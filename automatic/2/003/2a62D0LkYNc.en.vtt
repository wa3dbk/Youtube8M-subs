00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.340
 Years old good evening 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.259
 good evening 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.750
 They have syndicated percent good ones 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.040
 says after a while says percent is almost night 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.499
 or come to the man's suit 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.960
 On the Seegrube water Hopp wants to be the visitor of my grandmother on the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.220
 stage 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.849
 hot summer the shore my grandma and the markets not yet she is sitting in front of the 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.109
 TV and vouchers 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.169
 yes but end with funny ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.839
 I'm in the name and on behalf of the new Bavarian Minister of Finance and Seesen 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:33.789
 Chairman 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:35.150
 Erwin Gruber Chur 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.980
 I should say a few words in his name 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 Per cent why I should do that I did not quite understand 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.150
 Therefore, what did not understand, they paid a tick or at least 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.790
 a young cost 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.850
 and that's why Huber said that with the tax deductible for them 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.900
 Have pattern educational character 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.250
 that is, it must be spoken longer than this on the whole 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.060
 terrain 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.160
 Harald Kreibich see the program something the plans achieved No No do not worry 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.660
 Taxes that is now an international systems 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.040
 That's not jokes, it's comedy 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.640
 and percent I then be fed up with his comedy 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.640
 he does not get the tax revenue or comedy together 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.240
 they come quite good way as I said one I am here and should be 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.910
 To express benevolence towards all carnival activities and 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:26.990
 if they are honest 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.320
 Taxes have a lot to do with carnival 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.010
 If you think of the tax office because many think unfortunately I have no choice 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.050
 the Bundeswehr with 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.330
 It went so well, this really wonderful old suitable for a wine tasting 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.950
 if they are honest finances taxes that has to do with mine as with 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.100
 Sell ​​laugh 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 insofar as he is aware that we are at least state-owned and there 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.310
 you do not want people too much Aachen 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.899
 Doom does not mean percent to better master and Mining Group 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.320
 yes, yes, nothing 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.130
 What a bit disappointed me usually thought I was in Würzburg 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.250
 so that you do what you are told 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.250
 Bishop Hofmann also agrees on questions of faith 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.189
 also on the job if you are ten years old 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.329
 all German the ships would have been hectic 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.249
 he is the only one who has not only brought his sheep to the dry 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:25.730
 rather 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.849
 makes sure that the motorists are stopped even in the year 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.149
 sexuality 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.099
 but mostly a motorway junction bilingual German and English Bideau 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.099
 lies 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.939
 Now they are doing it again 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.159
 I also do not know if it's not so good for him that I'm my cousin 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.370
 Everywhere you look as the whole world is watching you laugh in it 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:01.429
 have gone to the cellar 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:03.109
 Caracas 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.919
 but to be honest some of them have little reason to really have time 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.249
 laugh the Markus Söder for example 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.249
 I mean the wine Hinternah Mark Streit 3 ​​2 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.169
 So less secretary mette-marit 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.979
 I mean the need to work because of mishaps have the act at the 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.950
 Cabinet reshuffle of criticism, ministerial positions make loans cheaper 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.049
 November 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.069
 and now it's also a Europe minister 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.219
 Emphasis on Europe so more so this year was also in the end is the 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:33.159
 attack 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.180
 I always want to do it very well that also noticed that you are pretty fast 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.439
 look pretty old in politics Ola this is no matter it does not matter in 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.340
 Whichever ministry you look at it no matter how you get in the fans' skies 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:46.809
 manages 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:50.969
 Klose has to come out Kleinlein Kommando is hot Minister with Max 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.969
 the 1 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.049
 Who else remembers you have to be a bit puffed up "when 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.389
 she honestly see you my politics is not consistently I actually much 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.549
 hot air and then you have to know Bächleins Hello 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:17.669
 that is also one needs condition and condition so inquired means that 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:18.389
 and 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.959
 The Minister of Finance has asked the front and back 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.009
 So in front 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.590
 Double mated keeps better or percent double airs be 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.349
 fewer 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.119
 It is clear to whom and who he wants to do it is clear who wins though that is yes 

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:45.759
 wonderful as a finance minister you have yes 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.090
 relatively little money but please enter your address for the star of 

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:52.430
 Law firm in the Mainz State Chancellery 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.229
 because they said the money somehow because you need it too 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.449
 there is one project is the projects 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.120
 there you are by far fast beyond good and bad what the financing 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.510
 As far as the money is concerned, the money is fast in the cellar 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.289
 it's also called Transrapid 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.039
 So who at Seidenberger Platz is in the limbo for a long time if that's even the case 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.349
 both the funding 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.839
 one asks the industry more more numbers for brands etc 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:20.099
 Obama declared that the common appeal was Swedish 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.080
 That's the proof of most things that really gets you under control 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.240
 just needs to be accurate in the speech 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.080
 they have never wondered 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.810
 why the ministerial cabinet nods 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.810
 No, it's about an otherwise only bottle or so he 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.259
 very special class let between between percent 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.509
 Quality wine and late is quality Quality is in the ministers Rösler 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.990
 Fini Quartet do that and yes ned but the collectors assassin masters 

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:01.490
 Quality cadres of security 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.949
 if late reading 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.849
 that confirmed that was more for Prime Minister Seidel 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.910
 Stoiber used to say the brand has been taken home since 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.909
 Taliban Spätlesen Platz 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.050
 That's why I have this suit here 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.259
 have to 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.639
 Mr. Huber did not admonish Linz in the year and yet 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.629
 he knows who he said to whom yes 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:33.550
 I dont have the 2 with the funds 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.729
 and Iran are going 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:39.240
 why should I put it on he said so that the Frankish taxpayers 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.340
 somehow Huber said what was that? 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.309
 it has a year 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.819
 Percent that are also taxpayers are roses I have something lost 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.909
 On the other hand, all new breeds are neuroses 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.949
 "Maybe it's not the most loose causes 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.270
 to rest at night 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.699
 in between, they move between innovations and Mark Knowles l 

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:16.879
 Westermann Euro is currently looking for those who are a little bit worn 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:20.439
 after that, either of them could turn roses to those legionaries 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.639
 that's why it's nice to sit here PR 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.710
 Mr. Huber r lets 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.850
 not to thank them for thanking us for being down while 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.490
 People from the Ministry to search their vehicles for valuables 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.909
 Older 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:38.779
 To be honest with me, it does not matter what you do but do it now 

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:39.819
 Thank you very much
