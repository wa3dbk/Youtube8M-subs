00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
reasons I got this one was because her

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.339 
reasons I got this one was because her
outfit<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:16.000> kind<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:16.420> layered<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.079> could

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
outfit is kind of layered so I could

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.009

change<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.190> up<00:02:18.340> by<00:02:18.519> taking<00:02:19.239> off<00:02:19.329> layer<00:02:19.660> putting

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
change it up by taking off layer putting

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.380 
change it up by taking off layer putting
something<00:02:20.440> on<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:21.250> that's<00:02:21.940> fun<00:02:22.150> because<00:02:22.299> she

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
something on so that's fun because she

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.119 
something on so that's fun because she
does<00:02:22.510> have<00:02:22.629> this<00:02:22.750> like<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> little<00:02:23.079> hoodie<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:24.099> I

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
can put that on her or I could take this

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.220 
can put that on her or I could take this
off<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.500> then<00:02:26.620> she<00:02:26.799> has<00:02:26.829> like<00:02:27.600> little<00:02:28.600> pajamas

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.250 
off and then she has like little pajamas
underneath<00:02:29.829> so<00:02:30.549> she<00:02:31.239> could<00:02:31.389> like<00:02:31.569> be<00:02:32.200> in
