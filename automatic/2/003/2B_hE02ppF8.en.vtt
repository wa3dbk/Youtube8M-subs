 d 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.880
 of portugal good the actions are 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:45.399
 they started to move to 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.500
 for france at once to the two 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.860
 minutes 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.600
 if almost at 3 karim benzema opens the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.600
 open the score in a good way 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.060
 for the center of the area with the scorer 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.250
 the ball came from him from the side 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.479
 left 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.160
 they hit him with ua rejects the goalkeeper and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.190
 and 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.620
 the rejection and patricio hits him with wise 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.580
 the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:27.849
 if it does not hit you remember the name before 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.099
 a griezmann play and the rebound what 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:35.220
 grab karim and place the 1 to 0 nothing 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.220
 he can be rude patrician and he places there 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:44.989
 the goal from 1 to 0 because they are going to go to 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:47.689
 at rest and already in the second half the 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.439
 of the rare hairs after a center back 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:53.299
 they reject it a little bit more backwards and 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.920
 almost goes from outside the area with the 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.010
 subtlety that characterizes it and with a 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.329
 haircut very very gray to place 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.909
 match 2 to 0 is a very good move that 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.519
 comes out of a side do a very good 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:12.109
 very good play on the left side 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.760
 the center receives it by white and touches it 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.819
 with foot has opened a tremendous goal 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.150
 Awesome awesome 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.990
 the pass was from karim benzema and little to 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.740
 place him 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.710
 2 to 0 that would not be final because 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.050
 there was going to be a criminal 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.230
 a strange average foul that gave the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.230
 referee 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.490
 I do not know if it was 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.170
 I hit Lent at 77 and with the 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.180
 result because there was no more time 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.290
 then if there was more time there 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.240
 could do more nothing 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.520
 equipment 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.360
 to remember me the keeper stopped 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.190
 holder of France and Portugal is the 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.870
 best archer in the world could not be 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.460
 but well I can not do anything in the 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.020
 penal 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.240
 Mandanda and broke it very well Lenten 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.700
 when the archer moves he did two to 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.620
 one won France justly to the 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.170
