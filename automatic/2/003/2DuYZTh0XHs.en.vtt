oh<00:01:58.310> okay<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:02.190> this<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.970> what<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.180> printed<00:02:03.570> out

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
oh okay so this is what I printed out

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.630 
oh okay so this is what I printed out
basically<00:02:05.910> there's<00:02:06.270> five<00:02:07.009> Globes<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.280> globe

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
basically there's five Globes and globe

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:19.000 
basically there's five Globes and globe
but<00:02:08.910> check<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.660> look<00:02:15.739> how<00:02:16.739> cool<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.040> is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
but check this out look how cool that is

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.110 
but check this out look how cool that is
so<00:02:20.010> there's<00:02:20.250> five<00:02:20.930> internal<00:02:23.120> rotating

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
so there's five internal rotating

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.940 
so there's five internal rotating
spheres<00:02:24.660> or<00:02:25.760> such<00:02:30.080> inside<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> bigger<00:02:31.709> sphere

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
spheres or such inside a bigger sphere

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.590 
spheres or such inside a bigger sphere
inside<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> bigger<00:02:33.030> one<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.330> bigger<00:02:33.480> one

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
inside a bigger one in the bigger one

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.770 
inside a bigger one in the bigger one
but<00:02:33.810> can't<00:02:34.530> get<00:02:34.620> these<00:02:34.799> out<00:02:35.040> now<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.090> did<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.720> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
but can't get these out now I did have a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.660 
but can't get these out now I did have a
problem<00:02:37.049> with<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.560> print<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.660> points

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
problem with this print and the points

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.920 
problem with this print and the points
that<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.880> see<00:02:42.060> here<00:02:42.239> what<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.450> did<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.810> I

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
that you see here what I did is I

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.479 
that you see here what I did is I
drilled<00:02:43.230> them<00:02:43.410> out<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.830> added<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.310> little

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
drilled them out and added a little

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.360 
drilled them out and added a little
bitty<00:02:44.790> cotter<00:02:45.510> pin<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.860> flattened<00:02:47.280> out

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
bitty cotter pin that I flattened out

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.650 
bitty cotter pin that I flattened out
that's<00:02:48.030> all<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.209> could<00:02:48.330> find<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:51.360> reason<00:02:51.600> I

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
that's all I could find and the reason I

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.030 
that's all I could find and the reason I
do<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:51.959> for<00:02:52.170> some<00:02:52.380> reason<00:02:52.769> they<00:02:52.860> don't

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
do that is for some reason they don't

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.390 
do that is for some reason they don't
quite<00:02:53.250> fit<00:02:53.489> in<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:55.560> regular<00:02:56.040> points

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
quite fit in there the regular points

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.430 
quite fit in there the regular points
that<00:02:56.549> were<00:02:56.640> printed<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.209> this<00:02:57.329> model<00:02:57.900> after<00:02:58.410> I

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
that were printed for this model after I

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.229 
that were printed for this model after I
printed<00:02:59.100> this<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.400> found<00:02:59.579> some<00:02:59.850> better<00:02:59.940> ones

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
printed this I found some better ones

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.990 
printed this I found some better ones
and<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.890> was<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.220> first<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:02.519> obviously

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
and this was the first one obviously

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.520 
and this was the first one obviously
that<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.299> tried<00:03:03.570> but<00:03:03.930> pretty<00:03:04.470> darn<00:03:04.769> cool<00:03:06.170> oops<00:03:07.170> I

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
that I tried but pretty darn cool oops I

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.199 
that I tried but pretty darn cool oops I
just<00:03:07.680> knocked<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.280> out<00:03:09.350> but<00:03:10.489> anyway<00:03:11.489> if<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.090> do

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
just knocked it out but anyway if you do

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.030 
just knocked it out but anyway if you do
print<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:15.780> version<00:03:16.110> didn't<00:03:16.680> work<00:03:16.829> out

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
print this this version didn't work out

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.819 
print this this version didn't work out
the<00:03:17.310> best<00:03:17.519> these<00:03:17.850> points<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:19.200> very<00:03:19.410> center

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
the best these points the very center

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.650 
the best these points the very center
the<00:03:20.340> very<00:03:20.549> center<00:03:20.880> one<00:03:21.030> here<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.329> actually

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
the very center one here is actually

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.720 
the very center one here is actually
sitting<00:03:21.840> on<00:03:22.019> it's<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.320> rake<00:03:22.500> original<00:03:23.130> points<00:03:23.549> I

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
sitting on it's a rake original points I

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.800 
sitting on it's a rake original points I
didn't<00:03:24.720> add<00:03:24.840> any<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.380> rest<00:03:25.590> on

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
didn't add any the rest on

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.940 
didn't add any the rest on
I<00:03:25.840> added<00:03:26.020> some<00:03:26.140> just<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.620> worked<00:03:26.800> out

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
I added some just so it worked out

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:38.990 
I added some just so it worked out
better<00:03:27.160> but<00:03:28.349> yeah<00:03:29.349> that's<00:03:30.220> pretty<00:03:30.430> cool<00:03:30.700> Oh

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.630 

slippery

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.040 

so<00:03:45.570> that's<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.470> gyroscopic<00:03:48.050> spherical

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
so that's the gyroscopic spherical

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.190 
so that's the gyroscopic spherical
thingamabob<00:03:49.920> er<00:03:50.000> pretty<00:03:51.000> darn<00:03:51.240> cool<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.960> you

thingamabob er pretty darn cool and you

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.570 
thingamabob er pretty darn cool and you
can't<00:03:52.440> get<00:03:52.530> these<00:03:52.680> out<00:03:52.890> they're<00:03:53.130> printed<00:03:53.460> in

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
can't get these out they're printed in

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.060 
can't get these out they're printed in
there<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:53.940> they're<00:03:54.240> there<00:03:54.270> to<00:03:54.540> stay<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.200> Russ
