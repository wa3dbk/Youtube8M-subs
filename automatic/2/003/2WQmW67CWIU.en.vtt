camera such as the NEX series I opted to
go<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.580> WX<00:00:30.060> 300<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.140> my<00:00:31.289> opinion<00:00:31.650> this

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
go with a WX 300 and in my opinion this

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
go with a WX 300 and in my opinion this
is<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> best<00:00:32.219> point<00:00:32.730> shoot<00:00:33.000> camera<00:00:33.420> that's

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
is the best point shoot camera that's

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.990 
is the best point shoot camera that's
affordable<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.770> general<00:00:35.160> public<00:00:35.370> for

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
2013 and a lot of you will argue that

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.990 
2013 and a lot of you will argue that
the<00:00:39.780> rx100<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.980> fact<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.340> better<00:00:41.520> camera<00:00:41.969> and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the rx100 is in fact a better camera and
