00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello I introduce myself yannick elsewhere 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.670
 today I would like to talk to you about 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.990
 drawing principles in perspective so 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.880
 to make furniture in a room 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.330
 like for example a wardrobe and he 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.970
 table 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.910
 I remind you that in the courts 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.359
 previous we saw the point of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.560
 leak that gives a point centrally located 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.859
 from your drawing sheet 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:35.489
 we also had the lines our 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.829
 elusive like for example the wall that is 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.640
 located at the bottom of your room 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.460
 and finally we've seen the lines 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.559
 fleeing from this point of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.899
 flight 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:57.050
 we saw that when we run 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:01.039
 the lines in a row to the two points 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:10.470
 upper wall of the bottom of your wall 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:13.400
 here we realize the ceiling I do not 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.400
 do not go back to my class 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.570
 see today how to achieve a 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.620
 furniture such as a wardrobe and 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:30.340
 well we can take it right away 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:33.880
 the cabinet seen in this sense so let's see 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.880
 on the right wall 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:48.260
 he appears to you as a big 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:52.210
 mud rectangle let's see now the 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.340
 perspective with leaking lines 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.180
 so we have a point here that gets 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.010
 located at the wall level twenty points here 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:08.000
 which is at the bottom edge of the cabinet 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:14.750
 upper edge what is waiting for you 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:21.190
 allow here to draw so the other 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:26.980
 side of this surface is here well 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:37.510
 there is more to join up there up 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:43.120
 I created that's how your wardrobe is 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:47.030
 realized I remove superfluous features 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.220
 like those here after confess to arrange 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.100
 to put cupboards doors 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.800
 etc. 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.620
 let's see the table now the table 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.209
 with the lines the searching year is at 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.209
 say what you will see from the front 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:10.430
 let's imagine that at table be like this 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.260
 so I make a rectangle with 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.519
 paws 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.079
 a dough and not see so what you 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.599
 see from the front this is what we have 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.930
 that's what I decided with the lines 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.849
 the leaping year using the lines 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.799
 fleeing I will be able to give some 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:34.629
 perspective at my table 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:38.519
 that is to say, to get an idea of 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.519
 depth of my table 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:56.190
 here we can add the legs 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:04:01.959
 so that's like this here 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:06.280
 would not find itself flat so that's the 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.109
 perspective drawing of a table or 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.780
 two months pra the principles he 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.430
 must be used to decide a table and 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.109
 a wardrobe 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.549
 I thank you for your attention 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.549
 see you again and see you soon
