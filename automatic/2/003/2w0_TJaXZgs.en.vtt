ride it what's he got to do where's he
got<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> ride<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.860> two<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.159> four<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.549> get

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
got a ride it two and four more just get

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.359 
got a ride it two and four more just get
on<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.150> ride<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.040> get

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
on it and ride it well we can just get

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.710 
on it and ride it well we can just get
on<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.579> right<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.509> need<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
on it right it but really we need a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.890 
on it right it but really we need a
super<00:01:31.140> smooth<00:01:31.380> surface<00:01:32.570> because<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:33.780> not

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
super smooth surface because it's not

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.080 
super smooth surface because it's not
the<00:01:33.990> most<00:01:34.170> comfortable<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:35.310> bikes<00:01:35.700> because

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the most comfortable of bikes because

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.810 
the most comfortable of bikes because
there's<00:01:36.360> no<00:01:36.509> suspension<00:01:37.170> anywhere<00:01:37.530> right<00:01:38.070> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
there's no suspension anywhere right so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.569 
there's no suspension anywhere right so
ideally<00:01:39.540> we're<00:01:39.900> looking<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.409> well<00:01:41.159> ideally

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
ideally we're looking for well ideally

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.490 
ideally we're looking for well ideally
we'd<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.180> go<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> 2012<00:01:42.930> velodrome<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
we'd like to go on the 2012 velodrome to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.139 
we'd like to go on the 2012 velodrome to
do<00:01:43.619> some<00:01:43.890> testing<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:44.520> touch<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.880> set<00:01:45.119> a

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
do some testing and then touch you set a

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.420 
do some testing and then touch you set a
land<00:01:45.360> speed<00:01:45.420> record<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.590> one<00:01:47.189> hundred

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
land speed record for a one hundred

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.130 
land speed record for a one hundred
percent<00:01:47.460> wooden<00:01:47.909> bike<00:01:48.119> that'd<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.720> quite<00:01:48.869> good

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
percent wooden bike that'd be quite good

if<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.350> would<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.680> would<00:01:49.890> win<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.220> yeah<00:01:50.850> yeah<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
if you would on would win it yeah yeah I

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.359 
if you would on would win it yeah yeah I
think<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.810> find<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.649> got<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> slight

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
think they find we have got a slight

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.539 
think they find we have got a slight
amount<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:54.229> glue<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.009> rims<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
amount of glue on the on the rims of the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.830 
amount of glue on the on the rims of the
wheels<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> give<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> bit<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> traction

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
wheels just to give a bit of traction

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.830 
wheels just to give a bit of traction
but<00:01:58.430> only<00:01:59.430> about<00:01:59.520> three<00:01:59.969> millimeters<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.570> glue

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
but only about three millimeters of glue

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.440 
but only about three millimeters of glue
on<00:02:00.869> there<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.350> how<00:02:01.530> close<00:02:01.979> our<00:02:02.430> how<00:02:03.030> close<00:02:03.270> you

just trying to work out looking at

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.720 
just trying to work out looking at
picture<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.620> now<00:02:31.710> how<00:02:32.070> do<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.220> get<00:02:32.490> round

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
picture of it now how do you get round

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.610 
picture of it now how do you get round
the<00:02:32.880> problem<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.450> chain<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.320> have<00:02:34.470> one

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the problem of a chain do you have one

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.350 
the problem of a chain do you have one
is<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.860> made<00:02:34.980> out<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.160> wood<00:02:35.310> was<00:02:35.520> doing<00:02:35.970> yeah<00:02:36.330> I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
is it made out of wood was doing yeah I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.220 
is it made out of wood was doing yeah I
know<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.870> decided<00:02:37.680> early<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.690> avoid

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
know I I decided early on to to avoid

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.400 
know I I decided early on to to avoid
using<00:02:40.530> wooden<00:02:40.920> train<00:02:41.310> because<00:02:42.410> practically

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
using wooden train because practically

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.500 
using wooden train because practically
wouldn't<00:02:44.400> really<00:02:44.490> hold<00:02:44.820> up<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.209> sort<00:02:45.420> of

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
wouldn't really hold up to the sort of

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.420 
wouldn't really hold up to the sort of
speed<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.020> they<00:02:46.260> both<00:02:46.530> geared<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:47.250> wear

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
speed that they both geared for wear

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.670 
speed that they both geared for wear
them<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.730> get<00:02:47.910> 31<00:02:48.600> mile<00:02:48.930> an<00:02:49.080> hour<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.530> this

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
them to get 31 mile an hour to this

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.310 
them to get 31 mile an hour to this
thing<00:02:49.890> Wow<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.760> I've<00:02:51.480> actually<00:02:51.690> effectively

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
thing Wow so I've actually effectively

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.300 
thing Wow so I've actually effectively
replaced<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.010> chain<00:02:53.250> with<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:54.830> 128<00:02:55.830> tooth

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
replaced the chain with a 128 tooth

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.900 
replaced the chain with a 128 tooth
wooden<00:02:57.209> gear<00:02:57.470> which<00:02:58.470> which<00:02:59.190> connects<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.790> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
wooden gear which which connects to the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.900 
wooden gear which which connects to the
front<00:03:00.840> pedal<00:03:01.200> gear<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.489> rear<00:03:02.670> hub

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
front pedal gear and to the rear hub

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.870 
front pedal gear and to the rear hub
gear<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:04.050> effectively<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.190> works<00:03:05.489> exactly

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
gear so effectively it works exactly
