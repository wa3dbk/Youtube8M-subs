00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 apple products make the most 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.460
 success with technology fans to 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.859
 apple company is one of the best in 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.670
 create objects of desire and one of them is 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.340
 this one 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.139
 the new macbook pro for retina display as 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.230
 every new version of apple's equipment 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.990
 the new macbook pro is thinner lighter 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.720
 and faster than its predecessor 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.340
 the design is pretty much the same after all 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.289
 in winning team do not move 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.109
 here we have the traditional finishing in 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.140
 reinforced aluminum with matte texture 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.600
 rounded corners and the famous apple 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.090
 bright on the cover the keyboard also 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.790
 even with the standard bubble gum buttons and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.649
 quebec light and otoute asks 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.320
 large and accurate the power of 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.500
 processing is amazingly equipped 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.399
 with the core i7 third generation 8 gb 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.920
 memory and a geforce gt graphic chip 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.140
 650 m of 1 giga it rotates any type 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.879
 and applications without problems 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.070
 it still has a ssd of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.289
 awesome 512 gb 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.390
 one of the ways to show the power 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.210
 it is to carry out an activity that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.670
 uses 100% of the processor and we choose 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.979
 use the after effects a software 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.570
 special video effects for terms 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.490
 a notion of evolution 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.460
 we did the same process in our 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.070
 macbook pro which is 2011 and features a 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.110
 second generation core i5 processor 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.130
 our old macbook already had a great 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.140
 performance 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.479
 but when compared to the new model 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.729
 It looks like a kid's toy. 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.490
 performance was already expected 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.820
 now the great differential of the model is the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.799
 screen retina who has an ipad 3 an iphone 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.439
 you already know the quality of the screen now 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.399
 imagine a screen of this 15-inch 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.210
 because it's resolution is 2,880 by 1,800 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.220
 points 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.649
 It's more than twice as big as a full HD TV 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 to see movies makes no difference because 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.320
 the video files have resolution 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.090
 full hd 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.740
 The big difference is to use the whole 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.710
 screen resolution to decrease 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.259
 characters - and still continue 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.509
 like comfortable navigation so we have 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.090
 even more useful work area 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.069
 on a 15-inch screen who uses 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.679
 video editing software knows the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.970
 how much is it useful on the day of common use 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.490
 the battery lasted six and a half hours 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.050
 then this product looks perfect will be 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.270
 that does not have any problem actually 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.100
 Yes you have a huge 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.710
 we do not usually quote the price of 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.870
 products here after all they can vary 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.910
 you can still search the link here 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.710
 in the video description but careful 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.780
 click on the link of the macbook not to 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.650
 scare because the price really a 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.660
 absurd 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.390
 is a computer better than 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.640
 be worth all this beyond the price you 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.380
 you can see more technical information and 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.000
 result of the tests here in the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.990
 description of the video and if you 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.940
 any doubt 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.940
 leave it here in the comments thanks
