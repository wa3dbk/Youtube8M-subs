still don't have two ingredients twist
like<00:02:41.450> this<00:02:42.999> pressure<00:02:43.999> plate<00:02:46.930> wheels<00:02:47.930> right

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
like this pressure plate wheels right

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:58.750 
like this pressure plate wheels right
here<00:02:48.670> bake<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:50.739> put<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:51.769> pressure<00:02:52.189> plate<00:02:57.760> put

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
here bake this put a pressure plate put

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.849 
here bake this put a pressure plate put
a<00:02:59.209> sign<00:03:00.549> put<00:03:01.549> in<00:03:01.790> out<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.329> her<00:03:02.480> behind<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.169> and
