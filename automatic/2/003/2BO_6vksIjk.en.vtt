one<00:01:31.500> chance<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:32.100> guess<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.520> boot<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.790> if

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
one chance to guess what this boot is if

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.210 
one chance to guess what this boot is if
you<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.450> more<00:01:33.960> than<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.170> entry<00:01:34.680> I'm<00:01:34.860> not

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
you have more than one entry I'm not

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.950 
you have more than one entry I'm not
going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> count<00:01:35.579> either<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.090> those<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.750> make

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
going to count either of those so make

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.870 
going to count either of those so make
sure<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.380> only<00:01:37.530> write<00:01:37.740> once<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.729> only

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
sure that you only write once you only

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310 
sure that you only write once you only
got<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.090> try<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> comments<00:01:40.290> section

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
