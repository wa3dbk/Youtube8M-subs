00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
a date for African construction and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.860 
a date for African construction and
totally<00:00:35.640> concrete<00:00:36.120> expert

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.840 

you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.260 

3d<00:00:48.450> regime<00:00:49.200> or<00:00:49.470> additive<00:00:49.980> manufacturing<00:00:50.270> it's

3d regime or additive manufacturing it's

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.750 
3d regime or additive manufacturing it's
got<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:51.570> possibility<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:53.190> will<00:00:53.550> not

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
got the possibility we will not

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
got the possibility we will not
revolutionize<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.900> way<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.110> we

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
revolutionize the way that we

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.040 
revolutionize the way that we
manufacture<00:00:55.920> things<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.879> also<00:00:57.450> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.780> what

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
manufacture things and also I think what

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.680 
manufacture things and also I think what
makes<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> exciting<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.850> allows<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
makes it exciting is that it allows the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.210 
makes it exciting is that it allows the
designer<00:01:01.430> to<00:01:02.960> manufacture<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.680> directly

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
designer to manufacture to be directly

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.780 
designer to manufacture to be directly
control<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.000> manufacturing<00:01:06.960> process<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.979> I

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
control the manufacturing process and I

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.340 
control the manufacturing process and I
think<00:01:08.850> what's<00:01:09.210> also<00:01:09.300> very<00:01:09.660> important<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
think what's also very important is the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.370 
think what's also very important is the
fact<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.740> through<00:01:10.950> 3d<00:01:11.190> printing<00:01:12.080> one<00:01:13.080> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
fact that through 3d printing one is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.910 
fact that through 3d printing one is
able<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.670> customize<00:01:15.440> for<00:01:16.440> which<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.310> scale

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
able to customize for which on a scale

the<00:01:25.200> idea<00:01:25.649> of<00:01:25.710> precast<00:01:26.220> will<00:01:26.670> become

we can see for example the way that if

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.839 
we can see for example the way that if
you<00:02:22.380> look<00:02:22.530> at<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.739> traditional<00:02:23.190> construction

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
you look at the traditional construction

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.390 
you look at the traditional construction
method<00:02:24.239> saying<00:02:24.569> concrete<00:02:25.230> where<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.250> would

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
method saying concrete where you would

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.280 
method saying concrete where you would
have<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> beam<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.480> slag

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
have a beam and a slag

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.890 
have a beam and a slag
which<00:02:28.830> usually<00:02:29.069> would<00:02:29.459> be<00:02:29.670> rectangular<00:02:30.360> or

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
which usually would be rectangular or

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.400 
which usually would be rectangular or
round<00:02:31.640> there's<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.760> lot<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.090> material<00:02:33.840> waste

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
round there's a lot of material waste

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.710 
round there's a lot of material waste
because<00:02:35.370> if<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.610> look<00:02:35.790> at<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.120> structural

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
because if you look at the structural

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.580 
because if you look at the structural
forces<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:38.700> terms<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.180> bending<00:02:39.599> forces<00:02:40.110> and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
have to be a rectangular element it

have to be a rectangular element it
could<00:02:48.450> maybe<00:02:48.780> will<00:02:49.140> be<00:02:49.650> more<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> bell

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
could maybe will be more like a bell

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.820 
could maybe will be more like a bell

shaped element but the reason why we

shaped element but the reason why we
keep<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:53.220> constructing<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.239> way<00:02:54.480> is

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
keep on constructing it that way is

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.789 
keep on constructing it that way is
because<00:02:55.769> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.340> costing<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:56.970> manufacturing

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
because of the costing and manufacturing

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.190 
because of the costing and manufacturing
processes<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.790> what<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.299> talk<00:03:00.540> about<00:03:00.750> here

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
processes so what we can talk about here

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.850 
processes so what we can talk about here
is<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.470> talk<00:03:01.830> about<00:03:02.040> future<00:03:02.810> new

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
is we can talk about future new

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.449 
is we can talk about future new
structural<00:03:05.840> prototypes<00:03:06.840> evolving<00:03:07.830> which

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
structural prototypes evolving which
