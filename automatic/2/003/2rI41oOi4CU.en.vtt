00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
savior on the C power-chord be a c5

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.619 
savior on the C power-chord be a c5
because<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:47.620> one<00:02:48.330> five-octave

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
because it's one five-octave

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.380 
because it's one five-octave
well<00:02:49.900> there's<00:02:50.140> actually<00:02:50.230> one<00:02:50.650> four<00:02:51.220> octave<00:02:51.700> so

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
well there's actually one four octave so

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.240 
well there's actually one four octave so
it's<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.989> different<00:02:53.409> type<00:02:53.530> of<00:02:53.560> power<00:02:53.830> chord<00:02:54.069> C

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
it's a different type of power chord C

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:02.780 
it's a different type of power chord C
instead<00:02:54.519> of<00:02:54.610> like<00:02:54.760> this

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:20.750 

all<00:03:03.790> right<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.120> once<00:03:04.570> again<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.960> goes

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.920 

their<00:03:21.760> variation<00:03:22.269> is<00:03:22.450> instead<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.780> the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
their variation is instead of the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.539 
their variation is instead of the

it<00:03:24.700> goes<00:03:24.879> up<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:29.110> then<00:03:29.280> I'll<00:03:30.280> run<00:03:30.459> through

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
it goes up and then I'll run through

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.089 
it goes up and then I'll run through
that<00:03:30.700> once<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:32.379> lyric<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:32.739> I'm<00:03:32.799> just<00:03:32.920> going<00:03:33.069> to
