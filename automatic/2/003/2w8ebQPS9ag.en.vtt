00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
which was another problem that Ferrari

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.529 
which was another problem that Ferrari
had<00:00:43.530> plus<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> problems<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.059> Ferrari<00:00:45.390> have

had plus the problems that Ferrari have

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.360 
had plus the problems that Ferrari have
had<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.410> amount<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.680> downforce<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
had with the amount of downforce the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.510 
had with the amount of downforce the
cars<00:00:47.579> produced<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.300> cooling<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.280> also<00:00:50.280> that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
cars produced it's cooling and also that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.610 
cars produced it's cooling and also that
the<00:00:50.610> front-end<00:00:51.059> grip<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.870> they've<00:00:52.410> done

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the front-end grip so that they've done

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.720 
the front-end grip so that they've done
lots<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.949> bits<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.250> pieces

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
lots of bits and pieces

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
lots of bits and pieces
I<00:00:53.879> think<00:00:54.239> Ferrari<00:00:54.600> probably<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.199> caught<00:00:55.500> up

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
I think Ferrari probably have caught up

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.099 
I think Ferrari probably have caught up
some<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> gap<00:00:56.370> they've<00:00:56.579> had<00:00:56.820> -<00:00:57.120> certainly

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
some of the gap they've had - certainly

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380 
some of the gap they've had - certainly
the<00:00:58.230> rest<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> sort<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> front<00:00:59.850> midfield

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the rest of the sort of front midfield

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.299 
the rest of the sort of front midfield
runners<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.379> don't<00:01:01.949> think<00:01:02.190> they've

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
runners I don't think they've

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.799 
runners I don't think they've
necessarily<00:01:02.879> done<00:01:03.030> enough<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> make<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> big

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
necessarily done enough to make a big

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.100 
necessarily done enough to make a big
step<00:01:04.080> towards<00:01:04.650> Mercedes<00:01:05.580> though<00:01:05.930> what<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.020> we

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
step towards Mercedes though what do we

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.250 
step towards Mercedes though what do we
understand<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:09.260> development

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
understand is there the development

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.840 
understand is there the development
program<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> engine<00:01:11.250> Renault<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.700> been

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
program for the engine Renault have been

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.429 
program for the engine Renault have been
relatively<00:01:12.210> open<00:01:12.630> about<00:01:12.840> how<00:01:13.110> they're<00:01:13.320> going

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.200 
there - about if you remember last year
the<00:01:49.350> Ferrari<00:01:49.649> turbo<00:01:50.009> would<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.490> at<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.030> back

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the Ferrari turbo would be at the back

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.660 
the Ferrari turbo would be at the back
of<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> engine<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.020> had<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.460> compressor<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
of the engine you had the compressor and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
of the engine you had the compressor and
then<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.939> had<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> engine<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.689> H<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.380> then

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
then you had the engine you H and then

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.410 
then you had the engine you H and then
the<00:01:55.799> turbine<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> exhaust<00:01:56.790> driven<00:01:57.090> part<00:01:57.270> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the turbine the exhaust driven part of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.719 
the turbine the exhaust driven part of
the<00:01:57.570> turbo<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> heat<00:01:59.280> from<00:01:59.549> this

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the turbo I think the heat from this

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
the turbo I think the heat from this
setup<00:02:00.000> actually<00:02:00.479> caused<00:02:00.600> problems<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
setup actually caused problems with the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.719 
setup actually caused problems with the
engine<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.530> hate<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.979> led<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.430> much

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
engine you hate you led to it's much

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.340 
engine you hate you led to it's much
weaker<00:02:03.149> performance<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> race<00:02:04.049> which

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
weaker performance in the race which

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.810 
weaker performance in the race which
therefore<00:02:04.920> meant<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.340> didn't<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.640> quite

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
therefore meant for I didn't have quite

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.819 
therefore meant for I didn't have quite
as<00:02:05.909> much<00:02:06.000> power<00:02:06.299> available<00:02:06.810> during<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> race

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
as much power available during the race

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.219 
as much power available during the race
from<00:02:08.039> recovered<00:02:08.670> energy<00:02:08.789> from<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> turbo<00:02:09.660> so

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
from recovered energy from the turbo so

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.390 
from recovered energy from the turbo so
what<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.500> appears<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:10.890> they've<00:02:11.039> done<00:02:11.069> is

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
what it appears as they've done is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.130 
what it appears as they've done is
they've<00:02:11.550> actually<00:02:11.670> moved<00:02:12.030> like<00:02:12.390> Renault<00:02:12.810> how

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

Don is put the M guh in front of the
turbo<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.080> then<00:02:16.200> brought<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.470> two<00:02:16.620> pieces

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
turbo and then brought the two pieces

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.400 
turbo and then brought the two pieces
the<00:02:17.100> turbo<00:02:17.430> closer<00:02:17.670> together<00:02:18.260> last<00:02:19.260> year

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
the turbo closer together last year

the turbo closer together last year
Ferrari<00:02:19.800> had<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.160> special<00:02:20.880> water

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
Ferrari had this special water

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.030 
Ferrari had this special water
intercooler<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.020> then<00:02:22.140> sat<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.709> V<00:02:22.890> of

intercooler that then sat in the V of
the<00:02:23.190> engine<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.510> looks<00:02:24.690> as<00:02:24.870> though

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the engine and it looks as though

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.330 
the engine and it looks as though
they've<00:02:25.230> actually<00:02:25.470> retained<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.160> year

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
they've actually retained that this year

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.100 
they've actually retained that this year
we've<00:02:26.490> seen<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> modified<00:02:27.270> version<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:28.020> the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
we've seen a modified version and on the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.670 
we've seen a modified version and on the

benches behind the sf50 t when he was
being<00:02:31.920> built<00:02:32.160> up<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.000> they<00:02:33.330> may<00:02:33.510> not<00:02:33.660> have

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
being built up so they may not have

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.460 
being built up so they may not have
actually<00:02:34.050> changed<00:02:34.280> lots<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:36.290> layouts<00:02:37.290> of

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
actually changed lots of the layouts of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.020 
actually changed lots of the layouts of
the<00:02:37.620> turbo<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.190> certainly<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.610> detailed

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
the turbo but certainly the detailed

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.340 
the turbo but certainly the detailed
parts<00:02:39.450> when<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.660> used<00:02:39.810> up<00:02:39.930> quite<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> lot<00:02:40.260> of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
parts when it used up quite a lot of

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.720 
parts when it used up quite a lot of
their<00:02:40.560> tokens<00:02:40.980> by<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.190> time<00:02:41.459> they<00:02:41.550> get<00:02:41.670> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
their tokens by the time they get to

their tokens by the time they get to
knellman<00:02:42.270> i<00:02:42.420> understand<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.260> he<00:02:43.350> they<00:02:43.739> are

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
knellman i understand that he they are

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.160 
knellman i understand that he they are
holding<00:02:44.220> some<00:02:44.480> tokens<00:02:45.480> back<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:45.900> they<00:02:46.020> can

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
holding some tokens back so they can

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.620 
holding some tokens back so they can
have<00:02:46.560> some<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.459> season<00:02:47.940> development<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.540> be

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
have some in season development and be

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.570 
have some in season development and be
able<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.900> react<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.170> what<00:02:49.650> they<00:02:50.160> see<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
able to react to what they see is the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.400 
able to react to what they see is the
problems<00:02:50.940> during<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.360> year<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.290> is

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
problems during the year so this is

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.930 
problems during the year so this is
looking<00:02:52.530> quite<00:02:52.800> good<00:02:53.070> from<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.370> Ferrari<00:02:53.519> power

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
looking quite good from a Ferrari power

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.090 
looking quite good from a Ferrari power
unit<00:02:54.269> perspective<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.989> also<00:02:55.530> understand<00:02:56.040> that

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
unit perspective I also understand that

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.350 
unit perspective I also understand that
the<00:02:56.190> Ferrari<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.700> actually<00:02:56.940> kicking<00:02:57.150> out<00:02:57.330> a

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
the Ferrari is actually kicking out a

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.270 
the Ferrari is actually kicking out a
lot<00:02:57.510> more<00:02:57.690> heat<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.170> year<00:02:58.440> which<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> sign

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
lot more heat this year which is a sign

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.680 
lot more heat this year which is a sign
that<00:02:59.400> they're<00:02:59.580> generating<00:03:00.030> much<00:03:00.180> more<00:03:00.420> power

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
that they're generating much more power

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.479 
that they're generating much more power

pushrod front suspension I think that

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.490 
pushrod front suspension I think that
was<00:04:31.600> something<00:04:31.900> just<00:04:32.020> simply<00:04:32.320> wasn't

was something just simply wasn't

was something just simply wasn't

quite big but that's merely because

that's<00:04:54.460> good<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.150> package<00:04:55.480> these<00:04:55.720> new

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
that's good to package these new

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.200 
that's good to package these new
radiators<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.490> they<00:04:57.610> were<00:04:57.669> talking<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.120> us

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
radiators that they were talking to us

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.909 
radiators that they were talking to us
about<00:04:58.570> where<00:04:58.960> these<00:04:59.140> radios<00:04:59.560> is<00:04:59.680> actually

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
about where these radios is actually

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.980 
about where these radios is actually
much<00:05:00.070> more<00:05:00.250> efficient<00:05:00.820> and<00:05:01.060> they're<00:05:01.570> laid<00:05:01.780> out

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
much more efficient and they're laid out

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.510 
much more efficient and they're laid out
and<00:05:02.140> a<00:05:02.169> much<00:05:02.320> more<00:05:02.350> efficient<00:05:02.919> manner<00:05:03.130> as<00:05:03.370> well

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
and a much more efficient manner as well

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.610 
and a much more efficient manner as well
but<00:05:04.210> still<00:05:04.330> overall<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.870> side<00:05:05.050> pods<00:05:05.260> do<00:05:05.440> look

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
but still overall the side pods do look

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.409 
but still overall the side pods do look
bulky<00:05:05.830> but<00:05:06.190> I<00:05:06.220> think<00:05:06.430> that<00:05:06.550> might<00:05:06.700> be<00:05:06.730> a<00:05:06.970> visual

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
bulky but I think that might be a visual

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.500 
bulky but I think that might be a visual
thing<00:05:07.630> because<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.169> curvature<00:05:08.380> so

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
thing because of the curvature so

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.790 
thing because of the curvature so
there's<00:05:10.510> loads<00:05:10.990> of<00:05:11.110> other<00:05:11.230> little<00:05:11.560> arrow

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
there's loads of other little arrow

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.620 
there's loads of other little arrow

details already on the launch car which

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.540 
details already on the launch car which
is<00:05:13.720> quite<00:05:14.230> unusual<00:05:14.410> for<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:14.890> large<00:05:15.040> car<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.370> show

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.550 
is quite unusual for a large car to show

Ferrari are kind of catching up on the
Aero<00:05:32.740> concepts<00:05:33.460> that<00:05:33.640> they<00:05:33.729> have<00:05:33.850> been

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
Aero concepts that they have been

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.090 
Aero concepts that they have been
lacking<00:05:34.360> in<00:05:34.510> of<00:05:34.960> course<00:05:35.020> in<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.440> past<00:05:35.650> Ferrari

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
have come up with some very

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.510 
have come up with some very
great-looking<00:05:38.200> Aero<00:05:38.770> parts<00:05:39.130> that<00:05:39.370> just

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
great-looking Aero parts that just

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.500 
great-looking Aero parts that just
simply<00:05:39.760> hadn't<00:05:40.000> worked<00:05:40.150> when<00:05:40.390> they've

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
simply hadn't worked when they've

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.900 
simply hadn't worked when they've
reached<00:05:40.540> the<00:05:40.900> track<00:05:41.200> so<00:05:41.919> hopefully<00:05:42.310> this<00:05:42.669> year

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
reached the track so hopefully this year

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.610 
reached the track so hopefully this year
all<00:05:43.150> of<00:05:43.419> this<00:05:43.540> work<00:05:43.870> that<00:05:44.050> they've<00:05:44.200> been<00:05:44.440> doing

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
all of this work that they've been doing

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.990 
all of this work that they've been doing
in<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:44.860> past<00:05:45.040> year<00:05:45.250> and<00:05:45.340> a<00:05:45.400> half<00:05:45.430> under<00:05:45.820> James

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
in the past year and a half under James

in the past year and a half under James
Allison<00:05:46.510> to<00:05:46.630> get<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:46.840> Windtunnel<00:05:47.470> producing

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
Allison to get the Windtunnel producing

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.770 
Allison to get the Windtunnel producing
the<00:05:48.430> same<00:05:48.640> result<00:05:49.030> as<00:05:49.150> when<00:05:49.330> they<00:05:49.419> get<00:05:49.570> on<00:05:49.690> the

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
the same result as when they get on the

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.860 
the same result as when they get on the
track<00:05:50.020> is<00:05:50.290> gonna<00:05:50.470> pay<00:05:50.740> off<00:05:50.770> and<00:05:51.660> some<00:05:52.660> of<00:05:52.780> that

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
track is gonna pay off and some of that

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.120 
track is gonna pay off and some of that
is<00:05:52.990> going<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.229> sort<00:05:53.530> of<00:05:53.590> start<00:05:53.860> to<00:05:53.890> come

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
is going to sort of start to come

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.680 
is going to sort of start to come
through<00:05:54.310> this<00:05:54.520> year<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:54.940> don't<00:05:55.390> know<00:05:55.600> if

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
through this year I don't know if

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.240 
through this year I don't know if
they'll<00:05:55.810> be<00:05:55.960> competitive<00:05:56.710> at<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.860> start<00:05:57.100> of

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
they'll be competitive at the start of

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.500 
they'll be competitive at the start of
year<00:05:57.400> but<00:05:57.550> I<00:05:57.640> think<00:05:57.669> as<00:05:58.000> this<00:05:58.120> program

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
year but I think as this program

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.710 
year but I think as this program
continues<00:05:59.500> then<00:06:00.310> we<00:06:00.520> should<00:06:00.760> see<00:06:00.970> you<00:06:01.660> know

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
continues then we should see you know

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.090 
continues then we should see you know
more<00:06:01.900> performance<00:06:02.290> from<00:06:02.410> far<00:06:02.620> as<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:02.919> Year

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
more performance from far as the Year

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.060 
more performance from far as the Year
moves<00:06:03.280> on<00:06:03.640> what<00:06:04.600> do<00:06:04.660> you<00:06:04.750> make<00:06:04.870> of<00:06:04.930> the<00:06:05.260> nose

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
moves on what do you make of the nose

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.820 
moves on what do you make of the nose
and<00:06:06.310> front<00:06:06.550> wing<00:06:06.729> I<00:06:07.350> want<00:06:08.350> to<00:06:08.410> say<00:06:08.560> that<00:06:08.740> the

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
and front wing I want to say that the

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.409 
and front wing I want to say that the
front<00:06:09.070> wing<00:06:09.280> is<00:06:09.460> really<00:06:09.760> interesting<00:06:10.270> I<00:06:10.330> mean

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
front wing is really interesting I mean

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.210 
front wing is really interesting I mean
it's<00:06:10.570> got<00:06:10.690> eight<00:06:10.870> elements<00:06:11.560> on<00:06:11.830> its<00:06:11.979> outer

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
it's got eight elements on its outer

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.920 
it's got eight elements on its outer
tips<00:06:12.669> which<00:06:12.880> is<00:06:13.030> probably<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.300> most<00:06:13.419> extreme

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
tips which is probably the most extreme

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.960 
tips which is probably the most extreme
front<00:06:14.290> wing<00:06:14.470> we've<00:06:14.890> seen<00:06:15.160> from<00:06:15.370> any<00:06:15.640> car<00:06:15.940> I

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
front wing we've seen from any car I

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.760 
front wing we've seen from any car I
think<00:06:16.270> seven<00:06:16.600> was<00:06:16.750> about<00:06:16.930> the<00:06:17.020> peak<00:06:17.200> last<00:06:17.470> year

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
think seven was about the peak last year

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.230 
think seven was about the peak last year
so<00:06:17.950> having<00:06:18.100> eight<00:06:18.340> elements<00:06:18.760> on<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:18.970> launch

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
so having eight elements on the launch

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.330 
so having eight elements on the launch
version<00:06:19.780> makes<00:06:20.440> you<00:06:20.620> wonder<00:06:20.830> when<00:06:21.100> we<00:06:21.190> get

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
version makes you wonder when we get

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.890 
version makes you wonder when we get
round<00:06:21.490> to<00:06:21.640> abbot<00:06:21.970> abbey<00:06:22.240> at<00:06:22.390> the<00:06:22.510> end<00:06:22.630> of<00:06:22.780> this

round to abbot abbey at the end of this

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.050 
round to abbot abbey at the end of this
year<00:06:23.200> how<00:06:23.860> many<00:06:24.100> pieces<00:06:24.340> these<00:06:24.700> wings<00:06:24.970> are

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
year how many pieces these wings are

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.700 
year how many pieces these wings are
going<00:06:25.180> to<00:06:25.270> be<00:06:25.360> made<00:06:25.570> up<00:06:25.780> of<00:06:25.930> you<00:06:26.530> know<00:06:26.590> the

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
going to be made up of you know the

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.500 
going to be made up of you know the
complexity<00:06:27.370> is<00:06:27.550> absolutely<00:06:28.030> baffling

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
complexity is absolutely baffling

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.909 
complexity is absolutely baffling
um<00:06:29.200> this<00:06:29.620> long<00:06:29.919> nose<00:06:30.160> I'm<00:06:30.940> and<00:06:31.720> I<00:06:32.020> think<00:06:32.290> yeah<00:06:32.620> I

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
um this long nose I'm and I think yeah I

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.620 
um this long nose I'm and I think yeah I
think<00:06:33.550> there<00:06:33.820> are<00:06:33.849> better<00:06:33.940> ways<00:06:34.300> of<00:06:34.479> doing

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
think there are better ways of doing

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.969 
think there are better ways of doing
things<00:06:34.960> what's<00:06:35.260> what's<00:06:35.590> interesting<00:06:35.800> about

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
things what's what's interesting about

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.460 
things what's what's interesting about
Ferrari<00:06:36.550> but<00:06:37.240> despite<00:06:37.570> the<00:06:37.690> long<00:06:37.870> nose<00:06:38.080> is

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
Ferrari but despite the long nose is

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.530 
Ferrari but despite the long nose is
not<00:06:38.590> doing<00:06:38.860> very<00:06:39.040> much<00:06:39.310> with<00:06:39.580> the<00:06:39.790> pillars

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
not doing very much with the pillars

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.390 
not doing very much with the pillars
that<00:06:40.570> mount<00:06:40.960> the<00:06:41.080> front<00:06:41.320> wing<00:06:41.530> increasingly

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
that mount the front wing increasingly

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.670 
that mount the front wing increasingly
teams<00:06:42.820> oh<00:06:43.000> using<00:06:43.780> these<00:06:43.930> is<00:06:44.170> one<00:06:44.320> of<00:06:44.410> the<00:06:44.470> key

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
teams oh using these is one of the key

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.320 
teams oh using these is one of the key
parts<00:06:45.160> of<00:06:45.280> the<00:06:45.370> front<00:06:45.580> aerodynamics<00:06:46.150> of<00:06:46.270> the

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
parts of the front aerodynamics of the

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.870 
parts of the front aerodynamics of the
car<00:06:46.570> to<00:06:46.840> create<00:06:47.410> vortices<00:06:47.560> and<00:06:48.160> the<00:06:48.220> long<00:06:48.610> nose

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
car to create vortices and the long nose

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.000 
car to create vortices and the long nose
helps<00:06:49.330> direct<00:06:49.600> these<00:06:49.960> back<00:06:50.260> along<00:06:50.590> the<00:06:50.770> car

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
helps direct these back along the car

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.340 
helps direct these back along the car
but<00:06:51.790> Ferrari<00:06:52.060> have<00:06:52.240> a<00:06:52.270> long<00:06:52.480> nose<00:06:52.690> but<00:06:53.050> not<00:06:53.320> a

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
but Ferrari have a long nose but not a

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.010 
but Ferrari have a long nose but not a
complex<00:06:53.890> front<00:06:54.280> wing<00:06:54.430> pylon<00:06:55.000> so<00:06:55.510> I<00:06:55.780> don't<00:06:55.960> know

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
complex front wing pylon so I don't know

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.120 
complex front wing pylon so I don't know
if<00:06:56.080> they're<00:06:56.230> missing<00:06:56.350> a<00:06:56.590> trick<00:06:56.860> or<00:06:57.010> is

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
if they're missing a trick or is

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.250 
if they're missing a trick or is
something<00:06:57.370> we've<00:06:57.490> not<00:06:57.670> seen<00:06:57.940> yet<00:06:58.240> but<00:06:58.930> I<00:06:58.960> think

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
something we've not seen yet but I think

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.390 
something we've not seen yet but I think
you<00:06:59.350> know<00:06:59.410> there<00:06:59.650> is<00:06:59.800> there<00:07:00.040> is<00:07:00.160> development

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
you know there is there is development

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.270 
you know there is there is development
potential<00:07:01.090> in<00:07:01.210> this<00:07:01.330> car<00:07:01.600> still<00:07:02.100> well<00:07:03.100> funnily

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
potential in this car still well funnily

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.410 
potential in this car still well funnily
enough<00:07:03.400> they<00:07:03.700> didn't<00:07:03.940> talk<00:07:04.090> about<00:07:04.210> those

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.420 
enough they didn't talk about those

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.380 
enough they didn't talk about those
pylons<00:07:04.870> in<00:07:05.020> their<00:07:05.230> online<00:07:05.880> launch<00:07:06.880> of<00:07:07.090> the<00:07:07.180> car

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.390 
pylons in their online launch of the car

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.650 
pylons in their online launch of the car
scales<00:07:07.750> but<00:07:07.990> thanks<00:07:08.260> very<00:07:08.500> much<00:07:09.660> surprising

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
scales but thanks very much surprising

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.990 
scales but thanks very much surprising
for<00:07:10.840> front<00:07:11.050> wing<00:07:11.170> pylons<00:07:11.410> yeah<00:07:12.070> well<00:07:12.760> thanks

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
for front wing pylons yeah well thanks

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.250 
for front wing pylons yeah well thanks
for<00:07:13.090> bringing<00:07:13.270> that<00:07:13.300> to<00:07:13.390> our<00:07:13.570> attention<00:07:13.660> and

we'll see a lot more of course when the

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.740 
we'll see a lot more of course when the
car<00:07:18.070> first<00:07:18.520> turns<00:07:18.760> a<00:07:18.850> wheel<00:07:18.970> at<00:07:19.120> herethe<00:07:19.390> next

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750 
car first turns a wheel at herethe next

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.960
