00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.470
 only tanks appeared immediately 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.960
 saw in them cyberspace potential 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.490
 because when long ago still Victor 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.350
 said that counter-strike on that chick 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.149
 as counter-strike is also sports 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.490
 discipline we naturally keep up 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.290
 develop and and every year wargaming 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 invests 300 million dollars in 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.979
 league development basically it's natural 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.840
 with spending on organization for logistics 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.979
 and the annual prize fund is 2 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.140
 controversial million dollars that is 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.060
 top teams guys who have 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.330
 your sponsors will be equipped in the west 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.520
 earn good money 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.740
 the course of the battle itself rapidly destroyed 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.170
 our initial expectations are 4 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.620
 The teams presented were clearly divided into 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.840
 beginners and favorites experienced hellraisers 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.930
 inari and debutants in the face of ryan lines and 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.510
 sc6 namely the latter have become real 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.880
 the opening of the tournament on the first day of santa 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.650
 claus and 6 deer exactly 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.959
 the name of the team is deciphered 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.750
 bypassed their big-name competitors and 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.239
 outright secured the finals not in 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.150
 last but not least thanks to the new arch 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.950
 rules at which teams alternate 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.500
 play matches in defense and in defense 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.780
 here you and space for new tactics and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.630
 constant intrigue and opportunity 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.520
 prove yourself by this and took advantage 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.280
 debutant 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.080
 we work very seriously with ours 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.910
 cyber sportsmen and talk on 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.310
 the fact that they like what doesn't like us 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.570
 do not dwell on the current situation 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.210
 what's happening with the project we 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.800
 constantly add new mods released mod 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.840
 which is exactly the same eSports 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.330
 our own cards are special and we 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.430
 changed the format on the attack defense that 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.990
 two were more dynamic more interesting 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.780
 that is, to avoid the so-called 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.780
 vigorous tank standing was rubilovo 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.160
 the second day came out more even team 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.830
 na'vi and pulled herself together and made her way into 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.900
 final alternately beating and dayan led ns 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.080
 and their main rivals in the face 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.510
 hellraisers and in a decisive game but also in 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.850
 came down with yesterday's offenders on this 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.850
 just not leaving deer wet place 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.730
 confirming the championship title with the final 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.780
 In a score of 7, 2 teams took home text on 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.820
 fifty thousand dollars 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.490
 a series of games in Minsk turned out exciting 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.680
 and unpredictable and this is not the final 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.780
 point in the current cyber season 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.300
 by world of tanks at the end of April 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.900
 assigned a new tournament this time in 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.120
 Warsaw 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.440
 where the list of participants will fill up 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.180
 the strongest teams from around the world 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.460
 Russia and the CIS will not represent 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.330
 only current winners in person 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.630
 but also hellraisers along with sc6 rates 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.910
 higher titles are more prestigious than battles themselves 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.300
 now do not even bother to say what 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.320
 will be 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.700
 and we will not see the wargaming company 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.200
 does not seem to be going either 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.420
 stop there 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.850
 developers as always plans and 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.580
 further develop your series of war games 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.080
 ahead of us are waiting for new championships among 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.260
 which may be pretty 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.150
 unexpectedly for example on the console version 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.340
 world of tanks 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.070
 desktop world of tanks your or 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.910
 what the hell is not joking even the world of warships 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.890
 which is still coming to beta test 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.960
 with the ships, I think that they are waiting for a great 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.820
 cybersport future because it 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.890
 something like chess that is there 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.440
 just exactly the same if the tanks can 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.990
 drag on saying one tankman about 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.800
 the ships are just the same Elena a bunch 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.350
 teamwork 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.720
 in general will solve a lot but we 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.220
 we'll see because the game will be out soon 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.500
 now she is in the closed stage 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.420
 beta testing and in every case we 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.970
 add people everyone can try 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.190
 feedback a very good game bed cool 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.280
 we will see how it will develop I 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.780
 I guess, that 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.730
 Of course we are interested in developing 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.740
 eSports not only for now even 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:31.100
 mobile evil if possible with console 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.010
 to the final of the third season wargaming.net 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.290
 whether once again clearly demonstrated 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.180
 that eSports today is serious and 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.310
 mass entertainment on the hype 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.919
 comparable to football matches 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.760
 these are genuine emotions uncompromising 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.310
 struggle and the joy of victory gambling desire 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.889
 success and wargaming companies and all 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.770
 professional players and what will 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.430
 next you will be the first to know
