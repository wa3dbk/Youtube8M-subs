00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.899
 welcome are you entering the 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.899
 unknown dimension 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.080
 warning the following video only 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.039
 my opinion is exposed, everyone is free to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.039
 tie conclusions 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.650
 prophecies of the end of the world a new 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.720
 deluge would end the human race today 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.939
 in day there are more predictions of the end 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.800
 of the world than anything else on the internet 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.260
 almost every half hour new 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.510
 predictions and those things but if I do not 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.489
 believe I invite you to see the new let's see 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.760
 if it really is a profession 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.040
 they are mere speculations because they say 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.470
 experts that in the year 2050 a deluge 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.269
 would whip the earth so we still have 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.370
 some time in case the doubts 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.470
 enjoy each day as if it were the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.699
 last but good now yes we go with the 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.280
 Russian scientific information and always 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.540
 those Russians doing their thing 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.549
 recently confirmed that a flood 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.710
 of large proportions could leave 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.949
 submerged coastal and lowlands 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.500
 Underwater Europe Latin America 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.360
 australia the east coast of states 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.490
 united and canada are some of the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.430
 territories mentioned by the best agency 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.979
 and in part the problem starts from 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.990
 climate change and its effects 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.479
 particular 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.820
 the calculations suggest that the temperature 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.829
 will stabilize quickly but the level of 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.759
 world ocean will continue to grow during 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.479
 several centuries explained Alexander Danilov 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.610
 deputy director of the institute of 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.700
 scientific research of the Arctic and the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.960
 Antarctic scientists explain that 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.240
 the ocean level would rise 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.119
 progressively in 5 meters until the year 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.950
 2050 so the people who live 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.280
 in low territories will be found in 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.140
 flood zones these 5 meters of 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.549
 rise of the ocean should be a signal 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.709
 very serious that in reality the 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.420
 giant low territories where the 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.390
 most of the population of the planet 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.520
 will be in flood zones 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.530
 said Natalia Riazanova who heads the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.450
 Institute's geology laboratory 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.780
 state of international relations 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.399
 moscow mg added to this big 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.350
 cities or countries complete with 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.470
 proximity to the coasts would be low 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.200
 the water as a result of the floods and 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.120
 you believe that this event of great impact 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.900
 for civilization can reach 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.549
 occur in 35 years of insurance many of 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.810
 you were already thinking about the 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.500
 antichrist and things like that 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.600
 but not 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.310
 they already saw that this phenomenon really 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.840
 it can become feasible and only the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.900
 paranoia of you is what I 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.910
 turns into prophecy until here ends 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.680
 our trip for the moment if it has 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.480
 liked this video I invite you to

 subscribe to always be in contact 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.310
