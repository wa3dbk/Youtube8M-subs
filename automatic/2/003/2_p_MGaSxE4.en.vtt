00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 very good people how are we here 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.210
 with a new video talking about 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.370
 curiosities of history this in 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.950
 we will dedicate it to talk about 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.170
 the origin of the game of the goose as already the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.389
 Most of you will know and almost explain it 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.430
 This game is made up of a board in 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.529
 spiral shape and whose ultimate goal 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.570
 It is to reach the center of it to 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.820
 know the origin of this game you have to 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.609
 go back to the early stages of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.859
 ancient egypt since those dates in 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.990
 the funeral chapels are observed 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.780
 scenes that represent one or several 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 people playing a board game 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.250
 known as the month in this name what 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.469
 take of a mythological snake that at 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.329
 contrary to his enemy pov and protects 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.000
 the solar boat against the forces of 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.290
 wrong on your journey through the wat the underworld 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.450
 Egyptian 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.400
 It should be noted that in the museums of 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.650
 Louvre and Leiden are two 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.270
 boards of this game so archaic its 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.520
 board consisted of a snake 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.770
 curled up that corresponds with the already 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.570
 mentioned mg this snake is 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.370
 arranged in a way that looks at 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.070
 the players while sticking out their tongue 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.500
 gesture that had some magical symbology 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.590
 in ancient egypt on one side of the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.360
 hidden board we found a goose the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.630
 of ham that released the sun from 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.910
 darkness once all the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.040
 obstacles of his trip to the beyond the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.070
 oca solar could give birth to her chick 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.290
 the rejuvenated star the goose in the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.080
 ancient egypt incubated the egg of the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.869
 creation therefore symbolized in certain 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.700
 mode the rebirth of the spirit the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.229
 goal of this game was to dodge 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.600
 all the traps that awaited the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.060
 player in the underworld or what is it 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.759
 same on the game board on a trip 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.410
 for reincarnation maybe the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.420
 considerable size of this board 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.490
 did that from the new empire 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.320
 we find variants and 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.140
 simplifications such as 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.990
 very well known 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.360
 the play table in this is where 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.170
 It becomes much smaller reduced to 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.850
 a rectangular box with 30 boxes 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.310
 several of these boxes contain the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.170
 water symbol which would amount to the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.140
 Well box of the 'game of the goose' 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.900
 of our days the name of that net in 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.970
 Spanish would mean passage and the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.470
 texts that allude to him show his 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.470
 link with the world of the dead 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.959
 an example of this simplified variant 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.150
 from the primitive game of the oca we can 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.790
 find in the funeral trousseau of the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.010
 Pharaoh Tutankhamun but above all in the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.530
 frescoes from the tomb of nefertari the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.600
 favorite royal wife of the pharaoh ramses 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.760
 second on one of the walls of his 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.650
 tomb this queen appears sitting 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.360
 while playing the pse net in a 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.000
 principle seems to play against 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.860
 invisible adversaries the dead in a 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.320
 attempt to progress on his journey towards 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.150
 the hereafter if he wins the goal 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.370
 main thing in the life of an Egyptian is 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.650
 will have fulfilled as for the chips 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.780
 with which it was played have been found 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.489
 from house-shaped pawns to 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.600
 lions and cheetahs in position 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.910
 thorns 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.430
 for the richest these pawns are 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.320
 manufactured in a circular way so 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.050
 enter in them the names of their 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.300
 owners to determine if these 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.400
 pawns advanced or retreated in the 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.370
 board were thrown into the air some 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.650
 bifacial rods with the passage of 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.810
 centuries and the comings and goings of civilizations 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.700
 the game was suffering innumerable 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.750
 changes since each town has 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.120
 adapted according to your tastes or your habits 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.100
 it is also said that the album of pompoms 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.410
 it could be the primitive Greek version 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.480
 of the game of the goose but the truth is 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.400
 that this issue is a mystery to the 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.010
 archeology and it has not yet been 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.660
 deciphered another example of these changes 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.700
 throughout history is that the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.220
 Templars did not advance by being inspired by 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.620
 the camino de santiago as the final point 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.570
 It could be said that this famous pastime 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.300
 it was not commercialized in a massive way 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.860
 well into the 18th century as 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.510
 I always hope you liked the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.230
 video a greeting and see you in the 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.230
 next chao
