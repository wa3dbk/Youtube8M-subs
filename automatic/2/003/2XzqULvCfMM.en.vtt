the review and this is the GB - just to
alleviate<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:33.020> mispronunciations<00:00:34.370> but<00:00:35.370> just

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
alleviate the mispronunciations but just

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.190 
alleviate the mispronunciations but just
to<00:00:35.880> go<00:00:36.210> over<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.510> really<00:00:36.719> quick<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.079> reason

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
to go over this really quick the reason

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200 
to go over this really quick the reason
I<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> GB<00:00:38.070> -<00:00:38.250> initially<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.850> was<00:00:39.059> my

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
I like the GB - initially this was my

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.680 
I like the GB - initially this was my
first<00:00:40.050> upgraded<00:00:40.829> ballhead<00:00:41.420> after<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> really

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
first upgraded ballhead after a really

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.850 
first upgraded ballhead after a really
write<00:00:42.930> stuff<00:00:43.489> ball<00:00:44.489> had<00:00:44.700> 40<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:46.469> reason<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
write stuff ball had 40 the reason I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.380 
write stuff ball had 40 the reason I
upgraded<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> way

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
upgraded just to get this out of the way

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.810 
upgraded just to get this out of the way
is<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.989> ball<00:00:49.260> heads<00:00:49.559> most<00:00:50.100> ball<00:00:50.370> heads<00:00:50.610> have

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
is the ball heads most ball heads have

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.470 
is the ball heads most ball heads have
it<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.059> caps<00:00:51.300> an<00:00:51.600> enclosed<00:00:52.140> ball<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> base

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
it in caps an enclosed ball at the base

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.939 
it in caps an enclosed ball at the base
and<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.570> shoot<00:00:54.809> around<00:00:55.050> salt<00:00:55.289> water<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.590> sand<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and I shoot around salt water and sand a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
and I shoot around salt water and sand a
lot<00:00:56.070> any<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.610> gets<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.360> gravity

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
lot any of that gets in there it gravity

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.420 
lot any of that gets in there it gravity
pulls<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.649> instead<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.039> letting<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.309> out

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
pulls it in instead of letting it out

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.910 
pulls it in instead of letting it out
and<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.850> harder<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.270> rinse<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.680> wanted

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and it's harder to rinse out so I wanted

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.709 
and it's harder to rinse out so I wanted
something<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.250> little<00:01:02.280> easier<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> clean<00:01:03.149> maybe

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
something a little easier to clean maybe

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
something a little easier to clean maybe
a<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:03.930> more<00:01:04.110> lightweight<00:01:04.610> would<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.729> nice

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
a little more lightweight would be nice

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.219 
a little more lightweight would be nice
and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.960> saw<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:08.130> GB<00:01:08.939> -<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.479> being<00:01:09.720> advertised

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and I saw the GB - was being advertised

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.320 
and I saw the GB - was being advertised
and<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.770> saw<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> open<00:01:11.310> ball<00:01:11.520> design<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.150> just

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and I saw the open ball design and just

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.350 
and I saw the open ball design and just
loved<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.680> actually<00:01:14.520> had<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> ultimate

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
loved it I actually had the ultimate

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
loved it I actually had the ultimate
before<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.140> has<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> diagonal<00:01:16.710> clamp

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
before this which has a diagonal clamp

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.760 
before this which has a diagonal clamp
it's<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> pain<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> butt<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.330> use<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:19.590> then

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it's a pain in the butt to use but then

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.310 
it's a pain in the butt to use but then
I<00:01:20.009> quickly<00:01:20.850> switched<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.720> which<00:01:22.110> has<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
I quickly switched to this which has a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.109 
I quickly switched to this which has a
like<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> ball<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:23.939> traditional

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
like the ball it's a more traditional

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.410 
like the ball it's a more traditional
design<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.930> open<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> use<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.090> for

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
design it just open so I use this for

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.850 
design it just open so I use this for
two<00:01:28.320> years

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
two years

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.920 
two years
really<00:01:29.220> liked<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.640> my<00:01:29.939> biggest<00:01:30.240> complaint<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
really liked it my biggest complaint and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.440 
really liked it my biggest complaint and
this<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.680> all<00:01:31.880> traditional<00:01:32.880> style<00:01:33.150> ball

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
this is for all traditional style ball

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.060 
this is for all traditional style ball
heads<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.840> general<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> knobs

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
heads in general because with the knobs

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.069 
heads in general because with the knobs
all<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.820> side<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.390> your<00:01:36.450> tripod<00:01:36.689> has

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
all on one side and your tripod has

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.600 
all on one side and your tripod has
basically<00:01:37.470> three<00:01:37.799> sides<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> triangle

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
basically three sides to the triangle

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.999 
basically three sides to the triangle
that<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.060> builds<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:40.170> set<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:40.560> legs<00:01:40.770> up

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
that it builds you set your legs up

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.440 
that it builds you set your legs up
early<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.610> morning<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.150> might<00:01:42.329> not

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
early in the morning and you might not

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.170 
early in the morning and you might not
realize<00:01:43.020> which<00:01:43.320> way<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:44.369> knobs<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.820> pointed

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
realize which way your knobs are pointed

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.389 
realize which way your knobs are pointed
so<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> sudden<00:01:46.740> you'll<00:01:46.860> need<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.130> loosen

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
so all of a sudden you'll need to loosen

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
so all of a sudden you'll need to loosen
the<00:01:47.670> panning<00:01:48.090> clamp<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.960> around<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.470> where

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the panning clamp and it around to where

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.109 
the panning clamp and it around to where
it's<00:01:49.799> pointed<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.579> tighten<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.000> back

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it's pointed at you and tighten it back

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.690 
it's pointed at you and tighten it back
up<00:01:51.229> not<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.439> end<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> world<00:01:52.920> not<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> huge

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
up not the end of the world not a huge

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.060 
up not the end of the world not a huge
deal<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.899> was<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.200> frustrating<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.920> me

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
deal but it was just frustrating for me

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.670 
deal but it was just frustrating for me
I<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.420> hadn't<00:01:57.689> even<00:01:57.750> thought<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
I really hadn't even thought of it that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.200 
I really hadn't even thought of it that
much<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.189> frustrating<00:01:59.790> but<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.939> hadn't

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
much it was frustrating but I hadn't

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.789 
much it was frustrating but I hadn't
thought<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> solution<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
thought there was a solution for it and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.469 
thought there was a solution for it and
tell<00:02:01.920> him<00:02:02.040> at<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.159> photo<00:02:02.430> Expo<00:02:02.820> last<00:02:03.060> year<00:02:03.299> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
tell him at the photo Expo last year and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.920 
tell him at the photo Expo last year and
saw<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.439> p0<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.520> you'll<00:02:05.969> notice<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.540> only

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
saw the p0 and you'll notice the only

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.190 
saw the p0 and you'll notice the only
locking<00:02:07.380> ring<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.979> both<00:02:08.129> drag<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.239> lock

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
locking ring for both drag and the lock

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.930 
locking ring for both drag and the lock
is<00:02:10.280> circular<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.370> goes<00:02:11.459> all<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.700> way<00:02:11.790> around

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
is circular it goes all the way around

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.240 
is circular it goes all the way around
the<00:02:12.150> whole<00:02:12.270> head<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.500> no<00:02:13.590> matter<00:02:13.709> which<00:02:14.010> way

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
the whole head so no matter which way

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.190 
the whole head so no matter which way
you<00:02:14.310> set<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.760> up<00:02:14.849> even<00:02:15.239> if<00:02:15.360> you're<00:02:15.780> backwards

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
you set it up even if you're backwards

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.619 
you set it up even if you're backwards
with<00:02:16.620> your<00:02:16.739> clamp<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.730> set<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.150> your<00:02:18.450> legs

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
with your clamp you set it up your legs

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.330 
with your clamp you set it up your legs
are<00:02:18.750> level<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.200> realize<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.980> loosen

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
are level you realize that you loosen

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.650 
are level you realize that you loosen
the<00:02:20.400> lock<00:02:20.550> what<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.360> compose

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
the lock what you have to do to compose

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.630 
the lock what you have to do to compose
anyway<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:22.530> spin<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.860> whole<00:02:22.950> thing<00:02:23.190> around

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
anyway you spin the whole thing around

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.119 
anyway you spin the whole thing around
tighten<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:23.970> up<00:02:24.120> boom<00:02:24.629> set<00:02:25.230> up<00:02:25.379> it's<00:02:25.860> always

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
tighten it up boom set up it's always

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.520 
tighten it up boom set up it's always
pointed<00:02:26.790> at<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.970> because<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.480> ring

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
pointed at you because it's a ring

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.190 
pointed at you because it's a ring
so<00:02:28.830> I've<00:02:28.950> since<00:02:29.250> switched<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.140> but<00:02:31.140> I

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
so I've since switched to that but I

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.830 
so I've since switched to that but I
just<00:02:31.230> wanted<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.620> show<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.730> gb2<00:02:33.239> has

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
just wanted to show you the the gb2 has

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.479 
just wanted to show you the the gb2 has
a<00:02:33.870> couple<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.290> nice<00:02:34.410> features<00:02:34.620> one<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.130> that

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
a couple of nice features one is that

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.430 
a couple of nice features one is that
you<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.180> actually<00:02:36.360> take<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.840> threaded<00:02:37.110> stud

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
you can actually take the threaded stud

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.350 
you can actually take the threaded stud
for<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.709> clamp<00:02:37.950> out<00:02:38.160> screw<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.880> bottom

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
for the clamp out screw it in the bottom

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.740 
for the clamp out screw it in the bottom
and<00:02:39.540> then<00:02:40.230> put<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.730> head<00:02:41.910> upside<00:02:42.510> or

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and then put it on the head upside or

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.530 
and then put it on the head upside or
the<00:02:42.840> legs<00:02:43.049> upside<00:02:43.620> down<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:45.090> what<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.450> gets

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
the legs upside down and what that gets

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.900 
the legs upside down and what that gets
you<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.410> same<00:02:46.590> as<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.860> p0<00:02:47.280> gets<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.760> with

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
you the same as the p0 gets you is with

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.839 
you the same as the p0 gets you is with
your<00:02:48.000> panning<00:02:48.540> option<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.680> once<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.340> level<00:02:50.790> it

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
your panning option up once you level it

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.400 
your panning option up once you level it
say<00:02:51.060> your<00:02:51.180> legs<00:02:51.420> are<00:02:51.569> way<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> funny<00:02:52.200> angle

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
say your legs are way on a funny angle

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.559 
say your legs are way on a funny angle
once<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.190> level<00:02:53.519> your<00:02:53.549> head<00:02:53.819> out<00:02:54.000> if<00:02:54.450> you

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
once you level your head out if you

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.089 
once you level your head out if you
loosen<00:02:54.870> your<00:02:54.900> panting<00:02:55.260> clamp<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.799> can<00:02:55.950> then

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
loosen your panting clamp you can then

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.380 
loosen your panting clamp you can then
pan<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.120> clamp<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.780> do<00:02:58.560> panoramas<00:02:59.390> so

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
pan just the clamp and do panoramas so

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.030 
pan just the clamp and do panoramas so
that's<00:03:00.569> great<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.079> anyone<00:03:01.620> who<00:03:01.709> wants<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.950> do

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
that's great for anyone who wants to do

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.330 
that's great for anyone who wants to do
a<00:03:02.069> panorama<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.849> it's<00:03:03.329> much<00:03:03.690> less<00:03:03.959> parts<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:05.220> go

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
a panorama it it's much less parts to go

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.190 
a panorama it it's much less parts to go
on<00:03:05.459> your<00:03:05.549> camera<00:03:06.060> because<00:03:06.510> your<00:03:06.660> clamp<00:03:06.989> which

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
on your camera because your clamp which

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.500 
on your camera because your clamp which
is<00:03:07.319> level<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:08.040> doing<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.430> panning<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.360> can

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
is level is doing the panning you can

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.390 
is level is doing the panning you can
then<00:03:09.660> use<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> rail<00:03:10.590> if<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.890> want<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.250> get<00:03:11.370> over

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
then use a rail if you want to get over

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.940 
then use a rail if you want to get over
the<00:03:11.670> nodal<00:03:11.940> point<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:12.480> you're<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.709> only

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
the nodal point but you're just you only

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.620 
the nodal point but you're just you only
need<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.489> rail<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:14.970> that's<00:03:15.239> even

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
need that rail and that's even

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.319 
need that rail and that's even
questionable<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.579> and<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.910> fact<00:03:18.090> this

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
questionable so that and the fact this

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.910 
questionable so that and the fact this
is<00:03:18.480> open<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.049> allows<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.650> get<00:03:19.709> any

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
is open and allows you to just get any

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.090 
is open and allows you to just get any
sand<00:03:20.250> or<00:03:20.430> grit<00:03:20.639> out<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:20.970> here<00:03:21.150> very<00:03:21.900> easily<00:03:22.380> and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
sand or grit out of here very easily and

actually had one of the rubber pieces
get<00:03:42.989> stripped<00:03:43.410> on<00:03:43.590> mine<00:03:43.829> once<00:03:44.100> because<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.639> was

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
get stripped on mine once because it was

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.410 
get stripped on mine once because it was
it<00:03:45.209> was<00:03:45.329> too<00:03:45.540> cold<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.519> just<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:47.940> used<00:03:48.269> too

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420

it was too cold and I just I used too
much<00:03:48.540> force<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.380> rubber<00:03:49.590> crack<00:03:49.889> so<00:03:50.549> I

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
much force and the rubber crack so I

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:51.920 
much force and the rubber crack so I
sent<00:03:50.880> it<00:03:51.000> in<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.180> actually<00:03:51.329> had<00:03:51.569> them<00:03:51.660> replace

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
sent it in I actually had them replace

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.259 
sent it in I actually had them replace
it<00:03:52.079> with<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.230> knob<00:03:52.410> without<00:03:52.680> rubber<00:03:52.980> on<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.269> but

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
it with a knob without rubber on it but

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.910 
it with a knob without rubber on it but
yeah<00:03:54.389> they<00:03:54.630> they<00:03:54.810> stand<00:03:55.200> by<00:03:55.349> their<00:03:55.500> product

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
yeah they they stand by their product

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.819 
yeah they they stand by their product
and<00:03:55.980> it's<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.220> well-built<00:03:56.760> product<00:03:57.410> so<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.590> is

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
and it's a well-built product so this is

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.920 
and it's a well-built product so this is
this<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.670> G<00:03:59.819> V<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.269> new<00:04:00.420> versions<00:04:00.870> of

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
this is the G V to the new versions of

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.120 
this is the G V to the new versions of
the<00:04:01.049> GP<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.650> Jeep

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
the GP and the Jeep

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.600 
the GP and the Jeep
yes<00:04:02.780> they<00:04:03.780> are<00:04:03.990> they<00:04:04.320> advertise<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:05.220> fact<00:04:05.250> you

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
yes they are they advertise the fact you

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.490 
yes they are they advertise the fact you
can<00:04:05.760> flip<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.060> upside<00:04:06.360> down<00:04:06.390> but<00:04:07.170> this<00:04:07.350> one

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
can flip it upside down but this one

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.170 
can flip it upside down but this one
does<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.800> anyway

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
does it anyway

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.790 
does it anyway
I<00:04:09.210> believe<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.780> other<00:04:09.810> ones<00:04:10.110> advertise<00:04:10.590> it

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
I believe the other ones advertise it

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.320 
I believe the other ones advertise it
because<00:04:11.070> they<00:04:11.190> come<00:04:11.400> with<00:04:11.430> their<00:04:11.670> own<00:04:11.700> clamps

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
because they come with their own clamps

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.600 
because they come with their own clamps
generally<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.020> with<00:04:13.260> their<00:04:13.530> clamps<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.250> GP

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
generally and with their clamps the GP

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.950 
generally and with their clamps the GP
versions<00:04:15.060> are<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.210> only<00:04:15.360> ones<00:04:15.570> you<00:04:15.690> can<00:04:15.810> take

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
versions are the only ones you can take

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.170 
versions are the only ones you can take
the<00:04:16.080> clamp<00:04:16.350> off<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.770> flip<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.370> bought<00:04:18.000> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
the clamp off and flip it I bought the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.760 
the clamp off and flip it I bought the
version<00:04:18.510> without<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.900> clamp<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.530> could<00:04:19.650> use

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
version without the clamp so I could use

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.370 
version without the clamp so I could use
my<00:04:19.920> really<00:04:20.160> write<00:04:20.370> stuff<00:04:20.610> lever<00:04:20.970> clamp<00:04:21.510> which

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
my really write stuff lever clamp which

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.550 
my really write stuff lever clamp which
is<00:04:22.500> why<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:22.680> have<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:22.980> option<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.990> S<00:04:25.170> on

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
is why I have that option and the S on

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.230 
is why I have that option and the S on
the<00:04:25.650> GPS<00:04:26.070> means<00:04:26.370> it's<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.610> smaller<00:04:26.970> diameter

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
the GPS means it's a smaller diameter

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.180 
the GPS means it's a smaller diameter
for<00:04:27.780> some<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:27.990> those<00:04:28.050> smaller<00:04:28.440> inverting<00:04:29.040> leg

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
for some of those smaller inverting leg

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.090 
for some of those smaller inverting leg
tripods<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:30.600> non<00:04:31.200> S<00:04:31.470> has<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.650> slightly<00:04:31.980> larger

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
tripods the non S has a slightly larger

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.980 
tripods the non S has a slightly larger
base<00:04:32.640> everything<00:04:33.270> else<00:04:33.420> is<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.570> same<00:04:33.840> that

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
base everything else is the same that

base everything else is the same that
capacities<00:04:34.560> in<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.680> ball<00:04:34.890> size<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:36.120> that's

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
capacities in the ball size so that's

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.860 
capacities in the ball size so that's

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
the GB - here's the p0 like I said one

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.410 
the GB - here's the p0 like I said one
ring<00:04:40.260> that<00:04:41.220> does<00:04:41.430> all<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.790> work<00:04:41.820> makes<00:04:42.270> it

the<00:04:55.710> clamp<00:04:55.890> backwards<00:04:56.370> go<00:04:56.580> up<00:04:56.820> if<00:04:57.510> you're<00:04:57.750> not

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
the clamp backwards go up if you're not

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.780 
the clamp backwards go up if you're not
using<00:04:58.350> an<00:04:58.590> L<00:04:58.740> bracket<00:04:59.250> you'll<00:04:59.370> have<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.640> use

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
using an L bracket you'll have to use

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.360 
using an L bracket you'll have to use
that<00:05:00.000> for<00:05:00.060> all<00:05:00.330> your<00:05:00.510> vertical<00:05:00.900> shots<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:02.250> at

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
that for all your vertical shots and at

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.920 
that for all your vertical shots and at
that<00:05:02.520> point<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.940> loosen<00:05:03.270> your<00:05:03.300> pan<00:05:03.660> lock

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
that point you loosen your pan lock

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.870 
that point you loosen your pan lock
right<00:05:04.170> here<00:05:04.230> and<00:05:04.650> you'd<00:05:04.890> have<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.190> get<00:05:05.610> that

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
right here and you'd have to get that

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.260 
right here and you'd have to get that
perpendicular<00:05:07.010> but<00:05:08.010> this<00:05:08.250> it's<00:05:09.000> about

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
perpendicular but this it's about

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.470 
perpendicular but this it's about
eliminating<00:05:09.960> controls<00:05:10.530> for<00:05:11.340> me<00:05:11.490> so<00:05:11.910> I've

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
eliminating controls for me so I've

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.170 
eliminating controls for me so I've
really<00:05:12.990> enjoyed<00:05:13.320> this<00:05:14.220> head<00:05:14.490> since<00:05:14.850> I've<00:05:14.970> got

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
really enjoyed this head since I've got

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.700 
really enjoyed this head since I've got
it<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:16.530> ball<00:05:17.130> for<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.180> head<00:05:18.420> is<00:05:18.690> enclosed<00:05:19.350> on

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
it the ball for this head is enclosed on

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.940 
it the ball for this head is enclosed on
this<00:05:19.890> design<00:05:20.570> but<00:05:21.570> because<00:05:21.720> it's<00:05:22.350> upside<00:05:22.920> down

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
this design but because it's upside down

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.460 
this design but because it's upside down
I've<00:05:23.730> had<00:05:23.970> no<00:05:24.150> issues<00:05:24.180> with<00:05:24.570> it<00:05:24.630> in<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:25.260> time

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
I've had no issues with it in the time

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.980 
I've had no issues with it in the time
I've<00:05:25.620> had<00:05:25.770> it<00:05:25.950> which<00:05:26.040> has<00:05:26.220> been<00:05:26.690> almost<00:05:27.690> a<00:05:27.960> year

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
I've had it which has been almost a year

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.940 
I've had it which has been almost a year
now<00:05:28.550> so<00:05:29.990> gravity<00:05:30.990> is<00:05:31.080> basically<00:05:31.590> doing<00:05:31.740> all

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
now so gravity is basically doing all

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.890 
now so gravity is basically doing all
the<00:05:32.040> work<00:05:32.160> for<00:05:32.190> me<00:05:32.580> I<00:05:32.610> do<00:05:32.760> rinse<00:05:33.120> it<00:05:33.360> once<00:05:33.750> a

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
the work for me I do rinse it once a

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.140 
the work for me I do rinse it once a
month<00:05:33.930> maybe<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:35.190> make<00:05:35.340> sure<00:05:35.460> it<00:05:35.550> stays<00:05:35.760> clean

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
month maybe to make sure it stays clean

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.230 
month maybe to make sure it stays clean
but<00:05:36.810> it's<00:05:36.960> just<00:05:37.110> it's<00:05:37.500> super<00:05:38.040> easy<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.580> use<00:05:38.640> no

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
but it's just it's super easy to use no

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.580 
but it's just it's super easy to use no
matter<00:05:39.390> which<00:05:39.570> way<00:05:39.720> you<00:05:39.780> set<00:05:40.050> it<00:05:40.170> up<00:05:40.260> so<00:05:40.470> I've

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
matter which way you set it up so I've

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.920 
matter which way you set it up so I've
really<00:05:40.860> it's<00:05:41.400> it's<00:05:41.820> a<00:05:42.000> key<00:05:42.210> selling<00:05:42.510> point<00:05:42.840> for

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
really it's it's a key selling point for

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.810 
really it's it's a key selling point for
me<00:05:43.140> that<00:05:43.470> no<00:05:43.980> matter<00:05:44.130> how<00:05:44.280> I<00:05:44.310> set<00:05:44.550> it<00:05:44.640> up<00:05:44.730> you

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
me that no matter how I set it up you

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.040 
me that no matter how I set it up you
grab<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.210> use<00:05:45.420> it<00:05:45.570> and<00:05:45.660> you<00:05:45.780> don't<00:05:45.840> have<00:05:45.960> to

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
grab it and use it and you don't have to

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.890 
grab it and use it and you don't have to
think<00:05:46.200> about<00:05:46.320> it<00:05:46.620> less<00:05:47.160> frustrations<00:05:47.940> it<00:05:48.780> does

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
think about it less frustrations it does

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.630 
think about it less frustrations it does
have<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.200> smaller<00:05:49.620> threaded<00:05:50.160> stud<00:05:50.370> on<00:05:50.490> this

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
have the smaller threaded stud on this

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.130 
have the smaller threaded stud on this
when<00:05:50.820> you<00:05:50.910> buy<00:05:51.030> it<00:05:51.090> without<00:05:51.360> a<00:05:51.480> clamp<00:05:51.840> so<00:05:52.080> you

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
when you buy it without a clamp so you

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.570 
when you buy it without a clamp so you
have<00:05:52.320> to<00:05:52.410> have<00:05:52.500> the<00:05:52.620> bushing<00:05:53.010> in<00:05:53.130> there<00:05:53.340> I

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
have to have the bushing in there I

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.280 
have to have the bushing in there I
don't<00:05:54.300> know<00:05:54.360> if<00:05:54.420> to<00:05:54.510> build<00:05:54.660> a<00:05:54.690> seal<00:05:54.900> try<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.170> get

don't know if to build a seal try to get

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.780 
don't know if to build a seal try to get
some<00:05:55.410> pictures<00:05:55.590> too<00:05:55.920> but<00:05:56.130> there's<00:05:56.280> a<00:05:56.340> bushing

so insistent on a lever bracket but I

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.730 
so insistent on a lever bracket but I
had<00:06:09.780> a<00:06:09.810> screw<00:06:10.200> type<00:06:10.410> clamp<00:06:10.710> on<00:06:10.919> one

always screw that up but my ultimate

on it from the factory and I thought I

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.219 
on it from the factory and I thought I
