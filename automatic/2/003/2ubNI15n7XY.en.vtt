this from 39 lighters let's see if we

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.030 
this from 39 lighters let's see if we
got<00:00:09.360> any<00:00:10.050> better<00:00:10.230> than<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.469> cracking<00:00:10.950> this

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
got any better than what cracking this

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.709

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.060 

so<00:00:26.670> they<00:00:26.789> actually<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.710> totally<00:00:28.710> encased
