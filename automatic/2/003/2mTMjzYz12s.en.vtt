00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to everything in this video i'm going 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.570
 to introduce you to how to apply a varnish 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.880
 semi-permanent so first of all I 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.450
 start by disinfecting my hands and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.369
 disinfect the hands of my client 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 i always use sanitized for myself 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.380
 disinfect the hands at 1 6l of my 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.380
 client 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.400
 then I'll take a cotton with 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.710
 the iso alcohol that I'm going to come over 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.030
 on the nail of the client for the 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.030
 degrease and dry 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.280
 I'm going to push back the cuticles with a 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.280
 cuticle regrowth disinfect 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.950
 we pass a small white or blogs 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.410
 the nail to remove just the cruze 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.450
 thanks to the top we must not do everything 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.630
 really hard to go 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.630
 slowly 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.170
 for Toulouse to be matt feel too much 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.170
 to polish 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.140
 good 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.439
 then in vo on the dust with 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.439
 the alcohol 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.430
 we will apply our varnished one 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.430
 permanent from our base first 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:36.870
 in common to mine one poses at the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 we go back to the level of 820 games 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.810
 in the canteen 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.810
 of course blood 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.940
 emotion and to me 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.610
 2 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.680
 in catalysis during 2008 it's very 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.399
 important to channel well during 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.470
 two minutes 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.350
 because otherwise the varnish will be full 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.640
 little bubbles actually 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.170
 Then we will come to apply our 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.830
 color so there I have chosen you 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.040
 a red polish so that you see well 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.250
 so as the base we have a road and we 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.470
 goes back to the safe reviews 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.540
 then we go back down 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.020
 not say too much the material we use and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.020
 full on 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.680
 we will start by putting a layer 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.680
 delicate 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.470
 we will have it catalyze 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.310
 further with permanent polish made 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.910
 it is to respect the protocol of 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.440
 catalyzing to properly respect both 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.440
 and every time break 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.520
 there I am at the last touch 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.180
 then I will go through the tooth 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.659
 we will put a second layer in 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.670
 general two layers are needed 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.920
 to really have a nice texture of 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.180
 varnish finally especially a beautiful color 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.250
 they are well opaque 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.900
 after if you like a layer you like it 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.280
 that you do not see the traces of 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.750
 brush you can very well put 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.120
 only one layer will not change at 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.200
 level of the outfit 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.019
 we do not forget to lined the free edge 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.700
 the very pretty if you see there the 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.150
 varnish well at the bac we will go under 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.870
 the language 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.870
 another two minutes 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.500
 to finish we will come to apply the top 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.210
 coat so there I used a base 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.840
 a polish a top coat that are of the 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.210
 same brand 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.690
 I do not know if it's necessary 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.280
 to use permanent polish with 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.200
 based top coat of the same brand 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.260
 now it's up to you to do tests 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.060
 to see if it's happening or not there I have 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.950
 used I had a kit so I used 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.950
 all the varnishes of the same brand 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.880
 I spend one last time under the 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.560
 tongue for two minutes and one cycle 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.389
 we undergo it 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.910
 there you have more to degrease if 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.970
 your top coat is a top coat adept 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.449
 residues otherwise it was take away your 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.449
 permanent varnish is weighed and normally 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.189
 on you for at least three weeks 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.169
 we're just going to beat a little 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.620
 the cuticle is always 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.969
 well it's pretty cool it looks like it's done 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.330
 the little touch that ends on the 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.330
 board 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.590
 now you know how 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.000
 ask a semi permanent varnish I hope 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.830
 that this video you press that she 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.570
