they're<00:04:07.160> going<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.310> spawn<00:04:07.609> by<00:04:07.850> their<00:04:08.090> flag<00:04:08.420> and

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
they're going to spawn by their flag and

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.990 
they're going to spawn by their flag and
then<00:04:09.049> scrapyard<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:09.889> map<00:04:10.130> is<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:10.609> small<00:04:11.060> that

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
then scrapyard the map is so small that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.380 
then scrapyard the map is so small that
you<00:04:13.570> know<00:04:13.690> you're<00:04:14.050> going<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.200> get<00:04:14.320> multi<00:04:14.710> kills

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
you know you're going to get multi kills

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.090 
you know you're going to get multi kills
not<00:04:16.390> multi<00:04:16.750> kills<00:04:16.989> but<00:04:17.200> maybe<00:04:17.410> doubles<00:04:17.859> or

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
not multi kills but maybe doubles or

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.990 
not multi kills but maybe doubles or
triples<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:20.130> if<00:04:21.130> they<00:04:21.310> don't<00:04:21.430> shoot<00:04:21.700> you<00:04:21.850> down

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
triples and if they don't shoot you down

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.300 
triples and if they don't shoot you down
you<00:04:22.810> know<00:04:22.930> it's<00:04:23.290> going<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.470> be<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.650> very

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
you know it's going to be a very

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.820 
you know it's going to be a very
difficult<00:04:24.520> time<00:04:24.970> for<00:04:25.240> them<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.390> do<00:04:25.600> anything

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
difficult time for them to do anything

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.830 
difficult time for them to do anything
as<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:27.040> can<00:04:27.130> see<00:04:27.280> they<00:04:27.430> all<00:04:27.580> spawn<00:04:28.060> right<00:04:28.420> next

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
as you can see they all spawn right next

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.680 
as you can see they all spawn right next
to<00:04:28.930> each<00:04:29.050> other<00:04:29.640> so<00:04:30.640> it's<00:04:30.790> very<00:04:31.030> easy<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.480> get

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
to each other so it's very easy to get

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.790 
to each other so it's very easy to get
kills<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:34.050> if<00:04:35.050> you're<00:04:35.200> getting<00:04:35.470> discouraged

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
kills and if you're getting discouraged

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.950 
kills and if you're getting discouraged
you<00:04:36.040> know<00:04:36.190> go<00:04:37.120> ahead<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.390> look<00:04:37.690> for<00:04:37.930> a

you know go ahead and look for a

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.410 
you know go ahead and look for a
