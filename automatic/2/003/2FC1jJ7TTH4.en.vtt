00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that probably lose half this stuff so

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
that probably lose half this stuff so
it's<00:00:41.010> all<00:00:41.129> back<00:00:41.280> together<00:00:41.489> with<00:00:41.850> new<00:00:41.940> gaskets

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

hopefully<00:02:14.280> wrapping<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.819> up<00:02:14.849> tonight<00:02:16.099> the

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
hopefully wrapping it up tonight the

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.030 
hopefully wrapping it up tonight the
first<00:02:17.370> step<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.760> removing<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.239> oil<00:02:18.269> pan<00:02:18.720> is

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
first step in removing the oil pan is

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.530 
first step in removing the oil pan is
removing<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.220> front<00:02:21.860> engine<00:02:22.860> pipe<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.700> has

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
removing the front engine pipe and has

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.490 
removing the front engine pipe and has
the<00:02:24.660> two<00:02:24.810> cats<00:02:25.160> up<00:02:26.160> by<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.549> manifold<00:02:27.500> forward

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the two cats up by the manifold forward

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.800 
the two cats up by the manifold forward
one<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.400> back<00:02:29.580> one<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.470> these<00:02:31.470> bolts<00:02:32.010> are

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
one and the back one and these bolts are

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
one and the back one and these bolts are
real<00:02:33.810> pain<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.230> ass

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
real pain in the ass

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.070 
real pain in the ass
there's<00:02:35.640> no<00:02:35.819> room<00:02:36.090> between<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.510> cats<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.930> get

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
there's no room between the cats to get

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.250 
there's no room between the cats to get
a<00:02:37.110> swivel<00:02:38.010> up<00:02:38.160> there<00:02:38.400> or<00:02:38.610> socket<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.110> have

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
a swivel up there or socket so you have

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.870 
a swivel up there or socket so you have
to<00:02:40.410> use<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:41.239> few<00:02:42.239> different<00:02:42.390> tools<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.730> this<00:02:44.730> is

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
to use a few different tools but this is

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.160 
to use a few different tools but this is
probably<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.209> newest<00:02:45.510> one<00:02:45.660> I've<00:02:45.780> ever<00:02:45.810> done

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
probably the newest one I've ever done

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.140 
probably the newest one I've ever done
and<00:02:48.769> Chrysler<00:02:49.769> Jeep<00:02:50.340> whoever<00:02:50.700> did<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.000> good

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
and Chrysler Jeep whoever did a good

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.610 
and Chrysler Jeep whoever did a good
thing<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.599> put<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:52.400> lock<00:02:53.400> nut<00:02:53.660> or<00:02:54.660> captured<00:02:55.440> nut

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
thing it put a lock nut or captured nut

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.979 
thing it put a lock nut or captured nut
or<00:02:55.829> a<00:02:55.860> clip<00:02:56.099> not<00:02:56.280> at<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.269> manifold<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:57.930> you

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
or a clip not at the manifold so you

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.509 
or a clip not at the manifold so you
don't<00:02:58.140> have<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.410> get<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.739> there<00:02:58.890> with<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> second

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
don't have to get in there with a second

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.000 
don't have to get in there with a second
hand<00:02:59.849> or<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.120> third<00:03:00.360> hand<00:03:00.629> and<00:03:00.840> hold<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.200> holder

hand or a third hand and hold a holder
wrench<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:04.590> these<00:03:04.739> bolts<00:03:05.040> are<00:03:05.129> actually

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
wrench and these bolts are actually

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.080 
wrench and these bolts are actually
coming<00:03:05.670> out<00:03:05.760> pretty<00:03:05.970> easily<00:03:06.650> no<00:03:07.650> heat<00:03:08.090> nothing

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
coming out pretty easily no heat nothing

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.970 
coming out pretty easily no heat nothing
breaking<00:03:09.480> nothing<00:03:09.629> rotted<00:03:10.110> which<00:03:10.829> is

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
breaking nothing rotted which is

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.250 
breaking nothing rotted which is
remarkable<00:03:11.579> so<00:03:12.150> we'll<00:03:12.359> get<00:03:12.450> those<00:03:12.660> out<00:03:12.870> drop

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
remarkable so we'll get those out drop

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.990 
remarkable so we'll get those out drop
the<00:03:13.290> pipe<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.069> then<00:03:14.760> move<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.389> starter

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
the pipe and then move on to the starter

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.670 
the pipe and then move on to the starter
can<00:03:18.000> now<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.389> front<00:03:18.660> pipe<00:03:19.500> is

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
can now that the front pipe is

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.990 
can now that the front pipe is
disconnected<00:03:20.250> from<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.430> manifold<00:03:23.000> your

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
disconnected from the manifold your

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.690 
disconnected from the manifold your
labor<00:03:24.209> guides<00:03:25.010> will<00:03:26.010> tell<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.459> pull<00:03:26.670> a

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
labor guides will tell you to pull a

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.150 
labor guides will tell you to pull a
whole<00:03:26.910> exhaust<00:03:27.299> system<00:03:27.690> out<00:03:28.069> disconnect<00:03:29.069> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
whole exhaust system out disconnect the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.520 
whole exhaust system out disconnect the
muffler<00:03:29.489> from<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:29.790> cat<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.359> pull<00:03:31.349> it<00:03:31.440> out

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
muffler from the cat and pull it out

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.190 
muffler from the cat and pull it out
that<00:03:31.709> way<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.280> find<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.269> lot<00:03:33.389> easier<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.019> to

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
that way I find it a lot easier just to

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.559 
that way I find it a lot easier just to
get<00:03:34.349> a<00:03:34.380> whiz<00:03:34.950> wheel<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.459> cut<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:36.359> piece

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
get a whiz wheel and just cut this piece

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.390 
get a whiz wheel and just cut this piece
of<00:03:36.720> pipe<00:03:36.840> right<00:03:37.109> here<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:37.919> when<00:03:38.099> everything's

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
of pipe right here and when everything's

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.949 
of pipe right here and when everything's
back<00:03:38.579> together<00:03:38.760> weld<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.269> back<00:03:39.299> together<00:03:39.569> so

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
back together weld it back together so

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.339 
back together weld it back together so
that's<00:03:40.680> what<00:03:40.829> I'm<00:03:40.919> gonna<00:03:41.010> do<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:43.200> front

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
that's what I'm gonna do so the front

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.900 
that's what I'm gonna do so the front
pipes<00:03:43.590> out<00:03:44.750> nice<00:03:45.750> clean<00:03:45.780> cut<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.880> ended<00:03:47.880> up

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
pipes out nice clean cut I ended up

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.620 
pipes out nice clean cut I ended up
using<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.269> sawzall<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.900> get<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.109> out<00:03:50.510> so<00:03:51.510> there

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
using the sawzall to get it out so there

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.080 
using the sawzall to get it out so there
won't<00:03:51.690> be<00:03:51.780> any<00:03:51.959> problem<00:03:52.319> welding<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.950> nice<00:03:53.760> butt

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
won't be any problem welding a nice butt

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.729 
won't be any problem welding a nice butt
joint<00:03:54.419> back<00:03:54.660> there<00:03:54.959> once<00:03:55.230> we<00:03:55.349> put<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.590> back

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
joint back there once we put it back

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.300 
joint back there once we put it back
together<00:03:55.919> so<00:03:57.260> next<00:03:58.260> I've<00:03:59.069> already

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
together so next I've already

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.589 
together so next I've already
disconnected<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.910> battery<00:03:59.940> with<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
disconnected the battery with the

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.620 
disconnected the battery with the
starter<00:04:00.930> out<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.620> then<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.639> inspection

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
starter out and then the inspection

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.870 
starter out and then the inspection
cover<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.169> then<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.859> oil<00:04:05.160> pan<00:04:05.430> should<00:04:05.609> come

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
cover and then the oil pan should come

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.270 
cover and then the oil pan should come
right<00:04:06.000> up<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:09.510> with<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.720> starter<00:04:10.079> out<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:11.099> can

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
right up so with the starter out you can

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.770 
right up so with the starter out you can
get<00:04:11.400> access<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.790> more<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.239> bolts

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
get access to more of the bolts

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.080 
get access to more of the bolts
I<00:04:13.099> don't<00:04:14.099> even<00:04:14.280> disconnect<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.790> starter

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
I don't even disconnect the starter

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.580 
I don't even disconnect the starter
power<00:04:15.329> line<00:04:15.569> I<00:04:15.599> just<00:04:15.720> leave<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.079> connected

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
power line I just leave that connected

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.199 
power line I just leave that connected
and<00:04:16.709> toss<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.219> starter<00:04:17.549> up<00:04:17.669> on<00:04:17.820> top<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.150> the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
and toss the starter up on top of the

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.599 
and toss the starter up on top of the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.309 
and then the inspection plate or access
plate<00:04:23.849> has<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.300> come<00:04:24.479> off<00:04:24.830> next<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.639> we<00:04:26.759> can<00:04:27.319> get

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 
plate has to come off next so we can get

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.830 
plate has to come off next so we can get
better<00:04:28.500> access<00:04:29.009> to<00:04:29.039> the<00:04:29.250> back<00:04:29.460> bolts<00:04:29.759> on<00:04:30.509> the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
better access to the back bolts on the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.369 
better access to the back bolts on the
on<00:04:31.469> the<00:04:31.680> oil<00:04:31.830> pan<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:33.360> looks<00:04:33.900> like<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.110> whole

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
on the oil pan this looks like a whole

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.409 
on the oil pan this looks like a whole
engine<00:04:34.949> plate<00:04:35.219> I'm<00:04:35.490> not<00:04:35.610> sure<00:04:35.849> it's<00:04:36.000> two

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
engine plate I'm not sure it's two

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.589 
engine plate I'm not sure it's two
pieces<00:04:37.550> remove<00:04:38.550> these<00:04:38.699> bolts<00:04:39.060> on<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.240> bottom

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
pieces remove these bolts on the bottom

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.249 
pieces remove these bolts on the bottom
and<00:04:39.719> see<00:04:39.840> if<00:04:39.930> it<00:04:40.020> comes<00:04:40.139> down

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
and see if it comes down

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.899 
and see if it comes down
all<00:04:43.259> right<00:04:43.379> the<00:04:43.469> pens<00:04:43.680> out<00:04:43.919> and<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.580> whole<00:04:44.699> pile

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
all right the pens out and a whole pile

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:50.629 
all right the pens out and a whole pile
of<00:04:44.939> bolts<00:04:45.330> there<00:04:46.009> some<00:04:48.319> bracket<00:04:49.319> that<00:04:49.639> covers

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
of bolts there some bracket that covers

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.119 
of bolts there some bracket that covers
up<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.840> rear<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.229> oil<00:04:52.379> pan<00:04:52.620> between<00:04:53.009> the

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
up the rear of the oil pan between the

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.140 
up the rear of the oil pan between the
transmission<00:04:53.580> cover<00:04:55.490> so<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.639> pans<00:04:56.879> pretty

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
transmission cover so the pans pretty

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:04.790 
transmission cover so the pans pretty
beat

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.580 

so<00:05:05.340> that'll<00:05:05.610> go<00:05:05.729> in<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:05.940> trash<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.590> underside

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
so that'll go in the trash and underside

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:17.930 
so that'll go in the trash and underside
of<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.800> motor

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.590 

I<00:05:18.200> guess<00:05:19.200> it<00:05:19.350> looks<00:05:19.380> pretty<00:05:19.740> good<00:05:20.390> oil<00:05:21.390> pickup

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
I guess it looks pretty good oil pickup

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.260 
I guess it looks pretty good oil pickup
is<00:05:22.040> it's<00:05:23.040> perfectly<00:05:23.490> clean<00:05:23.760> there's<00:05:23.970> nothing

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
is it's perfectly clean there's nothing

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.170 
is it's perfectly clean there's nothing
sucked<00:05:25.200> up<00:05:25.380> inside<00:05:25.770> there<00:05:26.040> I<00:05:26.280> guess<00:05:26.880> that's<00:05:27.090> a

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
sucked up inside there I guess that's a

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.970 
sucked up inside there I guess that's a
good<00:05:27.210> sign

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
good sign

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.860 
good sign
but<00:05:28.980> that<00:05:29.190> inspection<00:05:29.790> plate<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.300> is

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
but that inspection plate that is

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.330 
but that inspection plate that is
supposed<00:05:31.170> to<00:05:31.230> come<00:05:31.440> off<00:05:31.590> in<00:05:31.770> order<00:05:31.890> to<00:05:32.040> get

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
supposed to come off in order to get

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.460 
supposed to come off in order to get
those<00:05:32.570> back<00:05:33.570> bolts<00:05:33.870> a<00:05:33.990> little<00:05:34.200> bit<00:05:34.320> more

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
those back bolts a little bit more

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.570 
those back bolts a little bit more
easily<00:05:34.740> that's<00:05:34.890> a<00:05:35.070> whole<00:05:36.980> engine<00:05:37.980> plate<00:05:38.220> it's

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
easily that's a whole engine plate it's

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.130 
easily that's a whole engine plate it's
sandwiched<00:05:38.910> between<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.450> bell<00:05:39.600> housing<00:05:39.780> and

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
sandwiched between the bell housing and

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.360 
sandwiched between the bell housing and
the<00:05:40.200> engine<00:05:40.530> so<00:05:40.650> that's<00:05:40.740> not<00:05:40.950> coming<00:05:41.160> off

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
the engine so that's not coming off

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.400 
the engine so that's not coming off
without<00:05:41.610> pulling<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:41.910> transmission<00:05:42.480> so<00:05:43.380> I

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
without pulling the transmission so I

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.080 
without pulling the transmission so I
guess<00:05:43.680> on<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.830> automatics<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.910> the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
guess on the automatics and the

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.970 
guess on the automatics and the
automatics<00:05:45.870> have<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.140> inspection<00:05:46.620> plate<00:05:46.800> but

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
automatics have the inspection plate but

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.620 
automatics have the inspection plate but
the<00:05:47.070> manuals<00:05:47.540> do<00:05:48.540> not<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:51.120> let's<00:05:51.270> get<00:05:51.360> that<00:05:51.510> old

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
the manuals do not so let's get that old

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.480 
the manuals do not so let's get that old
gasket<00:05:52.110> off<00:05:52.230> of<00:05:52.410> there<00:05:52.590> get<00:05:53.280> everything

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
gasket off of there get everything

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.980 
gasket off of there get everything
cleaned<00:05:53.850> up<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.330> get<00:05:54.510> ready<00:05:54.660> for

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
cleaned up and get ready for

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.630 
cleaned up and get ready for
installation<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:58.770> next<00:05:59.040> step<00:05:59.220> now<00:05:59.370> that<00:05:59.400> all

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
installation the next step now that all

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.790 
installation the next step now that all
the<00:05:59.730> surfaces<00:06:00.270> are<00:06:00.450> clean<00:06:00.600> and<00:06:01.320> I<00:06:01.410> got<00:06:01.590> all<00:06:01.680> the

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
the surfaces are clean and I got all the

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.540 
the surfaces are clean and I got all the
grease<00:06:02.010> off<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:03.050> engine<00:06:04.050> plate<00:06:04.260> there<00:06:07.550> it's

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
grease off the engine plate there it's

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.390 
grease off the engine plate there it's
all<00:06:08.670> dried<00:06:09.000> up<00:06:09.380> hit<00:06:10.380> it<00:06:10.410> with<00:06:10.590> a<00:06:10.620> solvent<00:06:10.950> like

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
all dried up hit it with a solvent like

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.200 
all dried up hit it with a solvent like
brake<00:06:11.640> cleaner<00:06:11.940> or<00:06:12.120> something<00:06:12.150> and<00:06:14.180> when<00:06:15.180> I

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
brake cleaner or something and when I

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.880 
brake cleaner or something and when I
get<00:06:15.360> all<00:06:15.450> the<00:06:15.570> oil<00:06:15.600> residue<00:06:16.230> off<00:06:16.410> the<00:06:16.590> mating

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
get all the oil residue off the mating

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.030 
get all the oil residue off the mating
surfaces<00:06:17.370> so<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.150> next<00:06:18.390> step<00:06:18.570> would<00:06:18.720> be<00:06:18.780> to

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
surfaces so the next step would be to

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.280 
surfaces so the next step would be to
get<00:06:20.040> the<00:06:20.190> gasket<00:06:20.610> out<00:06:20.700> get<00:06:20.910> some<00:06:21.090> adhesive<00:06:22.050> and

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
get the gasket out get some adhesive and

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.520 
get the gasket out get some adhesive and
stick<00:06:22.890> the<00:06:23.010> gasket<00:06:23.430> up<00:06:23.550> there<00:06:23.730> and<00:06:24.410> get<00:06:25.410> it

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
stick the gasket up there and get it

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.310 
stick the gasket up there and get it
nice<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:25.770> stuck<00:06:26.250> to<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:27.080> engine<00:06:28.080> block<00:06:28.290> and

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
nice and stuck to the engine block and

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.370 
nice and stuck to the engine block and
the<00:06:28.650> right<00:06:28.770> position<00:06:29.250> so<00:06:29.780> what<00:06:30.780> trick<00:06:30.990> I<00:06:31.110> use

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
the right position so what trick I use

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.770 
the right position so what trick I use
when<00:06:31.650> I<00:06:31.680> install<00:06:32.160> the<00:06:32.310> gasket<00:06:32.540> onto<00:06:33.540> the

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
when I install the gasket onto the

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.130 
when I install the gasket onto the
engine<00:06:34.169> block<00:06:35.180> coat<00:06:36.180> both<00:06:36.390> sides<00:06:36.450> with<00:06:36.960> some

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
engine block coat both sides with some

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.409 
engine block coat both sides with some
gasket<00:06:37.590> adhesive<00:06:38.040> some<00:06:38.280> contact<00:06:38.760> adhesive

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
gasket adhesive some contact adhesive

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:48.350 
gasket adhesive some contact adhesive
and<00:06:42.620> get<00:06:43.620> to<00:06:43.860> clean<00:06:44.660> oil<00:06:45.660> pan<00:06:45.870> bolts<00:06:46.260> and<00:06:47.360> just

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
and get to clean oil pan bolts and just

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.090 
and get to clean oil pan bolts and just
run<00:06:48.570> them<00:06:48.690> up<00:06:48.870> finger<00:06:49.260> tight<00:06:49.500> against<00:06:50.070> the

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
run them up finger tight against the

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.820 
run them up finger tight against the
gasket<00:06:50.610> one<00:06:50.730> on<00:06:50.820> each<00:06:50.940> side<00:06:51.210> and<00:06:51.660> then<00:06:52.530> a<00:06:52.560> third

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
gasket one on each side and then a third

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.640 
gasket one on each side and then a third
one<00:06:52.980> in<00:06:53.100> the<00:06:53.130> front<00:06:53.750> it<00:06:54.750> basically<00:06:55.140> takes<00:06:55.440> the

work I have no idea what this only thing
goes<00:08:03.400> through<00:08:03.610> is<00:08:03.669> probably<00:08:04.030> a<00:08:04.090> 2.5<00:08:04.840> liter

00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:06.509
