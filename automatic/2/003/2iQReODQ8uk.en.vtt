00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.280
 hey people crime ixia and today too 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.619
 again brand new information about gta 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.990
 5 at the start and that's about it today 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.460
 new update which awaits us yesterday 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.930
 Maybe it already has one 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.369
 or others of you notice that 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.660
 just yesterday a new update came 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.009
 but I'm sure that's just what 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.779
 some have not noticed yet 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.099
 because you are honest from this update 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.599
 said not seen so much and 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.340
 my account synonymous with this update not 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.750
 see a lot because with this update are 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.489
 not in some new vehicles new 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.899
 weapons or something like that but it came 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.430
 just became a few small fixes 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.350
 but still you could do it 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.930
 to see something new in this update 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.210
 and that's what this video and 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.920
 yes yes it was like already said no 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.480
 new weapons or no new vehicles 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.039
 or something in the game with this 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.300
 However, update added something anyway 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.280
 pretty cool and that was the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.629
 graphic again improved somewhat since 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.489
 I think many of us have you 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.050
 already noticed that after the update 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.589
 first set the graphics down a bit 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.390
 has been 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.620
 I do not know why works agents use it 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.879
 a problem has definitely been 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.530
 now with this update that yesterday 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.580
 it just appeared the graphics again something 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.230
 tall plant and I think so 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.090
 personally extremely good because i just 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.190
 just found on the nexgen you have 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.500
 deserve a good graphic and of course 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.310
 I definitely have the coach on it 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.630
 now here one 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.920
 bring in before-after-comparison or 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.270
 better said two before after 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.590
 We begin to compare in succession 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.200
 first time with the first pictures 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.000
 that's at patch 1.09 after it's called 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.560
 update and there you can just the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.540
 pebbles look and michael's 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.100
 the whole looks really extreme chance sees 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.020
 just two-dimensional just out 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.820
 a textures palette on it worked out 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.560
 can the individual pebbles quasi 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.330
 Nest is just a textures palette 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.860
 for all the pebbles and the whole 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.940
 just two-dimensional and pretty 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.040
 muddy and it just looks real 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.420
 pretty bad as I said no 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.920
 I do not know why rockstar games was called 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.630
 from which has done in any case 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.790
 now with this update the whole thing 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.040
 different from now with the patch 1.10 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.420
 I'll even the new textures 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.860
 and now you can see again 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.360
 that the stones are three-dimensional again 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.010
 you can see each stone individually 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 and of course that's just one now 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.310
 small comparative but can not 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.650
 it is quite good and the whole thing is 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.030
 of course, around los santos 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.440
 I had the complete map 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.090
 Graphics of course improved and now 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.830
 Here's another example and two 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.420
 years on the beach has run then 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.190
 you just this footprints in the sand had 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.989
 and that was also wrong after hais 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.350
 dlc unfortunately only two-dimensional and so 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.360
 also 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.610
 muddy and bad but the whole thing 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.050
 now here with the new patch and there 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.730
 You can see again that this 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.200
 footprints are again three-dimensional and 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.670
 Personally, I find that extremely good because 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.230
 i should just be two-dimensional 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.370
 I personally find graphics easy 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.020
 not good that then i just go in 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.300
 on to old school games and just gta 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.650
 5 on the witches has earned extra 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.180
 and I really think so again 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.920
 extremely good that the graphics are up again 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.600
 has improved also became even more so 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.890
 a few small klitsche sex too much 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.060
 easier it's one or the other the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.530
 of you so gone in the last 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.360
 time of karl the character completely 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.530
 Maybe that looked different somehow 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.450
 that character somehow the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.620
 has changed skin color and has something there 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.300
 rockstar games also had a few 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.920
 that's the problem for the characters 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.480
 once looked completely different 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.680
 and that was also swept now 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.570
 second of the others were still one 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.220
 few money clips or something but gefixed 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.780
 nothing big was the main thing 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.980
 Now just that graphic again 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.810
 was set high and that was not 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.160
 really extremely good , however , writes about it 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.290
 your opinion in the comments 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.730
 could you see what is there at all? 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.230
 noticed because I have to be honest 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.400
 to give now that I did not notice 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.810
 that the graphics got worse 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.340
 because you just pull it when you are 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.660
 Nevertheless, pay attention to such small details 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.130
 simply finds quite well that the 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.030
 quality is better now, yes 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.200
 do not hurt but write me 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.400
 your opinion on it just in the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.810
 comments is that to you at all 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.800
 noticed and I am now at the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.910
 Just put it out then I have 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.140
 Of course I always have this video 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.610
 has fallen banons istanbul now 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.950
 Any one for a big provider 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.950
 until then, your kramer is pure
