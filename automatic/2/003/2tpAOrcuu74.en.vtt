00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:15.990
 [Music] 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.240
 Today I'll talk a little bit about staying 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.890
 here is a little time with me that is 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:27.210
 the act transformer 2 in 12 1 why you 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.720
 press here and it highlights is a tablet and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.510
 a computer when you plug it here 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.520
 has a little key that turns into 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.510
 computer is very interesting by the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.890
 Following 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.090
 here it has all the capacity to have the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.030
 cpu memory a small hd inside it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.940
 it runs the system here and here in this 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.110
 keyboard you have another 500 gigs in 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 format of a disc then you can 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.149
 installing things here does not have to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.170
 getting in the way is trouble because of lack of 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.629
 space 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.990
 One thing I wanted to comment on soon. 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.960
 face is as follows 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.210
 many people must have 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.610
 past this time we had the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.460
 netbook era 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.909
 I bought this one in Paraguay. 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:27.420
 long and looks only was he the the father 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.579
 let's say so from these computers 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.259
 nowadays the screens were small eyes 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.409
 use a box here on the side 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.930
 everything to disguise the keyboard was 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.900
 horrible to enter more was that the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.850
 I had at the time was when this is 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.479
 who appeared our helped me a lot 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.680
 because how I work with support was 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.240
 wonderful 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.329
 right after that the other one here has a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.110
 larger screen a more comfortable keyboard 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.259
 putz helped me a lot by talking on the keyboard 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.869
 is where one of the weaknesses of the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.149
 Our friend turns what I said 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.160
 enough on the social networks that it is 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.430
 super cool but could be more if 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.640
 have a keyboard is more efficient 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.360
 if you stop here 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.890
 it has a touchpad bigger than this one 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.160
 another netbook 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.770
 however it is narrower if you take 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.319
 that is narrower and clear here 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.940
 it is small but it is already comfortable 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.330
 of typing and taking steps well 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.590
 complicated 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.470
 the wife in his hands and minors is 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.050
 I obviously do not feel comfortable 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.390
 I have here an apple keyboard for 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.489
 people have an idea of ​​size in what 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.890
 would be a comfortable keyboard then the 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:54.860
 people see that size is neither a problem 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:59.269
 because he could stay here it is 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.540
 to do a kim reengineering with improving 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:06.860
 these keys at your disposal with 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.500
 keyboard and to enjoy the video as 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:16.610
 I did not show it from here again, I 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:30.350
 I have the nokia lumia 25/20 shown it 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:32.360
 without the keyboard here too 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.040
 turns on the computer but runs 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:40.510
 windows rtp1 from the south and here what it goes 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.780

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.260
 'What is a big advantage of you? 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.260

 understood very well I stayed until 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.070
 surprised that I had not used the 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.359

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.669

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.849
 I liked it, I just asked for deadlines. 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.580

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.410
 windows has evolved since the times 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.350
 wore 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.200
 I did not touch me more like this 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.170
 machine here as I said the worst 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.660
 part of it is the keyboard but the machine in 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:43.610
 Yes, it's very good here. 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.900
 how I have used it when I read 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.030
 something I said is with him and to 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.350

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.570
 he here around 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.180
 these entries here are the exchanges of 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.080
 data and here it is fixed in the base 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.970
 it has input to micro sd card 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:08.000

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:20.150
 hotkeys runs fine the fluid 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.250
 keyboard is a machine 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.100
 if I can find a machine like this 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.260
 with more comfortable keyboard looks and 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.650
 think twice I really want one 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.140
 It is that I would come to me with the windows 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.280
 the price of it has appeared in several 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:40.610
 promotions for 1.150 is a computer with 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.340
 a screen of 10 and a screen is for who 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.760
 either portability falls a lot thing 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.470
 On the screen, you can turn around if you want. 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.800
 a little more space 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.910
 a screen of 12 of 13 a more keyboard 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.490
 comfortable 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.950
 you will have serious problems at the time of 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.620
 typing will not feel comfortable 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.320
 but if you want a two in one fluid 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.350
 with a good price and the keyboard was not the 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.060
 problem for you is an excellent purchase 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:12.140
