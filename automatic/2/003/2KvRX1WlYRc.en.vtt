00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
those things when I was younger so I

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.440 
those things when I was younger so I
didn't<00:03:31.860> have<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.980> learn<00:03:32.220> them<00:03:32.460> through<00:03:33.210> gaming

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
didn't have to learn them through gaming

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.210 
didn't have to learn them through gaming
I<00:03:33.780> already<00:03:34.020> knew<00:03:34.320> what<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.530> had<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.710> do<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:34.920> be<00:03:35.130> at

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
I already knew what I had to do to be at

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.460 
I already knew what I had to do to be at
the<00:03:35.310> top<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:36.300> when<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.630> comes<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.990> halo<00:03:37.170> it's

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
the top and when it comes to halo it's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.130 
the top and when it comes to halo it's
10<00:03:37.650> years<00:03:37.830> old<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.550> year<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:39.510> anniversary

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
know much about it so I really couldn't

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.970 
know much about it so I really couldn't
do<00:03:45.570> that<00:03:45.600> did<00:03:45.990> you<00:03:46.140> never<00:03:46.500> play<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.920> original

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
game I did play halo 1 and halo 2 but I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.700 
game I did play halo 1 and halo 2 but I
was<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.670> lot<00:03:50.820> younger<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.210> you<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:52.020> I<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:52.350> really

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
was a lot younger so you know I I really

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.230 
was a lot younger so you know I I really
didn't<00:03:53.010> know<00:03:53.040> much<00:03:53.130> about<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.910> was<00:03:54.150> just

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
playing just to play and it basically

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.770 
playing just to play and it basically
redoing<00:03:56.250> everything<00:03:56.460> in<00:03:56.790> HD<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.360> bringing<00:03:57.690> a

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
redoing everything in HD and bringing a

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.990 
redoing everything in HD and bringing a
lot<00:03:57.960> of<00:03:58.020> new<00:03:58.110> content<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:58.830> it's<00:03:59.370> like<00:03:59.520> halo<00:03:59.730> 1

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
lot of new content so it's like halo 1

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.810 
lot of new content so it's like halo 1
just<00:04:00.210> like<00:04:00.330> new<00:04:01.170> graphics<00:04:01.620> are<00:04:01.740> they<00:04:01.890> 00<00:04:02.310> so

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
just like new graphics are they 00 so

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.610 
just like new graphics are they 00 so

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
mind and what we think will be a good

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.730 
mind and what we think will be a good
competitive<00:04:58.999> game<00:04:59.209> and<00:04:59.449> funds<00:05:00.349> you<00:05:00.439> didn't<00:05:00.649> do

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
competitive game and funds you didn't do

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.559 
competitive game and funds you didn't do
much<00:05:00.770> of<00:05:00.919> that<00:05:01.039> so<00:05:01.369> that's<00:05:01.490> why<00:05:01.759> you<00:05:02.449> know

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
much of that so that's why you know

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.029 
much of that so that's why you know
reach<00:05:02.809> is<00:05:03.020> where<00:05:03.169> it's<00:05:03.289> at<00:05:03.379> right<00:05:03.439> now<00:05:03.649> but<00:05:04.009> I

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
reach is where it's at right now but I

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.100 
reach is where it's at right now but I
really<00:05:04.369> think<00:05:04.580> that<00:05:04.699> 343<00:05:05.270> will<00:05:05.360> make<00:05:05.509> halo<00:05:05.719> 4

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
really think that 343 will make halo 4

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.739 
really think that 343 will make halo 4
amazing<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.039> it'll<00:05:07.459> be<00:05:07.580> one<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.389> the<00:05:08.479> best
