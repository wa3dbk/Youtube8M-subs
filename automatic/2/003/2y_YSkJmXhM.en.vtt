welcome<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.620> injector<00:00:02.159> cleaning<00:00:03.410> my<00:00:04.410> way<00:00:04.620> I

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
welcome to injector cleaning my way I

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.179 
welcome to injector cleaning my way I
guess<00:00:05.040> I<00:00:05.310> did<00:00:06.270> some<00:00:06.390> research<00:00:06.720> on<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.930> net

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
guess I did some research on the net

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.379 
guess I did some research on the net
found<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.580> was<00:00:08.730> an<00:00:08.849> interesting<00:00:09.059> way

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
found that this was an interesting way

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.820 
found that this was an interesting way
or<00:00:09.690> something<00:00:10.200> like<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.590> was<00:00:10.769> an

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
or something like this was an

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.280 
or something like this was an
interesting<00:00:11.160> way<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.250> clean<00:00:11.519> injectors<00:00:12.290> these

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
interesting way to clean injectors these

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.129 
interesting way to clean injectors these
injectors<00:00:13.679> are<00:00:13.830> off<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.330> Honda<00:00:15.330> Civic<00:00:15.509> VX

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
injectors are off of the Honda Civic VX

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.519 
injectors are off of the Honda Civic VX
over<00:00:16.500> there<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.920> just<00:00:17.580> cleaned<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.380> spot<00:00:19.380> where

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
over there I just cleaned the spot where

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.720 
over there I just cleaned the spot where
they<00:00:19.619> go<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> top<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.490> intake

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
they go in the top of the intake

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.849 
they go in the top of the intake
manifold<00:00:21.210> pretty<00:00:21.720> well<00:00:21.930> from<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> top<00:00:22.439> side<00:00:22.680> I

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
manifold pretty well from the top side I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:23.960 
manifold pretty well from the top side I
got<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> take<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.220> off<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.609> clean<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.850> whole

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
got to take it off and clean the whole

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.910 
got to take it off and clean the whole
thing<00:00:24.180> sometime<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:24.840> not<00:00:25.529> today<00:00:27.500> anyhow<00:00:28.500> like

here<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.620> bit<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> fire<00:00:38.520> hazard<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.180> some

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
here a bit of a fire hazard but get some

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.299 
here a bit of a fire hazard but get some
sparks<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.989> hey<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.710> know<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.219> gonna

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
sparks but hey you know what I'm gonna

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.569 
sparks but hey you know what I'm gonna
do<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.379> get<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> positive<00:00:43.829> lead<00:00:44.190> hooked<00:00:44.489> up

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
do so I get the positive lead hooked up

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.180 
do so I get the positive lead hooked up
to<00:00:44.789> one<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.600> wires<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.320> pulse<00:00:46.980> on

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
to one of the wires and I just pulse on

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.920 
to one of the wires and I just pulse on
and<00:00:47.309> off<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.789> ground<00:00:49.879> and<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.360> try<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> do<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and off the ground and I try to do it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.270 
and off the ground and I try to do it
much<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.710> look<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> codes

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
much like a if you look in the codes

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.060 
much like a if you look in the codes
that<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:54.440> this<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.680> liquid<00:00:55.949> in

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that you can see this and liquid in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.319 
that you can see this and liquid in
there<00:00:56.190> right<00:00:56.370> now<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.879> actually<00:00:57.090> being

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
there right now that's actually being

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
there right now that's actually being
held<00:00:57.539> by<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> by<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> injector<00:00:59.129> itself<00:00:59.460> I've

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
held by the by the injector itself I've

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.150 
held by the by the injector itself I've
just<00:00:59.879> done<00:01:00.210> some<00:01:00.390> vacuum<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
just done some vacuum on it so this is a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
just done some vacuum on it so this is a
one-man<00:01:02.370> brake<00:01:02.760> bleeder<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:04.260> black

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
one-man brake bleeder here the black

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.789 
one-man brake bleeder here the black
tube<00:01:04.680> goes<00:01:04.920> over<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:06.060> vacuum<00:01:06.710> happens<00:01:07.710> to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
tube goes over to my vacuum happens to

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.710 
tube goes over to my vacuum happens to
be<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> Kirby<00:01:08.369> which<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.640> pretty<00:01:09.390> heavy-duty

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
be a Kirby which is pretty heavy-duty

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
be a Kirby which is pretty heavy-duty
vacuum<00:01:11.119> works<00:01:12.119> well<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.900> purpose<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> I

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
vacuum works well for this purpose so I

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.789 
vacuum works well for this purpose so I
cycle<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.420> off<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.990> also<00:01:16.140> cycle<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
cycle it on and off and I also cycle the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.980 
cycle it on and off and I also cycle the
injector<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> off<00:01:17.729> sometimes<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.840> let

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
injector on and off sometimes I just let

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140 
injector on and off sometimes I just let
it<00:01:19.080> run<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:19.979> full<00:01:20.430> open<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> while

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it run with it on full open for a while

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.570 
it run with it on full open for a while
but<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:22.020> course<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.350> made<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.650> pulse<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.460> they

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
but of course they made to pulse so they

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.120 
but of course they made to pulse so they
get<00:01:23.700> hot<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.530> let<00:01:25.530> them<00:01:25.619> run<00:01:25.680> too<00:01:26.100> long

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
get hot if you let them run too long

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.170 
get hot if you let them run too long
wide<00:01:26.670> open<00:01:28.009> but<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.369> solenoid<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.939> believe

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
wide open but it's a solenoid I believe

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.870 
wide open but it's a solenoid I believe
activated<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.430> doesn't<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.700> held

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
activated and doesn't like to be held

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.060 
activated and doesn't like to be held
open<00:01:33.000> too<00:01:33.240> long<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.650> take<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:34.979> of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
open too long that if you take it out of

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.890 
open too long that if you take it out of
the<00:01:35.130> fuel<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.670> don't<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> vacuum<00:01:36.479> going

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the fuel or don't have the vacuum going

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.830 
the fuel or don't have the vacuum going
it<00:01:36.990> gets<00:01:37.020> hot<00:01:37.259> fast<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.840> fuel

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it gets hot fast because the fuel

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.300 
it gets hot fast because the fuel
injector<00:01:40.229> cleaner<00:01:40.500> which<00:01:40.770> I'm<00:01:40.890> using<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
injector cleaner which I'm using on the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.859 
injector cleaner which I'm using on the
right<00:01:41.490> there<00:01:41.729> cools<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.270> down<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.689> it's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
right there cools it down as it's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.670 
right there cools it down as it's
cleaning<00:01:43.460> but<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.299> pretty<00:01:45.479> much<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
cleaning but this is pretty much it I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.569 
cleaning but this is pretty much it I
judge<00:01:47.670> how<00:01:48.060> clean<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.630> by<00:01:48.899> how<00:01:49.140> fast<00:01:49.579> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
judge how clean it is by how fast the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.090 
judge how clean it is by how fast the
fluid<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.270> flowing<00:01:52.140> through<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.590> clear<00:01:52.829> hose

not<00:02:26.350> too<00:02:26.500> bad<00:02:26.680> either<00:02:26.890> but<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:27.460> usually<00:02:28.240> take

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
not too bad either but I usually take

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.180 
not too bad either but I usually take

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
on the inside of this guy this one is

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.270 
on the inside of this guy this one is
pretty<00:02:47.140> clean<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.120> use<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.260> spray<00:02:50.620> to

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
pretty clean but I use the spray to

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.710 
pretty clean but I use the spray to
clean<00:02:51.459> those<00:02:51.700> up<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:54.000> grab<00:02:55.000> some<00:02:55.180> new<00:02:55.300> gaskets

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
clean those up and grab some new gaskets

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.290 
clean those up and grab some new gaskets
from<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.959> store<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:57.250> thing<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.670> usually

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
from the store little thing is I usually

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.370 
from the store little thing is I usually
use<00:02:58.560> Vaseline<00:02:59.560> or<00:03:00.040> some<00:03:00.190> other<00:03:00.340> sort<00:03:00.610> of<00:03:01.380> if

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
use Vaseline or some other sort of if

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.050 
use Vaseline or some other sort of if
it's<00:03:02.560> what<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.709> actually<00:03:02.860> do<00:03:03.100> use<00:03:03.310> yeah<00:03:03.820> after

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
it's what I actually do use yeah after

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.530 
it's what I actually do use yeah after
only<00:03:04.180> I'm<00:03:04.300> going<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.670> Hannaford<00:03:07.120> version<00:03:08.459> for

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
only I'm going the Hannaford version for

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.150 
only I'm going the Hannaford version for
rear<00:03:10.540> up<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:11.050> we<00:03:11.230> found<00:03:11.530> those<00:03:11.650> gaskets<00:03:12.070> when

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
rear up and we found those gaskets when

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.190 
rear up and we found those gaskets when
I<00:03:12.220> put<00:03:12.340> them<00:03:12.430> back<00:03:12.520> together<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:13.030> they<00:03:13.150> go<00:03:14.050> back

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
I put them back together so they go back

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.449 
I put them back together so they go back
together<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.620> have<00:03:14.740> a<00:03:14.800> less<00:03:14.980> likelihood<00:03:15.340> of

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
together and have a less likelihood of

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.130 
together and have a less likelihood of
leaking<00:03:17.040> that's<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.190> for<00:03:18.340> now<00:03:18.459> oh<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:19.989> can

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
leaking that's it for now oh and you can

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.330 
leaking that's it for now oh and you can
tell<00:03:20.320> by<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.650> way<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:21.100> want<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.519> do<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:24.220> you

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
tell by the way I want to do this if you

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.060 
tell by the way I want to do this if you
can<00:03:24.370> hear<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:24.970> video<00:03:25.180> or<00:03:25.360> not<00:03:25.480> but

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
can hear that in the video or not but

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.170 
can hear that in the video or not but
you<00:03:27.070> can<00:03:27.190> hear<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.430> injector<00:03:27.790> clicking<00:03:28.060> on

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
you can hear the injector clicking on

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.000 
you can hear the injector clicking on
and<00:03:28.360> off<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.989> seems<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.290> get<00:03:29.380> pronounced

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
and off it seems to get pronounced

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.520 
and off it seems to get pronounced
louder<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:31.239> cleaner<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:32.080> think<00:03:32.410> that's

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
louder the cleaner it is I think that's

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.920 
louder the cleaner it is I think that's
because<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:32.920> going<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:34.209> valve<00:03:34.450> is<00:03:34.690> actually

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
because it's going the valve is actually

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.840 
because it's going the valve is actually
opening<00:03:35.410> farther<00:03:36.300> that's<00:03:37.300> just<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.540> guess<00:03:37.720> but

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
opening farther that's just a guess but

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.250 
opening farther that's just a guess but
anyway<00:03:39.850> that's<00:03:40.239> that<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.750> wanted<00:03:41.050> to<00:03:41.140> give<00:03:41.230> you

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
anyway that's that I wanted to give you

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.130 
anyway that's that I wanted to give you
a<00:03:41.320> heads<00:03:41.440> up<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:42.180> how<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.390> do<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:43.870> don't<00:03:44.019> know

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
a heads up on how I do it I don't know

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.240 
a heads up on how I do it I don't know
if<00:03:44.230> it's<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.410> right<00:03:44.560> way<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.769> do<00:03:44.920> it<00:03:45.040> or<00:03:45.160> if

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
if it's the right way to do it or if

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.009 
if it's the right way to do it or if
it's<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.400> good<00:03:45.550> way<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.670> do<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:45.910> but<00:03:46.180> it

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
it's a good way to do it but it

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.570 
it's a good way to do it but it
definitely<00:03:47.230> smoothes<00:03:47.769> out<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:47.980> idle<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.430> did

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
definitely smoothes out the idle I did

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.690 
definitely smoothes out the idle I did
this<00:03:48.670> on<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:48.850> on<00:03:49.269> my<00:03:49.480> Volvo<00:03:49.690> wagon<00:03:50.370> not<00:03:51.370> too<00:03:51.550> long

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
this on a on my Volvo wagon not too long

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.690 
this on a on my Volvo wagon not too long
ago<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.600> it<00:03:53.140> was<00:03:53.260> pretty<00:03:53.680> incredible<00:03:53.769> how<00:03:54.220> how

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
ago and it was pretty incredible how how

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.400 
ago and it was pretty incredible how how
much<00:03:54.820> different<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.300> car<00:03:55.480> ran<00:03:56.080> how<00:03:56.260> much

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
much different the car ran how much

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.979 
much different the car ran how much
smoother<00:03:56.769> it<00:03:56.800> was<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:58.000> I'm<00:03:58.150> guessing<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:58.959> know

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
smoother it was so I'm guessing you know

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.280 
smoother it was so I'm guessing you know
that<00:03:59.230> helps<00:03:59.680> power<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.220> fuel<00:04:00.430> economy<00:04:00.550> soon

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
that helps power and fuel economy soon

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.620 
that helps power and fuel economy soon
that's<00:04:02.290> all<00:04:02.440> for<00:04:02.590> now
