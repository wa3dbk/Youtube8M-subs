in<00:01:55.110> my<00:01:55.229> trap<00:01:55.439> degree<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.830> getting<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.250> much

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
in my trap degree is getting so much

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.810 
in my trap degree is getting so much
better<00:01:56.460> which<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.630> brilliant<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.369> like

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
better which is just brilliant so I like

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.700 
better which is just brilliant so I like
to<00:02:00.060> look<00:02:00.360> at<00:02:00.479> my<00:02:00.539> ground<00:02:00.780> speed<00:02:01.080> quite<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.500> lot

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
to look at my ground speed quite a lot

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.380 
to look at my ground speed quite a lot
and<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.979> feel<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.399> she's<00:02:02.610> pretty<00:02:02.820> consistent

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and I feel that she's pretty consistent

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.789 
and I feel that she's pretty consistent
with<00:02:03.479> ground<00:02:03.689> Sweden<00:02:03.990> getting<00:02:04.320> better<00:02:04.530> but

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
with ground Sweden getting better but

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.580 
with ground Sweden getting better but
what<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.280> think<00:02:05.850> helps<00:02:06.179> our<00:02:06.330> is<00:02:06.450> our<00:02:06.689> experience

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
what I think helps our is our experience

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.410 
what I think helps our is our experience
together<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:08.130> think<00:02:08.369> she<00:02:08.550> does<00:02:08.580> weed<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:09.269> she

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
together I think she does weed when she

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.210 
together I think she does weed when she
knows<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.200> big<00:02:10.319> event<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.920> she's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
knows that it's a big event so she's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.680 
knows that it's a big event so she's
sort<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.790> feel<00:02:12.150> at<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> moment<00:02:12.360> that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
sort of like I feel at the moment that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.420 
sort of like I feel at the moment that
she's<00:02:13.200> looking<00:02:13.440> after<00:02:13.799> me<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.100> way<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.250> don't

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
she's looking after me in a way I don't

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.309 
she's looking after me in a way I don't
know<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:14.880> she<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.090> or<00:02:15.180> not<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.989> just<00:02:16.140> feel

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
know if she is or not but I just feel

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.250 
know if she is or not but I just feel
that<00:02:16.560> from<00:02:16.709> her<00:02:17.239> we<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.510> don't<00:02:18.750> did<00:02:18.900> too<00:02:19.110> much

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.979 
that from her we I don't did too much

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.250 
because i don't want to burn the dog out
too<00:02:31.410> early<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.970> sport<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.930> wanted

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
limit each of my dogs probably is

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.630 
limit each of my dogs probably is
trained<00:02:39.630> for<00:02:39.930> about<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> maximum<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.069> an<00:02:41.220> hour<00:02:41.370> a

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
handling coming in to try and stay with

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.000 
handling coming in to try and stay with
the<00:02:55.829> European<00:02:56.370> three<00:02:57.359> European<00:02:57.840> seen<00:02:58.139> lots<00:02:58.859> of

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
the European three European seen lots of

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.160 
the European three European seen lots of
running<00:02:59.189> or<00:02:59.700> running<00:03:00.120> which<00:03:00.299> is<00:03:00.420> exciting<00:03:00.719> so

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
running or running which is exciting so

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.270 
running or running which is exciting so
she's<00:03:01.829> got<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.189> adapt<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.969> that<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:04.280> so

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
she's got to adapt to that and so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.729 
she's got to adapt to that and so
hopefully<00:03:06.209> yet<00:03:06.480> we<00:03:06.719> like<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.109> try<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.650> move

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
hopefully yet we like to try and move

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.410 
hopefully yet we like to try and move
through<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.219> journey<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.790> I'd<00:03:08.819> like<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.299> hope

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
through that journey so I'd like to hope

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.240 
through that journey so I'd like to hope
that<00:03:09.450> she's<00:03:09.719> getting<00:03:09.959> better<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.379> our<00:03:10.859> times

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
that she's getting better and our times

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.349 
that she's getting better and our times
are<00:03:11.400> getting<00:03:11.489> that<00:03:11.810> faster<00:03:12.810> but<00:03:13.139> yeah
