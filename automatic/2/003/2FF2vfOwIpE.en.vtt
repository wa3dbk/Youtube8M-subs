hi but I just do a little bit of a demo
here<00:00:03.810> on<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.170> moon<00:00:04.710> flower<00:00:05.009> seeds<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:05.879> I've

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
here on the moon flower seeds that I've

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.790 
here on the moon flower seeds that I've
given<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.859> people<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.599> here<00:00:09.599> they<00:00:09.750> are

given to people and here they are

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.650 
given to people and here they are
hopefully<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.040> can<00:00:11.190> see<00:00:11.460> these<00:00:11.639> now<00:00:12.360> there's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
hopefully you can see these now there's

hopefully you can see these now there's
little<00:00:13.490> little<00:00:14.490> very<00:00:14.940> very<00:00:15.210> hard<00:00:15.450> little

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
little little very very hard little

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.109 
little little very very hard little
seeds<00:00:16.109> they're<00:00:17.010> encased<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.609> almost<00:00:17.880> a

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
seeds they're encased in almost a

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.689 
seeds they're encased in almost a
ceramic<00:00:18.779> coatings<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.619> need<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.310> bust

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
ceramic coatings you need to bust

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.950 
ceramic coatings you need to bust
through<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:22.100> to<00:00:23.100> soak<00:00:23.789> them<00:00:24.119> overnight<00:00:24.570> for

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
through that to soak them overnight for

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.170 
through that to soak them overnight for
the<00:00:24.990> best<00:00:25.199> results<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.949> even<00:00:26.519> then<00:00:26.880> it's<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
the best results and even then it's a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.740 
the best results and even then it's a
little<00:00:27.359> bit<00:00:27.599> tricky<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.640> what<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.789> best<00:00:30.570> way<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
little bit tricky so what we best way to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.470 
little bit tricky so what we best way to
do<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.380> found<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.430> little<00:00:33.059> set<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> nail

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
do this I found is a little set of nail

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
do this I found is a little set of nail
clippers<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.250> what<00:00:35.250> we'll<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:36.500> clip

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
clippers and what we'll do is just clip

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.450 
clippers and what we'll do is just clip
away<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:38.690> bit<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> casing<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.559> don't<00:00:41.309> go

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
away a bit of the casing here don't go

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.910 
away a bit of the casing here don't go
too<00:00:41.700> deep<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.420> help<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:43.649> bear

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
here so you can see inside the seed be

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.430 
here so you can see inside the seed be
possible<00:00:54.739> okay

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
possible okay

it a tiny little bit is there that I've
cut<00:01:09.840> mean<00:01:10.200> cut<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.130> it

cut mean cut a bit more if you like it

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.620 
cut mean cut a bit more if you like it
doesn't<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:11.850> seem<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> matter<00:01:12.360> too<00:01:12.600> much

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
doesn't really seem to matter too much

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.630 
doesn't really seem to matter too much
as<00:01:12.900> long<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> water<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.070> soften

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
as long as the water can get in soften

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.609 
as long as the water can get in soften
them<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:14.960> otherwise<00:01:15.960> you'll<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.170> waiting

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
them up otherwise you'll be waiting

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.429 
them up otherwise you'll be waiting
forever<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.369> outside<00:01:18.049> coating<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
forever for that outside coating to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.230 
forever for that outside coating to
actually<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.009> integrate<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.610> moisture<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
actually just integrate in moisture and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.649 
actually just integrate in moisture and
that's<00:01:21.900> why<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.320> seams<00:01:22.530> never<00:01:22.830> work<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
that's why your seams never work so you

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.870 
that's why your seams never work so you
bust<00:01:24.659> through<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.310> nail<00:01:26.490> clippers

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
bust through that and the nail clippers

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.319 
bust through that and the nail clippers
really<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.710> get<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.860> without<00:01:29.040> damaging<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
really do get in without damaging the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.560 
really do get in without damaging the
rest<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> plant<00:01:31.049> inside<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.570> do

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
rest of the plant inside and then do

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
rest of the plant inside and then do
this<00:01:33.780> -<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:34.950> seeds<00:01:35.189> or

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
this - you know all of your seeds or

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.039 
this - you know all of your seeds or
whatever<00:01:36.180> seeds<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:38.689> yeah<00:01:39.689> and

whatever seeds you have and yeah and
then<00:01:40.229> once<00:01:40.950> you've<00:01:41.130> clipped<00:01:41.909> them<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
then once you've clipped them and you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.810 
then once you've clipped them and you
might<00:01:43.530> want<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> couple<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.430> guys<00:01:44.610> at

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
might want to have a couple of guys at

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.050 
might want to have a couple of guys at

this if you like not maybe plant or your
seeds<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.450> once<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.350> they<00:01:49.500> go

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
seeds at once just to see how they go

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.760 
seeds at once just to see how they go
girls<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.170> still<00:01:52.350> another<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:55.049> then<00:01:55.320> get

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
want to soak these in water at least

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.940 
want to soak these in water at least
overnight<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.310> they'll<00:02:11.880> soften<00:02:12.090> up<00:02:12.330> and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
overnight and they'll soften up and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.030 
overnight and they'll soften up and
here's<00:02:13.950> some<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.190> prepared<00:02:14.640> earlier<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:16.040> did

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
can see see the difference in the size

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.470 
can see see the difference in the size
where<00:02:25.530> they've<00:02:25.680> where<00:02:26.010> they've<00:02:26.130> actually

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480

swelled and some of the plant matter is
is<00:02:32.400> actually<00:02:32.940> coming<00:02:33.180> through<00:02:34.760> they<00:02:35.760> look<00:02:35.940> a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
is actually coming through they look a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.770 
is actually coming through they look a
little<00:02:36.180> bit<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.630> brains<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.739> reckon<00:02:38.459> so

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
little bit like brains I reckon so

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.800 
little bit like brains I reckon so
anyways<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> skins<00:02:40.260> gone<00:02:40.470> all<00:02:40.650> wrinkly<00:02:41.010> and

anyways the skins gone all wrinkly and
the<00:02:42.810> plant<00:02:43.080> matter<00:02:43.319> is<00:02:43.470> actually<00:02:43.769> coming

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
the plant matter is actually coming

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.440
