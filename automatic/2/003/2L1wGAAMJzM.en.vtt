00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
opens the right way out and then the

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.180 
opens the right way out and then the
other<00:04:48.870> one<00:04:49.190> you<00:04:50.190> have<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.460> push<00:04:50.729> it<00:04:50.759> in<00:04:52.039> like<00:04:53.039> it
