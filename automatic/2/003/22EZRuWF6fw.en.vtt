but<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:58.740> added<00:01:59.070> more<00:01:59.100> than<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.790> may

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
but they added more than just what may

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
but they added more than just what may
or<00:01:59.969> may<00:02:00.210> not<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> severe<00:02:01.049> case<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.469> rosacea

they<00:02:02.189> also<00:02:02.369> tweaked<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.149> design<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.810> time

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
they also tweaked the design this time

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.510 
they also tweaked the design this time
you<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.380> deliver<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.770> both<00:02:04.979> sides<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
you have to deliver to both sides of the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.950 
you have to deliver to both sides of the
street<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.090> solves<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.390> couple<00:02:06.659> different

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
street it solves a couple different

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.440 
street it solves a couple different
neighborhoods<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:08.340> also<00:02:08.459> take<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> friend

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
neighborhoods and you also take a friend

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
neighborhoods and you also take a friend
along<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> delivery<00:02:10.500> route<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> guess

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
along for the delivery route so I guess

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.590 
along for the delivery route so I guess
business<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:12.090> booming

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.610

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
be a little frustrating from time to

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.160 
be a little frustrating from time to
time<00:03:03.130> like<00:03:03.730> cars<00:03:04.030> are<00:03:04.240> just<00:03:04.390> there<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:04.900> top.you
