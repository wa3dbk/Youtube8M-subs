00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 young psv plays on tuesday evening 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.180
 squatter against young ajax last Friday 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.059
 the team from whom I did everything came too 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.280
 already in action then against VVV Venlo and that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.440
 team gets the first chance in this 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.580
 Melvin Platje is the top striker 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.650
 tourist Office 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.680
 Your ball over the goal of Jesse Bertram 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.369
 shoot here we have a colors teach 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.350
 busy gesturing he sees a stronger tourist office 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.930
 in that opening phase but still there are 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.480
 also some options for young PSV 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.219
 still with the shot the wise extends the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.489
 ball over the goal of an i here my 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.489
 dad 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 job again and with the in love with Conver 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.340
 Evidence works away but VVV stays in 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.090
 possession and keeps the pressure on young psv 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.280
 in the foreground that ball in the wise works away 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.340
 but not enough and the shot is off 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.890
 vuitton from cage pupil excellent van 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.149
 jesse bertrams 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.390
 and those bertrams who also plays one 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.680
 leading role in the next chance of VVV 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.270
 Bertrams thinks he is catching the ball 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.100
 but have to wait for that ball in the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.460
 sixteen is can does sit in between 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:17.130
 and bertram 6 counts so young psv it 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.259
 extremely awkward day comes vvv 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.180
 again and watch the running of 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.310
 Joppe just runs away from Quekel 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.230
 Heesakkers runs with picture makeup shop 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.860

 [Applause] 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.610
 what a small miracle that vvv not 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:38.130
 managed to score in the first half 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.140
 the wise gets the space but then sees 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.140
 a large yellow wall opposite 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.189
 leemans rommens the running action ista van 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.220

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.979
 feet of quekel where that division it 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.140

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.219
 and around acts that she was a striker 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.609
 don't shoot and think 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.609
 to score 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.849
