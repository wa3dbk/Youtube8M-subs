on<00:02:16.480> my<00:02:16.510> sponge<00:02:16.990> avoiding<00:02:17.740> those<00:02:17.890> darker

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
on my sponge avoiding those darker

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.500 
on my sponge avoiding those darker
colors<00:02:19.650> just<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:21.240> now<00:02:22.240> I'm<00:02:22.300> going<00:02:22.450> to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
colors just like that now I'm going to

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.970 
colors just like that now I'm going to
take<00:02:22.720> those<00:02:22.900> colors<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.560> I'm<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:23.770> going<00:02:23.920> to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
take those colors and I'm just going to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.690 
take those colors and I'm just going to
fill<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.580> on<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:26.320> inside

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
fill in on the inside

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.750 
fill in on the inside
so<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.810> reason<00:02:29.080> I'm<00:02:29.200> doing<00:02:29.349> this<00:02:29.680> now<00:02:30.040> instead

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
so the reason I'm doing this now instead

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.910 
so the reason I'm doing this now instead
of<00:02:30.819> before<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.780> first<00:02:32.050> step<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.680> can

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
of before is the first step is so I can

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.280 
of before is the first step is so I can
just<00:02:33.069> blend<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.550> right<00:02:33.760> up<00:02:33.940> into<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.840> strokes

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
just blend it right up into the strokes

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.589 
just blend it right up into the strokes
I<00:02:35.650> feel<00:02:36.459> like<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.730> makes<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.030> bladder<00:02:37.239> better

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
I feel like it makes the bladder better

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.750 
I feel like it makes the bladder better
blend<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.170> do<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.560> way<00:02:38.770> instead<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.310> doing

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
blend to do it that way instead of doing

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.910 
blend to do it that way instead of doing
it<00:02:39.880> at<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.090> beginning<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.349> have<00:02:41.560> my<00:02:41.709> three

pouncer sponges and you do not have to
use<00:03:51.910> these<00:03:52.150> if<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.540> don't<00:03:52.690> have<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:53.049> but<00:03:53.230> um
