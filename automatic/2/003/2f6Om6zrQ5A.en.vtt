philosophy<00:06:38.150> of<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.270> store<00:06:38.599> is<00:06:38.720> that<00:06:38.930> children

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
philosophy of the store is that children

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.860 
philosophy of the store is that children
are<00:06:39.409> an<00:06:39.530> extension<00:06:39.830> of<00:06:40.009> ourselves<00:06:40.370> and<00:06:41.000> so<00:06:41.389> we

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
are an extension of ourselves and so we

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.659 
are an extension of ourselves and so we
spend<00:06:42.319> so<00:06:42.530> much<00:06:42.620> time<00:06:42.680> trying<00:06:43.099> to<00:06:43.250> be<00:06:43.370> unique
