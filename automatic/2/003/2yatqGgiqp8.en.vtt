 take m of the day is weird in their 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.230
 future to recommend a video after 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.510
 all this time after two weeks low 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.920
 nothing and I restarted several women 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.170
 we have too much that I was a little 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.430
 a little disappointed a bit like the first 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.930
 once you make a video you are a 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.700
 little what do I say you do not know 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.209
 it looks like a little bit has served good 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.510
 we are launched we go skiing video 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.220
 you're going to have it sing anymore or 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.420
 unless you prepare it is it takes the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.100
 time a lot because there is 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.450
 many movies but at the same time 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.180
 you will not see much 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.069
 unfortunately for you luckily 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.590
 for those facts who did they finish him 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.950
 knows part with the whole group 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.200
 of school desbordes in fact what we have 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.629
 had big cuts especially but 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.720
 that's it I did not post videos 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.060
 with all the members of a school who 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.330
 not much to see history 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.129
 they are not necessarily to be sons me 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.680
 give back your village and enchanter 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.599
 what but hey I'm going to sleep I 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.060
 will do a video where I snowboard a little 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.650
 little but hey it was not very 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.000
 impressive during his first time 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.440
 that I have everything that makes it all 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.569
 first time 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.769
 so good no I do not worry I 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.980
 you would do that smells small video a 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.299
 little extra stuff after me there is a 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.170
 another topic I wanted to talk to you about 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.390
 and that is my pretty serious faith between 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.480
 quotation marks it's your different 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.560
 reactions in the comments on the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.110
 following the last ending the last 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.060
 against last May ig the video there he 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.410
 you announce me a little bit my 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.459
 departure but small worries that I have with 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.739
 youtube etc 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.390
 and I received so many comments 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.739
 who are completely beside the 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.190
 plate but you guys just want to go 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.870
 tell him to make us wear what 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.459
 frankly the complicated fact we can 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.940
 criticize one can appreciate not 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.769
 appreciate some people on off to 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.020
 less written messages that was in 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.979
 the negative idea but that they were 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.169
 built someone intelligent 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:30.610
 actually you say yes that's true 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.900
 on this point and it's ok mejia like we 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.139
 love many of you who have me 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.820
 intrigued but an insulter that some 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.479
 did it but who are invested with the 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.970
 plate 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.500
 ruffed bruche said to me we're going 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.410
 keep his cable we'll do I'm doing a 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.280
 video answer where I explain that really 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.389
 why he is wrong 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.340
 why he's not wrong I'm going 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.570
 really do that at the base but he gets 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.770
 find that in fact I tell myself that it serves 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.210
 more or less left is asking you the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.650
 question according to you is it 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.450
 helpful that I'm sync video between 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.450
 quotes to put the points back on 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.310
 i and re- explain more deeply 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.380
 why and how because a 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.170
 priori this really not someone 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.190
 a lot of people because I know 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.720
 not at the same time by doing their 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.390
 answer to mix built I had 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.830
 I'm a little scared in quotation marks 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.190
 quite like putting oil on the fire 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.080
 what's so good I hesitate to do that I 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.640
 need our opinion of whether you 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.160
 feel I need you 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.330
 explains in more depth 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.500
 donations etc 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.870
 because not much to do with 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.940
 some messages that I could receive 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.960
 you notice me just think you 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.670
 yeah really holy lives doubs that is 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.290
 very very short 1 this one just for 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.150
 announce you a little bit back 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.760
 it's that I have a little trouble with myself 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.460
 put back in the bath I had issued and 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.960
 no six on twitter and facebook 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.090
 two weeks doing nothing and you 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.140
 come back we lose a little hand but good 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.150
 it's going fast very fast first do you 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.950
 worry and for those who are asking 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.750
 questions they go along anyway 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.920
 in the modeling repeats it I do not stop 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.880
 no youtube from the site at least sure since 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.130
 because some panic and a little 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.000
 little and as I said before I 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.770
 will not stop anytime soon after we'll see 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.230
 how is it going that's clear it's 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.540
 not infinite but even if I decrease a 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.250
 little pace for now there what 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.650
 in my little head of what I have a 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.140
 idea of decreasing anyway regret simon 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.520
 little by little the rhythm of videos in 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.110
 France or main china because 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.790
 than before video sting two days to little 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.270
 close and make a video every 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.330
 three days 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.680
 this is an idea that may be 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.760
 shot a little more worked especially at 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.040
 level of small effects game it's 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.110
 to learn new tricks that 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.210
 would interest me so here is globally 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.980
 despite the news from my side the 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.190
 next video I'm preparing this 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.190
 give a top 10 I love you see 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.870
 would not this one be it's Islam in 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.360
 reserved game surprise but you will see 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.710
 we would already have gone to hope 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.760
 that this little video pleased you arm 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.140
 no it's just to give some 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.810
 information some of my 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.470
 news for those who might 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:03.030
 eventually the question of 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.800
 for some time now I'm going 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.520
 tells you bye bye and the next 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.520
 big kisses to all
