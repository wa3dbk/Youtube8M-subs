 Yes 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.680
 normally nothing is worth it 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.000
 Taylor Momsen wants to be big again 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.699
 Name is the band in their markets 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:22.450
 Network 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.550
 Pröll stands for working in a network with several millions

 Aldi are not only local in Germany at home but worldwide 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.900
 the way we ask the SCL 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.660
 except that we usually address two Orton projects that are his 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.950
 According to complex and the bad luck for construction environment we understand museums 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.520
 Monroe or bond market Büring SDI 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.340
 to be around 4 in the world and have a unique character 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.090
 dapd that an institute left aligned 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.800
 to research against diseases like Alzheimer's Parkinson's and so on 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.539
 The design of the architect in these wanted so that should pull the 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.469
 represent as playing mass in the broader sense 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.699
 and these so-called windows are American Window Railway bosses 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.409
 Switch to the gaps in the NBA that pose such diseases 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.250
 Our task now was to find a way to do it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.950
 such an Irishman can build buildings in quotes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 8th 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.960
 to 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.530
 the division of labor in these 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.420
 Building was so we 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.770
 the problem here in the right direction 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.549
 Percent predominantly at our main site in Bochum percent 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.300
 have performed 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.130
 and then have individual parts provide services such as this 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.759
 Percent of production 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.030

 Andersen appointment lines% 15 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.689
 The so-called Mechanical Engineers set the exclusively percent 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.009
 with such percent clb 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.929
 Deal with tasks and then us 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:33.739
 l deliver this work to less tactics 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.540
 these are not individual countries that can ever be seen in a simplified model 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.680
 are you can actually represent these areas percent only if 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.360
 you 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.500
 to be budgeted that means colors

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.219
 Sadly, China has this risk but is one 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.079
 he does this 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.079
 complex elements 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.790
 Percent to assemble 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.480
 Berne according to our engineering so we have in this context percent of ours 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.810
 Percent of thirty thousand drawings are created by these individual elements 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.510
 after that he was transferred the data transfer to China 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.579
 we were then built next to China 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:34.419
 you are 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.389
 Percent of the road pushing tour have been built then thermally insulated 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.509
