00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.719
 at the arrival in the outgoing 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.340
 chalk time awaited me completely 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.990
 different picture than I expected 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.730
 after I have another look in mine 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.860
 Darling dinosaur books dared 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.720
 I had the first dinosaurs 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.779
 He did not move at all 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.279
 obviously did not sleep for her 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.500
 just stood there neatly 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.029
 consecutively in the row because several 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.189
 Contemplation, I discovered something like 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.730
 However, meat does not kill any of the animals 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.680
 but something like sluice in the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.410
 inner dinosaurs were located 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.629
 Galletti I could not find me 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.140
 Make a rhyme out of the scenario like yourself 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.520
 the dinosaurs in motion now put 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.469
 I understood the situation 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.050
 It was a means of transport 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.050
 One of the meadow road the dinosaur 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.530
 in which he pulled on his annoying 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.280
 had landed in a ministry ischen bus 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.230
 obviously the gala had been 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.930
 an intelligent people that the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.949
 Dinosaurs dominated this discovery 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.810
 I could not rest 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.789
 I had to find out what happened here 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.160
 to uncover the connections 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.439
 in later travel I found out that 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.110
 the users are, so to speak, around 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.970
 machines acted tna of the animals became 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.560
 programmed by the gelatinous beings 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.680
 creatures that create the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.119
 respective requirements met 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.710
 but why were the jellyfish? 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.750
 along with her slaves the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.310
 dinosaur extinct 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.650
 You will learn that in the next episode 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.230
 In any case, it was not a comet 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.230
 but something much smaller
