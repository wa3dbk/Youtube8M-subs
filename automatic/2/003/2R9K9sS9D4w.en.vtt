00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
freeze or stick them up as I like to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.570 
freeze or stick them up as I like to
call<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.780> it's<00:00:10.139> definitely<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> crowd-pleaser

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
call it it's definitely a crowd-pleaser

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.539 
call it it's definitely a crowd-pleaser
it<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> behavior<00:00:13.019> or<00:00:13.410> trick<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.519> a

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
it is a behavior or trick that is a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.269 
it is a behavior or trick that is a
variation<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:15.750> we<00:00:16.350> often<00:00:16.650> refer<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.949> is

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
variation on what we often refer to is

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.500 
variation on what we often refer to is
beg<00:00:17.640> or<00:00:17.970> sit<00:00:18.330> pretty<00:00:18.740> for<00:00:19.740> Jack<00:00:20.010> he<00:00:20.970> does

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
beg or sit pretty for Jack he does

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.300 
beg or sit pretty for Jack he does
better<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> stick<00:00:22.470> them<00:00:22.590> up<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:23.189> it

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
better with the stick them up because it

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.210 
better with the stick them up because it
helps<00:00:23.519> balance<00:00:23.730> out<00:00:24.090> his<00:00:24.330> body<00:00:24.920> composition<00:00:25.920> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
helps balance out his body composition a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.670 
helps balance out his body composition a
little<00:00:26.430> bit<00:00:26.519> he's<00:00:26.640> very<00:00:26.820> heavy<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> front

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
little bit he's very heavy in the front

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.870 
little bit he's very heavy in the front
so<00:00:29.400> what<00:00:30.090> we're<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.929> look<00:00:31.349> for

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
so what we're going to do is look for

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.389 
so what we're going to do is look for
small<00:00:32.880> variations<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.770> end<00:00:34.950> result

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
small variations on what the end result

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:35.780 
small variations on what the end result
will<00:00:35.520> be

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
will be

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.430 
will be
whenever<00:00:36.030> you're<00:00:36.210> training<00:00:36.450> any<00:00:36.780> behavior

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
whenever you're training any behavior

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.410 
whenever you're training any behavior
what<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.129> want<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.820> what<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.120> end

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
what you want to know is what the end

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
what you want to know is what the end
behavior<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:39.960> supposed<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
behavior is supposed to look like and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.799 
behavior is supposed to look like and
then<00:00:41.370> you're<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.760> looking<00:00:42.149> at<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> dog

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
then you're just looking at what the dog

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.529 
then you're just looking at what the dog
does<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.739> breaking<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.789> down<00:00:44.820> into<00:00:45.270> small

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
does and breaking it down into small

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.380 
does and breaking it down into small
achievable<00:00:45.719> steps<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> definitely<00:00:48.149> want

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
achievable steps what I definitely want

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.600 
achievable steps what I definitely want
to<00:00:48.570> communicate<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.530> him<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.070> I'm<00:00:50.190> training

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
to communicate to him when I'm training

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
to communicate to him when I'm training
this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> want<00:00:51.360> his<00:00:51.449> rear<00:00:51.719> end<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
this is that I want his rear end on the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.650 
this is that I want his rear end on the
ground<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.340> want<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.820> his<00:00:53.940> paws<00:00:54.210> start

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
ground and I want to see his paws start

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.229 
ground and I want to see his paws start
to<00:00:54.809> come<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:56.070> I'm<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.579> use<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> clicker

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to come up so I'm going to use a clicker

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.450 
to come up so I'm going to use a clicker
to<00:00:57.989> communicate<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.829> him<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.190> he's<00:00:59.280> done

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
to communicate to him what he's done

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.979 
to communicate to him what he's done
correctly<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.300> getting<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.629> reward

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
correctly and what is getting a reward

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.549 
correctly and what is getting a reward
for<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.590> slowly<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.699> will<00:01:02.910> shape<00:01:03.510> him<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
for and slowly I will shape him to the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.820 
for and slowly I will shape him to the
end<00:01:04.739> result<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.990> perfect<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.500> he's<00:01:07.710> in

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
end result so it's perfect that he's in

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.380 
end result so it's perfect that he's in
a<00:01:07.890> sitting<00:01:08.220> position<00:01:08.340> that's<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.150> need

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
a sitting position that's what we need

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
a sitting position that's what we need
so<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> might<00:01:10.350> click<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> sit<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> couple

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
so I might click just the sit a couple

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.330 
so I might click just the sit a couple
times<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.330> reward<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> click<00:01:14.070> what<00:01:14.220> he's

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
times and reward it so I click what he's

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.570 
times and reward it so I click what he's
doing<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.600> reward<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:17.490> just

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
doing right and I reward it and I'm just

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.070 
doing right and I reward it and I'm just
going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.090> wait<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.840> he<00:01:18.900> does

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080

anything with his feet I'll even take
that<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:21.840> step<00:01:22.170> stepping<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:22.860> his<00:01:23.009> feet

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
that little step stepping with his feet

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.200 
that little step stepping with his feet
a<00:01:23.250> little<00:01:23.400> bit<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.080> just<00:01:25.080> wait<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.320> him<00:01:26.150> see<00:01:27.150> if
