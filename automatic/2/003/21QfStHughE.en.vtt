today<00:00:10.379> we<00:00:10.740> are<00:00:10.799> using<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.219> pattern<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:11.879> child

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
today we are using a pattern for child

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.629 
today we are using a pattern for child
size<00:00:12.570> for<00:00:12.990> pant<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.529> demonstration<00:00:14.190> purposes

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
size for pant for demonstration purposes

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.359 
size for pant for demonstration purposes
only<00:00:15.109> although<00:00:16.109> where<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.349> use<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> child's<00:00:17.099> pant

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369

can<00:00:20.400> be<00:00:20.520> used<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:20.970> any<00:00:21.180> size<00:00:21.509> of<00:00:21.900> pant<00:00:22.230> pattern

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
can be used for any size of pant pattern

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.479 
can be used for any size of pant pattern
the<00:00:24.630> first<00:00:24.960> thing<00:00:25.259> you<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.559> going<00:00:25.829> to<00:00:26.009> do<00:00:26.219> is

when<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:58.609> remove<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.089> pattern<00:00:59.329> you<00:00:59.719> should

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
when you remove the pattern you should

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.819 
when you remove the pattern you should
have<00:01:00.050> something<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:00.679> looks<00:01:00.769> like<00:01:00.920> this<00:01:02.829> you

and your hip line for the bathroom fan

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.899 
and your hip line for the bathroom fan
the<00:01:12.080> next<00:01:12.259> thing<00:01:12.619> we<00:01:12.860> are<00:01:12.890> going<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.310> do<00:01:13.610> is

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
the next thing we are going to do is

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.310 
the next thing we are going to do is
take<00:01:14.210> our<00:01:14.479> ruler<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:16.210> Mark<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.450> line<00:01:17.479> from<00:01:18.170> our

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
take our ruler and Mark a line from our

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.999 
take our ruler and Mark a line from our
crotch<00:01:18.640> extension<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:20.869> get<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.229> line<00:01:21.500> on<00:01:21.830> the

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
crotch extension so I get a line on the

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:31.780 
crotch extension so I get a line on the
outside<00:01:22.189> seam<00:01:23.649> we're<00:01:24.649> marking<00:01:25.039> our<00:01:25.159> hip<00:01:25.340> line

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.520 

very<00:01:32.790> next<00:01:33.060> thing<00:01:33.210> we're<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
very next thing we're going to do is

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.790 
very next thing we're going to do is
begin<00:01:35.190> at<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> hip<00:01:35.790> line<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.510> Mark<00:01:37.410> our<00:01:37.590> out

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
begin at the hip line and Mark our out

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.320 
begin at the hip line and Mark our out
seam<00:01:38.160> straight<00:01:38.670> down<00:01:39.440> instead<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:41.330> in

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
seam straight down instead of going in

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.050 
seam straight down instead of going in
at<00:01:42.630> our<00:01:42.780> need<00:01:43.170> line<00:01:43.470> name<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.400> down<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.910> we

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
at our need line name going down like we

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.970 
at our need line name going down like we
would<00:01:45.300> with<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> tapered<00:01:45.870> pair<00:01:46.260> of<00:01:46.380> pants<00:01:46.590> or

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
would with the tapered pair of pants or

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.950 
would with the tapered pair of pants or
a<00:01:47.040> pair<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.460> slacks<00:01:47.790> we're<00:01:48.510> just<00:01:48.660> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.870> go

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
a pair of slacks we're just going to go

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.929 
a pair of slacks we're just going to go
straight<00:01:49.020> down<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:50.490> this

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.389 

and<00:01:57.299> we're<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> same<00:01:58.409> thing<00:01:58.740> at

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and we're going to do the same thing at

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:08.529 
and we're going to do the same thing at
the<00:01:59.819> croc<00:01:59.999> extent

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:17.990 

and<00:02:08.690> then<00:02:09.259> we're<00:02:09.470> going<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.769> connect<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.489> him

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.270 

and<00:02:18.210> there<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.380> wide-leg<00:02:19.650> pant

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and there you have it a wide-leg pant

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.839 
and there you have it a wide-leg pant
pattern

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.720 

we<00:02:24.420> were<00:02:24.569> making<00:02:24.989> Gauchos<00:02:25.590> instead<00:02:26.189> of<00:02:26.280> Wiley

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
we were making Gauchos instead of Wiley

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.240 
we were making Gauchos instead of Wiley
pants<00:02:27.299> what<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.540> would<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.290> start<00:02:29.010> at<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
pants what we would do is start at the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.360 
pants what we would do is start at the
hip<00:02:29.519> line<00:02:30.049> angle<00:02:31.049> our<00:02:31.170> ruler<00:02:31.470> out<00:02:31.650> slightly

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
hip line angle our ruler out slightly

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.880 
hip line angle our ruler out slightly
like<00:02:32.549> this<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:35.209> make<00:02:36.209> our<00:02:36.420> AB<00:02:36.599> seen

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:50.180 

as<00:02:41.070> well<00:02:41.760> as<00:02:41.880> our<00:02:42.030> agency<00:02:44.600> Kinnett

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.190 

at<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.790> same<00:02:51.000> line<00:02:51.240> like<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.840> they<00:02:52.020> hit<00:02:52.140> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
at the same line like that if they hit a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.560 
at the same line like that if they hit a
line<00:02:52.380> like<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:54.270> will<00:02:54.420> be<00:02:54.540> a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
line like that and that will be a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.200 
line like that and that will be a
pattern<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.200> Gauchos<00:02:55.650> if<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.850> wanted

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
pattern for Gauchos if you wanted

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.540 
pattern for Gauchos if you wanted
anything<00:02:57.630> wider<00:02:58.020> than<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:59.250> would<00:02:59.400> have

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
anything wider than this you would have

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.870 
anything wider than this you would have
to<00:02:59.700> do<00:02:59.880> what<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:00.240> call<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.780> slash<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.470> spread

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.730 

for<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:06.910> slashing<00:03:07.360> spread<00:03:07.959> pattern<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.500> first

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
for a slashing spread pattern the first

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.930 
for a slashing spread pattern the first
thing<00:03:08.980> we're<00:03:09.130> going<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.640> do<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:11.490> divide<00:03:12.490> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
thing we're going to do is divide the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.580 
thing we're going to do is divide the
pattern<00:03:13.360> into<00:03:14.080> four<00:03:14.830> equal<00:03:15.400> parts<00:03:15.670> beginning

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
pattern into four equal parts beginning

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:37.220 
pattern into four equal parts beginning
at<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:18.310> hemline<00:03:18.690> like<00:03:19.690> this

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.059 

these<00:03:37.890> parts<00:03:38.340> aren't<00:03:38.550> exactly<00:03:42.290> identical<00:03:43.290> but

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
these parts aren't exactly identical but

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.479 
these parts aren't exactly identical but
this<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.940> demonstration<00:03:45.780> purposes<00:03:46.319> only<00:03:46.489> when

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
this is demonstration purposes only when

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.460 
this is demonstration purposes only when
you<00:03:47.700> guys<00:03:47.879> do<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.450> make<00:03:48.690> sure<00:03:49.019> they're

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
you guys do it make sure they're

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.430 
you guys do it make sure they're
actually<00:03:50.099> four<00:03:50.599> equal<00:03:51.599> parts<00:03:54.080> you<00:03:55.080> don't<00:03:55.230> need

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
actually four equal parts you don't need

this line right here that was for the

wide leg pant the next thing we're going
to<00:04:03.209> do<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.690> cut<00:04:04.110> along<00:04:04.379> these<00:04:04.950> lines<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.849> we

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
to do is cut along these lines that we

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.470 
to do is cut along these lines that we
just<00:04:06.569> created<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.379> we're<00:04:08.370> going<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.790> stop<00:04:09.090> at

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
distance apart like this and you will

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.360 
distance apart like this and you will
notice<00:04:24.840> when<00:04:25.199> you<00:04:25.320> do<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.889> will<00:04:26.070> have

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
notice when you do this you will have

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.100 
notice when you do this you will have
some<00:04:26.699> distortion<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.510> pattern<00:04:27.900> at<00:04:28.020> the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
some distortion of the pattern at the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.040 
some distortion of the pattern at the
top<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:29.160> way<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.430> fix<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.240> distortion<00:04:30.870> is

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
top the way you fix that distortion is

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.570 
top the way you fix that distortion is
like<00:04:32.039> this<00:04:33.110> when<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.560> correct<00:04:35.310> these

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
like this when you correct these

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.490 
like this when you correct these
distortions<00:04:36.570> in<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.690> pattern<00:04:37.139> is<00:04:37.289> you're

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
distortions in the pattern is you're

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.810 
distortions in the pattern is you're
going<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.860> do<00:04:38.130> like<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:39.139> kind<00:04:40.139> of<00:04:40.289> a<00:04:40.350> dart<00:04:40.820> pinch

it<00:04:42.000> out<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.720> extra<00:04:43.430> tape<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.610> down

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.059 

and<00:04:52.770> do<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.040> same<00:04:53.220> right<00:04:53.460> here

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069

tape it down

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.730 
tape it down
and<00:05:06.160> now

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.470 

when<00:05:11.400> you<00:05:13.370> redraw<00:05:14.370> your<00:05:14.400> pattern<00:05:14.970> first<00:05:15.270> of

all I should have some paper under here

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.860 
all I should have some paper under here
let<00:05:17.370> me<00:05:17.460> put<00:05:17.640> some<00:05:17.790> paper<00:05:17.940> under<00:05:18.270> here<00:05:18.420> then<00:05:18.750> it

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
let me put some paper under here then it

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.520 
let me put some paper under here then it
will<00:05:18.990> come<00:05:19.170> back<00:05:19.880> now<00:05:20.880> that<00:05:21.270> we<00:05:21.480> slashed<00:05:22.020> our

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
will come back now that we slashed our

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.220 
will come back now that we slashed our
pattern<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.280> spread<00:05:24.270> it<00:05:24.390> out<00:05:24.510> a<00:05:24.810> equal

paper<00:05:28.920> the<00:05:29.280> last<00:05:29.490> thing<00:05:29.760> we're<00:05:29.940> going<00:05:30.090> to<00:05:30.240> do

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
paper the last thing we're going to do

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.050 
paper the last thing we're going to do
is<00:05:31.620> just<00:05:32.250> simply<00:05:33.830> redraw<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:35.460> new<00:05:35.610> pattern

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
is just simply redraw the new pattern

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.290 
is just simply redraw the new pattern
like<00:05:36.660> this

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.820 

well<00:05:41.900> I<00:05:41.930> guess<00:05:42.140> I<00:05:42.260> don't<00:05:42.350> really<00:05:42.470> need<00:05:42.650> that

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
well I guess I don't really need that

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:55.060 
well I guess I don't really need that
because<00:05:43.690> our<00:05:44.690> lines<00:05:44.960> are<00:05:45.200> already<00:05:45.590> straight

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.010 

and<00:05:55.160> then<00:05:55.730> we're<00:05:55.970> going<00:05:56.270> to

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.560 

bloom<00:05:59.620> that<00:05:59.830> in

bloom that in

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.760 
bloom that in
like<00:06:01.810> this

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.559 

and<00:06:05.860> we'll<00:06:06.340> actually<00:06:06.520> better<00:06:06.910> than<00:06:07.150> that<00:06:07.300> when

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
and we'll actually better than that when

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.400 
and we'll actually better than that when
you<00:06:07.750> do<00:06:07.900> it<00:06:09.030> and<00:06:10.030> there<00:06:10.780> you<00:06:10.900> have<00:06:10.930> her<00:06:11.289> new

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
you do it and there you have her new

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:18.710 
you do it and there you have her new
pair<00:06:11.650> right<00:06:12.490> there<00:06:13.590> for<00:06:14.590> your<00:06:14.710> Gauchos

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.000 

simple<00:06:19.470> as<00:06:19.590> that

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.240 

in<00:06:23.820> order<00:06:24.360> to<00:06:24.420> make<00:06:24.720> a<00:06:24.870> split<00:06:25.290> skirt<00:06:25.800> pant

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
in order to make a split skirt pant

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.070 
in order to make a split skirt pant
pattern<00:06:26.790> the<00:06:26.970> first<00:06:27.240> thing<00:06:27.480> we're<00:06:27.690> going<00:06:27.870> to

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
pattern the first thing we're going to

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.590 
pattern the first thing we're going to
do<00:06:28.200> is<00:06:28.470> go<00:06:28.650> back<00:06:28.890> to<00:06:28.920> our<00:06:29.280> original<00:06:29.430> wide<00:06:30.180> leg

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
do is go back to our original wide leg

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.140 
do is go back to our original wide leg
pant<00:06:31.020> pattern<00:06:31.320> and<00:06:31.680> then<00:06:32.550> you're<00:06:32.760> going<00:06:33.030> to

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
pant pattern and then you're going to

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.290 
pant pattern and then you're going to
cut<00:06:33.510> the<00:06:33.720> pattern<00:06:34.140> in<00:06:34.320> half<00:06:34.880> right<00:06:35.880> down<00:06:36.180> the

cut the pattern in half right down the

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.030 
cut the pattern in half right down the

the<00:06:38.130> waist<00:06:38.280> line<00:06:39.410> then<00:06:40.410> you<00:06:40.950> spread<00:06:41.460> this<00:06:42.120> out

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
the waist line then you spread this out

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.890 
the waist line then you spread this out
like<00:06:43.770> this<00:06:44.130> make<00:06:45.030> sure<00:06:45.060> you<00:06:45.390> have<00:06:45.630> paper

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
like this make sure you have paper

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.420
