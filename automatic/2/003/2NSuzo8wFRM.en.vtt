00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
yeah that works quite well doesn't get

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:07.080 
yeah that works quite well doesn't get
the<00:00:59.650> hard<00:01:00.650> out<00:01:00.830> GILF<00:01:01.100> but<00:01:01.400> still<00:01:02.239> works<00:01:04.210> then

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
the hard out GILF but still works then

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.500 
the hard out GILF but still works then
glass<00:01:08.979> scraper<00:01:09.979> haven't<00:01:10.820> had<00:01:10.909> this<00:01:11.060> long<00:01:11.299> but

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
glass scraper haven't had this long but

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.870 
glass scraper haven't had this long but
at<00:01:11.630> this<00:01:11.750> far<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.290> best<00:01:12.470> one<00:01:12.619> like<00:01:13.549> a<00:01:13.610> sharp

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
at this far the best one like a sharp

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.850 
at this far the best one like a sharp
razor<00:01:14.060> blade<00:01:14.860> like<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:16.220> usual<00:01:16.880> handle<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.860> put

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
razor blade like a usual handle and put

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.610 
razor blade like a usual handle and put
it<00:01:18.950> in<00:01:19.100> Sector<00:01:19.760> scratch<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.210> glass<00:01:20.470> yeah<00:01:21.470> that

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
it in Sector scratch the glass yeah that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.820 
it in Sector scratch the glass yeah that
was<00:01:21.800> quite<00:01:21.920> well<00:01:22.130> though<00:01:22.810> yeah<00:01:23.830> definitely

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
was quite well though yeah definitely

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.930 
was quite well though yeah definitely
and<00:01:25.100> then<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.730> next<00:01:25.970> one<00:01:26.120> I'm<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:27.940> general

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
and then the next one I'm the general

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.550 
and then the next one I'm the general
magnet<00:01:29.510> float<00:01:29.990> magnet<00:01:30.460> he's<00:01:31.460> are<00:01:31.580> quite<00:01:31.790> good

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
magnet float magnet he's are quite good

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.030 
magnet float magnet he's are quite good
should<00:01:33.560> get<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:34.040> rough<00:01:35.000> edge<00:01:35.650> soft<00:01:36.650> edge<00:01:36.860> for

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
should get a rough edge soft edge for

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.190 
should get a rough edge soft edge for
the<00:01:37.100> outside<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.640> then<00:01:37.900> should<00:01:38.900> stick

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
the outside and then should stick

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.410 
the outside and then should stick
together<00:01:39.350> get<00:01:40.040> it<00:01:40.159> right<00:01:40.310> away<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.150> then<00:01:41.330> if

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
together get it right away and then if

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.930 
together get it right away and then if
it<00:01:41.510> breaks<00:01:41.659> up<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.960> explodes<00:01:42.290> surface<00:01:42.940> yeah

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
it breaks up it explodes surface yeah

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.969 
it breaks up it explodes surface yeah
I'll<00:01:44.510> do<00:01:44.659> a<00:01:44.690> quick<00:01:44.810> demonstration<00:01:45.110> it's<00:01:45.770> the

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
I'll do a quick demonstration it's the

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.990 
I'll do a quick demonstration it's the
individual<00:01:46.880> products<00:01:47.290> working<00:01:48.909> kind<00:01:49.909> of

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
individual products working kind of

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.230 
individual products working kind of
always<00:01:50.510> start<00:01:51.350> with<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.470> sponge<00:01:52.810> again<00:01:53.810> soft

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
always start with a sponge again soft

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.700 
always start with a sponge again soft
more<00:01:56.240> rough<00:01:56.450> side<00:01:56.690> trying<00:01:56.990> use<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.290> soft<00:01:57.530> white

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
more rough side trying use of soft white

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.219 
more rough side trying use of soft white
side<00:02:01.420> simply<00:02:02.420> go<00:02:02.570> over<00:02:02.600> none<00:02:02.840> on<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.049> would

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
side simply go over none on you would

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.440 
side simply go over none on you would
usually<00:02:03.890> gets<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.490> softer<00:02:05.150> I'll<00:02:05.270> be

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
usually gets of the softer I'll be

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.740 
usually gets of the softer I'll be
better<00:02:06.350> when<00:02:06.620> you<00:02:06.799> use<00:02:08.679> what<00:02:09.679> is<00:02:09.799> half<00:02:10.039> empty

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
better when you use what is half empty

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.460 
better when you use what is half empty
well<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:13.010> next<00:02:13.190> one<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.640> magnet<00:02:14.060> I

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
well the next one is the magnet I

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.960 
well the next one is the magnet I
forgave<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.680> soft<00:02:15.950> side<00:02:16.129> on<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.340> outside<00:02:16.700> and

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
forgave the soft side on the outside and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.230 
forgave the soft side on the outside and
in<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.120> rough<00:02:17.330> side<00:02:17.599> on<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.319> inside

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
in the rough side on the inside

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.080 
in the rough side on the inside
three<00:02:19.570> fish<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:22.380> move<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.530> around<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.890> bit
