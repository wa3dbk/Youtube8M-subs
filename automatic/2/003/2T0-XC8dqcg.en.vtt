00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
the ball back to the offense quickly

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.720 
the ball back to the offense quickly
because<00:04:11.120> we<00:04:11.240> had<00:04:11.420> them<00:04:11.540> on<00:04:11.660> their<00:04:11.840> heels<00:04:12.080> and

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
because we had them on their heels and

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.890 
because we had them on their heels and
you<00:04:13.730> know<00:04:13.820> we<00:04:13.940> did<00:04:14.060> we<00:04:14.180> played<00:04:14.390> very<00:04:14.420> well<00:04:14.720> that

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
you know we did we played very well that

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.690 
you know we did we played very well that
first<00:04:15.140> quarter<00:04:15.410> things<00:04:16.250> kind<00:04:16.459> of<00:04:16.489> slow<00:04:16.670> down

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
first quarter things kind of slow down

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.270 
first quarter things kind of slow down
under<00:04:17.030> seven<00:04:17.330> yeah<00:04:17.480> yeah<00:04:18.470> third<00:04:18.769> quarter<00:04:19.130> was

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
under seven yeah yeah third quarter was

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.020

bad<00:04:19.489> we<00:04:19.760> came<00:04:19.970> out<00:04:20.180> very<00:04:20.780> lackluster<00:04:21.940> put<00:04:22.940> the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
bad we came out very lackluster put the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.460 
bad we came out very lackluster put the
defense<00:04:23.360> in<00:04:23.480> a<00:04:23.540> tough<00:04:23.720> situation<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.290> then

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
defense in a tough situation and then

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.900 
defense in a tough situation and then
they<00:04:24.590> they<00:04:24.800> they<00:04:24.980> got<00:04:25.220> back<00:04:25.610> in<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.820> game

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
they they they got back in the game

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.120 
they they they got back in the game
because<00:04:26.510> of<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.440> created<00:04:28.040> some

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
because of that and it created some

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.190 
because of that and it created some
tense<00:04:28.490> moments<00:04:28.610> but<00:04:29.180> that's<00:04:29.360> that's<00:04:29.840> probably

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
tense moments but that's that's probably

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.600 
tense moments but that's that's probably
a<00:04:30.290> good<00:04:30.350> thing<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.980> put<00:04:31.130> us<00:04:31.220> in<00:04:31.370> some

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610
