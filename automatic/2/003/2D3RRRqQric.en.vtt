00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 it remains loved second but second gauge 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.160
 had already done pekin so that was it 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.929
 following his first games so no this 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.210
 that I remember especially it's my medal 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.160
 necessarily the success of swimming in 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.509
 general because that's it 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.670
 many years now that we 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.699
 trying competition after competition 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.869
 to hold the international level by 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.840
 report to other nations so there 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.609
 really we did really good 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.260
 results across the team and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.050
 that's really what I'll remember 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.000
 of sejna and and this is the first time 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.370
 I was here I was young it was my 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.739
 first my first team since I 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.329
 do all the teams all here at 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.219
 every time every summer every 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.020
 winters and suddenly it goes away with a 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.270
 medal this is an evolution by 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.410
 compared to what I had done at 80 it's 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.700
 true that once on site we are a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.050
 little bit in a bubble one enters 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.520
 athletes there are a lot of medals 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.620
 of time all the countries so we surrender 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.030
 not really count of what we do 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.250
 what we realize and that by returning that we 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.559
 saw the impact already by going down the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.570
 fields and then that's after we get into 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.940
 their self family name really one 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.159
 relishing this even had medals 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.960
 not fully but I think it's 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.439
 rather it comes rewarding years 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.750
 working 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.010
 after we know that all manner of month 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.540
 September the counters are reset to zero 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.090
 that everyone goes back on a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.970
 new qual so m serves mostly to me 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.409
 to say that this is what I finally have 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.090
 trust in what I'm capable of 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.680
 do and what I realized during 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.619
 previous years 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.790
 but here after the competition remains the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.020
 competition there are young people who 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.479
 arrive who have long teeth and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.870
 What he also comes back 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.310
 the goal is 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.970
 now I do not know anymore to see him in 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.090
 term of years the years follow each other and 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.250
 I think maybe brio online from 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.210
 test to finish but in any case 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.750
 I try to take years each 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.710
 after others 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.300
 it's true that I really wanted 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.890
 enjoy this post-Olympic year 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.780
 for 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.060
 devoted a little bit to my studies for 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.070
 change it a little bit of life 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.420
 to blow a little bit about 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.290
 the last eight years we've been 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.880
 quite intensive in terms 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.030
 training and in terms of commitment 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.350
 everyday and 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.350
 and that's it and then lille because it's 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.250
 a city that offers lessons 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.259
 accordingly and in addition 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.060
 it was not very far from Amiens where I 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.100
 was training before and then I had 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.750
 had good echoes about on the city in 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.000
 herself on the coach on the group 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.320
 so that was it and then the fact that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.630
 precisely there is not a group of high 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.030
 level it also allowed me to be here 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.470
 two to be more comfortable in in a 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.200
 group and maybe have less of 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.400
 pressure and be more than would actually 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.300
 I am two days at school 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.880
 so it's in a school of 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.350
 communication so in 3rd grade as 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.180
 I just had 100 years ago 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.580
 of history will be mine and perpignan 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.739
 before so two days ago at 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.640
 school years and 3 days in business 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.480
 from an already point of view the city really 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.270
 never had the blows it's really a 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.510
 very nice city people are nice 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.459
 are now welcoming after in 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.620
 sports complex term chance that 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.140
 this is a city a big city 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.390
 Lille there is an olympic pool so 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.500
 it was really good there are good 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.050
 training conditions everyone 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.480
 is motivated after it's true that in term 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.730
 of there is the structure is there but we 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.110
 still missing some conditions 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.150
 to really be able to do the top 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.260
 high level level here I think that 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.820
 really we could afford 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.110
 here is to have better conditions 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.750
 for the group because we have a big 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.060
 group launches with big of 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.430
 big ambitions there is a 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.780
 a real student city here so I 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.190
 say for sportsmen who want 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.390
 pursue studies and who would like 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.790
 to train I think there is really 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.520
 way to have a nice project to 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.360
 rooms what's the club is enough 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.190
 new but in any case they have 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.750
 ambition to progress and I hope that 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.760
 the less we come here I can bring 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.769
 maybe this extra trust 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.300
 to allow the club to 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.709
 benefit and other swimmers from 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.120
 benefit from a condition 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.540
 higher than you can 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.540
 have for now
