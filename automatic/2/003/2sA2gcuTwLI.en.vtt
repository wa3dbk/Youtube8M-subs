who we think is coming you know average
can<00:02:28.090> go<00:02:28.210> from<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.620> know<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.770> linebacker<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.700> a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
can go from you know a linebacker to a

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.640 
can go from you know a linebacker to a
safety<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.510> corner<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.170> know<00:02:32.290> we've<00:02:32.440> got<00:02:32.500> to

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
safety to a corner you know we've got to

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.550 
safety to a corner you know we've got to
look<00:02:33.280> out<00:02:33.370> for<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.610> lot<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.760> people<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.240> so<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
look out for a lot of people and so the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.720 
look out for a lot of people and so the
offense<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.890> like<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.160> move<00:02:36.280> around<00:02:36.400> and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
offense is like to move around and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.610 
offense is like to move around and
confuse<00:02:37.060> us<00:02:37.180> as<00:02:37.330> well<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.660> as<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> little

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
confuse us as well and as a little

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.620

much grander had the cover and you know

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.180 
much grander had the cover and you know
as<00:04:16.870> soon<00:04:16.930> as<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:17.139> turned<00:04:17.350> up<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.739> was<00:04:17.829> just<00:04:18.040> you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190

we<00:04:20.049> had<00:04:20.620> planned<00:04:20.799> was<00:04:21.400> obviously<00:04:22.060> at<00:04:22.210> the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
we had planned was obviously at the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.490 
we had planned was obviously at the
window<00:04:22.540> because<00:04:22.600> we<00:04:22.780> didn't<00:04:22.930> expect<00:04:23.169> him<00:04:23.320> to

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
window because we didn't expect him to

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.560 
window because we didn't expect him to
get<00:04:23.710> that<00:04:23.770> fire<00:04:24.040> and<00:04:24.220> heat<00:04:24.699> it<00:04:24.729> sweet<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.449> know

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.030 
get that fire and heat it sweet you know
it's<00:04:25.690> not<00:04:26.020> too<00:04:26.139> many<00:04:26.320> boys<00:04:26.440> I've<00:04:26.620> seen<00:04:26.800> kick

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
it's not too many boys I've seen kick

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.129 
it's not too many boys I've seen kick
like<00:04:27.220> that<00:04:27.250> or<00:04:27.520> caught<00:04:27.760> like<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:27.940> where<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
like that or caught like that where the

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.779 
like that or caught like that where the
balls<00:04:29.350> just<00:04:29.530> had<00:04:30.010> been<00:04:30.190> hit<00:04:30.340> sweet<00:04:30.669> the

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
balls just had been hit sweet the

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.969 
balls just had been hit sweet the
rotation<00:04:31.180> of<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.330> ball<00:04:31.449> was<00:04:31.630> crazy<00:04:31.979> obviously

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
rotation of the ball was crazy obviously

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.879 
rotation of the ball was crazy obviously
if<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.400> touches<00:04:34.330> you're<00:04:34.510> here<00:04:34.630> it's<00:04:35.289> like<00:04:35.620> all

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
if you touches you're here it's like all

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.390 
if you touches you're here it's like all
the<00:04:36.130> other<00:04:36.490> consider<00:04:37.060> just<00:04:37.419> letting<00:04:38.169> it<00:04:38.260> go

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
the other consider just letting it go

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.500 
the other consider just letting it go
not<00:04:39.400> because<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.669> thought<00:04:40.030> that's<00:04:40.270> going<00:04:40.449> to

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
not because I thought that's going to

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.420 
not because I thought that's going to
head<00:04:40.660> towards<00:04:40.990> that<00:04:41.110> end<00:04:41.260> zone<00:04:41.410> so<00:04:41.860> if<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.280> was

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
head towards that end zone so if I was

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.100 
head towards that end zone so if I was
going<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.580> if<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:43.150> was<00:04:43.240> going<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.449> drop<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.840> would

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
going to if I was going to drop it would

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.820 
going to if I was going to drop it would
have<00:04:44.199> went<00:04:44.289> back<00:04:44.530> there<00:04:44.680> anyway<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:47.710> know

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
have went back there anyway and you know

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.820 
have went back there anyway and you know
I<00:04:47.860> felt<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:48.400> would<00:04:48.910> have<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.389> lot<00:04:49.539> of<00:04:49.570> momentum<00:04:50.410> so

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
I felt I would have a lot of momentum so

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.370 
I felt I would have a lot of momentum so
if<00:04:50.979> I<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.160> if<00:04:51.699> I<00:04:51.850> don't<00:04:52.000> call<00:04:52.180> it<00:04:52.240> clean<00:04:52.600> you

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
if I to if I don't call it clean you

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.110 
if I to if I don't call it clean you
know<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.860> kind<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.400> thought<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:54.639> it<00:04:55.000> would<00:04:55.060> be

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
know I kind of thought that it would be

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.670 
know I kind of thought that it would be
you<00:04:55.510> know<00:04:55.600> within<00:04:55.840> an<00:04:56.050> area<00:04:56.229> that<00:04:56.380> I'd<00:04:56.590> still

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
you know within an area that I'd still

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.850 
you know within an area that I'd still

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.410 

um<00:05:23.830> quite<00:05:24.830> low<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.580> know<00:05:25.730> I<00:05:26.000> think<00:05:26.120> it's<00:05:26.300> a<00:05:26.330> bit

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
um quite low you know I think it's a bit

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.820 
um quite low you know I think it's a bit
more<00:05:26.540> jaded<00:05:26.780> especially<00:05:27.320> with<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.500> returns

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
more jaded especially with the returns

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.310 
more jaded especially with the returns
because<00:05:28.480> they're<00:05:29.480> still<00:05:29.660> kind<00:05:29.870> of<00:05:29.900> scattered

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
because they're still kind of scattered

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.640
