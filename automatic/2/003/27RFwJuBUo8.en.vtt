a<00:00:06.450> video<00:00:06.569> through<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.930> coast<00:00:07.259> where<00:00:07.500> we<00:00:07.529> had<00:00:07.770> a

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
a video through the coast where we had a

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.620 
a video through the coast where we had a
clip<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.250> driver<00:00:08.519> passing<00:00:09.030> me<00:00:09.150> as<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.389> made<00:00:09.599> my

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
clip of a driver passing me as I made my

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.570 
clip of a driver passing me as I made my
way<00:00:09.809> through<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.260> roundabout<00:00:10.590> that'd<00:00:11.550> be

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
way through the roundabout that'd be

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.270 
way through the roundabout that'd be
this<00:00:11.849> guy<00:00:12.000> right<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:12.380> now<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.590> felt<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.160> this

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
this guy right here now I felt that this

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.519 
this guy right here now I felt that this
driver<00:00:14.610> had<00:00:14.849> cut<00:00:15.120> me<00:00:15.240> off<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:16.170> gave<00:00:16.289> him<00:00:16.470> a

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
driver had cut me off so we gave him a

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.220 
driver had cut me off so we gave him a
different<00:00:16.710> label<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.310> video<00:00:18.050> well<00:00:19.050> we

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
different label in the video well we

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.349 
different label in the video well we
thought<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.560> was<00:00:19.650> funny<00:00:19.800> at<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:19.980> time<00:00:20.180> well<00:00:21.180> as

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
thought it was funny at the time well as

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.210 
thought it was funny at the time well as
it<00:00:21.480> turns<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:21.930> driver<00:00:22.350> actually<00:00:22.859> saw

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
it turns out that driver actually saw

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.009 
it turns out that driver actually saw
the<00:00:23.279> video<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.820> after<00:00:24.210> recognizing<00:00:24.930> his

take now the question is who was using

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.840 
take now the question is who was using
the<00:01:21.050> roundabout<00:01:21.440> correctly<00:01:22.009> I<00:01:22.220> wanted

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
the roundabout correctly I wanted

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.430 
the roundabout correctly I wanted
someone<00:01:23.060> official<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.570> judge<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.229> sent

with an interactive diagram what I found
most<00:01:42.110> useful<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.770> understanding<00:01:43.310> how<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.490> use

a<00:01:43.759> roundabout<00:01:44.119> was<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:45.080> diagram<00:01:45.649> here<00:01:45.950> it

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
a roundabout was this diagram here it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.359 
a roundabout was this diagram here it
basically<00:01:46.820> says<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:48.380> turn<00:01:48.530> right<00:01:48.800> you

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
basically says this to turn right you

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.029 
basically says this to turn right you
use<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.729> outside<00:01:50.090> lane<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.869> turn<00:01:51.080> left<00:01:51.410> you

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
use the outside lane to turn left you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.639 
use the outside lane to turn left you
use<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.550> inside<00:01:52.940> lane<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.990> go<00:01:54.110> straight<00:01:54.380> you

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
use the inside lane to go straight you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.219 
use the inside lane to go straight you
can<00:01:54.800> use<00:01:54.950> either<00:01:55.100> lane<00:01:55.990> according<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.080> these

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
can use either lane according to these

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.260 
can use either lane according to these
rules<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:57.740> was<00:01:58.280> clearly<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.789> wrong<00:01:58.910> I

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
street problem solved right well not

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.240

really<00:02:10.930> first<00:02:11.930> off<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.620> roundabout<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.160> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
really first off the roundabout of the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.820 
really first off the roundabout of the
curricula<00:02:13.580> street<00:02:13.850> looks<00:02:14.060> more<00:02:14.420> like<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:15.560> as

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
curricula street looks more like this as

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.610 
curricula street looks more like this as
it<00:02:16.670> turns<00:02:16.850> out<00:02:17.090> not<00:02:17.720> all<00:02:17.780> roundabouts<00:02:18.500> are

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
it turns out not all roundabouts are

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.170 
it turns out not all roundabouts are
created<00:02:18.950> equal<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.520> this<00:02:19.760> one<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.060> particular

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
created equal and this one in particular

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.449 
created equal and this one in particular
has<00:02:20.780> two<00:02:21.080> lanes<00:02:21.319> of<00:02:21.410> traffic<00:02:21.470> on<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.340> the

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
has two lanes of traffic on just the

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.190 
has two lanes of traffic on just the
northeast<00:02:22.880> side<00:02:23.000> if<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.900> look<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.080> little

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
northeast side if you look a little

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.140 
northeast side if you look a little
closer<00:02:24.530> you'll<00:02:25.100> also<00:02:25.430> notice<00:02:25.819> that<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
closer you'll also notice that the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.570 
closer you'll also notice that the
inside<00:02:26.540> lane<00:02:26.780> here<00:02:27.050> is<00:02:27.740> only<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.100> left<00:02:28.370> turn

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
inside lane here is only a left turn

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.000 
inside lane here is only a left turn
lane<00:02:28.850> so<00:02:29.480> what<00:02:29.599> does<00:02:29.660> that<00:02:29.720> all<00:02:29.870> mean<00:02:30.020> well<00:02:30.349> I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
lane so what does that all mean well I

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.410 
lane so what does that all mean well I
still<00:02:31.370> shouldn't<00:02:31.610> have<00:02:31.730> been<00:02:31.880> on<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.090> outside

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
still shouldn't have been on the outside

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.780 
still shouldn't have been on the outside
lane<00:02:32.690> if<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.990> was<00:02:33.140> turning<00:02:33.410> left<00:02:33.709> but<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
lane if I was turning left but the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.100 
lane if I was turning left but the
driver<00:02:35.060> also<00:02:35.360> shouldn't<00:02:35.660> have<00:02:35.840> been<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:35.990> the

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
driver also shouldn't have been in the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.720 
driver also shouldn't have been in the
inside<00:02:36.530> lane<00:02:36.560> if<00:02:36.920> he<00:02:37.069> was<00:02:37.190> going<00:02:37.340> straight

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
inside lane if he was going straight

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.089 
inside lane if he was going straight
through<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:38.209> agricola<00:02:38.660> street<00:02:38.990> here's<00:02:39.920> what

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
through to agricola street here's what

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:47.100 
through to agricola street here's what
should<00:02:40.280> have<00:02:40.370> happened

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.740 

so<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.140> guess<00:02:48.379> we're<00:02:48.590> both<00:02:49.040> wrong<00:02:49.459> I<00:02:49.970> gotta<00:02:50.629> be

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
so I guess we're both wrong I gotta be

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.390 
so I guess we're both wrong I gotta be
honest<00:02:50.989> with<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.230> I'm<00:02:51.500> not<00:02:51.920> sure<00:02:52.129> if<00:02:52.250> there

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
honest with you I'm not sure if there

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.220 
honest with you I'm not sure if there
really<00:02:52.549> is<00:02:52.879> a<00:02:53.180> consistent<00:02:53.629> rule<00:02:54.019> for

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
really is a consistent rule for

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.229 
really is a consistent rule for
navigating<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.829> roundabout<00:02:55.159> I'm<00:02:55.909> sure<00:02:56.120> the

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
navigating a roundabout I'm sure the

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.390 
navigating a roundabout I'm sure the
city<00:02:56.450> has<00:02:56.659> its<00:02:56.810> own<00:02:56.989> reasons<00:02:57.530> for<00:02:57.650> building

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
city has its own reasons for building

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.920 
city has its own reasons for building
them<00:02:58.579> each<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:58.939> their<00:02:59.030> own<00:02:59.120> unique<00:02:59.299> way<00:02:59.629> but

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
them each in their own unique way but

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.170 
them each in their own unique way but
for<00:03:00.140> now<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.319> can<00:03:00.500> only<00:03:00.829> recommend<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.609> you

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
just read the signs and trust me there

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.429

are<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.220> lot<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.670> signs<00:03:05.030> for<00:03:05.720> example<00:03:06.109> this<00:03:06.230> one

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
are a lot of signs for example this one

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.809 
are a lot of signs for example this one
