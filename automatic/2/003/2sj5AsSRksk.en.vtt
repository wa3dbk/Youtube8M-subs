00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.280
 nnpc our big birds 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.780
 cahors 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.710
 finals and ne-yo body 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.540
 it's really a car 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.430
 last generation in its category 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.840
 so an equivalence 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.840
 the citroÃ«n ds3 r3 maxi 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.760
 on the data sheet it's the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.050
 cars that look a lot like 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.640
 after these different 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.710
 different things different brands 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.390
 brake damper an arabic surplus 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.390
 simo turkey is really good 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.180
 but quite impressed by his 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.280
 we'll see what happens in anime but 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 we are quite confident in any case of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.979
 level of performance of the car made 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.979
 242 days 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.310
 fairly linear car that works very 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.330
 good and 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.600
 I think it can really be done 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.600
 nice group 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 10 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.330
 Yes 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.770
 m 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Oh 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.310
 at m 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.040
 or 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.159
 he 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.810
 1 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.640
 1 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.250
 but 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.250
 Yes 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.440
 so when one his first and it's not 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.200
 bad it's been going well since this morning 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.610
 we did a lot of kilometers 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.500
 we can sweep a lot of 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.490
 things wrong step and we get everything 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.100
 the game 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.780
 rather pretty much tried two 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.670
 tires too 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.950
 range 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.150
 his wide good 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.540
 the choice of tires we tried a lot 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.200
 things are going pretty well that's 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.069
 really happy with them 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.460
 you find in the key today 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.350
 co-pilot then 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.350
 his impressions well 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.310
 we have these disputes last it happens 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.700
 well 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.700
 so 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.700
 she has not rolled this clio yet 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.750
 rally she drove to 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.750
 some customers but not 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.300
 and 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:33.690
 this new clio that good actually 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:37.449
 a good test session before the rally 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.880
 appropriate settings to face the base 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.400
 and is very similar to the rally so I 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.990
 think it should be fine 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.479
 found good settings the set up and not 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.479
 bad now to see friday
