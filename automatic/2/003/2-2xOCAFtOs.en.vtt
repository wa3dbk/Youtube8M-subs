00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.690
 let's start from a design already created that 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.580
 involves besides him from real estate that 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.890
 we are also dealing with a net 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.910
 bordering a shared wall between the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:28.220
 two units we design the compartment 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:31.599
 the neighboring building we do one 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.599
 copy of this wall 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:43.310
 we select the base point and hypothesize 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.020
 then the compartment is three meters long 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.710
 we press on the keyboard 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.350
 the arrow on the left type the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.350
 value 3 and wish 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.400
 in this way we have created one 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:06.280
 part of the room we are now going to 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:10.060
 complete by extending the upper wall 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.060
 and the lower one 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.110
 we create the compartment inside the unit 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.110
 adjoining 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.860
 we activate area management 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.910
 within zone management we find 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.620
 neighboring real estate unit 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.620
 containing the heated thermal zone 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.300
 click on the assigned button 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:14.090
 select the neighboring unit e 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:16.970
 we click ok to confirm what has 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.280
 learned in this video has acquired the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.250
 skills needed to deal with 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.090
 correctly the neighboring units looks 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.090
