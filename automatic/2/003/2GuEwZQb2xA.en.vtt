00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.810
 instead of practicing 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:10.219
 self-welding of the outer sidewall 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:13.700
 I had to deal with a back straightening 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:17.630
 that is, you had to stretch the metal 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.390
 internal and rear wheel splash guard 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.289
 since here was a fold well 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.609
 almost all the metal I put on 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.219
 place with a reverse hammer 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.090
 maybe the design here is leveling 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:41.070
 clamp to the rod and the tray itself tray 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:44.570
 probably two kilograms of welding 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.450
 we will burn about pardon leveling clip was 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.110
 fixed here in about this place 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:56.100
 then the metal hammer is almost safe 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.930
 all sorts of understand into place but 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.949
 I fixed the rest of the dent 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.590
 sugary hammer well feel that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.570
 metal a little bit not reaching here 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.970
 millimeters by 5 but it doesn't have 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.560
 crucial 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.189
 because here will be bringing new 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.540
 detail and she will compensate 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:24.540
 difference in size further 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.090
 almost completely adjusted the rate 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.540
 right stand here you can see how she 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.320
 fits with the old and new metal but 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.540
 almost no cracks they easily converge 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.540
 no problems with welding dislikes 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.700
 so it remains to do the inner 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.800
 bukovina prepare it for welding that is 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.600
 remove shipping soil make 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.070
 a system of primer and paint 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.420
 make a hole for welding lecturer 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.920
 rivet and it will need to be welded and 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.920
 then it will be possible to weld and 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:12.800
 external bukovina here it is held on 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:16.640
 welding clamp since I've already a hundred times 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:21.019
 showed outdoor bukovin previous 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.300
 series will not show it entirely 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.420
 I can only say that it was applied 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.390
 loud from the outside 2 ground 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.230
 office and acrylic as well on the inside 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.989
 parties 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:40.100
 in addition to the primer paint was applied 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:43.010
 here at the junction of old and new parts 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:48.590
 VTEK important on the part of the new parts 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:51.160
 was applied zinc primer for welding from 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.160
 corrosion 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.769
 that's about it 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.769
 present moment
