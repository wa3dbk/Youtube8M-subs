00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.659
 0 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.650
 yes 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.280
 yes 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.650
 how I like the music of the nba 2k 13 and 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.090
 here we are again with chris bailey 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.580
 hello, I'm chris, it's worth it 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.810
 I forgot and it's a new chapter a 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.150
 chapter a bit weird is a chapter 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.120
 complain 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.160
 towards the coach a very chapter 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.340
 I miss first 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.640
 and put the shooting guard holder 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.250
 just but something like that the number zero of the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.380
 Boston Celtics 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.130
 I do not know what he has done if he has less 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.810
 minutes of the game that I created bale I do not know 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.909
 what he's done to be a starter is something 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.999
 that I have not understood having them 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.079
 like more minutes crisis bale is 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:32.060
 having many more minutes and spent in 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.819
 this match also weird things here I 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.729
 You see escorting something as something 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.619
 normal for which base base game can I 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.060
 be an escort but you will see in what 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.209
 positions puts me along the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.429
 match are very rare things that I 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:49.130
 he did in this game but it's something 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.899
 rare and sometimes makes you go down a 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.040
 little statistics because for example 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.550
 then you will see it 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.350
 he made me play with a power forward wing and 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.970
 forward to a good but power forward 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.200
 How can a power forward base play? 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.350
 defending a player who measures more 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.539
 that he and he is going to play in the post that 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.970
 the player does not know how to play in the post nor 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.580
 playing or defending costs more to defend 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.489
 the post are things that those the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.850
 I should know them and I do not know 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:26.650
 why not 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.810
 did not take them into account and well so 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.960
 unless you will see the final result of 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.960
 party that is not bad but 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.120
 I do not know I thought it was very strange that there 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.620
 that there were those changes of positions 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.010
 I think I went through all but that of 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.560
 pivot that I went through all the positions 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.080
 and well I still did not do it was not a match 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.810
 stellar I did not make many points or much 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.150
 attendance of many rebounds more than 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.599
 nothing because as you see game matches 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.330
 of 5 minutes every quarter if they played the 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.030
 matches 12 minutes each quarter 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.040
 the statistics would be lengthened as in 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.480
 many places where you can see them 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.430
 you can lengthen or yourself 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.489
 when you play if you play games of 12 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.920
 minutes as the statistics lengthen 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.019
 an absolute barbarity you have many 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.540
 more shots during the game you have a 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.590
 lots of occasions to be able to steal more 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.129
 times because they are more minutes on track 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.810
 and that comes for good and bad for 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.849
 bad because you can miss all the shots 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.710
 you can make many mistakes and eliminate you 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.690
 et cetera etcetera but always 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.550
 if you play more minutes the 12 minutes 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.950
 Well, I'm going to 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.590
 if you play the 12 minutes then there's more 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.990
 possibilities that 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.850
 that you make better statistics 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.350
 I'm not complaining about anything could 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.140
 make better statistics with chris 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.600
 bell no I do not doubt it but there was already some 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.120
 comment saying that because I 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.770
 I was glad that in a party I made three 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.340
 or four assists 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.640
 and it was crap that for him many 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.010
 assists were ten or something like that is that 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.170
 clear if I play 12 minutes 3 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.480
 assists is crap like that game 12 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.510
 minutes every quarter but if I play in 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.620
 total 11 minutes that is less than what 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.660
 lasts a quarter of playing 12 minutes 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.870
 then there the thing changes 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.200
 if you play more minutes then you will have to 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.810
 get more of the bigger goals and 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.360
 Now you put 8 points in 11 minutes as 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.460
 it seems pretty good to me if you put 11 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.800
 points in 40 minutes 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.280
 if you are the unquestionable holder of the kobe 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.380
 bryant me because I seem somewhat 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.520
 shit because you can surely 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.200
 you have thrown 40 shots other than 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:55.350
 also from a comment that said what 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.910
 that I threw everything I do not know what and for the 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.310
 shooting percentage do not notice the 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.580
 shooting percentage to assess what is 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.570
 that's all thrown away and if it does not happen if I do not know 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:11.009
 that you can have 20% and throw three 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:13.979
 times or four times and put a basket 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.279
 you can not guide for that if you do not know the 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.949
 final statistics because if you do not know 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:23.099
 now you can know if you see if with the 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.619
 nba 2k dotcom you can see compare 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:29.069
 with me and see the latest statistics 

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:30.899
 what have you done then good there if you 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.480
 you can see that I do not know if you can see if 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:34.820
 he taught me 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.910
 and now you can say look here you are shooting 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.250
 20 shots and put two here I do not know what 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:44.129
 but if I throw four shots and have 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.379
 20% this someone tells me 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:50.399
 it's because a pacifier happens more and it does not 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:51.659
 see normal if you play 12 minutes then 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:55.199
 there I would change the thing because I would have 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:58.349
 shoot 40 shots and I would have got 25 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.050
 example then there changes the thing and good 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.759
 it was more, that was a little bit the 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.550
 chapter is to complain about the coach 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:08.639
 change of position is a bit strange 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.529
 changes of positions and I also 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:15.059
 complain a little bit of those comments 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:17.519
 why because you're glad you have 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:20.309
 put you have given few 

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:22.169
 assists and three are shit if you do not 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:25.319
 you really know the minutes that I have 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.089
 played everything you've seen the whole game 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.249
 the baskets you tossed and so on 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:30.689
 etcetera etcetera I do not think I do not know 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:32.459
 you can evaluate you can not evaluate to 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.649
 someone if you do not really know everything 

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:37.679
 what have you done or anything if I put all the 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:39.300
 match clearly then there you can see 

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:42.269
 what it has done and what it is that 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.069
 no and well I do not want to extend much more 

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:45.300
 the video I hope you liked the 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.459
 like and favorites if you want more
