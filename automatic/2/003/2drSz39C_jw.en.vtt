going through a lot of changes swapped

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.400 
going through a lot of changes swapped
out<00:00:22.380> our<00:00:22.529> normal<00:00:22.890> table<00:00:23.750> for<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.869> long<00:00:25.170> run

first<00:04:45.190> episode<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:47.050> get<00:04:47.169> ideas<00:04:47.320> of<00:04:47.590> what<00:04:47.949> basis

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
first episode to get ideas of what basis

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.800 
first episode to get ideas of what basis
should<00:04:48.400> look<00:04:48.699> like<00:04:48.729> what<00:04:49.120> kind<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.360> building

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
should look like what kind of building

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.159 
should look like what kind of building
if<00:04:49.930> they<00:04:49.960> should<00:04:50.139> have<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:51.750> so<00:04:52.750> there's<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:53.020> lot

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
if they should have and so there's a lot

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.040 
if they should have and so there's a lot
of<00:04:53.260> storage<00:04:53.470> there's<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:53.919> fuel<00:04:54.190> area<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.930> know

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
of storage there's a fuel area you know

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.370 
of storage there's a fuel area you know
there's<00:04:56.350> a<00:04:56.410> hospital<00:04:57.870> destroyed<00:04:58.870> buildings

movie sets sometimes there's a clash of
the<00:05:10.330> scales<00:05:10.919> but<00:05:11.919> I<00:05:12.220> work<00:05:12.490> really<00:05:12.729> hard<00:05:12.850> to<00:05:13.330> try

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
the scales but I work really hard to try

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.890 
the scales but I work really hard to try
and<00:05:14.500> make<00:05:14.800> it<00:05:15.639> as<00:05:15.910> good<00:05:16.120> as<00:05:16.240> I<00:05:16.330> can<00:05:16.360> I<00:05:16.630> try<00:05:16.720> and

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
and make it as good as I can I try and

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.540 
and make it as good as I can I try and
use<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.139> Micro<00:05:17.410> Machines<00:05:17.530> whenever<00:05:18.160> I<00:05:18.250> can

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
use the Micro Machines whenever I can

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.730 
use the Micro Machines whenever I can
because<00:05:18.789> they<00:05:19.150> look<00:05:19.900> pretty<00:05:20.110> good<00:05:20.320> up<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.650> the

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
because they look pretty good up to the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.820
