00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.080
 no longer 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.969
 the triumph 1800 roadster from the years 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.430
 1947 is a very special representative 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.110
 this extinct genus owner 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:43.600
 peter ihle on the most important eckdaten 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:45.310
 his rare open British the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.950
 Englishman looks like a car from the 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.900
 30s much chrome detached 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.610
 Lamp heads bulbous mudguards 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.760
 swelling shapes wherever you look 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.410
 The tr was in 1803 for the first time 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.270
 new construction after the second 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.350
 world war hard to believe in the 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.350
 antiquated look 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.840
 especially in the typical shade gun metal 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.850
 Gray sees the rounded right-hand drive 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.340
 like a bentley washed out too hot 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.990
 the proportions of the four meter 20 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.530
 long roadsters are tuning in the back and 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.510
 not at the front 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.190
 especially in the back the tail is the 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.190
 designers simply advised too clunky 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.429
 on the inside, the mixture is the right one 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.109
 crime control offers full leather and wood 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.390
 and proves again that it was earlier 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.539
 without the massive use of plastic 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.539
 went 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.670
 The right-hand drive shows plenty of his 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.590
 playful details and offers on the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.490
 through bench to the emergency also three 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.490
 passenger space 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.060
 under his two-piece bonnet 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.549
 makes the solid gray cast iron 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.310
 four-cylinder with 1.8 liter displacement and 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.820
 a performance of loud factory 65 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.820
 ps ready 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.030
 a solex carburetor supplies the so far 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.759
 only a little run long 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.340
 mitgemischt 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.890
 not only the small quantity of 4500 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.780
 Exemplary raises the price above all the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.310
 Mother in law seat with hinged 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.680
 windshield makes the guilty 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.540
 english so interesting the two 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.350
 Seats are spartan but with 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:40.970
 leather covered 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:42.830
 So stylish is the motto 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.050
 nothing like in the parlor and 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.260
 out on the highway where the tr 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.190
 1800 roadster feels most comfortable 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.709
 closing the suicide doors with swing 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.800
 Press ignition on start button and off the 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.800
 post Office 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.640
 no question this car steals everyone 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.440
 publishers the show provided the two 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.390
 places in the rear passenger compartment 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.370
 are also occupied but had so far 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.410
 Owner Peter Elo not the least 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.570
 enthusiastic with driver for a problem 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.140
 solid country part in his triumph 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.140
 to find 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.730
 thanks to the big two-part writing 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.650
 enjoy not only children but also 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.950
 adult proper protection from the 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.950
 airstream 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.020
 in contrast to his successors tr 2 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.849
 the tr 6 is the tea 1800 no 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.130
 sports car but rather the 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.050
 cozy tour is his domain 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.959
 clearly the cozy stroll there 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.959
 at tempo 80 on little traffic 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.959
 highways 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.370
 a sporty driving style 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.010
 anyway, the high dare weight of good 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.110
 12 tons and the spongy steering in the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.120
 way, so you leave the things easy 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.190
 his run enjoys the noble character 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.560
 of the rare Englishman and still takes 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.640
 take a deep breath spicy 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.640
 country air to itself
