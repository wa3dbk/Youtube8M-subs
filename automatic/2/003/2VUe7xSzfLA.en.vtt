00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.680
 life 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.260
 good to start the apparent 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.510
 fillings we're going to start obviously by 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.219
 what would be the internal part or the 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:17.020
 filling and we will have enough 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.150
 complete a goal with vegetables 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.730
 to pancho like proteins and a lot of 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.610
 more good things if we can show that 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.430
 we have onion with a spoonful of 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.000
 oil that is watering and what you 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.079
 I'm going to take out quickly add half 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.329
 red logo in there 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.519
 then we were half red we're going to 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.379
 also create a chopped tomato as 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.420
 I have two but only one goes to 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.969
 this recipe and we're going to do it as a 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.390
 small salsita previously speaking 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:52.189
 then there we move well we have this 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.449
 onion cuts a chopped tomato there 

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:55.609
 we are then with many rhythms 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.439
 money now thing that shortly to 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.899
 through a system that hears in the 

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:02.839
 radial program of my ex-friend deniece 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.369
 Well then go many 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:14.840
 drivers this program 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:21.310
 He is also a specialist in life at 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:23.409
 sauce lady sir a greeting to which 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.399
 we have 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.799
 this is the presentation of what 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.630
 there is always slowly and what we are going to 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.610
 do now add three steps to 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.380
 calculate or a pancho for each zucchini 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.780
 then in this case do three 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.140
 little shoes go three chopped panchos there 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.600
 inside 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.610
 if you out there they did panchos 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.770
 served the day before and left them 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.869
 can take advantage of this recipe without 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.740
 problems mix well this we are going to 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.420
 leave pressing a little bit more 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.229
 I have three shoes, I have to be 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.210
 all right 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.970
 add a little salt of water to the water 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.880
 with salt 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.930
 and let's go with the shoes 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.610
 trunk zucchini in this case if 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.170
 when they go to buy the ducklings there 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.160
 meet those who are very young because 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.290
 are more or less medium the hand would be 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.790
 in the ideal measure one would be a portion 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.160
 what I'm going to do is cut the middle 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.320
 wash well first brush obviously 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.170
 let's cut the middle I 'm going to give 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.720
 this a cooking in water with more salt or 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.800
 less for 10 minutes and then once 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.930
 that is well cooked what we are going to 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.510
 to make it with a spoon to remove the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.299
 seeds are already going straight to the water 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.370
 then to bring the horses things 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.980
 little ones go to the water 10 minutes 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.750
 cooking we turn off this and on the other hand the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.939
 sauce is still being made and we're going to 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.709
 Finish this sauce by adding the 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.989
 flavors in this case we're going to have 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.180
 parsley dance half a teaspoon of 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.739
 half tablespoon parsley parsley let 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.750
 to add a very large spoonful of 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.849
 rico and antonio verdÃº not in this case 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.379
 do not do and jarryd bayless a spoonful 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.349
 well big of ricotta to give you more 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.780
 consistency to the preparation and 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.730
 obviously you can not miss pepper 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.250
 scoop i love all the smart 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.409
 flavors so then there's good 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.930
 pepper and obviously a little touch of 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.450
 dry oregano also of scoop and good 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.010
 while you cook zucchini 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.959
 I'm going to cook two or three minutes more than 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.549
 you have this list well so they will stay 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.530
 the zucchini once they are 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.180
 served 10 minutes after cooking 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.950
 they will stay like this and then what 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.620
 have to do you are simply with 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.959
 a spoon go finishing a little bit there 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.620
 I do not know if it is not running out and we 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.310
 to remove the seeds there then 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.590
 we scrape this well 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.750
 and then we remove we take out all the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.940
 easy enough seeds what's important not 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.830
 exceed 10 minutes of cooking 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.810
 these are already ready and after said 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.670
 I always recommend it is on a cloth 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.800
 of cotton leave these and the zucchini 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.349
 upside down so they lose all the water 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.260
 that they were acquiring now during 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.480
 cooking once it is not ready 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.410
 Well, we have some trays here 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.970
 spectacular in this case trays of 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.099
 refractory video and what are we going to do 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.980
 now it's also the filling and finish 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.000
 a little bit these zucchini that is what 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.890
 What am I going to do? I 'm going to put a little 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.140
 there I will bring tomato sauce that 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.610
 I have here I am going to move a 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.290
 little that our friends cameramen 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.510
 and what I 'm going to do is at the base of 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.459
 container place tomato sauce 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.320
 recipe that you know how to do and if not 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.479
 can buy even a can or a 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.609
 Sachet without any problem of the brand 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.830
 that you like most we put there then 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.380
 a base of tomato sauce and the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.470
 zucchini will go inside in this case 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.080
 I will present to four 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.060
 that would be two portions then there are 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.470
 four zucchini four media 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.660
 zucchini for what I had told them 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.340
 that would be two parts and good me 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.080
 I'm going to go with there because 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.340
 I have the filling but I will take advantage and 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.230
 I'm going to bring one of the condiments that 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.270
 I will be missing for the filling in this 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.040
 case I'm going to use good oregano 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.660
 here we have the filling that we had 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.250
 prepared with the panchos with the ricotta 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.380
 of parsley is ready what I'm going to 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.240
 to do is to place two more spoonfuls 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.920
 or less imagine what this is going to be 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.540
 you feel like I want churches 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.400
 prepare empanadas for example with 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.530
 he filled it yes because I did not have 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.380
 thought that we can make some empanadas 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.780
 quite rich then we download and 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.830
 obviously this like all zucchini 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.900
 filling to make it more interesting 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.210
 as a proposal what we are going to do is 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.620
 gratin today I use 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.750
 as we are with the line suddenly a 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.790
 little bit more light use I will use 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.700
 rather, I 'm kind of age 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.110
 lay people can also use a m I will use the 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.430
 normal true that also goes well with 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.140
 the people who take care of themselves according to 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.760
 he told us our otter I opened that 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.770
 tomorrow will be also and I will advance 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.300
 tomorrow we continue with the wave of plates of 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.710
 suddenly a little lighter so 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.009
 the people who are interested in not 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.409
 miss that 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:37.110
 we put in a feta of cheddar cheese and 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.550
 this I'm going to take to oven au gratin 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.960
 very hot or in the event that what 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.669
 want to be microwaves you can also 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.770
 do with such here all the food 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.110
 they are already cooked only 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.029
 gratinar finally we put together quickly 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.520
 our rice cake and buds 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:53.520
 I had promised I have two cups of rice 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.499
 boiled now they will measure it raw 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.689
 would be two cups with four cups of 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.580
 water will boil those 18 minutes and 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.169
 they have a obviously scoop-proof rice 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.309
 of the kind you want there is no 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.649
 no inconvenience in any 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:07.499
 contraindication I have a chopped tomato 

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:09.659
 a red tomato and in rojito there whole 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:11.849
 I'm going to put two tablespoons of 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.259
 cream today you can place 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.580
 half a cup of milk if they do not have 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.649
 putting on cream is also 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.990
 very well we are going to place 5 eggs 

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:21.509
 inside I will also place parsley 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.969
 chopped for the flavor hoisting there is a 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.039
 good spoonful of parsley obviously 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.289
 as I had told you can not miss 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:30.029
 the oregano of scoop there is a good 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.759
 amount of oregano that's very out 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:34.740
 which we are going to place also in the 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.110
 case of the cheese is going to go a half cup of 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.430
 grated mozzarella cheese in this case 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.090
 so that it gives you a little 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.550
 plus 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.810
 or more evenly and finally obviously 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.270
 what he had told them soya bean sprouts 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.630
 well washed cool 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.949
 they wash with a little water with some 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.900
 vinegar droplets to help 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:54.090
 disinfect better then there goes medium 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.430
 package of bean sprouts and finally 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.630
 ground pepper that can not be missing in 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.479
 all my recipes that you already know 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.820
 that is part of my personal touch salt 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.979
 fine and this easy enough I explain 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.250
 how to continue cooking there at the end 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:11.040
 I have individual molds if I want them 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.260
 make suddenly already singles portion 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.760
 to two for each person or in any case 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.650
 can choose another container of the 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.930
 nobody's line that I have here one 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.820
 family type and good I'm going to go 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.820
 mixing this cargo in the molds and going 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.680
 to oven 20 to 25 minutes and that's already 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.090
 ready and the preparation we load 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:32.660
 up to half the capacity of the mold 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.660
 and it's ready and it's 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.180
 here we have the Jews in this case type
