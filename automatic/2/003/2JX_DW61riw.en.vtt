shortcut copy that shortcut and then you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.640 
shortcut copy that shortcut and then you

now<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.849> can<00:03:12.030> close<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.269> one<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.349> can

now you can close that one and you can

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.110 
now you can close that one and you can
maximize<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.190> other<00:03:14.400> one<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.760> close<00:03:14.910> that

now<00:03:18.120> what<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.419> will<00:03:18.599> do<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.620> course<00:03:19.950> when

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
now what this will do is of course when

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.800 
now what this will do is of course when
you<00:03:20.579> start<00:03:20.819> up<00:03:20.910> your<00:03:21.000> computer<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.630> log

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
you start up your computer and you log

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.339 
you start up your computer and you log
on<00:03:22.049> those<00:03:23.040> part<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.120> program<00:03:24.329> will<00:03:25.169> open

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
on those part of that program will open

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.089 
on those part of that program will open
up<00:03:25.880> automatically<00:03:27.380> now<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.410> recommend<00:03:28.859> you

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
up automatically now I recommend you

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.680 
up automatically now I recommend you
don't<00:03:29.280> add<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.489> bunch<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:29.910> programs<00:03:30.329> depending

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
don't add a bunch of programs depending

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.020 
don't add a bunch of programs depending
on<00:03:30.989> how<00:03:31.139> fast<00:03:31.319> your<00:03:31.530> computer<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.519> the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
on how fast your computer is and the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.729 
on how fast your computer is and the
more<00:03:33.150> programs<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.810> has<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.049> load<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.260> startup

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
more programs it has to load a startup

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.569 
more programs it has to load a startup
the<00:03:35.010> longer<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:36.599> time<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.989> takes<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.349> load<00:03:37.579> and

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
the longer the time it takes to load and

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.990 
the longer the time it takes to load and
that<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.440> for<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:40.739> tutorial<00:03:40.940> thank<00:03:41.940> you

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
that is it for this tutorial thank you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.859 
that is it for this tutorial thank you
for<00:03:42.090> watching<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.930> hopefully<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.560> helped
