00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.750
 I did not know I came and president 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.780
 happened right there the girl is standing 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.940
 and I spent six and a half months 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.120
 I said harmony part president okay 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.120
 here 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.340
 the usual and potato here 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:26.150
 and we are all gathered there the call 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.450
 and that's a wonderful thing we could 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.950
 ask for this project that already right now 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.950
 is working 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.489
 because before we did not have where to take the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.100
 coffee producers had no where 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.430
 they had to sell it to the first 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.930
 bought from that I came to the grounds without 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.340
 law with nothing and now after the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.090
 factory is giving more of the same has 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.090
 changed everything 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.780
 not only the association leaves 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.410
 officer inside right now they're going to 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.670
 benefit more than 1,300 producers of 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.870
 the area the amount of this project is 27 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.330
 millions of 363 thousand pesos 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:15.370
 and here is the machinery that are used 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:18.940
 to choose the size of the coffee so much 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.580
 beta like that one that by gravity the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.160
 producer can sell his coffee according to 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.830
 quality and according to the preparation so 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.210
 you can export them directly and 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.210
 sell it also in the local market 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:39.530
 then this nursery will benefit 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.270
 in coffee breeding since the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.729
 coffee that we have here has attacked 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.880
 much the rust this coffee are three 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.110
 varieties that we have tupi or bata and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.670
 here water 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.770
 this is a coffee that is resistant to 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.200
 We are working on the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.079
 nursery for now here we have 13 thousand 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.180

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.570
 more than 20 thousand bushes to start and 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.780
 here to the future 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.539

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.150
 producers are going to bring their coffee where it goes 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.740
 to have confidence where there is security and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.830
 where there is going to be an economy 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.830
 stable 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.569
 very happy because it is a pretty step 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.940
 broad that we have already given as 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.450
