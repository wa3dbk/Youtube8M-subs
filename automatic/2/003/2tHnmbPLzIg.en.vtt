weeks<00:00:10.800> ago<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.250> i<00:00:11.309> discovered<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.849> symbols

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
weeks ago that i discovered the symbols

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.789 
weeks ago that i discovered the symbols
i<00:00:12.330> was<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.690> from<00:00:12.929> Hell<00:00:13.110> pipe<00:00:13.320> some<00:00:13.530> sticks

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
i was in it from Hell pipe some sticks

i was in it from Hell pipe some sticks
actually<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.240> simple<00:00:15.540> city<00:00:15.719> on<00:00:15.839> rock

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
actually and so the simple city on rock

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.080 
actually and so the simple city on rock
crab<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.410> Deacon<00:00:16.830> had<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> bit<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.670> plan<00:00:17.910> was

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
crab is Deacon had a bit of a plan was

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.450 
crab is Deacon had a bit of a plan was
extremely<00:00:18.600> impressed<00:00:19.279> got<00:00:20.279> into<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
extremely impressed got into a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.040 
extremely impressed got into a
conversation<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:21.180> one<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> staff<00:00:21.689> members

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
conversation with one of staff members

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.529 
conversation with one of staff members
then<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:23.100> couldn't<00:00:23.730> believe<00:00:23.939> their<00:00:24.090> value<00:00:24.359> for

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
then I couldn't believe their value for

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.519 
then I couldn't believe their value for
money<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:24.990> were<00:00:25.050> talking<00:00:25.289> about<00:00:25.380> with

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
money that you were talking about with

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.759 
money that you were talking about with
these<00:00:25.680> symbols<00:00:26.099> are<00:00:26.580> basically<00:00:27.359> looking<00:00:27.750> at<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
these symbols are basically looking at a

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.349 
these symbols are basically looking at a
set<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> symbols<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.789> you're<00:00:29.939> looking<00:00:30.029> at

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
set of symbols like you're looking at

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.880 
set of symbols like you're looking at
here<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:30.960> round<00:00:31.140> about<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> five<00:00:31.590> hundred

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
here for round about the five hundred

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.490 
here for round about the five hundred
dollar<00:00:32.040> mark<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.610> guess<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.960> numbers<00:00:34.230> stack<00:00:34.469> up

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
dollar mark I guess the numbers stack up

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.650 
dollar mark I guess the numbers stack up
but<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.610> proof<00:00:35.820> was<00:00:36.030> ultimately<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
but the proof was ultimately in the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.330 
but the proof was ultimately in the
pudding<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.200> recommended<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.980> take<00:00:38.040> them

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
pudding I recommended that I take them

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
pudding I recommended that I take them
out<00:00:38.520> try<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.390> corporate<00:00:39.690> gig<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.140> I'll

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
out try on a corporate gig so I'll

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.619 
out try on a corporate gig so I'll
borrow<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.500> set<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.309> round<00:00:41.579> play<00:00:42.390> them<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
borrow a set to round play them on a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.330 
borrow a set to round play them on a
corporate<00:00:42.960> gig<00:00:43.230> probably<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> about<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
corporate gig probably to about a

normal set of symbols that are playing

difference<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:57.719> actually<00:00:57.870> really

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
difference I was actually really

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.950 
difference I was actually really
surprised<00:00:58.590> by<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.829> way<00:00:58.980> they<00:00:59.160> perform<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.870> at

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
surprised by the way they perform and at

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.150 
surprised by the way they perform and at
that<00:01:00.989> price<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.530> could<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.829> believe<00:01:01.949> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
that price I could not believe it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.650 
that price I could not believe it
there's<00:01:02.640> something<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> student<00:01:03.449> could

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
there's something that a student could

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.179 
there's something that a student could
buy<00:01:03.840> they<00:01:04.260> could<00:01:04.409> use<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> all<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> way<00:01:05.159> out

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
each symbol individually see what you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.770 
each symbol individually see what you
think<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.600> play
