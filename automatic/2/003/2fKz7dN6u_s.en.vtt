00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hairstyles with braids 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.680
 in the first option we start by taking 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.990
 the top part with a small rubber 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.910
 now we take the lock from one side what 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.800
 we divide into three partitions and we're going to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.570
 make a root braid every time 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.090
 we cross the strands of the ends 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.640
 we add hair 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.270
 we cross and add hair in the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.270
 first crosses 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.850
 and then we braided normal all over the chest 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.030
 we tie the braid with a small rubber 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.190
 and we do the same thing on the other side 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.649
 we add hair at the first crosses 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 leaving the braid in horizontal and braid 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.059
 We normal all the lock 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.379
 we hold the braid with a small rubber 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 we skip the queue we've made 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.860
 up and we load all the hair to 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.860
 get more volume 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.170
 we apply a little fixative spray 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.420
 we throw the hair back we give 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.990
 the volume that we want and we place two 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.990
 tweezers 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.659
 we take a braid we fold it 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.820
 we place and hold it with hairpins 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.899
 open we take the other one and place it 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.899
 just below 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.570
 we hold them that the forks that 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.030
 be necessary 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.030
 and ready this is the result 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.600
 in season we started twisting the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.400
 hair from the front to 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.260
 give it more volume 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.820
 we pull the hair to one side and 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.820
 we make a pigtail 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.850
 we take a lock we cover the rubber 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.820
 We passed the hair inside 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.220
 we squeeze 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.410
 we take another small rubber and place it 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.410
 just down holding the tip 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.170
 we could leave it so we would stay 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.390
 a nice pigtail 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.430
 or take a lock of the center 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.330
 divide it into two partitions and make one 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.330
 short braid 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.349
 we are rolling the two million between 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.349
 yes 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.939
 we put a small rubber 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.540
 and we roll it up in planes by raising it 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.540
 upwards 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.020
 we hold the roll with forks 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.740
 open 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.740
 and ready 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.410
 in this option we take a lock of the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.860
 top part and we make a braid 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.860
 normal 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.080
 we hold it with a small rubber band and 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.080
 we make another one just below 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.370
 we do the same on the other side 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.900
 we take the braids on one side the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.900
 we roll together 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.710
 we hold them with a clamp and do what 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.710
 same on the other side 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.739
 we choose to give it to you making a 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.739
 pigtail 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.640
 since we do the bottom 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.900
 and ready what options you liked the most
