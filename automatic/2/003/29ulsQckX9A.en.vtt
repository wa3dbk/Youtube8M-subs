00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.749 
and you know duplicate it now the reason
why<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.840> great<00:02:04.350> form<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.950> animation<00:02:05.579> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
why this is a great form of animation is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.210 
why this is a great form of animation is
because<00:02:06.570> these<00:02:07.079> items<00:02:07.439> don't<00:02:08.009> take<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.429> extra

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
because these items don't take up extra

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.410 
because these items don't take up extra
it<00:02:11.220> doesn't<00:02:11.520> increase<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> size<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.360> your

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it doesn't increase the size of your

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.880 
it doesn't increase the size of your
movie<00:02:12.810> because<00:02:12.840> it's

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
movie because it's

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.050 
movie because it's
just<00:02:14.069> recycled<00:02:15.000> items<00:02:16.790> opposed<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.030> just

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
just recycled items opposed to just

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.000 
just recycled items opposed to just
drawing<00:02:18.630> every<00:02:18.930> single<00:02:19.230> frame<00:02:19.470> which<00:02:19.800> will

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
drawing every single frame which will

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.449 
drawing every single frame which will
create<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.340> huge<00:02:20.990> movie<00:02:21.990> now<00:02:22.530> only<00:02:22.800> have<00:02:23.190> one

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
create a huge movie now only have one

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.480 
create a huge movie now only have one
layer<00:02:23.700> right<00:02:24.240> now<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.890> let's<00:02:25.890> look<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.190> at<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
layer right now and let's look up at the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.050 
layer right now and let's look up at the
top<00:02:26.700> only<00:02:27.150> have<00:02:27.270> one<00:02:27.480> layer<00:02:28.130> for<00:02:29.130> more<00:02:29.490> complex

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
top only have one layer for more complex

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.820 
top only have one layer for more complex
animations<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> more<00:02:30.959> complicated<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.680> want

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
animations the more complicated you want

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.550 
animations the more complicated you want
to<00:02:31.890> get<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.520> can<00:02:32.670> add<00:02:32.940> layers<00:02:33.510> more<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.380> more

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
to get you can add layers more and more

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.790 
to get you can add layers more and more
layers<00:02:35.240> maybe<00:02:36.240> putting<00:02:36.600> one<00:02:36.930> hand<00:02:36.959> on<00:02:37.560> each

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
layers maybe putting one hand on each

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.000 
layers maybe putting one hand on each
layer<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:39.360> layer<00:02:39.989> handles<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:40.830> not

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
layer and that layer handles just not

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.840 
layer and that layer handles just not
110<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:42.420> one<00:02:42.720> hand<00:02:43.140> animation<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.640> I'm

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
110 that one hand animation but I'm

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.729 
110 that one hand animation but I'm
putting<00:02:45.510> I'm<00:02:45.750> being<00:02:45.930> lazy<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.350> I'm<00:02:46.470> putting

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
putting I'm being lazy and I'm putting

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.860 
putting I'm being lazy and I'm putting
everything<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.400> layer<00:02:47.640> right<00:02:47.880> now<00:02:48.030> so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
everything on one layer right now so

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.920 
everything on one layer right now so
actually<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.500> could<00:02:49.830> just<00:02:50.100> bring<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.300> out<00:02:51.600> oh

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.140 

all<00:04:26.370> graphics<00:04:27.030> oh<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:29.160> there<00:04:29.310> we<00:04:29.430> have<00:04:29.460> we<00:04:30.030> have

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
all graphics oh so there we have we have

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150 
all graphics oh so there we have we have
that<00:04:30.360> one<00:04:30.600> little<00:04:30.870> animation<00:04:31.470> going<00:04:31.770> on<00:04:31.920> am

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
that one little animation going on am

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.880 
that one little animation going on am
moving<00:04:32.670> back<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:32.970> forth<00:04:33.060> of<00:04:33.750> course<00:04:34.170> you

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
moving back and forth of course you

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.390 
moving back and forth of course you
continue<00:04:35.460> pressing<00:04:35.760> f6<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:37.220> moving<00:04:38.220> your

continue pressing f6 and moving your
item<00:04:38.850> your<00:04:39.690> object<00:04:40.260> piece<00:04:40.500> by<00:04:40.710> piece<00:04:40.740> ever<00:04:41.640> so

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
item your object piece by piece ever so

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:49.210 
item your object piece by piece ever so
slowly<00:04:42.830> creating<00:04:43.830> some<00:04:44.670> brilliant<00:04:45.270> animation

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.120 

all<00:04:50.220> right<00:04:50.400> so<00:04:50.610> we<00:04:50.820> have<00:04:51.170> this<00:04:52.170> turtle<00:04:52.800> looking

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
all right so we have this turtle looking

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.380 
all right so we have this turtle looking
thing<00:04:53.400> kind<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.210> moving<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.930> side<00:04:55.200> and

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
thing kind of moving to the side and

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.490 
thing kind of moving to the side and
that's<00:04:57.390> pretty<00:04:57.720> much<00:04:57.840> for<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.320> object

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
that's pretty much for the object

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.060 
that's pretty much for the object
animation<00:04:59.340> there's<00:04:59.550> nothing<00:05:00.860> too<00:05:01.860> crazy

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
animation there's nothing too crazy

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.030 
animation there's nothing too crazy
about<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.760> other<00:05:03.390> and<00:05:03.630> then<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.050> this<00:05:04.740> is<00:05:04.920> the

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
about it other and then and this is the

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.900 
about it other and then and this is the
same<00:05:05.250> way<00:05:05.600> that<00:05:06.600> you<00:05:06.810> would<00:05:07.610> move<00:05:08.610> around

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
same way that you would move around

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.490 
same way that you would move around
sprites<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:09.600> stuff<00:05:09.840> like<00:05:09.960> that<00:05:10.020> which<00:05:10.290> I'm

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
sprites and stuff like that which I'm

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.350 
sprites and stuff like that which I'm
going<00:05:10.830> to<00:05:10.890> do<00:05:11.010> eventually<00:05:11.430> show<00:05:12.120> you<00:05:12.210> how<00:05:12.300> to

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
going to do eventually show you how to

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.570 
going to do eventually show you how to
use<00:05:12.450> sprites<00:05:12.960> for<00:05:13.050> your<00:05:13.260> animation<00:05:13.770> so<00:05:14.370> that's

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
use sprites for your animation so that's

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.160 
use sprites for your animation so that's
how<00:05:14.700> you<00:05:14.760> do<00:05:14.910> your<00:05:14.940> object<00:05:15.540> animation<00:05:16.080> I'm

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
how you do your object animation I'm

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.720 
how you do your object animation I'm
just<00:05:16.380> using<00:05:16.560> graphics<00:05:17.190> but<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.430> can<00:05:17.550> use<00:05:17.700> a

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
just using graphics but you can use a

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
just using graphics but you can use a
movie<00:05:18.120> clip<00:05:18.270> which<00:05:19.080> L<00:05:19.290> can<00:05:19.550> show<00:05:20.550> you<00:05:20.750> let's

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
movie clip which L can show you let's

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.470 
movie clip which L can show you let's
create<00:05:22.140> a<00:05:22.200> movie<00:05:22.500> clip<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:23.820> movie<00:05:24.090> clip<00:05:24.270> can

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
create a movie clip the movie clip can

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.540 
create a movie clip the movie clip can
be<00:05:24.510> animated<00:05:25.020> if<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.590> want<00:05:25.800> i'm<00:05:26.010> going<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.400> add

anything else so I'm going to press f6

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.170 
anything else so I'm going to press f6
on<00:06:13.020> there<00:06:13.350> and<00:06:14.720> I'm<00:06:15.720> going<00:06:16.080> to<00:06:16.310> add<00:06:17.310> to<00:06:18.030> this

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
on there and I'm going to add to this

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.110 
on there and I'm going to add to this
oval<00:06:21.890> so<00:06:22.890> all<00:06:23.040> I<00:06:23.070> do<00:06:23.190> with<00:06:23.430> this<00:06:23.550> movie<00:06:23.880> clip

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
oval so all I do with this movie clip

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.980 
oval so all I do with this movie clip
was<00:06:25.050> a<00:06:25.080> big<00:06:26.010> one<00:06:26.280> fine<00:06:26.730> big<00:06:27.030> one<00:06:27.330> for<00:06:27.540> him<00:06:27.660> small

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
was a big one fine big one for him small

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.160 
was a big one fine big one for him small
so<00:06:28.170> we<00:06:28.290> have<00:06:28.440> this<00:06:28.590> pulsating<00:06:29.720> thing<00:06:30.720> going<00:06:31.020> on

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
so we have this pulsating thing going on

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.590 
so we have this pulsating thing going on
so<00:06:31.530> let<00:06:31.950> me<00:06:31.980> add<00:06:32.220> that<00:06:32.250> to<00:06:32.820> the<00:06:32.940> new<00:06:33.120> layer<00:06:33.360> now

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
so let me add that to the new layer now

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.480 
so let me add that to the new layer now
so<00:06:33.840> I'm<00:06:33.900> going<00:06:34.050> to<00:06:34.080> go<00:06:34.230> inside<00:06:34.560> of<00:06:34.770> my<00:06:34.950> library

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
so I'm going to go inside of my library

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.950 
so I'm going to go inside of my library
get<00:06:35.850> that<00:06:36.030> big<00:06:36.330> oval<00:06:36.630> and<00:06:36.810> place<00:06:37.800> it
