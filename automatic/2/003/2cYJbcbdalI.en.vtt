show you how it works first thing you
got<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.400> do<00:00:23.609> when<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.150> guy<00:00:24.330> out<00:00:24.480> of

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
got to do when you get this guy out of

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.179 
got to do when you get this guy out of
the<00:00:24.720> box<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.170> hook<00:00:25.320> up<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> hardware<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the box is hook up the hardware to the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.429 
the box is hook up the hardware to the
guitar<00:00:26.580> itself<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.599> get<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> MIDI<00:00:28.050> pick<00:00:28.289> up

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
guitar itself you get a MIDI pick up

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.070 
guitar itself you get a MIDI pick up
here<00:00:28.680> attaches<00:00:29.460> itself<00:00:29.760> over<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> GK<00:00:30.720> 3

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
here attaches itself over to the GK 3

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.680 
here attaches itself over to the GK 3
and<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.830> GK<00:00:32.189> 3<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.000> roland<00:00:33.420> piece<00:00:33.570> of

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and the GK 3 is the roland piece of

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.479 
and the GK 3 is the roland piece of
hardware<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.140> accepts<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> signal<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
hardware that accepts the signal the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.920 
hardware that accepts the signal the
analog<00:00:35.850> signal<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> output<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> your

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
analog signal from the output of your

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.440 
analog signal from the output of your
guitar<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.530> also<00:00:38.340> creates<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.850> MIDI<00:00:39.030> signal

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
guitar and also creates a MIDI signal

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.780 
guitar and also creates a MIDI signal
based<00:00:39.719> off<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.290> play<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.550> there's<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
based off of what you play so there's a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
based off of what you play so there's a
dip<00:00:42.000> switch<00:00:42.239> which<00:00:42.690> allows<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.320> just

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
dip switch which allows you to have just

00:00:43.469 --> 00:01:05.530 
dip switch which allows you to have just
guitar<00:00:49.520> or<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:51.449> MIDI<00:00:57.109> or<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.489> mix<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.609> both

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.030 

so<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.689> basically<00:01:07.080> explains<00:01:07.260> what<00:01:07.680> goes<00:01:07.860> on

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
so that basically explains what goes on

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.920 
so that basically explains what goes on
on<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> body<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> guitar<00:01:08.909> I'd<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
on the body of the guitar I'd have to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.359 
on the body of the guitar I'd have to
let<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> spend

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
let you know that you do have to spend

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
let you know that you do have to spend
some<00:01:11.520> time<00:01:11.729> getting<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.180> pickup<00:01:12.540> situated

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
some time getting this pickup situated

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.990 
some time getting this pickup situated
so<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.619> sits<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.460> close<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
so that it sits just as close to the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.249 
so that it sits just as close to the
bottom<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> strings<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.900> humanly

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
bottom of the strings as humanly

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.190 
bottom of the strings as humanly
possible<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.670> also<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> keeps<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
possible and also that it keeps just the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.810 
possible and also that it keeps just the
minimum<00:01:19.560> distance<00:01:19.740> away<00:01:20.130> from<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.520> strings

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
minimum distance away from the strings

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.969 
minimum distance away from the strings
so<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> closer<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> strings<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so the closer it is to the strings the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
so the closer it is to the strings the
better<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.400> sensitivity<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> pickup<00:01:24.479> now

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
better the sensitivity of the pickup now

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.840 
better the sensitivity of the pickup now
let's<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.350> over<00:01:25.380> look<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> faceplate<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
let's go over look at the faceplate so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
let's go over look at the faceplate so
once<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.450> your<00:01:27.509> hardware<00:01:28.200> properly

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
once you get your hardware properly

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.620 
once you get your hardware properly
attached<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> body<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.909> your<00:01:29.939> guitar<00:01:30.390> then

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
attached to the body of your guitar then

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.030 
attached to the body of your guitar then
the<00:01:30.930> next<00:01:31.170> thing<00:01:31.259> you've<00:01:31.439> got<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.890> make

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the next thing you've got to do is make

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.130 
the next thing you've got to do is make
sure<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.939> sensitivity<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.810> pickup

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
sure that the sensitivity of the pickup

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.620 
sure that the sensitivity of the pickup
is<00:01:34.290> set<00:01:34.650> properly<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.479> you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
is set properly so what you do is you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.319 
is set properly so what you do is you
hit<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> sensitivity<00:01:37.650> button<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.210> go

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
hit the sensitivity button and you go

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.240 
hit the sensitivity button and you go
through<00:01:39.540> each<00:01:39.780> string<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.560> you're<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
through each string and you're going to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.690 
through each string and you're going to
see<00:01:41.750> these<00:01:42.750> pattern<00:01:43.500> selectors<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.520> or

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
see these pattern selectors here or

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
see these pattern selectors here or
patch<00:01:44.909> selectors<00:01:45.509> are<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> turn<00:01:46.049> into<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
patch selectors are going to turn into a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
patch selectors are going to turn into a
led<00:01:46.799> meter<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.280> let<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.299> you're

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
led meter and let you know if you're

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.260 
led meter and let you know if you're
getting<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> right<00:01:48.869> sensitivity

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.830 

so<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.329> just<00:01:53.479> go<00:01:53.630> through<00:01:53.659> all<00:01:53.929> your<00:01:53.960> strings

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
so you just go through all your strings

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.880 
so you just go through all your strings
and<00:01:56.840> make<00:01:57.020> sure<00:01:57.170> you're<00:01:57.350> getting<00:01:57.469> nearly

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
and make sure you're getting nearly

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.789 
and make sure you're getting nearly
maximum<00:01:58.490> sensitivity<00:01:58.700> if<00:01:59.299> you're<00:01:59.780> not<00:02:00.020> you

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
maximum sensitivity if you're not you

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.200 
maximum sensitivity if you're not you
can<00:02:00.950> expect<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.399> have<00:02:01.520> some<00:02:01.670> problems<00:02:01.880> with

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
can expect to have some problems with

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.600 
can expect to have some problems with
certain<00:02:02.329> patches<00:02:03.340> basically<00:02:04.340> like<00:02:04.490> the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
certain patches basically like the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.940 
certain patches basically like the
sustain<00:02:05.030> won't<00:02:05.329> work<00:02:05.539> or<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:06.560> won't<00:02:06.710> get<00:02:06.860> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
sustain won't work or you won't get the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.039 
sustain won't work or you won't get the
right<00:02:07.100> kind<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.399> attack<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:08.360> on<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:08.810> forth

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
right kind of attack so on and so forth

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.089 
right kind of attack so on and so forth
so<00:02:09.200> go<00:02:09.410> ahead<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.590> do<00:02:09.739> that

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
so go ahead and do that

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.009 
so go ahead and do that
the<00:02:10.970> gr20<00:02:11.450> has<00:02:11.840> ten<00:02:12.290> different<00:02:13.069> preset<00:02:14.019> banks

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
the gr20 has ten different preset banks

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.640 
the gr20 has ten different preset banks
and<00:02:15.230> inside<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.769> banks<00:02:16.160> are<00:02:16.340> many<00:02:16.879> many

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and inside of the banks are many many

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.710 
and inside of the banks are many many
variety<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.680> patches<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.459> I'll<00:02:20.330> just<00:02:20.480> kind<00:02:20.660> of

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
variety of patches so I'll just kind of

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.970 
variety of patches so I'll just kind of
quickly<00:02:20.900> walk<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.379> through<00:02:21.620> some<00:02:21.769> of<00:02:21.890> these

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
quickly walk you through some of these

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.690 
quickly walk you through some of these
guys<00:02:22.250> here

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
guys here

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.170 
guys here
here<00:02:23.360> we<00:02:23.480> have<00:02:23.599> first<00:02:23.870> off<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.970> string<00:02:25.970> or

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
here we have first off a string or

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.470 
here we have first off a string or
Orchestra<00:02:26.780> Bank

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.000 

and<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.930> go<00:02:33.079> through<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.470> different<00:02:33.650> patches

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
and you go through the different patches

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
and you go through the different patches
in<00:02:34.340> your<00:02:34.459> Orchestra<00:02:34.910> Bank

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.119 

one<00:02:59.030> thing<00:02:59.180> I've<00:02:59.269> noticed<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.750> that<00:03:00.129> this

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
one thing I've noticed is that this

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.059 
one thing I've noticed is that this
synthesis<00:03:02.290> situation<00:03:03.290> affects<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.920> way<00:03:04.040> that

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
synthesis situation affects the way that

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.220 
synthesis situation affects the way that
you<00:03:04.310> play<00:03:04.489> your<00:03:04.670> riffs<00:03:04.940> in<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.659> much<00:03:05.840> different

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
you play your riffs in a much different

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.170 
you play your riffs in a much different
way<00:03:06.379> than<00:03:06.409> a<00:03:06.980> traditional<00:03:07.250> guitar<00:03:07.670> effects

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
way than a traditional guitar effects

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.759 
way than a traditional guitar effects
processor<00:03:08.720> will<00:03:08.870> affect<00:03:09.170> how<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.349> play<00:03:09.709> so

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
processor will affect how you play so

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:25.920 
processor will affect how you play so
for<00:03:10.730> instance<00:03:11.090> I'll<00:03:11.239> give<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> dry<00:03:11.840> riff

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.929 

and<00:03:26.769> then<00:03:27.040> we<00:03:27.129> can<00:03:27.280> go<00:03:27.400> through<00:03:27.549> our<00:03:27.670> different

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
and then we can go through our different

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.089 
and then we can go through our different
types<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.209> patches<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:28.930> show<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.980> know

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
types of patches and show you you know

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.339 
types of patches and show you you know
on<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.310> piano<00:03:30.610> there's<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.420> certain<00:03:31.780> action<00:03:32.200> that

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
on a piano there's a certain action that

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:58.440 
on a piano there's a certain action that
people<00:03:32.620> have<00:03:32.799> on<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> piano<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:57.090> with<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.120> synth

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
people have on a piano and with a synth

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:23.890 
people have on a piano and with a synth
or<00:04:04.980> with<00:04:05.980> rhythmic<00:04:06.430> elements

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.350 

so<00:04:25.610> specifically<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:26.759> can<00:04:26.789> go<00:04:27.060> into<00:04:27.240> each

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
so specifically you can go into each

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.689 
so specifically you can go into each
bank<00:04:27.780> pick<00:04:28.289> particular<00:04:28.620> patches<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.520> then

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
bank pick particular patches and then

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.399 
bank pick particular patches and then
you<00:04:29.819> can<00:04:29.969> modify<00:04:30.330> them<00:04:30.629> in<00:04:30.719> the<00:04:30.840> following<00:04:31.169> way

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
you can modify them in the following way

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.409 
you can modify them in the following way
there's<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.830> glide<00:04:32.250> which<00:04:32.699> is<00:04:32.879> like<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.060> port

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
there's a glide which is like a port

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.899 
there's a glide which is like a port
Mentos<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:33.990> can<00:04:34.139> turn<00:04:34.259> on<00:04:34.319> and<00:04:34.650> off<00:04:34.909> you

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
Mentos that you can turn on and off you

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.899 
Mentos that you can turn on and off you
can<00:04:36.030> hold<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.479> down<00:04:36.509> and<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.080> can<00:04:37.229> get<00:04:37.469> a<00:04:37.909> port

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
can hold it down and you can get a port

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.869 
can hold it down and you can get a port
Mentos<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.750> can<00:04:39.900> also<00:04:40.050> hold<00:04:40.469> for<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:41.280> sustain

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
Mentos you can also hold for a sustain

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.730 
Mentos you can also hold for a sustain
if<00:04:42.210> you<00:04:42.360> want<00:04:42.539> to<00:04:42.599> sustain<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:42.960> particular<00:04:43.349> note

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
if you want to sustain a particular note

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.379 
if you want to sustain a particular note
then<00:04:44.729> you<00:04:44.939> have<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> basic<00:04:47.120> envelope<00:04:48.120> here

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
then you have a basic envelope here

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.260 
then you have a basic envelope here
attack<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.110> release<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:49.939> obviously<00:04:50.939> quick

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
attack and release so obviously quick

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:59.360 
attack and release so obviously quick
attack<00:04:53.180> slow<00:04:54.180> attack<00:04:56.779> and<00:04:57.919> so<00:04:58.919> forth<00:04:59.219> with

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
attack slow attack and so forth with

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.959 
attack slow attack and so forth with
release

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
release

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.610 
release
there's<00:05:00.479> chorusing<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.169> you<00:05:01.229> can<00:05:01.379> apply<00:05:01.500> to

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
there's chorusing that you can apply to

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.879 
there's chorusing that you can apply to
every<00:05:01.919> patch<00:05:03.199> there's<00:05:04.199> a<00:05:04.259> little<00:05:04.469> delay<00:05:04.590> and

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
every patch there's a little delay and

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.409 
every patch there's a little delay and
reverb<00:05:05.009> that<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.550> can<00:05:05.669> put<00:05:05.819> on<00:05:05.939> there<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.210> an

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
reverb that you can put on there and an

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.309 
reverb that you can put on there and an
output<00:05:06.750> level<00:05:07.099> then<00:05:08.099> you<00:05:09.000> have<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.960> ability

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
output level then you have the ability

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.429 
output level then you have the ability
to<00:05:10.349> edit<00:05:10.680> your<00:05:10.800> patch<00:05:11.099> and<00:05:11.460> you<00:05:11.669> can<00:05:11.849> edit<00:05:12.439> by

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:13.439 
to edit your patch and you can edit by

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.230 
to edit your patch and you can edit by
hitting<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.889> patch<00:05:14.099> editor<00:05:14.669> and<00:05:14.849> then<00:05:15.120> you

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
hitting the patch editor and then you

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.820 
hitting the patch editor and then you
get<00:05:15.389> a<00:05:15.419> frequency<00:05:15.840> control<00:05:16.469> which<00:05:16.800> is

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
get a frequency control which is

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.459 
get a frequency control which is
basically<00:05:17.310> a<00:05:17.430> filter<00:05:17.879> a<00:05:18.060> resonance<00:05:19.020> control

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
basically a filter a resonance control

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.860 
basically a filter a resonance control
which<00:05:19.680> is<00:05:19.800> like<00:05:19.919> a<00:05:19.949> cutoff<00:05:20.370> filter<00:05:20.870> transpose

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
which is like a cutoff filter transpose

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.719 
which is like a cutoff filter transpose
which<00:05:22.259> allows<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.889> move<00:05:23.159> it<00:05:23.310> up<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:23.580> down

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
which allows you to move it up and down

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.300 
which allows you to move it up and down
by<00:05:23.939> octave<00:05:24.360> or<00:05:24.479> v<00:05:24.779> if<00:05:24.990> you<00:05:25.080> so<00:05:25.259> choose<00:05:25.529> and<00:05:25.800> then

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
by octave or v if you so choose and then

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.070 
by octave or v if you so choose and then
you<00:05:26.430> get<00:05:26.550> this<00:05:26.729> thing<00:05:27.000> called<00:05:27.240> playing<00:05:27.599> feel

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
you get this thing called playing feel

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.390 
you get this thing called playing feel
which<00:05:28.349> is<00:05:28.379> like<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.680> sensitivity<00:05:29.310> control<00:05:29.750> so

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
which is like a sensitivity control so

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.579 
which is like a sensitivity control so
obviously<00:05:32.400> here's<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.909> riff<00:05:33.379> just<00:05:34.379> the<00:05:34.469> way

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:34.589 
obviously here's the riff just the way

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:42.309 
obviously here's the riff just the way
it<00:05:34.710> is

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.080 

and<00:05:43.319> then<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.800> can<00:05:43.979> boost<00:05:44.189> that<00:05:44.370> frequency<00:05:44.789> way

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
and then I can boost that frequency way

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.219 
and then I can boost that frequency way
up<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.479> get<00:05:45.629> a<00:05:45.659> nice<00:05:45.840> treble<00:05:46.349> sound<00:05:48.110> bring<00:05:49.110> out

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
up and get a nice treble sound bring out

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:56.420 
up and get a nice treble sound bring out
the<00:05:49.349> brightness<00:05:54.770> I'll<00:05:55.770> go<00:05:56.069> over<00:05:56.159> to<00:05:56.340> the

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
the brightness I'll go over to the

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:05.059 
the brightness I'll go over to the
resonance<00:05:57.050> crank<00:05:58.050> that<00:05:58.229> all<00:05:58.409> the<00:05:58.499> way<00:05:58.590> up<00:06:04.069> and

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
resonance crank that all the way up and

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.179 
resonance crank that all the way up and
then<00:06:05.249> we<00:06:05.370> can<00:06:05.400> go<00:06:05.699> over<00:06:06.029> to<00:06:06.060> transpose<00:06:07.039> take<00:06:08.039> it

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:08.189 
then we can go over to transpose take it

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:24.469 
then we can go over to transpose take it
up<00:06:08.279> a<00:06:08.400> couple<00:06:08.520> octaves<00:06:08.789> or<00:06:16.969> down<00:06:23.029> and<00:06:24.029> this<00:06:24.270> can

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
up a couple octaves or down and this can

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.029 
up a couple octaves or down and this can
be<00:06:24.569> very<00:06:24.810> useful<00:06:25.259> if<00:06:25.379> you're<00:06:25.529> in<00:06:25.620> the<00:06:25.710> midst<00:06:25.919> of

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
be very useful if you're in the midst of

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.600 
be very useful if you're in the midst of
doing<00:06:26.189> a<00:06:26.400> riff<00:06:26.610> of<00:06:26.759> some<00:06:26.969> sort<00:06:28.129> so<00:06:29.129> let's<00:06:29.340> say

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
doing a riff of some sort so let's say

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:48.870 
doing a riff of some sort so let's say
you<00:06:30.539> know<00:06:30.689> you<00:06:30.779> got<00:06:31.050> a<00:06:31.080> riff<00:06:31.349> going

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:07:08.330 

you

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.710 

so<00:07:09.340> this<00:07:09.490> really<00:07:09.730> allows<00:07:09.850> you<00:07:10.240> to<00:07:10.270> turn<00:07:10.480> your

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
so this really allows you to turn your

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.510 
so this really allows you to turn your
six<00:07:11.020> string<00:07:11.260> guitar<00:07:11.590> into<00:07:11.890> much<00:07:12.070> of<00:07:12.100> a<00:07:12.310> base

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
six string guitar into much of a base

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.610 
six string guitar into much of a base
because<00:07:13.180> you<00:07:13.390> can<00:07:13.570> certainly<00:07:13.780> exceed<00:07:14.410> the

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:14.620 
because you can certainly exceed the

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.680 
because you can certainly exceed the
limit<00:07:14.950> of<00:07:15.070> the<00:07:15.760> low-end<00:07:16.180> that<00:07:16.360> you'd<00:07:16.510> normally

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690 
limit of the low-end that you'd normally

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.850 
limit of the low-end that you'd normally
get<00:07:17.050> on<00:07:17.200> a<00:07:17.290> guitar

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
get on a guitar

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.950 
get on a guitar
well<00:07:18.370> the<00:07:18.520> gr20<00:07:18.970> certainly<00:07:19.450> has<00:07:19.600> some<00:07:19.780> fine

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
well the gr20 certainly has some fine

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.320 
well the gr20 certainly has some fine
features<00:07:20.410> and<00:07:20.680> I<00:07:21.460> haven't<00:07:21.760> been<00:07:21.850> able<00:07:21.970> to<00:07:22.120> show

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
features and I haven't been able to show

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.820 
features and I haven't been able to show
you<00:07:22.390> all<00:07:22.630> of<00:07:22.660> them<00:07:22.960> there's<00:07:23.320> certainly<00:07:23.590> a<00:07:23.680> heck

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830 
you all of them there's certainly a heck

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.170 
you all of them there's certainly a heck
of<00:07:23.920> a<00:07:23.980> lot<00:07:24.100> more<00:07:24.160> you<00:07:24.430> can<00:07:24.460> do<00:07:24.670> with<00:07:24.700> this<00:07:24.970> thing
