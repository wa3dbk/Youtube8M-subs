00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:08.450
 Yes Domo is Michael 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:11.750
 It is ne er online weapon wheel is this time 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.560
 This put this is it part technique 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.660
 Fix from the beginning 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:26.580
 I would like to introduce the way but this is very easy though 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:33.020
 Well Wheel Well ready when you started online 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.020
 I want to use the corpse immediately, but in the picture and story mode I have set first 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.740
 Please remember this condition not to do this 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.180
 If you decide 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.450
 Open the phone 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.980
 Enter this quick save 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:54.109
 But create a new year-end 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.109
 Then make one 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.280
 After that you only go online 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:15.320
 But you Nde become another so fixed from one quick Once you have saved the next or later there 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.460
 When you got in 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:24.840
 11 Even if you do not change weapons one by one at the time of a certain death match 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.840
 You can use the weapon you want to use 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.270
 Your wait a while 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.850
 It was originally entered 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.969
 Remember the previous theme Wheel 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.440
 It is this that I think I do not have something I can not do 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.290
 This is what 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.959
 Hmmm 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.959
 Became a studio emperor except I think- 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.750
 It is not reflected as much as I think 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.100
 I think 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.930
 It will not be properly softened the edge of the non-Ono 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.750
 Fixed 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.750
 I can use it right now 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.319
 Pete Khan 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:53.099
 I 'm careful though 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:03:00.830
 That story mode is a cheat code or something planted in a circle r 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:07.310
 It is possible to replenish the weapon or something with that day or good, but if it gets done this way 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:11.120
 It does not seem to be reflected, though I tried it earlier, but even in my own story mode 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:16.400
 Are or if not a weapon that you can buy in 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:19.490
 Well kind of Nde did not have their own high-Rokeran Nde like this to do the way can not 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.000
 If you can't help anymore, it's Rokiran 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:27.130
 Well buy weapons Well otherwise Nde not go to a fixed 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.020
 It is not only do it 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.880
 Well that's right 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:38.310
