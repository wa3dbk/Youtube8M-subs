put it out here and finally we have the
GPS<00:02:28.020> units<00:02:31.819> that's<00:02:32.819> not<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.180> inside<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.930> box

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
GPS units that's not it inside the box

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.520 
GPS units that's not it inside the box
then<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.830> more<00:02:35.630> accessories<00:02:36.630> cables

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
then you have more accessories cables

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.559 
then you have more accessories cables
that<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.250> will<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.400> using<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:39.030> course<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:42.300> big

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
that you will be using of course so big

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.449 
that you will be using of course so big
in<00:02:42.720> your<00:02:43.020> box<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:45.620> inside<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.680> will<00:02:46.920> find<00:02:47.190> a

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
in your box and inside you will find a

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.780 
in your box and inside you will find a
bag<00:02:48.050> then<00:02:49.050> inside<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.769> bag<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.280> will<00:02:50.310> find<00:02:50.670> a

bag then inside this bag you will find a

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.970 
bag then inside this bag you will find a
whole<00:02:51.000> lot<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.269> accessories<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.500> actually

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
whole lot of accessories that actually

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.870 
whole lot of accessories that actually
go<00:02:53.269> with<00:02:54.269> your<00:02:54.780> YS<00:02:55.110> x.x<00:02:55.769> autopilot<00:02:56.220> system<00:02:56.730> let

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
go with your YS x.x autopilot system let

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.300 
go with your YS x.x autopilot system let
me<00:02:56.970> open<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.300> bag<00:02:57.540> okay<00:02:58.170> inside<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.769> big<00:02:59.040> bag

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
me open the bag okay inside that big bag

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.000 
me open the bag okay inside that big bag
we<00:02:59.549> have<00:02:59.730> more<00:03:00.390> smaller<00:03:00.900> bags<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:01.590> have<00:03:01.799> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
we have more smaller bags we have the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.270 
we have more smaller bags we have the
connection<00:03:02.489> cables<00:03:02.940> ok<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:04.560> have<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.739> warranty

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
connection cables ok we have a warranty

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.890 
connection cables ok we have a warranty
card<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:07.260> have<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.680> LED<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.730> antenna<00:03:09.450> for

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
card we have the LED and antenna for

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.610 
card we have the LED and antenna for
Wi-Fi<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> special<00:03:12.480> connector<00:03:13.080> cable

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
Wi-Fi we have a special connector cable

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.920 
Wi-Fi we have a special connector cable
with<00:03:13.769> xt60<00:03:14.489> connector<00:03:14.580> made<00:03:15.269> very<00:03:15.870> good

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
with xt60 connector made very good

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.630 
with xt60 connector made very good
thinking<00:03:16.440> with<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.739> cable<00:03:17.130> because<00:03:17.370> once

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
thinking with this cable because once

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.400 
thinking with this cable because once
you<00:03:17.819> use<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.510> will<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.930> power<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
you use this you will just power the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.990 
you use this you will just power the
autopilot<00:03:19.769> system<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.519> can<00:03:20.700> configure

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
autopilot system and you can configure

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.479 
autopilot system and you can configure
it<00:03:21.269> without<00:03:21.780> powering<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.470> motors<00:03:22.830> up<00:03:23.100> very

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
it without powering the motors up very

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.410 
it without powering the motors up very
very<00:03:23.610> safe<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.390> then<00:03:25.200> we<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:25.590> zero<00:03:25.859> UAV

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
very safe and then we have zero UAV

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.479 
very safe and then we have zero UAV
stickers<00:03:27.470> more<00:03:28.470> cables<00:03:28.859> this<00:03:29.070> looks<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:29.430> a

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
stickers more cables this looks like a

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.960 
stickers more cables this looks like a
serial<00:03:29.850> cable<00:03:30.239> alright<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.370> then<00:03:32.370> we<00:03:32.670> have

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
serial cable alright and then we have

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.259 
serial cable alright and then we have
the<00:03:33.440> vibration<00:03:34.440> proof<00:03:34.709> mount<00:03:35.070> for<00:03:35.579> your<00:03:35.760> IMU

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
the vibration proof mount for your IMU

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:43.670 
the vibration proof mount for your IMU
unit<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:39.090> course<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:40.730> gps<00:03:42.019> mount<00:03:43.019> which

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
unit and of course the gps mount which

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.250 
unit and of course the gps mount which
you<00:03:43.920> can<00:03:44.070> easily<00:03:44.310> assemble<00:03:45.269> ok<00:03:45.780> i'll<00:03:45.959> just

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
you can easily assemble ok i'll just

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.009 
you can easily assemble ok i'll just
show<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.560> very<00:03:46.950> quickly<00:03:50.420> that's<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:51.870> your

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
show you very quickly that's it so your

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.830 
show you very quickly that's it so your
gps<00:03:52.470> can<00:03:52.680> actually<00:03:53.130> stay<00:03:53.850> on<00:03:54.180> top<00:03:54.810> of

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
gps can actually stay on top of

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.229 
gps can actually stay on top of
everything<00:03:55.350> one<00:03:56.070> more<00:03:56.280> cable<00:03:56.640> sitting<00:03:57.090> inside

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
everything one more cable sitting inside

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.140 
everything one more cable sitting inside
that's<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.320> that's<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.370> inside<00:03:59.820> this<00:03:59.940> box<00:04:02.150> so

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
that's it that's it inside this box so

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.090 
that's it that's it inside this box so
this<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.690> for<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.049> unboxing<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:05.069> Y<00:04:05.880> as<00:04:06.150> x6

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
this is it for the unboxing of Y as x6

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.590 
this is it for the unboxing of Y as x6

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
before I end this video I would like to

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.940 
before I end this video I would like to
say<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.359> is<00:04:12.569> a<00:04:12.600> full<00:04:13.079> fledge<00:04:13.380> fully

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
say this is a full fledge fully

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.909
