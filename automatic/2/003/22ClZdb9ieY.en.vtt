 in the crevices of the rocks 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.289
 can live under the roofs of buildings they build 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.579
 there their nest houses look like 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:38.089
 big icicles 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.659
 from beeswax in them wild bees grow their 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.969
 offspring and make stocks but there are bees 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:46.219
 which are specially grown and for

 bee colonies that people care about 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.460
 They live in houses of bee hives place where 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.219
 i stand called apiary apiary 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.620
 usually located where there are many blooming 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.649
 plants to the bees were close 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.500
 fly for pollen and nectar bee 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:12.110
 remembers where her apiary is located and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.469
 hive and always returns home

 bees love their hive house take care of 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:23.060
 he is cleaned warmed and guarded

 house at 100 bees have wax that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.680
 they build themselves honeycomb seems like a big 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.380
 a house in which there are many apartment cells in these 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.969
 bee cells live in them the same way 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.649
 are born from the larvae 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:42.289
 their babies and they keep pollen and honey 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.460
 bees build their honeycombs on special 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.000
 wooden framework 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.429
 that beekeepers put in the hive when 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.009
 the bee finds nectar and wants to inform 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.649
 the rest of the bees where to fly for 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.250
 him it arriving in the hive takes 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.750
 dance 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.420
 moving his little body 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.380
 to make a kilo of honey bee 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.140
 should fly 2 million flowers 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.810
 bee sucking nectar proboscis lowering 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.540
 him in the flower then nectar falls 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.070
 special honey pouch on the abdomen 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.110
 bees 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.440
 for pollen bees have small 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.950
 baskets on hind legs and bristles on 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.950
 all legs bees also drink water but not 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.880
 just drink a and take it as nectar and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.220
 carry home to the hive where it is needed 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.920
 when a bee flies into the hive with its legs 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.220
 cleans pollen from your body on

 for storage 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.150
 floral nectar that the bees brought 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.750
 in the hive they keep comb 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.239
 it removes excess moisture from it and 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.250
 turn nectar into honey when honeycombs 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.190
 filled with nectar which is already 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.790
 turned into honey bees close them 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.459
 special wax caps 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.269
 sealed honey is different in color 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.120
 and taste 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.030
 it depends on when 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.780
 bee plants collected nectar eat honey 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.959
 May lime floral acacia and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.780
 various other bees can hurt 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.030
 human therefore beekeepers are treated with 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.670
 they are very careful also they 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.750
 use special clothes and a hat 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.450
 bee care net 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.870
 to collect honey beekeepers carefully 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.980
 take out the frame from the hive fold the frame 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.440
 honeycomb without bees special box and 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.170
 get honey from honeycombs using 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.900
 special devices in this way 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.690
 thanks to the bees on our workers 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.890
 the tables gets wonderful delicious and 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.700
 useful product
