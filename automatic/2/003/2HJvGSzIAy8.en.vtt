00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.450
 hey people what 's up fitness 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.880
 and welcome to my 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.380
 Squat video from last Monday 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.170
 and I'm doing a little here 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.450
 experiment and not with video like 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.570
 so far used by me but simply 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.289
 only with voiceover and let's see how 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.970
 that feels to you 172 5 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.019
 kilo 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.820
 that means you are back in the field 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 over 170 kilos and I have to say I am 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.410
 got through well 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.510
 where I would have so where I say 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.170
 must is could have run better yes 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.420
 So you will see it soon 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.969
 I have a few problems there 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.770
 and just with the consistency 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.410
 that means that the rape at the same time 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.329
 still thinking okay kneel outward or 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.329
 I just sit back or go 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.780
 I kneel forward 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:01.469
 since the loud there but look at 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.000
 it works is relatively easy yes there me 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.220
 therefore, have tried the deep too 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.470
 improve and become equal to the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.720
 we can see and see the page as well 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.670
 that I have improved the depth I have 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.799
 have to stop working on the rotation this 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.540
 still easy where with you now 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.890
 also not invalidated the experiment 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.509
 or I just have to go with it 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.880
 balance the time a bit 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.259
 that is not an issue we get too 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.200
 if we look from the side 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.640
 says there you can see it clearly 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.710
 just below parallel and I had one 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.479
 few apps where I really on the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.890
 Tiptoe came then I had to 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.509
 I compensate that then I had one 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.860
 big burden for and on the back 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.290
 suddenly and with 172 5 kilos is now 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.909
 a little hard and 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.920
 that's why I figured that off with the conc 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.759
 Now test the sentences both 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.210
 shit if it is now 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.009
 fourth is yes that is the fourth so 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.290
 now i show that also slow mo like 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.430
 me and come forward and that has 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.259
 felt like three to me 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 seconds that I sat down there that was like that 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.560
 but I need it when it comes to the future 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.939
 I wait until it's easy 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.190
 comes back and push up again 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.530
 So it was really and the second where 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.690
 also shit 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.970
 really a higher load one 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.880
 unschÃ¶ne load then it went 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.240
 also already in the direction so yes it is 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.190
 now not as nice as the first 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.500
 It was totally funny, I watch myself too 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.430
 think Mr. right is more on it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.489
 then I concentrated on it 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.840
 that I can see that I make up for it 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.819
 because that felt weird then 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.160
 It was totally slow and way too high 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.959
 and the last website also shit out 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.230
 So the two sets the heat in the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.150
 Tons can also kick too slow 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.530
 and then I have the last sentence 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.560
 again had focus 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.620
 he went again reasonably there 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.620
 man's actually works quite well 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.790
 yes not too strong the rotation in it 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.319
 got through well 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.970
 I have a little something about mine 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.860
 I change the training plan 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.750
 but a separate video with it 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.200
 Everyone could hear something with it 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.810
 also from you and my diet 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.360
 is stretch again the calories now post 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.489
 I still have squats at 123, though 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.500
 the weight of daniel taken that 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.170
 He had just it therefore also 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.130
 without helping 123 help 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.060
 Who will give me a tick too much ? 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.680
 because then you have none 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.140
 stability more simply 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.709
 normal post made short with normal 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.600
 handle went well so I was 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.670
 Already finished my legs 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.950
 Feel right at home even now 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.370
 ass on 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.350
 what i wanted to say i wanted exactly i got 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.090
 I'm directly calories again and mine 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.070
 I noticed that the last three 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.769
 four weeks five weeks where it is 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.299
 shit was eating too little 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.620
 I have checked now if you can 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.030
 swings can be seen only as much as you 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.040
 Eats and I have it all the time 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.640
 maybe two and a half thousand calories 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.410
 eaten 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.290
 that's why I lost weight too 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.230
 was recently at 1 992 now 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.359
 I go back to 89 88 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.670
 weigh in the morning and I have three 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.450
 kilo decreased 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.160
 simply because I do not stop enough 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.570
 have eaten and that is naturally clear 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.640
 that and training is getting harder 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.070
 and you still run against a wall 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.190
 that's why now calories stretch again 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.630
 properly eat the training properly 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.010
 pull through I have said as the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.479
 made a small change saying that 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.400
 I'll see you again in the separate video 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.820
 for the new ones among you, you can 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.970
 also possible me you mean mine 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.740
 look at the training plan and yes that 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.479
 was the last post god and me now 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.690
 I have the day before that is mine 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.340
 conventionally easy day because I yes 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.140
 so they hurt and had injuries 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.840
 I do conventional and only light 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.210
 But so that you see my technique 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.770
 how do I do the setup so that I can 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.870
 I do not have the head over the head 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.599
 head falls down so practically neutral 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.500
 below is not the best of them now either 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.300
 to pull down 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.190
 but that's my setup and you see 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.810
 you're like me just the hip by 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.890
 I think that's 140 now 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.060
 or just a few sentences 5 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.990
 I repeated six repetitions 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.030
 I'm not so strict 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.180
 that's why until the next video makes it 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.180
 Well 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.229
 the 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.730
 Well
