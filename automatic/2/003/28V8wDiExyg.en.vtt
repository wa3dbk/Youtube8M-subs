00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.950
 everyone welcome to tutorials in the 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.470
 blog today we're going to see how to update the 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.200
 Our brand's software is very 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.369
 simple and there are two ways to do it the 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:32.180
 first and relatively easier is 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.910
 going to the manzanita the top 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.370
 left after we're going to 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.250
 software update 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.280
 here this window will appear 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.789
 where will you start looking on the internet 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.359
 what software needs to be updated on 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.850
 which of this we have installed sometimes 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:57.140
 it takes a little bit sometimes it does not take long 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.800
 but usually yes if you throw yourself 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.399
 more than 30 seconds then we wait for 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.399
 to load 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.450
 so in this case it tells me that the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.710
 software is updated 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.630
 software updates does not have 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.020
 again software for your computer in 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.450
 these moments in my case there is no 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.470
 software to update here you 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.470
 let's go out 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.440
 after 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 the other way that is more widespread but 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.570
 with more options to handle the 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.850
 updates is going to preferences of 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:49.420
 system and we go to where it says 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.360
 software update here we will see 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.450
 several options on the first tab 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.180
 where it says scheduled searches here 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.240
 we can click on it to do the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.010
 automatic search or the same search 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.370
 what did he do with 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.390
 with the previous option to search for 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.000
 new and some configurable options for 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.730
 to look for updates for example 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.770
 by default it comes to look for 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.790
 updates every week but 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:26.020
 we can change this all 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.170
 the days or each month and it's this option 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.430
 says download authorizations 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.930
 will automatically check a notice when 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.850
 the updates are ready for 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.000
 then install our system 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.850
 operative what it does is check ok there 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.660
 an update then I start it 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:47.140
 download on sight 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.970
 of second term then this one 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.760
 as a user you do not see when you're 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.610
 downloading but already when we 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.370
 we check that there is an update we 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.500
 says that we can install it now and 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.020
 we proceed to install it then to 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.640
 that serves this option we can this one 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.500
 what is called distilling so that 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.810
 download anything and at the time that we 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.210
 let's check the updates of 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.930
 software download them in that same 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:17.250
 moment and the other tab shows us 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.250
 All software updated 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.370
 that we have in this case we see the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.490
 installation date the name and the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.750
 version to which the 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.670
 software that we want or that 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.930
 this one appeared the update 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.240
 then these two ways there are for 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.610
 update our software I hope that 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.060
 have any questions or have you 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.760
 comment here below this one share 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.750
 like it then, here we follow 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.750
 watching greetings
