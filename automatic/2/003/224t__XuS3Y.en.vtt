really needed an alternative and

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.580 
really needed an alternative and
eportfolios<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.960> provided<00:00:16.500> a

I like utilizing that creative outlet so
I<00:00:52.129> thought<00:00:52.520> that<00:00:52.820> using<00:00:53.720> this<00:00:54.140> website<00:00:54.650> the

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
I thought that using this website the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.979 
I thought that using this website the
city<00:00:55.070> portfolio<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:56.089> provided<00:00:56.629> me<00:00:56.780> with<00:00:56.809> the

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
city portfolio it provided me with the

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.259 
city portfolio it provided me with the
canvas<00:00:57.589> to<00:00:57.800> really<00:00:58.070> kind<00:00:58.430> of<00:00:58.519> paint<00:00:58.760> my<00:00:58.940> story

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
I think one of the nice things about a

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.570 
I think one of the nice things about a
folio<00:01:02.150> is<00:01:02.480> that<00:01:02.780> it's<00:01:03.080> not<00:01:03.290> stagnant<00:01:03.650> it's

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
folio is that it's not stagnant it's

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.460 
folio is that it's not stagnant it's
always<00:01:05.210> growing<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:05.780> always<00:01:05.960> progressing

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
always growing and always progressing

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.560 
always growing and always progressing
along<00:01:06.860> with<00:01:07.010> whatever<00:01:07.220> you're<00:01:07.550> doing<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.390> it

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
along with whatever you're doing and it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.420 
along with whatever you're doing and it
can<00:01:08.690> always<00:01:08.810> be<00:01:08.930> changed<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.650> modified<00:01:09.800> to

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
can always be changed and modified to

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.460 
can always be changed and modified to
fit<00:01:10.670> what<00:01:11.479> it<00:01:11.570> is<00:01:11.690> you're<00:01:11.840> looking<00:01:11.870> for<00:01:12.200> in

fit what it is you're looking for in
your<00:01:12.530> life<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:13.870> think<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.050> efolio<00:01:15.440> would<00:01:15.830> be

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
your life I think the efolio would be

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.719 
your life I think the efolio would be
valuable<00:01:16.370> to<00:01:16.700> students<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:18.460> just<00:01:19.460> like<00:01:19.610> it

biology<00:02:06.950> chemistry<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.629> efolio<00:02:09.080> is<00:02:09.500> a

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
biology chemistry and the efolio is a

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.170 
biology chemistry and the efolio is a
way<00:02:09.739> for<00:02:09.979> them<00:02:10.129> to<00:02:10.160> bring<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.670> information

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
way for them to bring that information

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.050 
way for them to bring that information
together<00:02:11.900> in<00:02:12.379> one<00:02:12.650> piece<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.280> sort<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.879> then

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
together in one piece and sort of then

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.790 
together in one piece and sort of then
reflect<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:14.840> say<00:02:14.989> what<00:02:15.530> are<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
reflect on it and say what are the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.490 
reflect on it and say what are the
linkages<00:02:16.250> here<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.090> folio<00:02:17.569> really<00:02:17.840> forces

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
linkages here the folio really forces

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.199 
linkages here the folio really forces
them<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.129> way<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.340> kind<00:02:19.819> of<00:02:19.849> do<00:02:20.060> that

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
them in a way to kind of do that

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.170 
them in a way to kind of do that
reflection<00:02:20.599> but<00:02:21.379> we<00:02:21.890> find<00:02:22.159> that<00:02:22.310> for<00:02:22.879> a<00:02:22.909> lot<00:02:23.150> of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
reflection but we find that for a lot of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.490 
reflection but we find that for a lot of
our<00:02:23.360> students<00:02:23.720> they<00:02:23.840> find<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.200> extremely

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
our students they find it extremely

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.070 
our students they find it extremely
helpful<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:26.030> helps<00:02:26.300> them<00:02:26.420> think<00:02:26.840> about

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
helpful and it helps them think about

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.809 
helpful and it helps them think about
the<00:02:27.260> value<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.620> their<00:02:27.769> education<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.580> value

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
the value of their education the value

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.670 
the value of their education the value
of<00:02:28.940> an<00:02:29.060> interdisciplinary<00:02:29.409> education<00:02:30.409> and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
of an interdisciplinary education and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.100 
of an interdisciplinary education and
then<00:02:30.980> how<00:02:31.610> they<00:02:31.819> will<00:02:32.060> actually<00:02:32.420> graduate

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
then how they will actually graduate

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.840 
then how they will actually graduate
with<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.290> whole<00:02:33.560> bunch<00:02:33.710> of<00:02:33.950> skills<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.640> they

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
with a whole bunch of skills that they

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.559 
with a whole bunch of skills that they
can<00:02:35.000> then<00:02:35.150> apply

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
can then apply

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.140 
can then apply
to<00:02:35.810> whatever<00:02:36.140> career<00:02:36.439> that<00:02:36.650> they<00:02:36.769> chose<00:02:37.150> we

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
to whatever career that they chose we

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.640 
to whatever career that they chose we
have<00:02:38.359> them<00:02:38.599> build<00:02:38.840> their<00:02:39.079> professional

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
have them build their professional

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.679 
have them build their professional
philosophy<00:02:40.159> page<00:02:40.400> by<00:02:40.999> the<00:02:41.060> end<00:02:41.359> I<00:02:41.629> think

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
philosophy page by the end I think

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.869 
philosophy page by the end I think
that's<00:02:42.049> one<00:02:42.319> of<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.469> strongest<00:02:43.069> pieces<00:02:43.340> of

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
that's one of the strongest pieces of

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.050 
that's one of the strongest pieces of
the<00:02:44.329> students<00:02:44.840> eportfolio<00:02:45.530> is<00:02:45.859> how<00:02:46.609> who<00:02:46.849> they

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
the students eportfolio is how who they

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.000 
the students eportfolio is how who they
want<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.329> be<00:02:47.450> professionally<00:02:48.319> so<00:02:48.560> that's<00:02:48.769> been
