00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.969
 we will be the forcados that we are going to take out 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.969
 painters 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.330
 because being there by bicycle 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.029
 please there's a cycle bike you have to go 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.250
 regulated and helmet please or do you have to 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.890
 get off and take her by the horns god 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.230
 the correct word not a loose oil 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.059
 but qualifying me but all sidewalk 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.059
 you have to go down only for the pedestrian 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.350
 but why calm quiet guy 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.670
 you have to use the bike path just 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.730
 that did not give 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.859
 bicycles must circulate only 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.799
 by the bike paths or by the stream 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:08.619
 vehicular but in no way should 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.990
 do it on the sidewalks as the pedestrian 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:18.100
 you risk suffering some 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:23.080
 accident or also some bull we take 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.909
 the bull by the horns uncle if you go 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.800
 although on the bicycle do not use the 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:34.550
 banqueta and less using the cell phone 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.350
 but it is already hanging and you have to 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.940
 get off the bull and take it by the 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.580
 horns walking while you go by the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:47.800
 sidewalk until it arrives we can only 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:51.900
 carry carrying a lot like the very same 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.900
 now we are ready and the extraterrestrial 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.260
 from my in the opposite direction 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.030
 where are we going to climb on the sidewalk 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:22.070
 because it is dangerous but forward 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:24.730
 thanks is a tough bull uncle 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.350
 you have to use the bike path 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.270
 you look like you look like 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.020
 einstein then it should be more 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.020
 smart 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.050
 cyclists 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.050
 banquets only for desired 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.450
 because people have to understand that 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.750
 the bike path and two sidewalks for the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.750
 drawer 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:02.239
 As you can see, I like that in these 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.239
 Mexican males turn you on 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.060
 we go for the steer that comes where 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.760
 should not 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:21.240
 let's take it to the bike path 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:24.630
 we load the uncles 12 but low and walk 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.540
 with the bicycle's low bicycle and 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.500
 push that is the way to do it 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.240
 very well 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.790
 come on uncle 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.709
 that we can congratulate you 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.079
 You're the only one who has grabbed the 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.109
 bike 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:47.340
 and it does it like it has to be 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:47.340
 You are a great Mexican bravo on shoulders 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:58.829
 that we have grabbed a bull that was 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.870
 where 930 mature the word then 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.120
 I say you can not use the sidewalk if 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.709
 well on a bicycle do not use the sidewalk 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.040
 father of the bike path 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.590
 or 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.260
 but he is a compadre of the seagulls 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.470
 we do not accept corruption 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.690
 in no time man 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.770
 but I'm going to tell you if it's foolish what 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:27.990
 that goes by the bike path 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.990
 it gets hot takes this year 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.430
 ahead
