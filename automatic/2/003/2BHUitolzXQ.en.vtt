00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
with the first game top gear might

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.929 
with the first game top gear might
actually<00:00:22.260> be<00:00:22.619> my<00:00:22.859> favorite<00:00:23.250> racing<00:00:23.550> game<00:00:23.730> on

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
actually be my favorite racing game on

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.759 
actually be my favorite racing game on
the<00:00:24.060> Super<00:00:24.180> Nintendo<00:00:24.420> not<00:00:24.900> named<00:00:25.170> Super<00:00:25.590> Mario

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the Super Nintendo not named Super Mario

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.920 
the Super Nintendo not named Super Mario
Kart<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.519> reason<00:00:26.820> why<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.090> because<00:00:27.480> of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
Kart and the reason why is because of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.109 
Kart and the reason why is because of
the<00:00:28.019> three<00:00:28.349> elements<00:00:28.580> strategy<00:00:29.580> within<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the three elements strategy within the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.330 
the three elements strategy within the
racing<00:00:30.480> itself<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.410> you're<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:31.650> just<00:00:31.890> holding

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
racing itself so you're not just holding

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.610 
racing itself so you're not just holding
down<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.520> button<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.149> turning<00:00:33.360> your<00:00:33.780> car<00:00:34.020> left

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
down a button and turning your car left

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.799 
down a button and turning your car left
and<00:00:34.829> right<00:00:35.010> there's<00:00:35.309> more<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> than<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
and right there's more to it than the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.369 
and right there's more to it than the
first<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.040> four<00:00:38.250> cars<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.700> choose<00:00:38.910> from

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
first you get four cars to choose from

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.930 
first you get four cars to choose from
each<00:00:40.379> car<00:00:40.739> has<00:00:41.040> its<00:00:41.250> own<00:00:41.309> strengths<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
each car has its own strengths and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.850 
each car has its own strengths and
weakness<00:00:42.360> whether<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.989> higher<00:00:43.170> top<00:00:43.440> speed

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
weakness whether it's a higher top speed

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860 
weakness whether it's a higher top speed
with<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> weakness<00:00:44.820> being<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.450> consumes

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
with a weakness being that it consumes

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.500 
with a weakness being that it consumes
fuel<00:00:46.200> faster<00:00:46.680> or<00:00:47.100> whether<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.210> better

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
fuel faster or whether it's a better

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.650 
fuel faster or whether it's a better
tire<00:00:48.899> grip<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:49.739> better<00:00:49.920> turning<00:00:50.660> slower

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
tire grip for better turning slower

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.860 
tire grip for better turning slower
times<00:00:52.020> etc<00:00:52.590> etc<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:54.090> second<00:00:54.510> element<00:00:54.840> of

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
times etc etc the second element of

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.110 
times etc etc the second element of
strategy<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.500> refueling<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> some<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
strategy is refueling in some of the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.670 
strategy is refueling in some of the
longer<00:00:57.480> races<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.109> into<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> pit<00:00:58.649> stop

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
longer races going into a pit stop

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.430 
longer races going into a pit stop
there's<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> requirement<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.059> when<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.930> refuel

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
there's a requirement so when you refuel

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
there's a requirement so when you refuel
and<00:01:01.770> how<00:01:01.949> much<00:01:02.190> fuel<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.390> be

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and how much fuel you take in can be

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
and how much fuel you take in can be
tricky<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.799> sit<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.010> your<00:01:05.129> ass<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.580> there

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
tricky if you sit on your ass in there

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.219 
tricky if you sit on your ass in there
for<00:01:05.850> too<00:01:05.970> long<00:01:06.180> everyone's<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.020> pass

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
for too long everyone's going to pass

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.780 
for too long everyone's going to pass
you<00:01:07.470> or<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.310> picked<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.670> more

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
you or if you picked a more

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.640 
you or if you picked a more
fuel-efficient<00:01:09.570> car<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.140> might<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.590> able

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
fuel-efficient car you might not be able

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.870 
fuel-efficient car you might not be able
to<00:01:10.770> complete<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> whole<00:01:11.340> race<00:01:11.580> without

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
to complete the whole race without

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.620 
to complete the whole race without
refueling

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
refueling

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.230 
refueling
but<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> gas<00:01:13.890> come<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.460> ah<00:01:15.680> get<00:01:16.680> there

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
but on a gas come on ah get there

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.249 
but on a gas come on ah get there
yeah<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> third<00:01:21.119> element<00:01:21.329> of<00:01:21.630> strategy<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
yeah the third element of strategy is

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.319 
yeah the third element of strategy is
the<00:01:22.409> use<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> three<00:01:23.159> nitros<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.149> for

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
the use of the three nitros you get for

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.840 
the use of the three nitros you get for
each<00:01:24.509> race<00:01:24.899> a<00:01:25.229> nice<00:01:25.740> row<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> burst<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.640> speed

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
each race a nice row is a burst of speed

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.670 
each race a nice row is a burst of speed
that<00:01:27.240> will<00:01:27.299> propel<00:01:27.600> your<00:01:27.750> car<00:01:27.899> way<00:01:28.140> faster

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that will propel your car way faster

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.679 
that will propel your car way faster
than<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.130> normally<00:01:29.159> go<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.390> don't<00:01:30.540> want

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
than it would normally go you don't want

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.120 
than it would normally go you don't want
to<00:01:30.780> shoot<00:01:30.960> your<00:01:31.080> wad<00:01:31.289> with<00:01:31.590> these<00:01:31.770> or<00:01:31.979> you'll

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
to shoot your wad with these or you'll

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.590 
to shoot your wad with these or you'll
be<00:01:32.280> dead<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.640> water<00:01:32.700> towards<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> end<00:01:33.479> of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
be dead in the water towards the end of

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.160 
be dead in the water towards the end of
the<00:01:33.659> race

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the race

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.870 
the race
so<00:01:34.530> yeah<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.399> of<00:01:35.520> those<00:01:35.610> three

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
so yeah it's because of those three

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.160 
so yeah it's because of those three
things<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.330> make<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.630> game<00:01:36.869> worth<00:01:37.110> playing

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
things that make this game worth playing

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.109 
things that make this game worth playing
nowadays<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.220> keeps<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.520> difficulty

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
nowadays it keeps the difficulty

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.240 
nowadays it keeps the difficulty
balanced<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.350> game<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.770> hard

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
balanced not that this game is that hard

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.889 
balanced not that this game is that hard
to<00:01:41.490> begin<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.600> not<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.840> easy

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
to begin with but it's not that easy

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.520 
to begin with but it's not that easy

that's<00:02:29.459> nice<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.000> all<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.570> problem<00:02:30.600> with

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
that's nice and all but the problem with

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.810 
that's nice and all but the problem with
that<00:02:31.079> is<00:02:31.500> all<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.100> really<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.549> do<00:02:32.670> is

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
that is all you really have to do is

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.890 
that is all you really have to do is
just<00:02:33.000> buy<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.239> nitro<00:02:33.810> upgrade<00:02:34.230> right

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
just buy the nitro upgrade right

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.110 
just buy the nitro upgrade right
and<00:02:35.080> you'll<00:02:35.530> win<00:02:35.709> every<00:02:35.890> race<00:02:36.220> no<00:02:36.459> problem

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
and you'll win every race no problem

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.030 
and you'll win every race no problem
that's<00:02:37.659> because<00:02:37.900> instead<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.260> just<00:02:38.409> three<00:02:38.739> you

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
that's because instead of just three you

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.399 
that's because instead of just three you
get<00:02:39.220> six<00:02:39.610> nitros<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.480> game<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:41.349> you

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
get six nitros in this game so you

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.780 
get six nitros in this game so you
barely<00:02:41.709> even<00:02:41.950> have<00:02:42.129> to<00:02:42.250> think<00:02:42.430> about<00:02:42.549> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
barely even have to think about the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.640 
barely even have to think about the
timing<00:02:43.269> or<00:02:43.420> picking<00:02:43.750> your<00:02:43.900> spots<00:02:44.230> or<00:02:44.440> anything

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
timing or picking your spots or anything

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.830 
timing or picking your spots or anything
like<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.010> just<00:02:45.819> nitro<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.390> hell<00:02:46.540> out<00:02:46.720> of

simple my biggest issue though as Top
Gear<00:02:53.980> too<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.640> they<00:02:54.760> completely<00:02:55.150> remove

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
Gear too is that they completely remove

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.020

now one of my favorite things about Top
Gear<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.760> if<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.090> happen<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.480> miss<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
Gear is that if you happen to miss the

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.110
