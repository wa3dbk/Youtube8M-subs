and<00:03:00.720> then<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.200> right<00:03:01.350> hand<00:03:01.380> will<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.830> D

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
and then the right hand will have a D

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.750 
and then the right hand will have a D
and<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:03.360> e<00:03:03.630> flat<00:03:04.250> d<00:03:05.390> c<00:03:06.390> b<00:03:06.420> flat<00:03:07.460> left<00:03:08.460> hand<00:03:08.700> is

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
and then e flat d c b flat left hand is

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.550 
and then e flat d c b flat left hand is
going<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.940> be<00:03:09.030> on<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> B<00:03:09.390> flat<00:03:09.660> below<00:03:10.020> middle<00:03:10.260> C

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
going to be on a B flat below middle C

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.540 
going to be on a B flat below middle C
and<00:03:11.340> then<00:03:11.490> down<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.000> G<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:13.650> together<00:03:14.100> here

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
and then down to a G so together here

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.600 
and then down to a G so together here
together<00:03:17.550> here<00:03:18.710> so<00:03:19.710> starting<00:03:20.100> right<00:03:20.280> here<00:03:20.310> we

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
together here so starting right here we

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.360 
together here so starting right here we
have<00:03:24.290> all<00:03:25.290> right<00:03:25.470> let's<00:03:26.010> go<00:03:26.160> from<00:03:26.310> the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
have all right let's go from the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.830 
have all right let's go from the
beginning<00:03:26.520> that<00:03:26.790> far<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.360> starting<00:03:27.720> at<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
beginning that far so starting at the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:39.070 
beginning that far so starting at the
very<00:03:28.080> beginning

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.660 

and<00:03:40.080> then<00:03:40.349> continuing<00:03:40.860> on<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.130> have<00:03:41.280> a<00:03:41.310> seed

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
and then continuing on we have a seed

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.280 
and then continuing on we have a seed
and<00:03:42.590> then<00:03:43.590> they<00:03:43.890> say<00:03:44.400> you're<00:03:44.640> gonna<00:03:44.790> be<00:03:45.000> flat

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
bumper left an has an A below middle C

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.559 
bumper left an has an A below middle C
and<00:03:54.480> i<00:03:54.720> sharpened<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.890> gene<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:57.030> then<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.300> lower

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
and i sharpened a gene and then a lower

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.500 
and i sharpened a gene and then a lower
d<00:03:57.989> right<00:03:58.290> here<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:59.400> then<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.610> heidi<00:04:00.209> above

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
d right here and then a heidi above

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.800 
d right here and then a heidi above
middle<00:04:00.690> C<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.830> then<00:04:02.790> we'll<00:04:03.030> see<00:04:03.330> then<00:04:03.660> be

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
middle C and then we'll see then be

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.009 
middle C and then we'll see then be
Fleming<00:04:04.380> Hey<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:05.700> we<00:04:05.790> have<00:04:06.000> pom<00:04:06.569> pom<00:04:07.170> pom<00:04:07.500> um<00:04:07.830> um

now it's going to repeat back so I have
it<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.440> little<00:04:30.560> repeat<00:04:30.980> sign<00:04:31.250> there<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:32.330> little

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
it a little repeat sign there a little

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.020 
it a little repeat sign there a little
go<00:04:33.410> back<00:04:33.620> arrow<00:04:33.980> so<00:04:34.310> go<00:04:34.430> back<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:34.820> very

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
go back arrow so go back to the very

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.600 
go back arrow so go back to the very
beginning<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.930> play<00:04:36.710> until<00:04:37.010> you<00:04:37.310> see<00:04:37.490> the
