00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.590
 [Music] 

00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.049
 and me that we are here that are me gray neither 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.050
 let's bring you a new game mode 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.549
 that will arrive in the tidal event 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.419
 ardent you already know this that is 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.339
 set in stagnant waters and this 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.500
 new game mode is called the 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:21.680
 black market fighters or something like that 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.510
 and it's a very good game mode very much yours 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.970
 on the map of 5 v 5 and basically because 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.700
 apart from having gold there is a coin 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.879
 special called cracking you get 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.950
 a crack in every 60 seconds you get 2 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.190
 kraken with a death 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.800
 with an assistance you hold a kraken 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.010
 When a male or a dragon is obtained, a 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.830
 kraken to each team player and 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.960
 eliminate a blue or red bug from the 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.420
 enemy jungle also grants you a 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.640
 kraken so I'm fast crack in 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.500
 direct 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.930
 It serves to contract and improve 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.760
 wrestlers that we are going to draw us and 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.020
 that will replace the subjects 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.520
 normal is true in this mode 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.180
 destroy an inhibitor will not do that 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.520
 appear super subjects but yes that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.729
 will improve the performance of all 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.290
 subjects in that good line we are 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.650
 talking about fighters and you do not know what 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.080
 the fuck is it, these are the subjects 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.410
 specials that we can hire and there 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.560
 several types we have this one first that is 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.600
 basically a siege tank that 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.970
 they accessed the towers and it has damage 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.310
 reduced by the tower we can upload 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.380
 level and improve their skills 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.770
 here you see level 1 level 2 level 3 is not 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.770
 knows how much kraken is short against 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.600
 but then we have this unit that 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.710
 it's called resort pins which is a 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.710
 chasing champion 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.440
 well here we have another that basically 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.400
 one thing from other champions but that 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.980
 shoot from a distance 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.119
 then here is in a kind of 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.040
 submarine that is a one support unit 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.410
 that is supposed to support the subjects 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.630
 with which it goes and good to remember what 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.240
 that every saying we hire every 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.660
 fighter that we hire will appear in 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.900
 each wave in each line of agreement and 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.660
 that we can improve it other than that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.350
 we have new objects with passives and 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.950
 active we are crazy we have for 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.960
 example the typhoon charge that says that 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.850
 basic attacks grant charge 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.100
 malicious and when an enemy is hit 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.570
 after three accumulations performed 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.750
 three attacks with a maximum speed 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.850
 of attack but inflict half of the year 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.010
 it's worth it or it's crazy apart 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.020
 obviously it is of harm the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.120
 attack speed and speed of 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.230
 move and have a car this yes 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.959
 gold cost vale 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.640
 we have other objects here like the 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.190
 mili plate 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.170
 this was basically a bling that had 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.510
 by ejido a blind activation is 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.940
 transports thrown to 360 units of 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.730
 far 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.380
 objects that are crazy you will have the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.380
 list of achilles 3 living 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.650
 and they are all with passive effects apart from 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.079
 that have stuck whatever they have 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.280
 very curious passive or active effects 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:31.250
 It's crazy and we'll see how 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.060
 ends in this game mode and the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.859
 truth is that it seems pretty 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.389
 interesting seems interesting enough 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.400
 we have here that the basic attacks 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.109
 download a moment in my case in 12 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.230
 Physical damage points every two charges 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.800
 good 26 years object is an object of 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.310
 tank 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.560
 many objects that there is enough object 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.270
 the enchantment of boots web portal 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.360
 that teleports 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.950
 the target ally in the cock knows a 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.620
 enchantment that allows you to have tele 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.700
 for crazy guy is crazy about what
