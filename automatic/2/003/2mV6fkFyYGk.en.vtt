00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and basically what happened was I was

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.650 
and basically what happened was I was
using<00:00:26.039> split-screen<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.820> test<00:00:27.060> things<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
using split-screen to test things and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.390 
using split-screen to test things and
for<00:00:27.990> whatever<00:00:28.109> reason<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.590> doesn't<00:00:28.830> work<00:00:29.010> I

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
for whatever reason it doesn't work I

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.220 
for whatever reason it doesn't work I
don't<00:00:29.640> know<00:00:29.730> why<00:00:29.970> you're<00:00:30.570> supposed<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:31.080> have

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
don't know why you're supposed to have

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.500 
don't know why you're supposed to have
the<00:00:31.410> pro<00:00:31.619> perks<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.399> stuff<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.149> I

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the pro perks and all that stuff and I

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.479 
the pro perks and all that stuff and I
don't<00:00:34.079> know<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.530> whatever<00:00:34.680> reason<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.219> didn't

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
don't know for whatever reason it didn't

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.920 
don't know for whatever reason it didn't
work<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.940> tested<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.600> split<00:00:36.809> screen

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
work because I tested it in split screen

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.549 
work because I tested it in split screen
again<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> got<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> same<00:00:37.890> results<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
again I got the same results but I

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.229 
again I got the same results but I
decided<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.829> go<00:00:40.950> test<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.579> private<00:00:41.910> match

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
decided to go test it in a private match

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.080 
decided to go test it in a private match
instead<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:44.190> using<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
instead of just using you know the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
instead of just using you know the
offline<00:00:45.450> split<00:00:45.840> screen<00:00:46.110> because<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.920> private

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
offline split screen because the private

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.060 
offline split screen because the private
match<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> same<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.440> know<00:00:49.530> coding

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
match has all the same you know coding

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.369 
match has all the same you know coding
or<00:00:50.160> whatever<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> online<00:00:51.059> multiplayer<00:00:51.600> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
or whatever is the online multiplayer is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.569 
or whatever is the online multiplayer is
it's<00:00:52.590> essentially<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.039> same<00:00:53.219> thing<00:00:53.280> it's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
it's essentially the same thing it's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.069 
it's essentially the same thing it's
just<00:00:53.640> you're<00:00:54.329> playing<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.629> private<00:00:54.960> match

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
just you're playing a private match

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
just you're playing a private match
instead<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.530> public<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.430> i<00:00:56.460> retested<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.180> there

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
instead of public so i retested it there

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.520 
instead of public so i retested it there
and<00:00:57.649> what<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> did<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.550> added<00:01:00.289> three<00:01:01.289> base

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
perks that really weren't that important

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.530

you<00:04:49.200> can<00:04:49.290> see<00:04:49.470> in<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.620> ac-130<00:04:50.100> I'm<00:04:50.340> clearly

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
you can see in the ac-130 I'm clearly

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.740 
you can see in the ac-130 I'm clearly
showing<00:04:51.270> up<00:04:51.540> on<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.720> ac-130<00:04:52.290> as<00:04:52.530> well<00:04:53.750> you

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
showing up on the ac-130 as well you

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.390 
showing up on the ac-130 as well you
know<00:04:54.840> again<00:04:55.170> it's<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.650> red<00:04:55.830> box<00:04:56.100> you

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
know again it's the red box you

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.480 
know again it's the red box you
shouldn't<00:04:56.760> see<00:04:56.910> that<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.330> have<00:04:57.360> blind<00:04:57.840> eye<00:04:58.050> on

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
shouldn't see that I have blind eye on

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.530 
shouldn't see that I have blind eye on
there's<00:04:59.490> no<00:04:59.730> you<00:05:00.000> know<00:05:00.120> I<00:05:00.150> shouldn't<00:05:00.480> be

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
there's no you know I shouldn't be

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.470 
there's no you know I shouldn't be
showing<00:05:00.750> up<00:05:00.960> at<00:05:01.380> all<00:05:01.830> period<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.970> like<00:05:03.300> I<00:05:03.420> said

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
showing up at all period so like I said

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.370 
showing up at all period so like I said
this<00:05:03.870> is<00:05:03.930> kind<00:05:04.230> of<00:05:04.260> a<00:05:04.380> big<00:05:04.590> deal<00:05:05.840> especially<00:05:06.840> in

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
this is kind of a big deal especially in

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.450 
this is kind of a big deal especially in
Search<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.710> Destroy<00:05:07.740> like<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.100> said<00:05:08.250> because

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
Search and Destroy like I said because

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.620 
Search and Destroy like I said because
you<00:05:08.550> could<00:05:08.700> earn<00:05:08.760> your<00:05:08.970> specialist<00:05:09.390> one<00:05:09.510> of<00:05:09.570> us

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
you could earn your specialist one of us

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.150 
you could earn your specialist one of us
and<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:09.930> you<00:05:10.560> know<00:05:10.680> and<00:05:10.800> then<00:05:10.920> you<00:05:11.010> don't

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
and I you know and then you don't

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.980 
and I you know and then you don't
respawn<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.270> worked<00:05:12.420> hard<00:05:12.660> to<00:05:12.840> actually

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
respawn and you worked hard to actually

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.600 
respawn and you worked hard to actually
get<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.410> specialist<00:05:13.920> bonus<00:05:14.190> which<00:05:14.280> isn't

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
get the specialist bonus which isn't

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.940 
get the specialist bonus which isn't
easy<00:05:14.700> to<00:05:14.910> do<00:05:15.030> in<00:05:15.150> Search<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.510> Destroy<00:05:15.540> so<00:05:16.080> you

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
easy to do in Search and Destroy so you

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.710 
easy to do in Search and Destroy so you
know<00:05:17.070> it's<00:05:17.280> good<00:05:17.340> it's<00:05:17.700> fairly<00:05:18.060> common<00:05:18.420> i

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
know it's good it's fairly common i

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.970 
know it's good it's fairly common i
would<00:05:18.840> think<00:05:18.930> i'm<00:05:19.169> actually<00:05:19.350> surprised<00:05:19.830> no

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
would think i'm actually surprised no

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.280 
would think i'm actually surprised no
one<00:05:20.130> noticed<00:05:20.460> this<00:05:20.580> yet<00:05:20.850> but<00:05:20.990> you<00:05:21.990> know<00:05:22.020> it's

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
one noticed this yet but you know it's

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.260 
one noticed this yet but you know it's
fairly<00:05:22.530> common<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:23.100> see<00:05:23.430> a<00:05:23.460> predator<00:05:23.910> missile

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
fairly common to see a predator missile

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.090 
fairly common to see a predator missile
in<00:05:24.390> search<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:24.690> destroy<00:05:24.870> or<00:05:25.290> like<00:05:25.680> i<00:05:25.800> said<00:05:25.980> in

in search and destroy or like i said in
demolition<00:05:26.640> because<00:05:26.850> people<00:05:27.150> use<00:05:27.270> them<00:05:27.419> to

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
demolition because people use them to

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.980 
demolition because people use them to
protect<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.930> bombs<00:05:28.140> and<00:05:28.850> i<00:05:29.850> don't<00:05:30.480> know<00:05:30.600> if<00:05:30.780> i

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
was a glitch or something but here i

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.540

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
three clips into it to finally kill it

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.340 
three clips into it to finally kill it
and<00:05:50.240> which<00:05:51.240> tells<00:05:51.540> you<00:05:51.690> know<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:51.990> blind<00:05:52.229> i

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.140 
to lock on quikr either which like I
said<00:06:01.169> is<00:06:01.590> it's<00:06:01.950> kind<00:06:02.220> of<00:06:02.280> a<00:06:02.400> big<00:06:02.580> deal<00:06:02.610> because
