00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
probably use a black one for science and

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.260

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
weight like you can use them there's so

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.050 
weight like you can use them there's so
much<00:05:38.200> easier<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:38.860> like<00:05:39.010> right<00:05:39.220> way<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:40.000> the

much easier to like right way and the

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.029 
much easier to like right way and the
key<00:05:40.360> was<00:05:40.389> like<00:05:40.780> new<00:05:41.470> colors<00:05:41.889> used<00:05:42.610> to<00:05:42.760> be<00:05:42.940> like
