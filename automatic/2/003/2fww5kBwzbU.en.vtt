41 Mark Spitz has dived headlong into a

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500 
41 Mark Spitz has dived headlong into a
comeback<00:01:36.010> but<00:01:36.430> I<00:01:36.460> think<00:01:36.700> my<00:01:36.820> motivation<00:01:37.000> now

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
comeback but I think my motivation now

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.899 
comeback but I think my motivation now
is<00:01:37.689> to<00:01:37.810> do<00:01:37.960> something<00:01:38.229> that<00:01:38.380> in<00:01:39.250> one<00:01:39.490> sense<00:01:39.760> has

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
is to do something that in one sense has

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.010 
is to do something that in one sense has
never<00:01:40.119> been<00:01:40.270> done<00:01:40.420> before

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
never been done before

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.690 
never been done before
and<00:01:41.409> I<00:01:41.500> think<00:01:41.560> that's<00:01:41.860> what<00:01:42.010> really<00:01:42.159> motivates

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
and I think that's what really motivates

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.100 
and I think that's what really motivates
me<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:46.210> sort<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.659> it's<00:01:46.900> so<00:01:47.110> bizarre

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.620 

that<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.400> know<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.760> may<00:01:51.940> have<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.120> possibility

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
that you know it may have a possibility

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.490 
that you know it may have a possibility
of<00:01:52.810> being<00:01:53.050> successful<00:01:53.290> I'm<00:01:53.800> not<00:01:53.980> sure<00:01:54.220> yet
