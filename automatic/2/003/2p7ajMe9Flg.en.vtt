hi this is Jim ensel in portland oregon
i<00:00:03.840> am<00:00:04.319> going<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.650> show<00:00:04.710> you<00:00:04.859> how<00:00:04.950> i<00:00:05.069> built<00:00:05.279> my

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
i am going to show you how i built my

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.450 
i am going to show you how i built my
own<00:00:05.549> solar<00:00:06.390> pathfinder<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.980> i<00:00:08.040> started<00:00:08.340> out

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
own solar pathfinder so i started out

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.790 
own solar pathfinder so i started out
with<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.700> piece<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:08.940> scrap<00:00:09.389> wood<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:10.380> happens

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
with a piece of scrap wood this happens

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.700 
with a piece of scrap wood this happens
to<00:00:10.889> be<00:00:11.010> three<00:00:11.849> quarters<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.210> an<00:00:12.420> inch<00:00:12.509> thick<00:00:12.929> so

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
to be three quarters of an inch thick so

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.120 
to be three quarters of an inch thick so
it's<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.950> one<00:00:14.219> by<00:00:14.370> material<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.150> nine<00:00:15.420> inches

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
it's a one by material it's nine inches

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.609 
it's a one by material it's nine inches
wide<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.000> foot<00:00:18.390> long<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.439> could

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
wide and it's a foot long but you could

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.570 
wide and it's a foot long but you could
use<00:00:19.650> plywood<00:00:20.160> or<00:00:20.670> anything<00:00:21.000> else<00:00:21.500> I<00:00:22.500> then<00:00:23.400> took

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
use plywood or anything else I then took

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.080 
use plywood or anything else I then took
a<00:00:23.640> piece<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> quarter-inch<00:00:24.990> material<00:00:25.970> you<00:00:26.970> can

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
a piece of quarter-inch material you can

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.659 
a piece of quarter-inch material you can
see<00:00:27.359> here<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.640> cut<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> radius<00:00:31.460> sorry<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
see here and cut a radius sorry a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.810 
see here and cut a radius sorry a
diameter<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.300> seven<00:00:33.660> inches<00:00:34.219> out<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
diameter of seven inches out of it and

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.850 
diameter of seven inches out of it and
you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:38.540> offset<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.780> circle<00:00:40.379> so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
you can see that I offset the circle so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.119 
you can see that I offset the circle so
that<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.160> actually<00:00:41.570> didn't<00:00:42.829> didn't<00:00:43.829> complete

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that it actually didn't didn't complete

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.209 
that it actually didn't didn't complete
itself<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:46.739> piece<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> wood

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
itself here so this this piece of wood

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.580 
itself here so this this piece of wood
is<00:00:47.610> seven<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.480> quarter<00:00:50.030> this<00:00:51.030> direction

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
is seven and a quarter this direction

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.810 
is seven and a quarter this direction
and<00:00:52.590> there's<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> bad<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.579> inch<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
and there's a bad an inch up here so it

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.950 
and there's a bad an inch up here so it
creates<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.910> nice<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.300> gap<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
creates this nice little gap here and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.750 
creates this nice little gap here and
that<00:00:58.050> will<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.260> important<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.399> minute<00:00:59.670> so

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
that will be important in a minute so

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.509 
that will be important in a minute so
that's<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.030> seven<00:01:00.390> inch<00:01:00.539> diameter<00:01:01.530> circle<00:01:03.049> I

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
that's a seven inch diameter circle I

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.600 
that's a seven inch diameter circle I
then<00:01:05.519> glued<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.540> stapled<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.220> or<00:01:08.220> screwed

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
then glued and stapled that or screwed

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.310 
then glued and stapled that or screwed
it<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.030> our<00:01:09.450> nail<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.810> ever<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.080> wanted

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it you do our nail that ever you wanted

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.030 
it you do our nail that ever you wanted
to<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.740> board<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:12.240> before<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> did<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
to this board but before I did that I I

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.130 
to this board but before I did that I I
don't<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.450> there's<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
don't know if you can see here there's a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.940 
don't know if you can see here there's a
line<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:17.159> runs<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.180> width<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.590> is

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
line that runs the width here that is is

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.580 
line that runs the width here that is is
or<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> length<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.210> board<00:01:21.540> which<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
or the length of this board which is the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.289 
or the length of this board which is the
center<00:01:22.890> line<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.610> board<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:28.729> then<00:01:29.729> took

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
center line to this board I I then took

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.390 
center line to this board I I then took
the<00:01:30.570> remnants<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.790> this<00:01:32.790> circle<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.759> cut<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
the remnants of this circle and cut a

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.569 
the remnants of this circle and cut a
piece<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.759> looks<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.979> this

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
piece that looks like this so that this

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.520 
piece that looks like this so that this
is<00:01:41.820> six<00:01:42.509> inches<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:43.909> diameter<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
is six inches in diameter here and it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.880 
is six inches in diameter here and it
then<00:01:46.860> fits<00:01:47.450> into<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.530> course<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
then fits into here because of course I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.899 
then fits into here because of course I
cut<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:52.340> now<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.369> something

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
cut it out and so I now have something

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:54.980 
cut it out and so I now have something
that<00:01:54.000> looks<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.210> little<00:01:54.329> bit<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> horseshoe

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that looks a little bit like a horseshoe

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.899 
that looks a little bit like a horseshoe
shape<00:01:56.360> on<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.840> back<00:01:58.079> side<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:59.219> took<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.670> piece<00:01:59.880> of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
shape on the back side I took a piece of

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.429 
shape on the back side I took a piece of
aluminum<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.600> didn't<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> use<00:02:01.140> steel

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
aluminum I didn't want to use steel

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.959 
aluminum I didn't want to use steel
because<00:02:01.770> there's<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.340> compass

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
because there's going to be a compass

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.670 
because there's going to be a compass
involved<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.140> took<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.439> piece<00:02:04.649> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
involved with this I took a piece of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.880 
involved with this I took a piece of
aluminum<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.610> see<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.180> raggedy

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
aluminum you can see it's just a raggedy

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.490 
aluminum you can see it's just a raggedy
piece<00:02:07.890> drill<00:02:08.759> four<00:02:09.030> holes<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.720> screwed<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
piece drill four holes and screwed it to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.920 
piece drill four holes and screwed it to
this<00:02:10.920> board<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.550> also

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
this board I also

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.449 
this board I also
tapped<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.950> quarter-inch<00:02:14.870> national<00:02:15.870> course

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
tapped a quarter-inch national course

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.849 
tapped a quarter-inch national course
hole<00:02:17.459> here<00:02:18.180> with<00:02:18.719> and<00:02:19.079> threaded<00:02:19.439> it<00:02:19.560> with<00:02:19.739> the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
hole here with and threaded it with the

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.520 
hole here with and threaded it with the
tap<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.299> can<00:02:21.420> screw<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.989> on<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.500> a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
tap so that I can screw this on to a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.860

regular<00:02:23.400> old<00:02:23.430> camera<00:02:24.000> tripod<00:02:24.719> I<00:02:25.079> did<00:02:25.680> drill<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
regular old camera tripod I did drill a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.500 
regular old camera tripod I did drill a
half-inch<00:02:27.870> hole<00:02:28.170> behind<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.609> hole<00:02:29.909> in<00:02:30.269> the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
half-inch hole behind this hole in the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.770 
half-inch hole behind this hole in the
wood<00:02:30.750> oh<00:02:31.200> maybe<00:02:32.389> three<00:02:33.389> eighths<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.599> an<00:02:33.689> inch

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
wood oh maybe three eighths of an inch

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.129 
wood oh maybe three eighths of an inch
deep<00:02:34.079> so<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:35.540> if<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.930> if<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:39.139> tripod

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
deep so that the if the if the tripod

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.289 
deep so that the if the if the tripod
bolt<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:41.489> would<00:02:41.609> go<00:02:41.730> into<00:02:41.879> this<00:02:42.060> whole

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
bolt that would go into this whole

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.509 
bolt that would go into this whole
happen<00:02:42.719> to<00:02:42.810> go<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.280> longer<00:02:44.280> than<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
happen to go be longer than the

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.610 
happen to go be longer than the
thickness<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.299> material<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:46.500> it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
thickness of this material that it

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.080 
thickness of this material that it
wouldn't<00:02:46.889> hit<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.099> wood<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.579> if<00:02:47.730> there<00:02:47.909> be

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
wouldn't hit the wood that if there be

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.240 
wouldn't hit the wood that if there be
an<00:02:48.239> area<00:02:49.200> there<00:02:49.470> for<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:52.590> then<00:02:52.739> how<00:02:52.889> to<00:02:52.950> use

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
an area there for it so then how to use

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.520 
an area there for it so then how to use
or<00:02:53.549> how<00:02:53.669> to<00:02:53.730> rest<00:02:54.569> of<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.810> way<00:02:54.959> here<00:02:55.260> I'm<00:02:55.379> going

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
or how to rest of the way here I'm going

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.899 
or how to rest of the way here I'm going
to<00:02:55.590> turn<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.859> around<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.639> away

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
to turn this around so that it's away

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.740 
to turn this around so that it's away
from<00:02:57.209> me<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:58.500> bought<00:02:59.010> from<00:02:59.430> solar<00:02:59.909> Pathfinder

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
from me I bought from solar Pathfinder

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.360 
from me I bought from solar Pathfinder
this<00:03:03.230> template<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.889> for<00:03:05.129> my

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
this template and this is for my

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.050 
this template and this is for my
latitude<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.019> sits<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.590> here<00:03:08.219> and<00:03:08.459> then

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
latitude and so it sits in here and then

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.649 
latitude and so it sits in here and then
it's<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.540> one<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.409> was<00:03:10.560> seven<00:03:10.919> inches<00:03:11.250> and

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
it's the one that was seven inches and

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.330 
it's the one that was seven inches and
I've<00:03:12.659> actually<00:03:12.930> installed<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.980> don't<00:03:14.159> if<00:03:14.250> you

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
I've actually installed I don't if you

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.360 
I've actually installed I don't if you
could<00:03:14.519> see<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.909> there<00:03:15.389> a<00:03:17.569> pin<00:03:18.569> on<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.799> center

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
could see it there a pin on the center

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.240 
could see it there a pin on the center
line<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.479> can<00:03:21.720> rotate<00:03:22.940> around<00:03:25.250> on

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
line so that this can rotate around on

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.469 
line so that this can rotate around on
that<00:03:26.669> on<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.000> center<00:03:27.810> line<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.729> up<00:03:29.729> here<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
that on that center line and up here the

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.140 
that on that center line and up here the

line the center line that I drew on this
board<00:03:33.419> extends<00:03:33.930> above<00:03:34.169> because<00:03:34.949> there's<00:03:35.400> a

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
board extends above because there's a

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.719 
board extends above because there's a

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
case or a 16 degrees east and so I can

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:49.280 
case or a 16 degrees east and so I can
turn<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.669> 16<00:03:44.669> degrees<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:46.849> then<00:03:47.849> I<00:03:48.209> did<00:03:49.079> also

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
turn it 16 degrees and then I did also

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.999 
turn it 16 degrees and then I did also
bought<00:03:49.680> from<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.400> solar<00:03:50.609> Pathfinder<00:03:51.419> this<00:03:52.009> dome

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
bought from a solar Pathfinder this dome

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.339 
bought from a solar Pathfinder this dome
and<00:03:53.479> hindsight<00:03:54.479> I<00:03:54.629> think<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.019> could<00:03:55.199> probably

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
and hindsight I think you could probably

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.550 
and hindsight I think you could probably
use<00:03:55.680> any<00:03:55.949> dome<00:03:56.959> I've<00:03:57.959> seen<00:03:58.229> some<00:03:58.409> other

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
use any dome I've seen some other

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.899 
use any dome I've seen some other
YouTube<00:03:58.919> videos<00:03:58.949> for<00:03:59.489> people<00:03:59.759> look<00:03:59.879> like

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
YouTube videos for people look like

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.670 
YouTube videos for people look like
they've<00:04:00.209> used<00:04:00.449> the<00:04:00.810> glass<00:04:01.079> lids<00:04:01.560> from<00:04:01.949> pot<00:04:03.680> but

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
they've used the glass lids from pot but

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.129 
they've used the glass lids from pot but
i<00:04:04.889> bought<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.189> stones<00:04:05.459> don't<00:04:05.909> from<00:04:06.150> them<00:04:06.359> and

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
i bought the stones don't from them and

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.110 
i bought the stones don't from them and
it<00:04:07.259> goes<00:04:07.439> on<00:04:08.150> as<00:04:09.150> well<00:04:09.599> here<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.699> then<00:04:11.699> this

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
it goes on as well here and then this

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.499 
it goes on as well here and then this
little<00:04:12.540> retaining<00:04:13.259> piece<00:04:14.060> retains<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.359> two

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
little retaining piece retains the two

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.360 
little retaining piece retains the two
together

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
together

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.520 
together
so<00:04:17.880> there<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.060> have<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:20.299> now<00:04:21.299> solar<00:04:21.690> Pathfinder

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
so there you have a now solar Pathfinder

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.659 
so there you have a now solar Pathfinder
I<00:04:23.310> made<00:04:24.030> some<00:04:24.199> clips<00:04:25.199> made<00:04:25.530> some<00:04:25.770> clips<00:04:26.130> on<00:04:26.430> the

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
I made some clips made some clips on the

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.640 
I made some clips made some clips on the
side<00:04:26.940> here<00:04:26.970> out<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:28.350> aluminum<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:31.020> just<00:04:31.380> can

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
side here out of aluminum that just can

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.520 
side here out of aluminum that just can
turn<00:04:32.130> slightly<00:04:32.810> I'll<00:04:33.810> show<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.110> live<00:04:34.229> in<00:04:34.410> just

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
turn slightly I'll show you live in just

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.960 
turn slightly I'll show you live in just
a<00:04:34.650> second<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:36.630> can<00:04:36.810> see<00:04:37.340> if<00:04:38.340> I<00:04:38.610> can<00:04:38.699> get<00:04:38.790> this

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
a second you can see if I can get this

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.210 
a second you can see if I can get this
light<00:04:39.840> right<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.260> can<00:04:40.410> see<00:04:40.560> this<00:04:40.710> clip<00:04:41.070> and

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
light right you can see this clip and

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.590 
light right you can see this clip and
you<00:04:41.280> can<00:04:41.400> see<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.639> clips<00:04:41.910> that<00:04:42.120> holds<00:04:42.449> this

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
you can see this clips that holds this

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.450 
you can see this clips that holds this
ring<00:04:42.870> in<00:04:42.990> place<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:43.500> now<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.710> whole<00:04:43.979> thing<00:04:44.220> is

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
ring in place so now the whole thing is

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.390 
ring in place so now the whole thing is
not<00:04:45.150> going<00:04:45.479> anywhere<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.770> now<00:04:46.919> this<00:04:47.100> would<00:04:47.280> be

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
not going anywhere so now this would be

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.900 
not going anywhere so now this would be
mounted<00:04:47.820> on<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.000> tripod<00:04:48.710> using<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:50.070> tripod

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
mounted on a tripod using this tripod

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.960 
mounted on a tripod using this tripod
mount<00:04:51.210> here<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.500> tripod<00:04:52.949> and<00:04:53.370> this<00:04:53.729> would

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
mount here and the tripod and this would

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.450 
mount here and the tripod and this would
need<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.180> be<00:04:54.650> level<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:56.210> my<00:04:57.210> tripod<00:04:57.449> has<00:04:57.900> a

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
need to be level and my tripod has a

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.760 
need to be level and my tripod has a
bubble<00:04:59.460> level<00:04:59.789> on<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.180> so<00:05:00.389> I<00:05:00.419> can<00:05:00.750> level<00:05:01.350> it<00:05:01.470> the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
bubble level on it so I can level it the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.290 
bubble level on it so I can level it the
head<00:05:01.949> of<00:05:02.039> the<00:05:02.130> tripod<00:05:02.520> before<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:02.910> screw<00:05:03.240> this

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
head of the tripod before I screw this

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.450 
head of the tripod before I screw this
on<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:04.800> could<00:05:05.010> also<00:05:05.160> go<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.610> a<00:05:05.820> RV

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
on you could also go to a RV

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.100 
on you could also go to a RV
recreational<00:05:08.460> vehicle<00:05:09.120> supply<00:05:09.479> store<00:05:09.810> and

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
recreational vehicle supply store and

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.990 
recreational vehicle supply store and
then<00:05:10.260> for<00:05:10.560> three<00:05:11.310> or<00:05:11.370> four<00:05:11.430> dollars<00:05:11.820> they

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
then for three or four dollars they

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.370 
then for three or four dollars they
would<00:05:12.180> sell<00:05:12.419> you<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:13.490> bubble<00:05:14.490> level<00:05:14.940> that

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
would sell you a bubble level that

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.740 
would sell you a bubble level that
levels<00:05:16.380> all<00:05:16.590> four<00:05:16.830> directions<00:05:17.010> at<00:05:17.639> once<00:05:17.750> and

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
levels all four directions at once and

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.710 
levels all four directions at once and
then<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.460> compass<00:05:20.460> can<00:05:20.669> sit<00:05:20.880> back<00:05:21.060> here<00:05:21.419> and<00:05:21.479> you

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
then a compass can sit back here and you

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.219 
then a compass can sit back here and you
can<00:05:21.870> rotate<00:05:22.110> this<00:05:22.560> so<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:24.479> line

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
can rotate this so that the the line

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.430 
can rotate this so that the the line
that<00:05:25.979> runs<00:05:26.250> on<00:05:26.700> the<00:05:26.880> board<00:05:26.910> runs<00:05:27.539> due<00:05:28.110> south

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
that runs on the board runs due south

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.089 
that runs on the board runs due south
and<00:05:28.770> then<00:05:29.300> take<00:05:30.300> a<00:05:30.330> picture<00:05:30.720> from<00:05:30.870> above<00:05:31.229> which

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
and then take a picture from above which

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.060 
and then take a picture from above which
I've<00:05:32.310> taken<00:05:33.270> one<00:05:33.570> that<00:05:33.750> I'll<00:05:33.870> include<00:05:34.139> at<00:05:34.919> the

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
I've taken one that I'll include at the

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.570 
I've taken one that I'll include at the
end<00:05:35.190> of<00:05:35.250> this<00:05:35.340> video<00:05:36.770> so<00:05:37.770> my<00:05:37.979> intention<00:05:38.430> is<00:05:38.520> to

so<00:06:15.040> here's<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.520> center<00:06:16.000> line<00:06:16.300> that<00:06:16.570> I've<00:06:16.720> been

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
so here's the center line that I've been

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.510 
so here's the center line that I've been
talking<00:06:17.410> about<00:06:17.500> you<00:06:17.860> can<00:06:18.010> see<00:06:18.190> it<00:06:18.280> running

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
talking about you can see it running

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.080 
talking about you can see it running
through<00:06:18.910> and<00:06:19.150> on<00:06:19.270> on<00:06:19.840> through<00:06:20.380> all<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.740> way

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
through and on on through all the way

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.600 
through and on on through all the way
and<00:06:22.090> then<00:06:22.330> I<00:06:22.810> have<00:06:23.020> a<00:06:23.050> compass<00:06:23.980> here<00:06:24.220> that<00:06:24.490> I'm

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
and then I have a compass here that I'm

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.270 
and then I have a compass here that I'm
going<00:06:24.760> to<00:06:24.880> put<00:06:25.090> on<00:06:25.240> that<00:06:25.480> line<00:06:25.780> and<00:06:26.190> then<00:06:27.190> I

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
going to put on that line and then I

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.860 
going to put on that line and then I
have<00:06:27.490> lined<00:06:27.820> up<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.840> needle<00:06:29.940> so<00:06:30.940> that<00:06:31.090> it's<00:06:31.270> on

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
have lined up the needle so that it's on

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.220 
have lined up the needle so that it's on
the<00:06:32.110> line<00:06:32.350> maybe<00:06:33.190> it<00:06:33.430> make<00:06:33.640> it<00:06:33.790> better<00:06:34.110> if<00:06:35.110> I

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
the line maybe it make it better if I

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:41.550 
the line maybe it make it better if I
did<00:06:35.380> that<00:06:36.450> like<00:06:37.450> that<00:06:38.160> so<00:06:39.240> I've<00:06:40.240> also<00:06:40.480> up<00:06:41.350> here

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
did that like that so I've also up here

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.240 
did that like that so I've also up here
you<00:06:42.520> can<00:06:42.700> see<00:06:43.000> that<00:06:43.390> I've<00:06:43.540> set<00:06:43.870> it<00:06:43.900> for<00:06:44.320> 16

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
you can see that I've set it for 16

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.970 
you can see that I've set it for 16
degrees<00:06:45.430> east<00:06:45.880> declination<00:06:46.540> so<00:06:47.530> that<00:06:47.710> South

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
degrees east declination so that South

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.980 
degrees east declination so that South
actually<00:06:48.580> is<00:06:48.760> is<00:06:49.350> more<00:06:50.350> off<00:06:50.650> this<00:06:51.010> direction

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
actually is is more off this direction

00:06:51.990 --> 00:07:00.440 
actually is is more off this direction
truce<00:06:52.990> out<00:06:55.050> so<00:06:56.760> just<00:06:57.760> back<00:06:58.060> up<00:06:58.240> a<00:06:58.330> little<00:06:58.450> bit

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
truce out so just back up a little bit

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.620 
truce out so just back up a little bit
here's<00:07:01.450> what<00:07:01.660> the<00:07:01.780> whole<00:07:01.900> thing<00:07:02.140> looks<00:07:02.380> like
