00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hey people today it is again a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.910
 flocking around what we are in 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.950
 biggest on the back of football 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.410
 trainings or other jerseys and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.090
 Although the number at the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.730
 Returns number is 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.890
 a flop that jersey for the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.779
 Game operation has needed and there is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.350
 actually relatively little too 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.779
 note 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.760
 In general, that is always the case 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.010
 free design possibility that is 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.840
 it is possible the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.150
 font of the numbers to choose yourself 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 as well as the blog act on that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.210
 went right now one more time 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.739
 However, I want one of the most important 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.500
 point things out 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.690
 the higher numbers is a standard size 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.930
 and they are adults 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.910
 jerseys around 25 cm kids jerseys from 164 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.950
 176 are mixed with 20 cm 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 as you said you have the possibility 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.840
 not just the font numbers too 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.370
 choose but also the procedure 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.100
 Generally you will be transfered 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
 made flop that is it is one the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.809
 Numbers are stamped on and then on 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.299
 the jersey pressed on with heat like that 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.400
 does it happen that the numbers really 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.960
 on the jersey stay on the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.460
 stairs the numbers have a good one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 Shelf life needs no worries 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.170
 make that numbers somehow 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.840
 break or become porous somewhere 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.060
 but the numbers are really long 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 on the jersey on it and hold her as well 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.130
 as I said have the free 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.500
 design possibilities 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.259
 another option and now too 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.540
 times a different font numbers 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.750
 to accommodate a jersey is one 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.729
 flex hole a flex film is why 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.560
 interesting because one with it 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.450
 floating effects can show 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.729
 that means something like here you can 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.680
 achieve a shiny effect and 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.119
 You can be as gold silver as we are now 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.610
 here in the example have pictures 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.280
 and so can be flockhart with this 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.970
 or with this print also numbers 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.220
 depict 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.500
 with those very nice straight 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.780
 visual effects like that golden over 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.910
 can be generated just a third 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.300
 Art flocking a number is next to it 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.310
 also the direct becomes very rare 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.040
 because you usually used the more 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.259
 Transfer used for the numbers can 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.020
 however, as it is here as well 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.700
 in the director prof 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.260
 it is a something 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.570
 special number we have now in 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.070
 selection falling what design as said 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.050
 but the number of types determines her 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.200
 of course I would now 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.840
 I'm interested in what numbers I want 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.760
 you like to have which blog like the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.100
 dearest for numbers let me know 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.370
 via facebook youtube or sometimes 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.370
 offender
