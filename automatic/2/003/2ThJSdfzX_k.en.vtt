00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
unsweetened we're going to use three

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.620

if you really like don't if you think

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.859 
if you really like don't if you think
that<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> texture<00:01:21.330> needs<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> little

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that the texture needs to be a little

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.289 
that the texture needs to be a little
bit<00:01:22.049> more<00:01:22.350> liquid<00:01:22.729> then<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.000> go<00:01:24.180> ahead

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
bit more liquid then you can go ahead

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.149 
bit more liquid then you can go ahead
and<00:01:24.689> maybe<00:01:24.840> use<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> little<00:01:25.680> bit<00:01:25.770> more<00:01:26.009> yogurt

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
and maybe use a little bit more yogurt

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.649 
and maybe use a little bit more yogurt
we're<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> start<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.420> three

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
we're going to start with three

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.810 
we're going to start with three
tablespoons<00:01:28.009> now<00:01:29.009> what's<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.490> good<00:01:29.790> about

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
tablespoons now what's really good about

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
tablespoons now what's really good about
the<00:01:30.150> yogurt<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.020> has<00:01:31.259> protein<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the yogurt is that it has protein and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460 
the yogurt is that it has protein and
calcium<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.150> which<00:01:33.360> are<00:01:33.570> obviously<00:01:34.170> really

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
calcium in it which are obviously really

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.410 
calcium in it which are obviously really
good<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:34.950> our<00:01:35.009> body<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.610> our<00:01:35.729> skin

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
good for our body for our skin

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.069

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
now the third ingredient is an egg white

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.010 
now the third ingredient is an egg white
so<00:01:41.040> we're<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.700> basically<00:01:41.970> separate<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
so we're going to basically separate the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.539 
so we're going to basically separate the
egg<00:01:43.170> whites<00:01:43.200> from<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> egg<00:01:44.040> yolk<00:01:44.189> because

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
egg whites from the egg yolk because

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.090 
egg whites from the egg yolk because
we're<00:01:44.790> only<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.270> use<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.960> egg<00:01:46.170> white<00:01:46.439> so

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
we're only going to use the egg white so

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.160 
we're only going to use the egg white so
we're<00:01:47.250> going<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.579> ahead<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.180> mix<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.049> all

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
we're going to go ahead and mix it all

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.630 
we're going to go ahead and mix it all
together

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640

close would be cold water so I just

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.340 
close would be cold water so I just
wanted<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:32.120> let<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.450> know<00:04:32.480> that<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.170> actually

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
wanted to let you know that I actually

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.790 
wanted to let you know that I actually
moved<00:04:33.890> the<00:04:34.010> mask<00:04:34.310> from<00:04:34.880> my<00:04:35.090> skin<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.800> it

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
moved the mask from my skin and it

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.750 
moved the mask from my skin and it
really<00:04:37.040> definitely<00:04:37.700> feels<00:04:38.230> softer<00:04:39.460> now<00:04:40.460> it

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
really definitely feels softer now it

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.210 
really definitely feels softer now it
took<00:04:41.000> me<00:04:41.180> actually<00:04:41.540> more<00:04:41.720> than<00:04:41.870> 15<00:04:42.350> minutes<00:04:42.830> it

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
took me actually more than 15 minutes it

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.160 
took me actually more than 15 minutes it
took<00:04:43.340> me<00:04:43.550> anywhere<00:04:43.580> between<00:04:44.060> 20<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:44.750> 30

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
took me anywhere between 20 and 30

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.520 
took me anywhere between 20 and 30
minutes<00:04:45.560> so<00:04:46.100> I<00:04:46.130> guess<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.580> depends<00:04:46.970> on

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
minutes so I guess it depends on

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.930 
minutes so I guess it depends on
whenever<00:04:48.530> you<00:04:48.860> feel<00:04:49.130> that<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.520> mask<00:04:49.730> is

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
whenever you feel that the mask is

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.390 
whenever you feel that the mask is
actually<00:04:50.300> dry<00:04:50.630> on<00:04:50.930> your<00:04:51.140> skin<00:04:51.560> then<00:04:52.100> you<00:04:52.250> can

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
actually dry on your skin then you can

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.810 
actually dry on your skin then you can
