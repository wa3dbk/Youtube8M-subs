00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.880
 hi to all those moons harris then 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.519
 today the test of a system of 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.349
 quick disassembly for flying the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.349
 zain brand racing 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:26.180
 then the zanchi racing kit includes a 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.610
 piece that is broken down into two parts 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.270
 you have a first part that gets 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.180
 fixed directly on the hub of your 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.050
 flying so you see here I already had 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.379
 an adaptable hub to fix any 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.710
 which steering wheel with a system 2 to 6 years to 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.540
 six holes so if you're never 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.190
 you have you have no hub you 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.650
 still have the original fixation 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.720
 it will be necessary to think of putting one for 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.320
 able to install this system then the 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.030
 first 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.420
 the first part you see this is 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.610
 fixed directly inside you have 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.989
 all the cables finally all the cards 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.920
 that allow you to connect the 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.800
 cables coming from the horn and after you 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.259
 see here in fact all this is the 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.530
 vices that make it possible to bring 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.950
 the electricity of the horn we see that the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.200
 system is screwed directly onto the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.990
 hub as if it was a steering wheel so 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.479
 no chance that it moves is 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.810
 solid and on this system 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:36.229
 he screen that allow you there 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:40.090
 block the steering wheel once it's in 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.119
 place then actually the holes are used to 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.220
 put the balls that are here 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.900
 on the piece that plug in except one 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.020
 which installs directly on the steering wheel 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:55.159
 Here we find the connection points 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.750
 for the horn that are in contact and 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.560
 all around you have the famous ones 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.259
 balls to be able to allow 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.090
 installing the device and doing it 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.149
 that it does not move at all we can 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.340
 see that the piece is very aluminum 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.140
 good quality anodized with a logo 5-5 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.290
 it's the very good quality it takes 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.299
 know that the system is still 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.060
 big enough then I'm going to show you 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.959
 so already with the hub it made me 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.230
 a little space but if I add the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.230
 flying 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.299
 so here you see the frozen fly put 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.709
 in place just I find the screen 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.220
 here you see the balls are 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.470
 inserted 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.090
 it moves at all in against 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.879
 the disadvantage is that you see that 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.209
 makes a lot of ports because the piece 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.340
 all measures about 6 cm plus the hub 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.670
 it makes you a very big port for 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.010
 the steering wheel in addition to the g1 a steering wheel 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.799
 tulips and forward so that's me 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.269
 bring a lot closer 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.290
 so to remove it is very 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.629
 simple just press the button 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:13.540
 we catch the ring that we push towards 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:16.590
 we finally pull towards us and the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.370
 steering wheel comes off extremely easily 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.579
 to put it back 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.689
 nothing more simple just 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.730
 take the wheel 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:28.510
 and to prove to you that it's easy I 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.329
 even go m see it upside down the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.739
 recluse hands over to the location and there you 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.660
 see that it turns 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.669
 because I'm not in the banks 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.389
 row we hear the balls shot I 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:42.790
 turn I turn around and that's right 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.430
 we arrive at the right place 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.269
 the balls enter their location 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:52.500
 and it's solidarity it moves more than anything 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:55.269
 I make them look normal 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.180
 see it takes less than a second to 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.790
 remove him and their masters 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.940
 it's extremely easy 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.349
 recap on the system of 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.019
 Quick disassembly of the steering wheel 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.329
 singh then as I already said it 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.659
 see that it's very good finish to 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.620
 bare anodized aluminum so there me 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.729
 I had taken in blue but must know 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.639
 that it is available in almost 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:20.109
 all the colors the price I do not have any 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.549
 still spoken but it's enough 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.139
 reasonable considering that you can the 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.750
 order on the zinc site that racing 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.530
 for 65 euros including postage 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.800
 so it's not very expensive compared to 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.289
 other systems of the same kind that are 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.169
 very expensive or both dual 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.360
 triple the price of it 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.349
 it's a good quality I remember that 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.509
 zaki racing is a brand that works 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.819
 with a lot of drifting team so 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.310
 on circuit so it's not the stuff I 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.699
 would say to laugh that it's really 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.430
 high performance equipment 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:00.330
 It is compatible with all hubs to 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.219
 six holes see here so easily 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.870
 installable in almost every 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:10.770
 vehicle models after against the 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.069
 flat it's actually instead that he 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.159
 take 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:18.659
 see that makes you a really fucking hub 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:21.479
 long so it can affect your setting 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:23.159
 of the steering wheel but for me who am in 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.259
 bucket seats I can assure you 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:27.900
 that being able to dismount the 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:31.050
 flying it helps me a lot because I could 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.639
 to adjust the seats each time so 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.259
 here it is a product that I use 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.370
 now everyday for a little 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.599
 less than a year 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.279
 I really recommend it is the 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.870
 good quality never had the slightest concern 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.379
 with while the car I use it 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.379
 daily 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:47.759
 I hope this video could have you 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.159
 to interest and you have brought more 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.990
 information about this system and 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.149
 I hope to see you again very soon 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.110
 for a new test on one tests all 

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:57.110
 points like see you soon
