00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.099
 hi friends are 28 days and so good in 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.110
 This chapter will teach you how to 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.480
 could I say how to change the subject of 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.309
 avalanche for example to put another version to 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.270
 your cell phone apart from the one we already know 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.640
 what is to be here 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.060
 and that's how we can put animations 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.980
 when turning the page while doing this if at 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.290
 Doing this can put noise 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.990
 or things like that, let's start but 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.850
 before I start, I suggest you 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.690
 den I liked to subscribe in the part of 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.809
 down 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.610
 I like it here so if they subscribe 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.470
 come my videos that I do corridos 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.140
 good channel the first thing we have to 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.050
 to do is in the place orchestra that Nestor 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.090
 is that this application is called go 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.340
 launcher that will be used for 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.220
 be able to change your android theme 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.840
 we are going to open with launcher once 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.329
 already arrive installed with the woman we are going to 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.420
 open it to see how it can be 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.050
 animation 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.050
 is loading 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.900
 This laser provided but with my menu 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.400
 as you will see, the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.400
 start presentation as I had already 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.010
 we had known before for example 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.490
 this little thing here was here and now 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.590
 it is on average 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.500
 while they are new things that you have with 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.439
 launcher as you will see also changed 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.930
 the lashes the camera is different 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.409
 and my files play these settings 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.899
 also and change minecraft youtube all 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.250
 and in return and as you will see those of certain 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.780
 continue to load you're ready to 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.220
 use 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.870
 let's see I think it's not ready yet 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.870
 I hope it loads a little more 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.250
 I believe that and to the best 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.710
 I think it's cake 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.920
 and there it is 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.829
 ok i 'm going to work a little bit because as 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.759
 are the application to one of endurance my 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.250
 cellular because it has many 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.830
 explanations because we're going to wait for 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.700
 that is composed well 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.950
 and at the end it looks like it's a cube 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.070
 the google wide animation 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.560
 For example we passed him and he would pass 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.760
 band-aid as it is already work was a bit 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.760
 bad this 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:28.540
 the writings of four bertero is 7 other 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:32.980
 Once there is is circling the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.570
 turtle speed we are going to give you the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.720
 part of here to see the menu as 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.720
 is 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.180
 as you will see, it has changed a lot 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.340
 that you could say it changes a lot 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.340
 energy version how we do it 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.810
 but that continues to provoke a little 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.870
 and this one that bears to sell it 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.540
 and as you will see this is different since you 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:04.189
 appears to Android search apps and other 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.310
 more versions for example god that 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.080
 was talking was a way to 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.060
 encourage your cell 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.980
 here we can also change the tone 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.950
 to the animation we put adjustments 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.030
 we go to the management part and 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.080
 transition or transition or transition 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.879
 horizontal transition and here they are 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.590
 what ways in which we 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.019
 we can put a spin we already have this 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.040
 of wheel we can also put you sphere 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.040
 let's see how the sphere is 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.410
 as you will see the spheres as if it were a 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.170
 world a bowl 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.950
 is a very father animation which I go 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.210
 launcher go launcher is free 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.930
 and here you see the things more than 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.060
 you can know 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.129
 is very father that discovered whole to me 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.620
 I liked it a lot but honestly I 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.409
 like the thief version more or a little 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.650
 when I want to open this version 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:02.769
 to stop a little good friends and already 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.750
 when for example they want to remove only 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.900
 I created you to see I think it's lapacho 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.090
 let's go here and we have several options 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.370
 if we want to go something global blanchett 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.590
 launcher or initiates that are here 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.590
 that we are going to give him there only once 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.720
 is erasing everything I did 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.240
 in the version that we already know as the 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.320
 healing of the crisis is eight days and 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.910
