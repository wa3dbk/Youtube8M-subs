00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
in when you're using a i i really

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.130 
in when you're using a i i really
recommend<00:03:06.430> taking<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.300> ball<00:03:07.450> towards<00:03:08.050> the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
recommend taking that ball towards the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.870 
recommend taking that ball towards the
inside<00:03:08.230> first<00:03:09.010> away<00:03:09.280> from<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.520> three-point

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
inside first away from the three-point

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.370 
inside first away from the three-point
line<00:03:09.940> because<00:03:10.300> that's<00:03:10.450> pretty<00:03:10.720> much<00:03:10.900> his<00:03:11.080> only

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
line because that's pretty much his only

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.650 
line because that's pretty much his only
weak<00:03:11.560> spot<00:03:11.830> on<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.130> court<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:12.970> if<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.330> were<00:03:13.480> you

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
weak spot on the court so if I were you

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.600 
weak spot on the court so if I were you
the<00:03:14.200> best<00:03:14.410> thing<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.560> do<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:14.890> if<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.459> have<00:03:15.550> a
