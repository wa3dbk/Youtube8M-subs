system<00:00:09.780> will<00:00:10.410> get<00:00:10.590> serial<00:00:11.130> number<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:12.300> when

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
system will get serial number one when

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.169 
system will get serial number one when
somebody<00:00:13.620> purchases<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.309> once<00:00:14.519> these<00:00:14.700> systems

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
somebody purchases it once these systems

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.810 
somebody purchases it once these systems

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
a brushed finish so this front fan

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.470 
a brushed finish so this front fan
grille<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.800> painted<00:00:50.550> red<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.329> actually

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
overall specs so this video card right

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.740 
overall specs so this video card right
here<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.369> why<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.790> release<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.299> system

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
here this is why we release the system

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.510 
here this is why we release the system
there<00:01:34.170> aren't<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.530> whole<00:01:34.560> lot<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> these<00:01:35.130> cards

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
there aren't a whole lot of these cards

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.190 
there aren't a whole lot of these cards
out<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.909> right<00:01:36.090> now<00:01:36.270> they're<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:36.630> limited

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
out there right now they're very limited

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.730 
out there right now they're very limited
supply<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.570> only<00:01:39.930> building<00:01:40.290> five<00:01:40.530> of

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
supply so we are only building five of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.380 
supply so we are only building five of
these<00:01:40.860> systems<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
these systems with it but is this is the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.450 
these systems with it but is this is the
sixty<00:01:42.750> nine<00:01:42.780> ninety<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.220> here

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
sixty nine ninety so you can see here

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.859 
sixty nine ninety so you can see here
there's<00:01:44.670> two<00:01:44.850> back<00:01:45.030> plates<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.659> means

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
there's two back plates so that means

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
at the fall 880 megahertz clock speed so

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.450

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
you'll get the max

you'll get the max
performance<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:13.210> we've<00:02:13.360> also<00:02:13.540> got<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:14.200> gigabyte

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
p67 au d7 that is a b3 board so it is a

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
what the overall finished case looks

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.390 
what the overall finished case looks
like<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.360> so<00:03:55.990> so<00:03:56.680> yeah<00:03:56.800> that's<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.280> other

myself<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.990> bring<00:04:08.530> these<00:04:08.740> systems<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.550> market

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
myself to bring these systems to market

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.670 
myself to bring these systems to market
I'll<00:04:10.210> be<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.780> first<00:04:11.020> to<00:04:11.200> tell<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:11.410> guys

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
I'll be the first to tell you guys

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.500 
I'll be the first to tell you guys
they're<00:04:12.040> not<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.460> hundred<00:04:12.730> percent<00:04:12.880> perfect

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
they're not a hundred percent perfect

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.990 
they're not a hundred percent perfect
but<00:04:14.170> they<00:04:14.350> are<00:04:14.560> handcrafted<00:04:15.070> so<00:04:15.730> there's

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
but they are handcrafted so there's

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.970 
but they are handcrafted so there's
little<00:04:16.630> imperfections<00:04:17.350> in<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.530> paint

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
little imperfections in the paint

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.250 
little imperfections in the paint
honestly<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.640> masking<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.359> building<00:04:19.810> was

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
honestly the masking the building was

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.070 
honestly the masking the building was
done<00:04:20.530> by<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:20.950> two<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.549> us<00:04:21.669> completely<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.630> I

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
done by the two of us completely and I

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.350 
done by the two of us completely and I
think<00:04:23.350> for<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.800> price<00:04:23.950> would

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
think for the price would

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.879 
think for the price would
I haven't<00:04:24.689> really<00:04:24.960> talked<00:04:25.199> about<00:04:25.349> much<00:04:25.500> up

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
I haven't really talked about much up

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.050 
I haven't really talked about much up
till<00:04:26.099> now<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:27.530> 9999<00:04:28.560> it's<00:04:28.889> more<00:04:29.789> than

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
till now of to 9999 it's more than

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.570 
till now of to 9999 it's more than
reasonable<00:04:30.539> it's<00:04:30.840> uh<00:04:31.110> it's<00:04:31.590> actually<00:04:32.129> a<00:04:32.159> crazy

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
reasonable it's uh it's actually a crazy

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.550 
reasonable it's uh it's actually a crazy
good<00:04:32.849> value<00:04:33.240> considering<00:04:33.689> the<00:04:34.229> kind<00:04:34.469> of

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
good value considering the kind of

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.339 
good value considering the kind of
hardware<00:04:34.860> you're<00:04:35.129> looking<00:04:35.460> at<00:04:35.639> and<00:04:36.349> the

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
hardware you're looking at and the

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.559 
hardware you're looking at and the
custom<00:04:38.039> nature<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.520> this<00:04:38.669> particular<00:04:39.300> little

let me grab the camera from you and I'm
just<00:04:57.000> going<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.710> get<00:04:58.860> some<00:04:59.069> close-up

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
just going to so to get some close-up

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.279 
just going to so to get some close-up
shots<00:04:59.580> of<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.360> parts<00:05:00.629> that<00:05:00.719> I<00:05:00.870> think<00:05:01.139> are

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
shots of the parts that I think are

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.110 
shots of the parts that I think are
important<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:02.129> here's<00:05:02.340> what<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.639> top<00:05:02.819> grille

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
important so here's what the top grille

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.809 
important so here's what the top grille
looks<00:05:03.330> like<00:05:03.889> you<00:05:04.889> can<00:05:05.069> see<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.400> got<00:05:05.550> a<00:05:05.580> good

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
looks like you can see you got a good

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.129 
looks like you can see you got a good
glow<00:05:06.029> there<00:05:06.270> because<00:05:06.569> the<00:05:06.689> lights<00:05:06.870> actually

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
glow there because the lights actually

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.529 
glow there because the lights actually
over<00:05:08.099> on<00:05:08.219> the<00:05:08.370> other<00:05:08.400> side<00:05:08.580> under<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.240> case

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
over on the other side under the case

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.240 
over on the other side under the case
itself<00:05:09.930> here<00:05:10.199> so<00:05:10.349> it<00:05:10.409> lights<00:05:10.590> up<00:05:10.740> these<00:05:10.949> fans

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
itself here so it lights up these fans

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.100 
itself here so it lights up these fans
really<00:05:11.639> nice<00:05:11.819> okay<00:05:12.539> at<00:05:12.629> the<00:05:12.689> bottom<00:05:12.990> you<00:05:13.080> can

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110
