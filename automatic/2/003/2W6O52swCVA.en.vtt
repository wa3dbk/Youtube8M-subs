00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
I think an overall solid round with the

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.629 
I think an overall solid round with the
dark<00:05:29.849> hair<00:05:30.379> yeah<00:05:31.379> and<00:05:31.529> have<00:05:31.649> to<00:05:31.769> do<00:05:31.949> get<00:05:32.159> me<00:05:32.369> to

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129 
mind for the rest of the night I think

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:54.859 
mind for the rest of the night I think
you<00:05:53.249> know<00:05:53.399> I<00:05:53.459> would<00:05:53.489> give<00:05:54.119> that<00:05:54.300> round<00:05:54.479> to

00:05:54.859 --> 00:05:54.869 
you know I would give that round to

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:57.019 
you know I would give that round to
Bedard<00:05:55.279> not<00:05:56.279> sure<00:05:56.519> if<00:05:56.610> anybody<00:05:56.789> could

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:57.029 
Bedard not sure if anybody could

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.559 
Bedard not sure if anybody could
possibly<00:05:57.419> see<00:05:57.629> it<00:05:57.689> differently<00:05:59.029> if<00:06:00.029> someone

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:00.569 
possibly see it differently if someone

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:01.999 
possibly see it differently if someone
gave<00:06:00.779> that<00:06:00.989> round<00:06:01.259> to<00:06:01.409> myself<00:06:01.739> in<00:06:01.949> that

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
gave that round to myself in that

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.879 
gave that round to myself in that
particular<00:06:02.279> case<00:06:02.749> he<00:06:03.749> reversed<00:06:04.139> on<00:06:04.469> there<00:06:04.739> was

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
particular case he reversed on there was

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.799 
particular case he reversed on there was
take<00:06:05.159> that<00:06:05.189> I<00:06:05.459> don't<00:06:05.729> I<00:06:06.300> guess<00:06:06.569> there's

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:06.809 
take that I don't I guess there's

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:08.209 
take that I don't I guess there's
argument<00:06:07.349> either<00:06:07.499> way<00:06:07.769> but<00:06:08.009> it<00:06:08.099> was

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.219 
argument either way but it was

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:09.350 
argument either way but it was
definitely<00:06:08.610> a<00:06:08.669> close<00:06:08.699> round

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
definitely a close round

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.619 
definitely a close round
I<00:06:09.419> thought<00:06:09.779> Eric<00:06:10.199> carried<00:06:10.739> the<00:06:11.449> carry<00:06:12.449> the

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:12.629 
I thought Eric carried the carry the

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.689 
I thought Eric carried the carry the
round<00:06:12.809> you<00:06:13.529> certainly<00:06:13.919> don't<00:06:14.129> know<00:06:14.339> what<00:06:14.550> the

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 
round you certainly don't know what the

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:16.609 
round you certainly don't know what the
judges<00:06:15.059> might<00:06:15.269> be<00:06:15.449> thinking<00:06:15.869> and<00:06:16.019> we<00:06:16.169> may<00:06:16.349> find

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:16.619 
judges might be thinking and we may find

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:18.679
