review<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.990> did<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.700> think<00:01:29.700> sideshows<00:01:30.540> step<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
review I did I think sideshows step it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.190 
review I did I think sideshows step it
up<00:01:31.290> through<00:01:31.530> game<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.450> their<00:01:33.450> figures<00:01:33.930> are

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
up through game and their figures are

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.670 
up through game and their figures are
getting<00:01:34.590> better<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.220> better<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:36.650> i<00:01:37.650> think

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
getting better and better and i think

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.300 
getting better and better and i think
the<00:01:38.100> Star<00:01:38.430> Wars<00:01:38.729> series<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:40.009> one<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.159> those

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the Star Wars series is one of those

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.230 
the Star Wars series is one of those
areas<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:43.250> Jojo<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.640> are<00:01:44.880> getting<00:01:45.119> better

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.950 
areas and Jojo that's are getting better
and<00:01:45.479> better<00:01:47.090> I'd<00:01:48.090> say<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> was<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> little

fader<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.980> my<00:02:14.730> display<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.670> gotta<00:02:18.420> give<00:02:18.690> high

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260

marks to the storm trooper commander I

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.480 
marks to the storm trooper commander I
think<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.670> he's<00:02:24.510> well<00:02:24.870> worth<00:02:25.140> money<00:02:25.620> he's

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
think that he's well worth money he's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.060 
think that he's well worth money he's
pretty<00:02:26.640> easy<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.240> find<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.170> think<00:02:28.710> he's<00:02:28.860> one

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
pretty easy to find so I think he's one

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.200 
pretty easy to find so I think he's one
of<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.250> cooler<00:02:29.520> look<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:32.210> stormtrooper
