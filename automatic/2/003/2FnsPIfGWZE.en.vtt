00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:08.219
 Hi friends, I'm going to show you an application 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.660
 made in macros to generate the books 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.660
 electronics 2003 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.640
 this is a format each in 32 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.810
 columns 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.699
 to 32 column 32 is a calculated 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.669
 automatically the same as in the column 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.820
 one of the data that you see here 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.930
 are the columns that normally do not 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.780
 record in a purchase record 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.150
 there are empty data columns in 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.110
 white that the macro is going to fill 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.110
 that in this field here 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.900
 and we complete records we are click 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.460
 and the lower gestures are completed 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.780
 the threads that were missing the tip 50 this 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.000
 column 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.390
 once we do that we can generate 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.410
 the electronic book we go from here to 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.410
 I'm going to erase the general 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.200
 general 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.200
 generate 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.360
 ah 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.610
 this is the electronic book the file 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.400
 electronic that we have that is going to get 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.400
 with the play 3.0 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.430
 before we have let's try first 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.720
 and we paste it here we have testing 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.790
 sync is the p mode 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.970
 we do not know if we can validate that here 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.780
 archive 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.260
 of vanity 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.220
 we add the file 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.620
 this has generated and we open and now 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.380
 we validate equipment 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:07.580
 we see without errors and does not show rodrigo 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.580
 I can see the summary of the record 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.660
 cancel 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.530
 now 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.980
 we see what 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.480
 thanks to the macros you can generate 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.579
 our plane that is required for 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.930
 validate data obviously that if I 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:31.730
 change fx here as number two dates that 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.670
 do not correspond to the period then 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.189
 mark the code is the one that will vary 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.510
 here in this column all this is 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.780
 done just for this to 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.650
 identify when the dates 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.920
 according to the record that is made they are not going to 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.140
 change now 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.840
 well that 's about the record of 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.000
 I can not explain more of you 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.950
 come here 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.440
 fits in the rut the exercise the period 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.910
 a number that will normally go on the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.500
 archive 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.500
 txt of our plan 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.110
 work can work to pay 500 or more 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.110
 records depending 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.250
 let's see more quickly the feesl 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.650
 purchases 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.510
 this is the sales record up to 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.000
 of rents that has the same format what 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.820
 previous out are testing here with 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.640
 six records equal to fields that 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.170
 are missing fill the macro the whale the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.970
 field 27 also that are numbers 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.800
 the period field 1 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.510
 and we complete then 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.510
 and we see that they have been generated 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.450
 here 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.030
 and they have been filled by the data according to 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.690
 according to the structure that has given national 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.980
 it seems good in those fields 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.599
 I'm explaining very quickly 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.269
 you are going to realize that the 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.730
 file is easy to use just have 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.519
 to register your urgent purchases in 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.239
 the columns that should where they should 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.540
 according to according to this structure now 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.400
 we generate inde is also going to be generated 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.710
 here is going to generate lack here is 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.740
 they sell they buy to distribute of sold 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.740
 then we return from sales we generate 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.470
 has been generated now 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.049
 we think and validate another record 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:47.850
 the sales record this is 14 0 a 

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:50.380
 less 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.990
 we validate 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.500
 without our mistakes without errors and a 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.500
 constancy 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.480
 we cancel as it is proof we are 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.060
 testing we're validating it's just 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.220
 correct then with this application and 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.560
 we can generate all the files of 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.250
 purchases and events and we can validate it 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.250
 with the play 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.590
 but have any doubt 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.790
 write to my mail in the inscription 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.630
 of the video I leave my mail 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:25.720
 on how to get these two files 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.670
 they are very very important especially for 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.920
 the main contributing peaks that 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.100
 are required in this year to present 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.850
 the electronic book 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.850
 A) Yes
