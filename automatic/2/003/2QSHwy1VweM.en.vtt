00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
star and kind of just real consistent

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.410 
star and kind of just real consistent
the<00:00:35.190> whole<00:00:35.250> race<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:35.880> that's<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.210> kind

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the whole race I think that's what kind

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.840 
the whole race I think that's what kind
of<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.570> lot<00:00:36.750> was<00:00:36.960> I'm<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.980> writing<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.550> know

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
of a lot was I'm just writing you know

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.310 
of a lot was I'm just writing you know
consistent<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.570> hitting<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.050> my<00:00:40.140> lines

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
consistent and hitting all my lines

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.869 
consistent and hitting all my lines
every<00:00:40.710> life<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.309> think<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:41.700> what

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
every life and I think that's what

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.310 
every life and I think that's what
helped<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> lot<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> got

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
another rookie out there Justin Barcia

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.520 
another rookie out there Justin Barcia
but<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.210> seem<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.840> most<00:00:45.870> consistent

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
but you seem to be the most consistent

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.049 
but you seem to be the most consistent
out<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> rookies<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.520> year<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.910> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
out of the rookies this year in that

lights on the East Coast yeah East Coast
Lites<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.629> stacked<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.230> anything

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
Lites it's so stacked you know anything

can<00:00:52.800> happen<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.309> I've<00:00:53.879> been<00:00:54.059> consistent<00:00:54.570> so

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
can happen and I've been consistent so

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
can happen and I've been consistent so
far<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> hopefully<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:55.860> keep<00:00:56.190> it

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
far and hopefully we can just keep it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.310

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
it's like you don't know what to do

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.859 
it's like you don't know what to do
because<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.850> mean<00:01:33.150> no<00:01:33.270> one's<00:01:33.420> even<00:01:33.509> ridden

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
because it's I mean no one's even ridden

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.840 
because it's I mean no one's even ridden
it<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:35.100> confusing<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it so it's like kind of confusing and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.060 
it so it's like kind of confusing and
I'm<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.420> don't<00:01:36.720> know<00:01:36.990> what<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.650> but

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070

on a 450 do you think on that 250 that

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
on a 450 do you think on that 250 that
hey<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.710> got<00:01:49.920> enough<00:01:50.100> power<00:01:50.250> to

hey I can do that I got enough power to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.480 
hey I can do that I got enough power to
do<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.579> yeah<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> mean<00:01:52.250> my<00:01:53.250> bikes

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
do that yeah I think so I mean my bikes

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.510 
do that yeah I think so I mean my bikes
just<00:01:53.670> mean<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.290> fast<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.490> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
just mean it's just really fast and on a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
just mean it's just really fast and on a
small<00:01:56.939> tight<00:01:57.180> track<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> mean<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.200> going

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
small tight track I mean it's just going

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.980 
small tight track I mean it's just going
to<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.469> close<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.219> 450<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.509> they're<00:02:00.840> doing

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
to be close to 450 so if they're doing

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
to be close to 450 so if they're doing
something<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.500> don't<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.130> there's<00:02:02.280> any

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
something I don't think there's any

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.950 
something I don't think there's any
reason<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.850> should<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.240> able<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:03.810> it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
reason that we should be able to do it

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.990 
reason that we should be able to do it
