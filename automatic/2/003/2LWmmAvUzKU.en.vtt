00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.089
 [Music] 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.770
 and I was looking for a soap there 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.950
 How are you talking very well about yourself? 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.920
 of her daughter in Japanese magazines there 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.839
 I decided to try it and it helps 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.020
 activate circulation and prepare the skin 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.720
 to receive the motion emotion right 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.550
 So what I liked the most about him is the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.880
 texture of the soap even because it does 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.740
 a very consistent foam is and the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.350
 cool is that when you 're passing 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.329
 It starts to heat the skin, you do not 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.860
 know is that he's heating up affi 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.620
 superficially feel that he is 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.440
 activating the circulation same right 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.559
 and there is even the packaging here you have in the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 Packaging has some tips on how to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.559
 massage like this from here to music and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.680
 sold it said it was to use only 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.059
 morning then I bought this here is also 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.489
 the same line and helps remove 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.689
 dead cells and helps to unclog the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.010
 Pores too, right? 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:14.070
 I'll fool you, he's like law. 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.900
 thousand that he is right and so the net 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.100
 the packaging until explaining the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.960
 how much 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.350
 It's like a knee coin is 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.350
 More or less there we put that one 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:43.250
 that it makes it more consistent also 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:43.250
 I think it's very fragrant too. 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.280
 [Applause] 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.250
 it yields enough to do more good 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.220
 consistent with this one from here I am 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.440
 using the night is good 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.229
 At night I 'm passing this cream here 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.680
 What is it for the eye area? 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.440
 finally I and I quite liked it I 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.410
 quite liked the texture of it right 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.230
 It's kind of gel like that and when I 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.630
 I bought it, the girl also said that 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.170
 they lasted for 15 months 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.300
 I think you're loving the cool it is. 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.980
 he comes with this spatula is also that 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.510
 a lot of people do not know is that when 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.910
 people buy a cream so it is not good 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.310
 keep putting your hand is because of the add 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.790
 bacteria these things is always good to use 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.620
 the spatula is more good, you can not tell 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.019
 much difference is that like any 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.060
 product anti age we do not win the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.640
 fear and my expression or anything else is 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.640
 Good, but you always care.
