out on all these rare bricks that are in

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280 
out on all these rare bricks that are in
here<00:01:26.610> aren't<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.659> raring<00:01:27.869> no<00:01:28.080> more

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
here aren't going to be raring no more

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.080 
here aren't going to be raring no more
so<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:28.710> really<00:01:28.860> why<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.130> got<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.790> just

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so that's really why I got that is just

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.170 
so that's really why I got that is just
to<00:01:30.299> part<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.200> later<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:32.130> update<00:01:33.000> my

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.249 
to part it out later to update my
inventory<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> new<00:01:34.759> prices<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.259> think

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
inventory to get the new prices I think

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.490
