00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.680
 dutch national circus herman renz 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.660
 must close the tent at 7 after 115 years 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.240
 September represents the tax authorities 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.650
 the door and the plug must be removed 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.800
 i am waiting for us to find someone 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.539
 yah from the tax office you say 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.010
 then very simply the plug goes forward 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.539
 because who you walk two months with you 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.789
 wage tax behind the increased 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.710
 regulatory pressure on excise duties 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.410
 the ban on red diesel and from 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.240
 September a ban on wild animals 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.369
 and a blow to the company with 60 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.079
 man staff but also the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.079
 visitor numbers are declining 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.430
 millcote 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.360
 the circus how long with about yes 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.610
 as if it was up to me to 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.519
 actually other to the ministry of 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.739
 no longer because the rack is out of the 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.690
 cake is on the coffin the water stands us 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.570
 really literally figuratively 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.250
 our lips so yes it is very bad 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.420
 posed with the circus we have we 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.310
 have the last five years 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.950
 brand still needs that 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.180
 fewer visitors and that we put on 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.679
 this moment the last two years 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.929
 really only work for the 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.789
 to pay tax to him, he said 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.340
 willow that no longer 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.250
 how many yes we go among all sorts 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.259
 rules that we have 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.090
 pay 12 percent more to the 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.750
 sector taxes and we can't 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.460
 more on 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.649
 we can cough up new ones if diggle will 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.500
 I have taken nothing ourselves 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.509
 then I don't mind that much 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.979
 because i think the worst is that i think it 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.780
 company I had no longer exists 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.700
 where fought really hard for 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.080
 do I find the very first time the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.580
 application is a once but not anymore 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.520
 exists 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.069
 we exist 115 years this year 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.099
 and herman renz deep deep stands for 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.050
 even after 25 years and I am twenty of them 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:54.039
 I have been the director for years and I see it 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.500
 no more sitting 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.349
 We are really line together and 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.270
 however we do and try everything 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.860
 of possible they have to pay well too 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.289
 the tax as every netherlands do 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.479
 we really pay but that just comes on 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.690
 Right now so few people come there 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.760
 inside and 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.230
 yes we have to snap our taxpayers 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.510
 I also have it neat for years 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.070
 done just this year will give us the water 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.720
 so we can't afford it we pay 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.630
 want to pay we cannot pay 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.460
 like we don't before 7 september 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.200
 pay everything neatly then get the 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.330
 tax authorities unplug I think 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.950
 him very much by the competition you but me 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.690
 what I really think is that I have to do everything 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.800
 and that the villages are foreign 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.510
 competitors 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.940
 everywhere my way can go there then 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.320
 less in order through there and environmental policy 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.390
 is a German circus 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.610
 who drives so Amsterdam is under German 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.860
 license plate is not signaled one 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.650
 German circus is now in Breda I come 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.270
 less in Breda because there are environmental zones 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.410
 and a German circus has absolutely nothing there 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.510
 to do with it 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.550
 and I think that's unfair I think I had 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.350
 Dutch national circus must be on 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.420
 meet all requirements and my foreign 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.260
 colleagues who can do what they want 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.760
 they want to 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.460
 I pay my own blue him that way 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.690
 I run everything through generator and 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.790
 that is just not anymore either nowadays 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.410
 sometimes i guess the had struck 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.460
 calories not good how do I pay 60 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.710
 cents per liter 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.140
 to I pay over the euro and the 20th 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.700
 liter is it is just it is yes it is 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.350
 actually no when the inspection 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.880
 situation which does not occur at the moment 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.440
 for the Dutch national circus 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.510
 plays yes 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.250
 partly thanks to the current government policy 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.080
 that's just how it is 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.030
 burdens unfair 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.800
 competition from abroad that ride 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.450
 circus from hunting valuable the people 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.100
 but that she is just so thats there 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.510
 no wild animal man circle and 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.790
 commodore fewer visitors all 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.400
 government policy and I certainly will 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.140
 ambassador of dr van the circus of us 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.800
 certainly from our national circus herman 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.670
 renz and our pride since last year 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.010
 board 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.930
 officially into the folk culture of 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.769
 the netherlands but what did they do 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.030
 nothing 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.700
 they've got that naming there 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.290
 nothing and I am going to the government about this 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.630
 because the mother and income I 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.970
 how to help book on companies please 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.709
 save our national circus and I go 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.519
 that plea also with the government 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.690
 put it down 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.020
 during the budget treatment eh die 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.270
 are coming that's the last coming 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.940
 have until September 7 but then I go 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.260
 try to use my power and strength as lex 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.060
 the states will demand script 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.080
 children already apply and I want 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.180
 actually from searching to at least 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.799
 soon to ask for the big one 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.799
 tensions that place the room sectors
