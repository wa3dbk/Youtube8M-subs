this<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.420> little<00:00:03.840> tutorial<00:00:04.080> on<00:00:04.979> the

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:05.340 
this is a little tutorial on the

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.330 
this is a little tutorial on the
different<00:00:05.700> kinds<00:00:05.939> of<00:00:06.330> cat<00:00:06.630> chase<00:00:07.170> balls<00:00:07.529> that

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
different kinds of cat chase balls that

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.030 
different kinds of cat chase balls that
we<00:00:08.519> make<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.150> sell<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:10.110> thought<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:10.860> would

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
we make and sell I thought we would

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.369 
we make and sell I thought we would
start<00:00:11.070> with<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.700> smallest<00:00:12.089> ones<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.959> work

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
start with the smallest ones and work

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.919 
start with the smallest ones and work
our<00:00:13.589> way<00:00:13.769> forward<00:00:14.269> so<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.360> make<00:00:15.570> three

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
our way forward so we make three

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.460 
our way forward so we make three
different<00:00:16.410> kinds<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.460> small<00:00:18.360> chase<00:00:18.900> balls

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
different kinds of small chase balls

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.500 
different kinds of small chase balls
they're<00:00:19.860> about<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.430> size<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:21.120> a<00:00:21.240> ping<00:00:21.480> pong

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
they're about the size of a ping pong

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.240 
they're about the size of a ping pong
ball<00:00:21.780> some<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.620> them<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.890> little<00:00:22.980> bit

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
ball some of them are a little bit

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.370 
ball some of them are a little bit
smaller<00:00:23.640> some<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.330> them<00:00:24.420> are<00:00:24.540> a<00:00:24.570> little<00:00:24.690> larger

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
smaller some of them are a little larger

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.100 
smaller some of them are a little larger
they<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:25.920> all<00:00:26.310> handmade<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.270> that's<00:00:27.840> why

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
they are all handmade and that's why

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.880 
they are all handmade and that's why
there<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.440> a<00:00:28.560> variety<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:30.150> begin<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:30.890> we

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
there is a variety to begin with we

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.279 
there is a variety to begin with we
offer<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.579> brand<00:00:33.149> new<00:00:33.360> product<00:00:33.690> which<00:00:34.109> is<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
offer a brand new product which is a

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.529 
offer a brand new product which is a
little<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.920> call<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.280> woolly<00:00:35.519> ping<00:00:35.910> pong<00:00:36.179> you

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
little we call it a woolly ping pong you

little we call it a woolly ping pong you
can<00:00:36.929> see<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.320> about<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.800> size<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.820> ping

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
can see it's about the size of a ping

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.880 
can see it's about the size of a ping
pong<00:00:39.359> and<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.620> very<00:00:41.070> very<00:00:41.850> bouncy<00:00:42.269> I<00:00:42.890> don't

pong and it's very very bouncy I don't
know<00:00:44.010> quite<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.460> physics<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.999> why<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.420> so

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
know quite the physics of why it's so

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.649 
know quite the physics of why it's so
bouncy<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.920> completely<00:00:47.489> 100%<00:00:47.999> organic

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659

a<00:01:14.909> pom-pom<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.409> felt<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.310> means<00:01:17.850> that

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
a pom-pom but we felt it that means that

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.270 
a pom-pom but we felt it that means that
you<00:01:18.420> can't<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:19.079> pull<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.560> apart<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:20.039> cat

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
you can't just pull it apart the cat

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.859 
you can't just pull it apart the cat
will<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.520> able<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.180> pull<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.539> apart<00:01:21.630> because

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
will be able to pull it apart because

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.870 
will be able to pull it apart because
it's<00:01:22.110> felt<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.829> the<00:01:22.860> heart<00:01:23.219> which<00:01:23.850> means

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it's felt it in the heart which means

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.469 
it's felt it in the heart which means
that<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:25.289> fibers<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:25.829> in<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:27.060> under<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
that the fibers have in the under the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.260 
that the fibers have in the under the
influence<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> certain<00:01:28.710> kind<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.070> pH<00:01:29.399> hot

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
influence of a certain kind of pH hot

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.389 
influence of a certain kind of pH hot
water<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:30.810> friction<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.770> bound<00:01:32.130> themselves

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
water and friction have bound themselves

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.609 
water and friction have bound themselves
together<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.750> even<00:01:34.140> though<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.560> looks

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
together so even though this looks

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
together so even though this looks
really<00:01:35.009> delicate<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.850> tough<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.329> ball

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
really delicate it's a tough little ball

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.870 
really delicate it's a tough little ball
and<00:01:36.899> it's<00:01:37.079> also<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.530> bouncy<00:01:38.039> because<00:01:38.700> it's

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and it's also really bouncy because it's

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.389 
and it's also really bouncy because it's
fuzzy<00:01:39.180> cats<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.109> pick<00:01:40.289> it<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.710> carry<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
fuzzy cats can pick it up and carry it

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.459 
fuzzy cats can pick it up and carry it
around<00:01:41.549> which<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.299> course<00:01:42.329> cats<00:01:42.960> love<00:01:44.179> for<00:01:45.179> our
