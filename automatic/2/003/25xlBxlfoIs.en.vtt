00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.179 
want to be the last surviving team but
for<00:01:26.820> example<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.420> 15<00:01:27.780> minutes<00:01:28.080> run<00:01:28.229> run<00:01:29.009> out

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
for example if 15 minutes run run out

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
for example if 15 minutes run run out
and<00:01:29.430> there's<00:01:29.909> two<00:01:30.090> teams<00:01:30.240> surviving<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.020> team

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and there's two teams surviving the team

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
and there's two teams surviving the team
with<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> most<00:01:31.950> kills<00:01:32.280> wins<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
with the most kills wins so it's a

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270 
with the most kills wins so it's a
really<00:01:33.299> interesting<00:01:33.570> way<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> play<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
really interesting way to play and you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
really interesting way to play and you
know<00:01:35.430> 40<00:01:36.090> minutes<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.570> ended<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
most important perk I can suggest is

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.010 
most important perk I can suggest is
make<00:01:44.759> sure<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.060> engineer<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.869> can

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.139 
make sure you have engineer so you can
see<00:01:46.229> where<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> enemy<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.799> camping<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:48.030> know

I'm saying and here Alex was with me you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.999 
I'm saying and here Alex was with me you
know<00:01:51.119> what<00:01:51.899> suppose<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.380> me<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.740> they're

know what suppose with me and they're
both<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.430> good<00:01:53.670> players<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.540> tell
