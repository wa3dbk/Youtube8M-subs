00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.860
 how I cut my time and that 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.690
 that is already extremely long and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.630
 I do not see anymore 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.170
 I do not see anything anymore is very long and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.769
 I wanted to cut it a bit like that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.710
 and I'll show you today like you 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:35.130
 could save money by getting your hair 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:39.600
 itself cuts and with two kitchens the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.079
 The kitchen utensils he might 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.570
 already you have that you have for sure that is 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.449
 the teaching and please use one 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 scissors that really cuts one 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.940
 hour would be postponed 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.180
 curl and damage your hair 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.820
 and then I have a clip here zip or 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.600
 a clip crabs yes they are synonymous 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.590
 ikea namely how to use them to 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.680
 once opened products such as 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.869
 example flour or complex he too 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:25.140
 close and today I use that 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:29.189
 to cut my hair and yes is one 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.500
 is actually a cool idea and me 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.810
 I have never done so 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.180
 I'll test you now 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.900
 together 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.070
 so wishes me luck so 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:51.740
 let's get started 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:51.740
 I took my crest and 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.429
 I already have it so I have the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.170
 Hall already dried and stretched 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.799
 You can do very well with dry hair 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.560
 because you can work exactly the length 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.290
 which one you want to cut with 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.299
 Wet hair requires one centimeter 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.489
 expect to 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:26.750
 So cut faster for longer 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:31.560
 because they shorten when drying 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:39.720
 what I'm doing now is me 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:44.489
 take it and I know mine first 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.220
 hair through, I look that the end 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:55.310
 the side and the side I have to stay 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.310
 not somehow so cross the stay 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:10.489
 then I take the clips then I click 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:10.489
 it in the middle like that 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.990
 and push it forward depending on the length 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:23.790
 I want that I almost want that 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:31.140
 Going in years has fortis and 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:33.890
 then I take the bowl edg schnipp 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.890
 snap hair off 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:07.169
 So then I kind of cleanse my 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:17.139
 face because all the hair is 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:21.630
 I am insisting where help is indeed the 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:24.520
 you have to wash the face improved 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.130
 here comes the hour of truth 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.440
 So if I do not upload the video 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.900
 then it is said that it came to shit 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.900
 is and I'll show you 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.819
 So now I had my hair 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:06.039
 Again, stretch them evenly 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:10.039
 are like that and that is the finished cut 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:12.500
 I hope you liked it and me 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:15.430
 I hope I could do it that much easier 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.889
 how they did it imitate 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:23.419
 when I was little they've done that 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:28.270
 you have the courage tell me 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:30.919
 I want to know how that works and 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.180
 nice that you have turned on and 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.180
 Until next time
