00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
see that I'm going to let them cook for

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.740 
see that I'm going to let them cook for
a<00:01:11.260> couple<00:01:11.410> minutes<00:01:12.120> before<00:01:13.120> I<00:01:13.180> put<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.480> steaks

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.370 
a couple minutes before I put the steaks
on<00:01:13.990> because<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:16.570> take<00:01:16.810> a<00:01:16.840> little<00:01:17.020> bit<00:01:17.200> longer

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
on because they take a little bit longer

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
on because they take a little bit longer
they're<00:01:17.740> going<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.890> take<00:01:18.010> a<00:01:18.070> little<00:01:18.220> bit

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
they're going to take a little bit

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.770 
they're going to take a little bit
harder<00:01:18.760> than<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.940> stake<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.560> meantime<00:01:20.800> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
baby golden amber all right let's check

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:52.740 
baby golden amber all right let's check
on<00:01:38.950> that<00:01:39.070> but<00:01:39.250> those<00:01:39.520> potatoes

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.210 

that's<00:01:53.650> blames<00:01:54.160> for<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:54.700> baby

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.380 

see<00:02:02.220> that's<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.550> trick<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:03.060> comes<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
see that's the trick when it comes to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.330 
see that's the trick when it comes to
bake<00:02:03.690> potatoes<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.770> put<00:02:04.950> them<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.160> on<00:02:05.220> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
bake potatoes you put them right on the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.760 
bake potatoes you put them right on the
flame<00:02:05.670> let<00:02:06.420> them<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.690> burnt<00:02:06.960> let<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.380> skin

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
flame let them get burnt let that skin

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
flame let them get burnt let that skin
get<00:02:08.610> charged<00:02:08.970> black<00:02:09.330> because<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:10.289> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
get charged black because when that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.470 
get charged black because when that
happens<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.520> when<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> sugars<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.330> their

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
happens that's when the sugars in their

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.630 
happens that's when the sugars in their
potato<00:02:12.810> come<00:02:13.080> out<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.410> gets<00:02:13.530> really<00:02:13.920> tasty

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
potato come out and it gets really tasty

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.630 
potato come out and it gets really tasty
so<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:16.830> going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> little<00:02:17.340> bit<00:02:17.490> while

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
so it's going to be a little bit while

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.100 
so it's going to be a little bit while
longer<00:02:17.940> before<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.360> could<00:02:18.510> throw<00:02:18.660> those<00:02:18.810> steaks

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
longer before I could throw those steaks

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.050 
longer before I could throw those steaks
on<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.980> want<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.780> I<00:02:22.640> just<00:02:23.640> want<00:02:23.880> those

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
on I just want the I just want those

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.380 
on I just want the I just want those
potatoes<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.930> get<00:02:25.050> nice<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.260> buck<00:02:26.180> okay<00:02:27.180> I

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
potatoes to get nice and buck okay I

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.360 
potatoes to get nice and buck okay I
think<00:02:27.959> it's<00:02:28.080> time<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.290> put<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> steaks<00:02:28.860> on<00:02:29.070> and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
think it's time to put the steaks on and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.270 
think it's time to put the steaks on and
the<00:02:29.489> way<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.640> could<00:02:29.910> tell<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:33.020> see<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.280> that's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the way I could tell is see that that's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.059 
the way I could tell is see that that's
how<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.850> want<00:02:36.060> your<00:02:36.120> potato<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.630> look

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.910 

but

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.820 

put<00:02:46.370> these<00:02:46.490> off<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:46.940> side

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
put these off to the side

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:56.530 
put these off to the side
now<00:02:49.520> it's<00:02:49.850> time<00:02:50.800> for<00:02:51.800> our<00:02:51.830> state's

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.970 

sizzle<00:02:57.379> sizzle

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.510 

it<00:03:01.489> was<00:03:01.700> something<00:03:02.120> going<00:03:02.360> on<00:03:02.540> there

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.330 

gamma<00:03:08.120> ray

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.160 

going<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.430> set<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.700> timer<00:03:14.910> for<00:03:15.060> two<00:03:15.390> minutes

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.360 

we'll<00:03:19.170> check<00:03:19.379> on<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:19.739> two<00:03:19.980> minutes<00:03:22.370> now

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
we'll check on it in two minutes now

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.130 
we'll check on it in two minutes now
there's<00:03:23.670> less<00:03:23.849> than<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.090> minute<00:03:24.269> left<00:03:24.510> we're

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
there's less than a minute left we're

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.000 
there's less than a minute left we're
kind<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.470> looking<00:03:25.620> at<00:03:26.269> about<00:03:27.269> 47<00:03:27.959> seconds<00:03:28.410> and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
kind of looking at about 47 seconds and

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.740 
kind of looking at about 47 seconds and
I'm<00:03:29.069> going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.220> tell<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.400> what<00:03:29.610> at<00:03:29.790> 42<00:03:30.269> seconds

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
I'm going to tell you what at 42 seconds

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.330
