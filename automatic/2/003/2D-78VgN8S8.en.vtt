00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.029
 we are with the presenter actress and 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.770
 comical that has everything peace padilla that 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.020
 returns comes back to the one that is coming 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.209
 your paper of chucha tell us so that 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.340
 brings choux to the new season of the 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.280
 fiction I do not know what it brings to the 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.510
 series what more for also wonderful 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.160
 because it gives me the opportunity to 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.620
 interpret a character that is a very 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.270
 extreme that I believe that in very little 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.360
 people would like to be because it's something 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.100
 yucky date have asked me 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.850
 there's a lot of characterization I say if I 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.850
 remove makeup 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.930
 What does it contribute? I imagine that chicha is 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.720
 a little bit is one is a time bomb 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.030
 comes into their lives and what they believe 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.860
 It is chaos within chaos of them 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.350
 you know what I tell you is like 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.730
 then it is also very tender with which 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.430
 they also feel a little 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.600
 responsible for me some already love me 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.309
 They already worry about me how to choose 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 is the character the truth that is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.030
 wonderful for when you think that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.580
 end will be a fixed character in fiction 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.750
 I do not know and I hope it's the public of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.970
 house likes that I will consider it 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.790
 so I hope you raise it and that to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.729
 you saw what you could combine with 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.490
 save me perfectly because as Jorge 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.110
 you take very little vacation I'm 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.909
 waiting for science to advance and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.920
 then Jorge got pregnant and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.530
 have a pregnancy that will obviously be 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.690
 high risk and this already up to nine 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.800
 months plus delivery and postpartum but 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.229
 Jorge is the most hard-working guy, not you 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.820
 you can not even dance is a worker 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.340
 natural 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.800
 he does not like his job and then he does not 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.650
 it's no effort to get 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.880
 to go one day costs me and talking 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.070
 of achievements as you have achieved that the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.300
 public respect you so much in your facet of 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.520
 presenter in a program so 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.120
 destroyer like 'save me' and then like 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.730
 actress I think he 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.760
 they are two different facets it is as if you 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.500
 says that you like more on the radio or the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.950
 interpretation and I say that they are two worlds 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.820
 different that separate my presenter 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.190
 it's also a little interpreting is another 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.500
 record and actress are different no 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.130
 has nothing to do as a singer and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.450
 writer if you get to make the two 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.680
 like the wonderful wonderful 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.570
 you said save me too, you see 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.520
 like a comedy like the series 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.560
 what would you say to those people who do not 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.990
 understand that you compare save me with the one 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.840
 is coming 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.130
 save me is a soap opera the only 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.090
 difference from what they said they are 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:48.319
 actors and there's a script and save me 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.439
 it's your life and there's no script 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.900
 then save me it is created on the 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.970
 march day by day in that same instant 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.189
 he understands what I tell you but he does not leave 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.680
 of being a soap opera because my mother is 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.540
 hooked on roses and returns with amador 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.260
 if he does not return with a lover that has happened to him 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.939
 a bun if Alberto and la is a soap opera 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.609
 Sometimes people laugh and again the 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.519
 agent gets excited and now with it and 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.920
 other times a look that rages 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.500
 the same are the same they feel there 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.900
 in a sitcom 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.820
 anger humor sensitivity chaos be saved 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.010
 unlike jorge javier tÃº a nivel 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.260
 staff you try to bring more comedy to 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.800
 program maybe he is more controversial and 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.380
 you more comical the more controversial I also 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.570
 I am controversial is that I also 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.250
 I bring but it is that each one was reflected 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.830
 is if my life is like that I am a little more 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.420
 crazy mccaffrey in that sense the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.790
 directors has me to live layer vega 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.100
 that is a serious issue I'm not like that 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.410
 then he contributed what I can contribute and 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.870
 in that sense it brought humor because my 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.760
 life is like that where it's coming 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.430
 they can tell you that i am arab 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.410
 I'm serious for there are issues that I put 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.080
 very serious but when I have no more 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.670
 remedy for the waiter and to finalize 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.770
 you commented that the program save me 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.720
 personally I saved you in a moment in 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.600
 the one that was complicated to the best is already 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.459
 a time apart from television I 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.100
 he was making a motto and in south channel 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.910
 that was called peace on earth to chain 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.400
 in September and I started in October 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.140
 between the 100 with save me what I 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.030
 have saved me save me is a bit of the 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.520
 crisis and if I have a lot of 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.010
 comrades there are 50 I think there are 65 thousand 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.140
 actors in this country and there are so many 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.420
 presenters are standing then I 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.090
 today I'm still working and then 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.010
 I say it has saved me from the crisis and not 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.920
 is that I earn a lot of money but I do not eat 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.630
 the savings that already today in a lot and 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.670
 so then what project would 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.240
 I left to save me, I 'm not going to 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.520
 give up life the really me 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.620
 love save me both I think it's the 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.510
 program that everything presented that you want 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.840
 do and the one that says it's not because no 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.580
 knows how it works except a program 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.340
 entertainment a program 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.430
 interview a humor program a 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.670
 program of 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.730
 a reality 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.530
 and there are performances in which we see and 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.750
 now to truly end the last 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.280
 of the good opinion that all 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.230
 the controversy of Pedro Sanchez when 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.210
 he called the program jorge javier mira 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.330
 I keep saying that politicians have 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.240
 that being with the town seemed like a 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.690
 very smart thing by Pedro 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.850
 because there is an audience that people 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.130
 believe that the people who see save me are 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.960
 illiterate maybe not and there are people who 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.850
 we read the press that we know what is 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.600
 happening and especially that we go to 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:50.300
 ballot box to vote then Pedro Sanchez not 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.220
 he was known as a result of save me because 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.660
 there are many people who know who he is and 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.420
 especially I think it's a thermometer 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.110
 very good to know what the 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:03.620
 people on the street and there is an audience that 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:07.040
 you do not read that you can not be separated 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.020
 say by may be to keep in mind 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.360
 an opinion to take into account the 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.090
 politicians can not get on the cloud no 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.780
 so many intellectuals not the town is more 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.450
 street 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.700
 we have many many things that we 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.950
 they worry and that maybe they 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.320
 that they worry not what worries us 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.540
 us then me for example in this 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.169
 crisis that we are living with Ebola 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:33.289
 all I'm saying is that you're doing 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.840
 what are you doing tell me I do not know what 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:38.330
 I'm doing is discussing who 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.150
 it is the fault is providing solution to 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.690
 problem 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.280
 as the spectator of save me my mother 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.980
 surely you are thinking the same thing that 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:52.080
 I do're doing and that you are 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.080
 working alone i'm fighting
