00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
rest off in this case he is its number

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.529 
rest off in this case he is its number
one<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.890> number<00:00:23.100> two<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.730> number<00:00:24.000> two<00:00:24.180> first

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
one and number two so number two first

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.750 
one and number two so number two first
and<00:00:25.880> then<00:00:27.019> number<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.260> actually<00:00:28.949> number<00:00:29.580> one

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
and then number one actually number one

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.970 
and then number one actually number one
number<00:00:30.000> two<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.630> move<00:00:30.810> together<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.619> no<00:00:31.800> big

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
number two can move together it's no big

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.000 
number two can move together it's no big
deal<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.340> suppose<00:00:32.850> so

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
deal I suppose so

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.770 
deal I suppose so
now<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.399> remove<00:00:35.579> number<00:00:35.969> four<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.750> let's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.070 
it's put back number three okay and now
we<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.690> remove<00:02:24.990> them<00:02:25.170> before<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:29.840> like<00:02:30.840> this

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
we can remove them before this like this

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.530 
we can remove them before this like this
I<00:02:31.350> need<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:31.740> remove<00:02:32.130> number<00:02:32.400> three<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.210> put

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
I need to remove number three so I put

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.730 
I need to remove number three so I put
back<00:02:33.980> number<00:02:34.980> two<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.840> move<00:02:36.840> number<00:02:37.140> one<00:02:37.380> and

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
back number two I move number one and

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.790 
back number two I move number one and
I'm<00:02:40.740> done<00:02:41.040> with<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.930> put<00:02:46.140> back<00:02:46.320> everything

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
I'm done with it to put back everything

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.590 
I'm done with it to put back everything
we<00:02:46.950> all<00:02:47.130> have<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.520> make<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.910> same<00:02:48.090> reasoning

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
we all have to make the same reasoning

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.210 
we all have to make the same reasoning
with<00:02:48.780> backward<00:02:49.020> if<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.560> want<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.800> put<00:02:49.950> number

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
with backward if you want to put number

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.910 
with backward if you want to put number
six<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:51.540> need<00:02:51.720> first<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.200> put<00:02:52.380> number<00:02:52.650> five

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
six you need first to put number five

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.280 
six you need first to put number five
which<00:02:53.790> means<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.270> need<00:02:54.420> first<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.900> put<00:02:55.080> number

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
which means you need first to put number

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.320 
which means you need first to put number
four<00:02:55.320> first<00:02:56.190> number<00:02:56.430> three<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.150> need

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
four first number three so and you need

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.190 
four first number three so and you need
to<00:02:57.450> put<00:02:57.660> number<00:02:57.900> one<00:02:58.140> first<00:02:58.500> alone<00:02:59.250> and<00:03:00.200> it's

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
to put number one first alone and it's

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.860 
to put number one first alone and it's
going<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:02.820> way<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:06.270> then<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.540> put

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
going to be this way and then you put

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.690 
going to be this way and then you put
number<00:03:07.170> two<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:09.480> want<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.750> put<00:03:09.930> number<00:03:10.170> three

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.740

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
removing number one put number three etc

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.130 
removing number one put number three etc
etc<00:03:28.280> from<00:03:29.280> now<00:03:29.519> on<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.910> will<00:03:30.269> speed<00:03:30.750> up<00:03:30.900> the

etc from now on I will speed up the
video<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.400> little<00:03:32.820> bit
