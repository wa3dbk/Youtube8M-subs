and<00:01:36.060> raving<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.570> his<00:01:37.170> comments<00:01:37.650> about

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and raving it his comments about

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.620 
and raving it his comments about
referees<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.729> said<00:01:38.909> we'll<00:01:39.060> wait<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.270> minute

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
referees and I said we'll wait a minute

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.289 
referees and I said we'll wait a minute
let's<00:01:39.840> watch<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:41.820> solve<00:01:42.090> all<00:01:42.240> of

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
let's watch it and it would solve all of

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.270 
let's watch it and it would solve all of
it<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> technology's<00:01:43.560> there<00:01:43.590> why<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.070> use

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
it so the technology's there why not use

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.670 
it so the technology's there why not use
it<00:01:44.360> we're<00:01:45.360> judging<00:01:45.570> them<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.140> why<00:01:46.320> not<00:01:46.350> do

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
it we're judging them on that why not do

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.160 
it we're judging them on that why not do
it<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.970> know<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.329> ass<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.810> same<00:01:49.020> as

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it so you know my ass is the same as

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.600 
it so you know my ass is the same as
it's<00:01:49.320> been<00:01:49.350> all<00:01:49.619> season<00:01:49.649> until<00:01:50.220> someone

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
it's been all season until someone

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.850 
it's been all season until someone
listens<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.290> you'll<00:01:52.439> find<00:01:52.680> that

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
listens and I think you'll find that

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
listens and I think you'll find that
they'll<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:54.920> because<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.040> my<00:01:56.219> words<00:01:56.490> will<00:01:56.700> go

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
they'll be because all my words will go

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.380 
they'll be because all my words will go
nowhere<00:01:57.979> unfortunately<00:01:59.240> because<00:02:00.240> I'm

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
nowhere unfortunately because I'm

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.859 
nowhere unfortunately because I'm
totally<00:02:00.570> convinced<00:02:00.960> I'm<00:02:01.320> right<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.549> wrong

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
totally convinced I'm right it was wrong

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.240 
totally convinced I'm right it was wrong
well<00:02:03.869> they<00:02:04.439> don't<00:02:04.619> because<00:02:05.009> they're<00:02:05.130> not

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
well they don't because they're not

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.760 
well they don't because they're not
going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.520> them<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:07.110> could<00:02:07.290> already<00:02:07.439> got

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
going to them and we could already got

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.669 
going to them and we could already got
in<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.160> let<00:02:08.610> us<00:02:08.729> trial<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.330> let<00:02:10.110> us<00:02:10.229> start<00:02:10.560> it

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
in here let us trial it let us start it

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.180 
in here let us trial it let us start it
now<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.280> already<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:12.000> place<00:02:12.500> start<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.620> now

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
now it's already in place start it now

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.870 
now it's already in place start it now
and<00:02:14.310> let's<00:02:14.490> get<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.790> these<00:02:14.970> results<00:02:15.900> that

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
and let's get all these results that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.980 
and let's get all these results that
determine<00:02:17.880> whether<00:02:18.060> someone<00:02:18.360> goes<00:02:18.630> up<00:02:18.840> or

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
determine whether someone goes up or

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.650 
determine whether someone goes up or
stays<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.470> or<00:02:19.620> goes<00:02:19.800> downward<00:02:20.390> let's<00:02:21.390> get<00:02:21.510> it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
stays up or goes downward let's get it

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.900 
stays up or goes downward let's get it
right<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.680> goal<00:02:22.920> line<00:02:23.160> technology<00:02:23.340> is

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
right and in goal line technology is

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.450 
right and in goal line technology is
just<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.530> delayed<00:02:25.530> thing<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.250> fourth

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
just a delayed thing for the fourth

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.880 
just a delayed thing for the fourth

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.620 
official we're not allowed to talk to
him<00:02:29.160> because<00:02:29.520> he's<00:02:29.670> too<00:02:29.940> busy<00:02:30.120> telling<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
him because he's too busy telling the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.420 
him because he's too busy telling the
referee<00:02:30.780> if<00:02:31.140> that's<00:02:31.350> exactly<00:02:31.890> right<00:02:32.100> or<00:02:32.310> not

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
referee if that's exactly right or not

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.580 
referee if that's exactly right or not
and<00:02:32.700> all<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.510> us<00:02:33.750> managers<00:02:34.170> would<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.410> more

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
and all of us managers would be more

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.430 
and all of us managers would be more
than<00:02:34.620> happy<00:02:34.740> we'd<00:02:35.100> never<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.520> fight<00:02:36.440> we'd

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
than happy we'd never have a fight we'd

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.870 
than happy we'd never have a fight we'd
never<00:02:37.620> do<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.100> we<00:02:38.400> don't<00:02:38.490> even<00:02:38.670> need<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
never do that we don't even need a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.580 
never do that we don't even need a
little<00:02:39.150> white<00:02:39.390> line<00:02:39.630> around<00:02:39.930> our<00:02:40.140> dugouts

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
little white line around our dugouts

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.960 
little white line around our dugouts
because<00:02:40.830> we're<00:02:40.980> not<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.580> just<00:02:41.790> want

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
because we're not going to we just want

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.780 
because we're not going to we just want
the<00:02:42.120> referees<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.840> get<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.200> right<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.220> possible

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
the referees to get it right as possible

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.910 
the referees to get it right as possible
so<00:02:45.510> give<00:02:45.690> them<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.960> technologies<00:02:46.590> already

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
so give them the technologies already

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.080 
so give them the technologies already
there<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.490> completely<00:02:48.650> nonsensical

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
there it's just completely nonsensical

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.690

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
rubbish in my opinion that we can't just

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.580 
rubbish in my opinion that we can't just
change<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.150> right<00:02:54.180> now<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:54.990> even<00:02:55.230> though<00:02:55.260> I

when<00:03:08.910> they<00:03:09.030> go<00:03:09.440> was<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.560> right<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:12.600> course<00:03:12.810> it

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
when they go was that right of course it

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.390 
when they go was that right of course it

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
was right at the time what they see I

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.070 
was right at the time what they see I
believe<00:03:14.790> every<00:03:15.030> one<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.300> them<00:03:15.390> gives<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.780> right

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
believe every one of them gives it right

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.050 
believe every one of them gives it right
but<00:03:16.740> they<00:03:16.950> don't<00:03:17.160> see<00:03:17.340> what<00:03:17.520> we<00:03:17.670> see<00:03:17.880> they're

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
but they don't see what we see they're

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.510 
but they don't see what we see they're
not<00:03:18.180> judged<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:18.660> we<00:03:18.810> are<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.770> we<00:03:20.160> can<00:03:20.340> judge

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
not judged like we are and we can judge
