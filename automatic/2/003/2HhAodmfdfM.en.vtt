target<00:00:09.150> online<00:00:09.360> because<00:00:10.290> they<00:00:10.620> didn't<00:00:10.889> have

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
target online because they didn't have

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.740 
target online because they didn't have
this<00:00:11.670> color<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:13.400> it's<00:00:14.400> only<00:00:14.820> one<00:00:15.299> gallon

far so good as you can see looks like
Steam<00:00:53.430> right<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:54.860> it<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.280> feels

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
Steam right but it really it feels

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.869 
Steam right but it really it feels
really<00:00:56.820> cool<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.890> providing<00:00:59.370> humidity

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
really cool and it's providing humidity

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.210 
really cool and it's providing humidity
to<00:01:00.230> my<00:01:01.230> growing<00:01:01.500> room<00:01:02.390> but<00:01:03.710> even<00:01:04.710> when<00:01:05.070> it's

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to my growing room but even when it's

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.280 
to my growing room but even when it's
working<00:01:05.580> almost<00:01:05.729> 12<00:01:06.119> hours<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.869> doesn't

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
working almost 12 hours and it doesn't

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.330 
working almost 12 hours and it doesn't
really<00:01:07.909> provide<00:01:08.909> enough<00:01:09.570> humidity<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.680> this

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
really provide enough humidity in this

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.910 
really provide enough humidity in this
room<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.540> room<00:01:12.750> gets<00:01:13.200> really

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
room because this room gets really

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.130 
room because this room gets really
really<00:01:14.689> dry<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.960> hot<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
really dry and hot and I have a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.050 
really dry and hot and I have a
humidifier<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:22.400> don't<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.820> can

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
humidifier here I don't know if you can

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.819 
humidifier here I don't know if you can
see<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:26.000> but<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.240> almost<00:01:28.520> 50%<00:01:30.170> almost<00:01:31.170> 50%

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
see it but it's almost 50% almost 50%

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.910 
see it but it's almost 50% almost 50%
but<00:01:32.610> most<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> day<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.659> around<00:01:34.530> 40<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.920> if

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
but most of the day was around 40 so if

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.280 
but most of the day was around 40 so if
I<00:01:38.100> were<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.579> using<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.600> would<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.869> really

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
I were not using it it would be really

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.160 
I were not using it it would be really
really<00:01:40.530> dry<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:42.450> also<00:01:42.630> helps<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.530> use<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.189> fan

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
really dry it also helps if I use a fan

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.310 
really dry it also helps if I use a fan
it<00:01:46.170> gets<00:01:46.470> cooler<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.540> in<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.720> community<00:01:49.200> is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
it gets cooler in in the community is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.010 
it gets cooler in in the community is
not<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.390> too<00:01:51.570> dry<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:53.009> anyway

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
not it's not too dry in here but anyway

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.760 
not it's not too dry in here but anyway
I<00:01:55.020> don't<00:01:55.590> use<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.700> maximum<00:01:57.770> because

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
I don't use it on the maximum because

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.730 
I don't use it on the maximum because
then<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.759> gets<00:02:00.000> things<00:02:00.689> wet<00:02:01.020> around<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:02.369> I

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
then it gets things wet around it but I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.719 
then it gets things wet around it but I
don't<00:02:04.740> know<00:02:04.890> how<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.490> working

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
don't know how it's going to be working

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.119 
don't know how it's going to be working
in<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> summertime<00:02:06.710> probably<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.799> gonna<00:02:07.920> do

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
in the summertime probably it's gonna do

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.910 
in the summertime probably it's gonna do
better<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> heater<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
better because with the heater in the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.140 
better because with the heater in the
wintertime<00:02:11.250> against

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
wintertime against

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.949 
wintertime against
dryer<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.530> think<00:02:14.209> anyway<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.930> my

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
dryer I think anyway this is my

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.089 
dryer I think anyway this is my
humidifier<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.099> really<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:19.099> and

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
humidifier and I really like it and

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.000 
humidifier and I really like it and
actually<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:21.120> was<00:02:21.420> looking<00:02:21.569> for<00:02:21.959> two<00:02:22.530> gallon

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
actually I was looking for two gallon

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.360 
actually I was looking for two gallon
but<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:24.480> couldn't<00:02:25.080> find<00:02:25.260> anything<00:02:25.620> around<00:02:26.129> my

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
but I couldn't find anything around my

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.910 
but I couldn't find anything around my
area<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.349> other<00:02:28.349> stores<00:02:28.829> don't<00:02:29.250> carry<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
area and other stores don't carry the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.210 
area and other stores don't carry the
ultrasonic<00:02:31.970> humidifiers<00:02:32.970> like<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.959> one<00:02:34.230> and

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
ultrasonic humidifiers like this one and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.619 
ultrasonic humidifiers like this one and
most<00:02:35.519> of<00:02:35.640> em<00:02:35.760> are<00:02:35.909> like<00:02:36.260> warm<00:02:37.260> mist<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.909> or

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
most of em are like warm mist and or

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.979 
most of em are like warm mist and or
cool<00:02:40.560> mist<00:02:40.890> but<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.519> mist<00:02:41.730> actually<00:02:42.510> you

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
cool mist but the mist actually you

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.099 
cool mist but the mist actually you
cannot<00:02:43.230> control<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.799> mist<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:45.690> gets

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
cannot control the mist and it gets

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.449 
cannot control the mist and it gets
things<00:02:46.440> wet<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.049> is<00:02:49.200> my<00:02:49.410> humidifier<00:02:50.040> and

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
things wet so this is my humidifier and

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.030 
things wet so this is my humidifier and
I<00:02:50.609> love<00:02:50.910> it
