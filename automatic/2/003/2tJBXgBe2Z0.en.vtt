00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
none of the job pins would have fallen

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.790

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
nothing the gears are stripped all the

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.639 
nothing the gears are stripped all the
gears<00:02:01.810> are<00:02:02.020> fine<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.630> is<00:02:04.690> just<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.200> mission

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
gears are fine but it is just a mission

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.370 
gears are fine but it is just a mission
that's<00:02:06.250> doing<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.850> though<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:08.110> like

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
that's doing that though it's like

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.210 
that's doing that though it's like
knocking<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:10.030> he'll<00:02:10.209> he'll<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.929> I'll<00:02:11.920> turn<00:02:12.070> it

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
knocking so he'll he'll and I'll turn it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.330 
knocking so he'll he'll and I'll turn it
off<00:02:12.340> before<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.780> could<00:02:14.290> blow<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.650> around<00:02:15.040> just

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
off before I could blow it around just

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.910 
off before I could blow it around just
fine<00:02:15.670> but<00:02:16.660> now<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.230> knocking<00:02:17.500> if<00:02:17.800> you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
fine but now it's like knocking if you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:27.630 
fine but now it's like knocking if you
can<00:02:18.720> hear<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:26.230> earlier<00:02:26.769> never

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
can hear that so and and earlier never

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.789 
can hear that so and and earlier never
I'll<00:02:27.820> let<00:02:28.000> out<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.269> gas<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.959> we<00:02:29.290> just<00:02:29.500> you'll

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
I'll let out the gas and we just you'll

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.430 
I'll let out the gas and we just you'll
just<00:02:30.010> stop<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.610> would<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:30.850> get<00:02:31.150> stopped<00:02:31.480> but

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
just stop it would just get stopped but

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.930 
just stop it would just get stopped but
