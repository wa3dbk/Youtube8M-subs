this now the key thing to remember about
the<00:01:59.200> arm<00:01:59.409> bones<00:01:59.770> is<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.190> is<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:01.150> directions

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
the arm bones is that is the directions

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.540 
the arm bones is that is the directions
of<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.900> lines<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.560> this<00:02:02.860> goes<00:02:03.070> for<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.310> legs

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
of the lines and this goes for the legs

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.800 
of the lines and this goes for the legs
too

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
too

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.719 
too
doesn't<00:02:05.409> matter<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:05.890> much<00:02:05.950> how<00:02:06.100> clean<00:02:06.550> they

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
doesn't matter so much how clean they

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.639 
doesn't matter so much how clean they
are<00:02:06.760> because<00:02:07.270> remember<00:02:08.050> we're<00:02:08.350> gonna<00:02:08.470> draw<00:02:08.619> a

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
are because remember we're gonna draw a

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.350 
are because remember we're gonna draw a
muscle<00:02:09.069> over<00:02:09.310> them<00:02:09.459> so<00:02:09.670> we'll<00:02:09.820> be<00:02:09.970> erasing

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
muscle over them so we'll be erasing

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.870 
muscle over them so we'll be erasing
them<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.700> elbows<00:02:13.150> L<00:02:13.780> elbows<00:02:14.620> line<00:02:15.610> up<00:02:15.730> with

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
them so the elbows L elbows line up with

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.780 
them so the elbows L elbows line up with
about<00:02:16.060> five<00:02:17.220> right<00:02:18.220> here

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
about five right here

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.470 
about five right here
give<00:02:19.600> them<00:02:19.690> some<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:21.150> little<00:02:22.150> notch<00:02:22.450> right

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
give them some a little notch right

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.220 
give them some a little notch right
there<00:02:24.660> come<00:02:25.660> down<00:02:25.870> again<00:02:27.900> again<00:02:28.900> with<00:02:29.050> both

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
there come down again again with both

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.300 
there come down again again with both
sides<00:02:29.530> like<00:02:29.800> this<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:32.110> wrist<00:02:32.410> lines<00:02:33.070> up<00:02:33.280> just

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
sides like this the wrist lines up just

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.259 
sides like this the wrist lines up just
right<00:02:33.850> here<00:02:34.150> right<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.459> little<00:02:36.700> bit<00:02:36.820> just

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
right here right just a little bit just

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.430 
right here right just a little bit just
a<00:02:37.390> little<00:02:37.420> bit<00:02:37.690> below<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:40.140> base<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.350> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
a little bit below the base of the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.699 
a little bit below the base of the
pelvis<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.130> somewhere<00:02:42.489> around<00:02:42.580> there<00:02:43.709> they

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
pelvis so somewhere around there they

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.009 
pelvis so somewhere around there they
were<00:02:44.769> able<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.100> draw<00:02:45.190> these<00:02:45.430> kind<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:46.019> big

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
were able to draw these kind of big

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.000 
were able to draw these kind of big
shapes<00:02:47.800> for<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.130> hand<00:02:49.170> they<00:02:50.170> can<00:02:50.320> be<00:02:50.380> boxes

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
shapes for the hand they can be boxes

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.479 
shapes for the hand they can be boxes
they<00:02:51.340> can<00:02:51.519> be<00:02:51.640> ovals<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:54.070> stay<00:02:54.250> loose

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
they can be ovals but just stay loose

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.140 
they can be ovals but just stay loose
then<00:02:55.090> you're<00:02:55.269> just<00:02:55.390> gonna<00:02:55.510> indicate<00:02:55.959> ton<00:02:56.470> of

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
then you're just gonna indicate ton of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.190 
then you're just gonna indicate ton of
the<00:02:58.150> back<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.840> his<00:02:58.959> palm<00:02:59.459> or<00:03:00.459> his<00:03:00.880> palm<00:03:02.070> back

the back of his palm or his palm back
now<00:03:05.200> we're<00:03:05.350> gonna<00:03:05.470> modify<00:03:05.769> his<00:03:06.280> ribs<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.700> little

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
now we're gonna modify his ribs a little

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.350 
now we're gonna modify his ribs a little
bit<00:03:06.970> shave<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.079> off<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.230> little<00:03:08.410> bit<00:03:08.560> right<00:03:08.680> here

this again i really suggest you go

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.069 
this again i really suggest you go
practice<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:16.060> front<00:03:16.420> view<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:17.049> side

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
practice the front view and the side

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.289 
practice the front view and the side
view<00:03:17.290> by<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:18.280> time<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.640> get<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.820> this<00:03:19.030> view

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
view by the time you get to this view

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.690 
view by the time you get to this view
you<00:03:19.480> should<00:03:19.510> be<00:03:19.810> really<00:03:20.260> kind<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.560> natural<00:03:21.519> for

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
you should be really kind of natural for

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.130 
you should be really kind of natural for
you<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.980> should<00:03:24.160> at<00:03:24.430> least<00:03:24.519> do<00:03:24.940> each<00:03:25.239> view

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
you and you should at least do each view

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.740 
you and you should at least do each view
at<00:03:26.290> least<00:03:26.440> five<00:03:26.799> times<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.360> can<00:03:28.540> get<00:03:28.630> all

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
at least five times so you can get all

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.280 
at least five times so you can get all
this<00:03:28.900> all<00:03:29.410> these<00:03:29.590> landmarks<00:03:30.370> by<00:03:30.549> memory<00:03:31.290> let's

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
this all these landmarks by memory let's

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.170 
this all these landmarks by memory let's
just<00:03:32.530> let's<00:03:32.829> just<00:03:32.890> modify<00:03:33.370> Skol<00:03:33.790> little<00:03:34.030> bit

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
just let's just modify Skol little bit

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.640 
just let's just modify Skol little bit
so<00:03:34.329> it's<00:03:34.450> not<00:03:34.540> just<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.870> square<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.500> it's

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
so it's not just a square and it's

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.759 
so it's not just a square and it's
actually<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.340> circular<00:03:37.299> say<00:03:37.570> shape<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.110> Rama

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
actually a circular say shape so Rama

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.729 
actually a circular say shape so Rama
Dolph<00:03:39.070> run<00:03:39.310> off<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.579> edges<00:03:39.730> like<00:03:40.000> this<00:03:40.739> round

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
Dolph run off the edges like this round

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:42.720 
Dolph run off the edges like this round
off<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.070> edges<00:03:42.100> like<00:03:42.489> that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
off the edges like that

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.289 
off the edges like that
and<00:03:42.970> then<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:43.810> would<00:03:43.989> be<00:03:44.110> his<00:03:44.230> jaws<00:03:45.299> like

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
and then this would be his jaws like

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.229 
and then this would be his jaws like
that<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:47.739> can<00:03:47.860> see<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.190> his<00:03:48.730> jaws<00:03:48.970> from<00:03:49.090> the

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
that you can see the his jaws from the

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.420 
that you can see the his jaws from the
other<00:03:49.359> side<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:53.350> can<00:03:53.920> draw<00:03:54.100> these<00:03:54.220> like

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
other side and you can draw these like

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.410 
other side and you can draw these like
dotted<00:03:55.269> lines<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:57.340> kind<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.609> show<00:03:57.850> his<00:03:58.060> ribcage

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.479 

all<00:04:01.420> right<00:04:01.660> so<00:04:02.080> there<00:04:02.349> you<00:04:02.500> have<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.709> our<00:04:03.040> back

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
all right so there you have it our back

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.780 
all right so there you have it our back
view<00:04:03.879> of<00:04:04.150> male<00:04:04.900> skeleton<00:04:05.370> eight<00:04:06.370> heads

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
view of male skeleton eight heads

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.770 
view of male skeleton eight heads
proportion<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:09.180> yeah<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.390> was<00:04:10.510> pretty

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
proportion and yeah that was pretty

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.280 
proportion and yeah that was pretty
quick<00:04:11.940> for<00:04:12.940> our<00:04:13.090> next<00:04:13.360> video<00:04:13.510> we'll<00:04:13.840> just<00:04:14.080> put

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
quick for our next video we'll just put

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.129 
quick for our next video we'll just put
some<00:04:14.319> muscles<00:04:14.800> on<00:04:14.950> there
