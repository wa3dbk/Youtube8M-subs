think it's pretty good I mean let's say

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.060 
think it's pretty good I mean let's say
if<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.720> guy<00:01:24.869> keeps<00:01:25.140> bidding<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> guy<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.740> too

if a body that could still probably make

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.790 
if a body that could still probably make
a<00:02:08.520> profit<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> basista<00:02:09.840> was<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.229> Sunday<00:02:10.619> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
a profit on it basista was on Sunday and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.730 
a profit on it basista was on Sunday and
the<00:02:10.979> web<00:02:11.430> app<00:02:11.550> was<00:02:11.730> supposedly<00:02:12.090> going<00:02:12.300> down

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
the web app was supposedly going down

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.740 
the web app was supposedly going down
monday<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.190> didn't<00:02:13.850> want<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.060> buy<00:02:14.240> two<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.540> them

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
monday I didn't want to buy two of them

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.530 
monday I didn't want to buy two of them
for<00:02:15.220> when<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.400> wasn't<00:02:16.730> sure<00:02:16.880> about<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.180> profit

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
for when I wasn't sure about the profit

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.090 
for when I wasn't sure about the profit
so<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.050> was<00:02:18.230> trying<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.500> get<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:18.740> trade-off<00:02:18.980> for

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
so I was trying to get a trade-off for

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.250 
so I was trying to get a trade-off for
Indian<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.610> didn't<00:02:19.850> get<00:02:20.000> him<00:02:20.210> but<00:02:20.420> Lampard<00:02:21.080> here

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
Indian I didn't get him but Lampard here

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.190 
Indian I didn't get him but Lampard here
you<00:02:21.350> see<00:02:21.470> there<00:02:21.620> was<00:02:21.710> one<00:02:21.800> for<00:02:21.950> 375<00:02:22.520> 900<00:02:23.060> 400<00:02:23.570> so

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
you see there was one for 375 900 400 so

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.780 
you see there was one for 375 900 400 so
this<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.530> situation<00:02:24.770> that<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.160> was<00:02:25.370> going<00:02:25.520> to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
this is a situation that I was going to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.630 
this is a situation that I was going to
check<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.330> market<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.990> database<00:02:27.640> he

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
check the market the database he

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.250 
check the market the database he
couldn't<00:02:28.910> see<00:02:29.000> there<00:02:29.180> but<00:02:29.720> basically<00:02:29.930> he's

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
couldn't see there but basically he's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.960 
couldn't see there but basically he's
surprising<00:02:30.800> he's<00:02:30.920> going<00:02:31.190> for<00:02:31.370> at<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.940> moment

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
surprising he's going for at the moment

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.970 
surprising he's going for at the moment
and<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.540> checked<00:02:32.840> all<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.080> trades<00:02:33.410> he<00:02:33.860> was

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
and I checked all the trades he was

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.510 
and I checked all the trades he was
going<00:02:34.130> for<00:02:34.220> about<00:02:34.430> 90<00:02:34.970> k<00:02:35.350> 400<00:02:36.350> k<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:37.070> I<00:02:37.100> put<00:02:37.340> mine

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
going for about 90 k 400 k so I put mine

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.190 
going for about 90 k 400 k so I put mine
is<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.820> second<00:02:38.180> cheapest<00:02:38.480> on<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.600> market<00:02:38.690> as

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
is the second cheapest on the market as

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.490 
is the second cheapest on the market as
you<00:02:39.710> seen<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> little<00:02:40.070> bit<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:41.330> way<00:02:41.630> the

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
you seen a little bit so that way the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.590 
you seen a little bit so that way the
first<00:02:42.710> car<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:42.950> sell<00:02:43.310> will<00:02:43.490> probably<00:02:43.850> be<00:02:44.000> that

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
first car to sell will probably be that

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.170 
first car to sell will probably be that
375<00:02:45.500> Lampard's<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.160> then<00:02:46.460> mine<00:02:46.670> will<00:02:46.880> be<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
375 Lampard's and then mine will be the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.570 
375 Lampard's and then mine will be the
second<00:02:47.600> one<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.840> go<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.280> little<00:02:49.280> bit<00:02:49.340> later

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
second one to go and a little bit later

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.150 
second one to go and a little bit later
after<00:02:49.820> I<00:02:49.880> put<00:02:50.090> all<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.450> items<00:02:50.750> for<00:02:50.930> sale
