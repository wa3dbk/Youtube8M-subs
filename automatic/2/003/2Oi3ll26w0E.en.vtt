string instrument plugged into an

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.740 
string instrument plugged into an
amplifier<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:29.670> first<00:00:29.880> guitarists<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.630> have

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
amplifier the first guitarists that have

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.600 
amplifier the first guitarists that have
used<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.230> kind<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.590> technique<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.369> Eddie

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
used this kind of technique was Eddie

a<00:00:36.120> guitar<00:00:36.510> pick<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.800> perform<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.489> picture

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
a guitar pick you can perform a picture

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.080 
a guitar pick you can perform a picture
monic<00:00:39.450> without<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> guitar<00:00:40.200> pick<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.550> then

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
monic without a guitar pick but then

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.119 
monic without a guitar pick but then
again<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.600> lot<00:00:42.750> harder<00:00:42.930> without<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.829> if

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
again it's a lot harder without it so if

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.430 
again it's a lot harder without it so if
you<00:00:44.219> don't<00:00:44.370> hell<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.239> guitar<00:00:45.690> pick<00:00:45.870> go<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
you don't hell on guitar pick go to you

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.400 
you don't hell on guitar pick go to you
guitar<00:00:47.070> store<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.579> buy<00:00:48.480> some<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.230> very

to show you how to easily put some pitch
harmonic<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> rift<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.149> guitar<00:00:57.449> attitude<00:00:57.870> in

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
harmonic in rift the guitar attitude in

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:09.120 
harmonic in rift the guitar attitude in
d

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.070 

it's<00:01:10.130> possible<00:01:10.370> to<00:01:10.820> get<00:01:11.030> different<00:01:11.270> sounds<00:01:11.900> by

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
it's possible to get different sounds by

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.980 
it's possible to get different sounds by
changing<00:01:12.620> spot<00:01:12.920> where<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.190> hid<00:01:13.310> your<00:01:13.430> string

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
changing spot where you hid your string

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.450 
changing spot where you hid your string
this<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.200> because<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.680> pitch<00:01:15.860> romanik<00:01:16.340> i

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
this is because the pitch romanik i

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.520 
this is because the pitch romanik i
created<00:01:16.970> with<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.150> rhine<00:01:17.390> hand<00:01:17.660> motion<00:01:18.080> that

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
created with the rhine hand motion that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.460 
created with the rhine hand motion that
i<00:01:18.590> will<00:01:18.920> show<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.430> later<00:01:19.960> notice<00:01:20.960> that<00:01:21.170> i

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
i will show you later notice that i

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.470 
i will show you later notice that i
don't<00:01:21.770> move<00:01:22.130> my<00:01:22.250> left<00:01:22.460> turn<00:01:22.730> to<00:01:22.760> another<00:01:23.120> fret

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
don't move my left turn to another fret

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:34.240 
don't move my left turn to another fret
i<00:01:32.140> strongly<00:01:33.140> recommend<00:01:33.320> for<00:01:33.979> all<00:01:34.130> the

i strongly recommend for all the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.830 
i strongly recommend for all the
beginners<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.910> set<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.210> humbucker<00:01:35.660> and

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
beginners to set the humbucker and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.350 
beginners to set the humbucker and
pickup<00:01:36.140> switch<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.800> also<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.490> tone<00:01:37.729> port<00:01:38.060> to

pickup switch and also the tone port to

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.840 
pickup switch and also the tone port to
the<00:01:38.390> highest<00:01:38.660> like<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:40.070> only<00:01:40.370> activate

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
the highest like this to only activate

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.270 
the highest like this to only activate
this<00:01:41.240> pickup<00:01:41.660> I<00:01:41.869> just<00:01:42.290> find<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.650> like<00:01:42.920> really

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
this pickup I just find it like really

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.980 
this pickup I just find it like really
easier<00:01:43.910> by<00:01:44.300> doing<00:01:44.540> this<00:01:49.090> well<00:01:50.090> now<00:01:50.509> comes<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
easier by doing this well now comes the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.710 
easier by doing this well now comes the
hard<00:01:51.200> part<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.550> how<00:01:52.729> you<00:01:52.790> perform<00:01:53.450> a

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
hard part this is how you perform a

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.440 
hard part this is how you perform a
pitcher<00:01:54.380> monic

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.810 

as<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.350> can<00:02:00.469> see<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.710> only<00:02:01.039> touch<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.340> string

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
as you can see I only touch the string

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.120 
as you can see I only touch the string
with<00:02:02.149> my<00:02:02.360> thumb<00:02:04.930> this<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.350> actual<00:02:06.740> Prince

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
with my thumb this is the actual Prince

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:19.000 
with my thumb this is the actual Prince
it<00:02:07.399> by<00:02:07.579> making<00:02:07.789> a<00:02:08.090> pitch<00:02:08.360> romanik

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:27.820 

you

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.200 

I

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:42.940 

go

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.340 

don't
