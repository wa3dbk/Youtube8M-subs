00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.389 

this<00:00:00.539> project<00:00:01.140> like<00:00:01.290> all<00:00:01.530> my<00:00:01.680> others<00:00:02.010> started

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
this project like all my others started

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.150 
this project like all my others started
from<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.639> need<00:00:02.850> that<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.090> had<00:00:03.440> when<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.470> perform

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
from a need that I had when I perform

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.519 
from a need that I had when I perform
acoustically<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.120> wanted<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.569> stompbox<00:00:07.290> a

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
acoustically I wanted that stompbox a

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.440 
acoustically I wanted that stompbox a
foot<00:00:07.770> drum<00:00:08.010> effect<00:00:08.400> so<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.000> went<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.269> YouTube

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
foot drum effect so I went on YouTube

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.209 
foot drum effect so I went on YouTube
and<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.019> looked<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.559> there's<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.769> ton<00:00:11.160> of

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
and I looked and there's a ton of

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.810 
and I looked and there's a ton of
projects<00:00:11.849> they<00:00:12.599> all<00:00:12.809> work<00:00:13.320> based<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> piezo

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
projects they all work based on a piezo

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.880 
projects they all work based on a piezo
element<00:00:15.269> or<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.570> microphone<00:00:15.990> or<00:00:16.440> something<00:00:16.770> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
element or a microphone or something to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.519 
element or a microphone or something to
that<00:00:16.980> effect<00:00:17.430> when<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.150> tried<00:00:18.539> them<00:00:18.750> out<00:00:18.930> they

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
that effect when I tried them out they

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.140 
that effect when I tried them out they
sounded<00:00:20.070> differently<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> different

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
sounded differently on the different

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.420 
sounded differently on the different
amps<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.689> use<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.949> wanted<00:00:23.369> something

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
amps that I use but I wanted something

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.150 
amps that I use but I wanted something
that<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:23.970> could<00:00:24.240> control<00:00:24.689> regardless<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.980> which

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
that I could control regardless of which

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.300 
that I could control regardless of which
amp<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.760> what<00:00:26.970> venue<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.390> was<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.890> came<00:00:29.010> up

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
amp or what venue I was in so I came up

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.189 
amp or what venue I was in so I came up
with<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> different<00:00:29.670> approach<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.929> called

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
with a different approach and I called

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.950 
with a different approach and I called
that<00:00:31.260> approach<00:00:31.679> electric<00:00:32.340> stump<00:00:32.960> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
that approach electric stump it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.250 
that approach electric stump it's
actually<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.040> drum<00:00:35.610> synthesizer<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.899> very

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
actually a drum synthesizer a very

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
actually a drum synthesizer a very
simple<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.219> drum<00:00:38.520> synthesizer

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
simple one but a drum synthesizer

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.450 
simple one but a drum synthesizer
nonetheless<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:40.469> allows<00:00:40.710> me<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.950> control<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
nonetheless it allows me to control the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.569 
nonetheless it allows me to control the
pitch<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.149> decay<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.809> signal<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:44.100> volume

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
pitch and decay of the signal the volume

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.900 
pitch and decay of the signal the volume
and<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.629> also<00:00:45.899> allows<00:00:46.440> me<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.920> plug<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.399> my

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and it also allows me to plug in my

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.240 
and it also allows me to plug in my
acoustic<00:00:48.450> guitar<00:00:48.690> through<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> system<00:00:50.039> so

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
acoustic guitar through the system so

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.119 
acoustic guitar through the system so
that<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.430> only<00:00:50.520> need<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.870> input<00:00:52.350> into<00:00:52.770> an<00:00:52.920> amp

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
that I only need one input into an amp

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.459 
that I only need one input into an amp
plus<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> amps<00:00:54.870> only<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.260> one

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
plus a lot of the amps only have one

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.090 
plus a lot of the amps only have one
input<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> let's<00:00:58.170> listen<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
input so let's listen to see what it

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:09.480 
input so let's listen to see what it
sounds<00:00:59.280> like

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:30.500 

electrum

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.469 

now<00:01:31.510> that's<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:32.020> sound<00:01:32.229> that<00:01:32.470> I<00:01:32.500> want<00:01:33.479> let's

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
now that's the sound that I want let's

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.540 
now that's the sound that I want let's
take<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.660> little<00:01:34.840> closer<00:01:35.110> look<00:01:35.290> as<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:36.160> trigger

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
take a little closer look as I trigger

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.330 
take a little closer look as I trigger
the<00:01:36.820> electric<00:01:37.210> stop<00:01:37.479> manually<00:01:38.110> as<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:39.040> change

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
the electric stop manually as I change

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.730 
the electric stop manually as I change
the<00:01:39.550> pitch<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.240> frequency<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.229> pitch<00:01:41.470> of

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
the pitch the frequency of the pitch of

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.249 
the pitch the frequency of the pitch of
the<00:01:41.890> drum<00:01:42.070> sound<00:01:42.460> goes<00:01:42.729> up<00:01:42.850> or<00:01:43.030> down<00:01:43.229> when<00:01:44.229> I

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
the drum sound goes up or down when I

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.830 
the drum sound goes up or down when I
increase<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.009> decay<00:01:45.400> it<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:46.090> sound<00:01:46.420> lasts

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
increase the decay it the sound lasts

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.340 
increase the decay it the sound lasts
longer<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.550> can<00:01:48.790> adjust<00:01:49.090> that<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.540> any<00:01:49.930> sound

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
longer so I can adjust that to any sound

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.380 
longer so I can adjust that to any sound
that<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.590> really<00:01:50.979> want<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:52.030> then<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.150> have<00:01:52.360> a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
that I really want and then I have a

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.630 
that I really want and then I have a
volume<00:01:52.660> control<00:01:52.840> which<00:01:53.470> allows<00:01:53.770> me<00:01:54.100> to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
volume control which allows me to

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.090 
volume control which allows me to
increase<00:01:55.539> or<00:01:55.720> decrease<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:56.350> volume<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.890> the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
increase or decrease the volume of the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.150 
increase or decrease the volume of the
drum<00:01:57.460> so<00:01:58.180> it<00:01:58.360> can<00:01:58.509> magically<00:01:59.020> boost<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.710> input

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
drum so it can magically boost the input

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.450 
drum so it can magically boost the input
from<00:02:00.399> my<00:02:00.670> guitar<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.710> all<00:02:02.830> comes<00:02:03.220> out

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
from my guitar and it all comes out

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.260 
from my guitar and it all comes out
through<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:04.119> single<00:02:04.869> but<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:06.820> course<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.149> have

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
through a single but of course I have

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.479 
through a single but of course I have
power<00:02:07.570> which<00:02:08.050> are<00:02:08.259> two<00:02:08.410> 9-volt<00:02:08.649> batteries<00:02:09.310> but

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
power which are two 9-volt batteries but

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.090 
power which are two 9-volt batteries but
they<00:02:09.670> tend<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.179> last<00:02:10.539> forever<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.890> way<00:02:12.040> the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
they tend to last forever so the way the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.380 
they tend to last forever so the way the
circuit<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.730> made<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.820> triggering

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
circuit is made and the triggering

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.990 
circuit is made and the triggering
mechanism<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.350> really<00:02:18.010> effective<00:02:18.730> it's

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
mechanism is really effective it's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.270 
mechanism is really effective it's
called<00:02:19.600> a<00:02:19.750> micro<00:02:20.200> switch<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.800> it's<00:02:20.920> used<00:02:21.130> a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
called a micro switch and it's used a

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.460 
called a micro switch and it's used a
lot<00:02:21.459> in<00:02:21.670> industry<00:02:22.209> because<00:02:22.360> it's<00:02:22.780> like<00:02:23.019> super

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
lot in industry because it's like super

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.280 
lot in industry because it's like super
reliable<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:25.090> really<00:02:25.330> inexpensive<00:02:25.780> it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
reliable and it's really inexpensive it

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.979 
reliable and it's really inexpensive it
only<00:02:26.410> costs<00:02:26.769> like<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> flower<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.780> let's<00:02:28.780> take<00:02:28.959> a

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
only costs like a flower so let's take a

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.750 
only costs like a flower so let's take a
little<00:02:29.200> closer<00:02:29.440> look<00:02:29.650> at<00:02:30.010> electric<00:02:30.459> stop

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
little closer look at electric stop

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.780 
little closer look at electric stop
let's<00:02:31.660> take<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.019> top<00:02:32.260> off<00:02:32.530> now<00:02:33.459> let's<00:02:33.610> have<00:02:33.730> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
let's take the top off now let's have a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.630 
let's take the top off now let's have a
little<00:02:34.290> foot<00:02:35.290> stop<00:02:35.590> here<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.130> when<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.340> put<00:02:36.610> my

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
little foot stop here so when I put my

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.030 
little foot stop here so when I put my
foot<00:02:37.120> on<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.480> doesn't<00:02:37.780> slide<00:02:38.110> backwards<00:02:38.799> and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
foot on it doesn't slide backwards and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.750 
foot on it doesn't slide backwards and
there's<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.030> hole<00:02:40.269> in<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.690> top<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:42.459> allows

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
there's a hole in the top that allows

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.880 
there's a hole in the top that allows
the<00:02:43.000> micro<00:02:43.360> switch<00:02:43.510> come<00:02:44.170> through<00:02:44.470> there's

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
the micro switch come through there's

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.080 
the micro switch come through there's
the<00:02:45.040> micro<00:02:45.370> switch<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.860> attached<00:02:48.670> to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
the micro switch and it's attached to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.900 
the micro switch and it's attached to
this<00:02:50.079> block<00:02:50.440> here<00:02:50.769> with<00:02:50.950> two<00:02:51.160> small<00:02:51.549> screws

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
this block here with two small screws

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.600 
this block here with two small screws
and<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:53.200> can<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.560> removed<00:02:53.920> or<00:02:54.160> taken<00:02:54.340> apart

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
and that can be removed or taken apart

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.300 
and that can be removed or taken apart
and<00:02:56.610> inside<00:02:57.610> here<00:02:58.200> are<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.530> components<00:02:59.680> now

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
and inside here are the components now

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.250 
and inside here are the components now
let's<00:03:00.489> take<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> look<00:03:00.970> first<00:03:01.630> we<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.079> two

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
let's take a look first we have the two

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.220 
let's take a look first we have the two
9-volt<00:03:02.470> batteries<00:03:03.190> here<00:03:03.549> held<00:03:04.480> steady<00:03:04.930> by

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
9-volt batteries here held steady by

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.590 
9-volt batteries here held steady by
this<00:03:05.290> screw<00:03:06.250> coming<00:03:06.610> up<00:03:06.760> from<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:06.940> bottom<00:03:07.209> and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
this screw coming up from the bottom and

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.420 
this screw coming up from the bottom and
this<00:03:07.810> piece<00:03:08.200> of<00:03:08.350> aluminum<00:03:08.829> would<00:03:09.010> they<00:03:09.160> bling

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
this piece of aluminum would they bling

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.690 
this piece of aluminum would they bling
them<00:03:10.140> then<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.320> have<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:12.930> potentiometers<00:03:14.700> for

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
them then we have the potentiometers for

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.580 
them then we have the potentiometers for
the<00:03:16.140> pitch<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.860> volume<00:03:19.019> we<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.230> the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
the pitch and the volume we have the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.720 
the pitch and the volume we have the
input<00:03:20.950> jack<00:03:20.980> for<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:21.970> acoustic<00:03:22.930> guitar<00:03:23.290> or

input jack for the acoustic guitar or
regular<00:03:24.730> guitarist<00:03:25.329> fact<00:03:25.840> maybe<00:03:26.079> we<00:03:27.040> have<00:03:27.220> the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
regular guitarist fact maybe we have the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.920 
regular guitarist fact maybe we have the
output<00:03:27.790> jack<00:03:28.320> we<00:03:29.320> have<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.680> power<00:03:29.860> switch<00:03:30.370> and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
output jack we have the power switch and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.520 
output jack we have the power switch and
we<00:03:31.930> have<00:03:32.169> the<00:03:32.500> decay<00:03:32.910> potentiometer<00:03:34.530> now

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
we have the decay potentiometer now

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.340 
we have the decay potentiometer now
these<00:03:35.680> are<00:03:36.070> all

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.130 

connected<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:40.310> an<00:03:40.910> experimenters<00:03:41.810> board

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
connected to a an experimenters board

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.440 
connected to a an experimenters board
here<00:03:42.530> this<00:03:42.710> is<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.890> board<00:03:43.850> way<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.150> don't<00:03:44.390> have

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
here this is a board way you don't have

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.720 
here this is a board way you don't have
to<00:03:44.750> solder<00:03:45.050> you<00:03:45.380> just<00:03:45.620> plug<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.520> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
to solder you just plug in the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.820 
to solder you just plug in the
individual<00:03:47.420> pieces<00:03:47.930> into<00:03:48.320> these<00:03:48.500> little

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
individual pieces into these little

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.030 
individual pieces into these little
holes<00:03:49.130> here<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:50.380> inside<00:03:51.380> them<00:03:51.650> they<00:03:51.800> have

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
holes here and inside them they have

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.940 
holes here and inside them they have
contacts<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.330> just<00:03:53.480> push<00:03:54.230> them<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.650> and

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
contacts so you just push them in and

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.970 
contacts so you just push them in and
then<00:03:55.940> connect<00:03:56.270> it<00:03:56.450> there<00:03:57.110> is<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.470> integrated

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
then connect it there is the integrated

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.040 
then connect it there is the integrated
circuit<00:03:58.430> right<00:03:58.610> in<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.880> middle<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.480> those

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
circuit right in the middle and those

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.190 
circuit right in the middle and those
those<00:04:00.440> arms<00:04:01.190> things<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.580> capacitors<00:04:02.240> the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
those arms things the capacitors the

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.510 
those arms things the capacitors the
other<00:04:03.350> things<00:04:03.680> are<00:04:03.830> resistors<00:04:04.780> as<00:04:05.780> these<00:04:06.080> two

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
other things are resistors as these two

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.080 
other things are resistors as these two
guys<00:04:07.520> over<00:04:07.820> here<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.450> are<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.630> two<00:04:08.900> diodes

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
guys over here that are the two diodes

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.620 
guys over here that are the two diodes
there<00:04:11.090> are<00:04:11.300> some<00:04:11.510> jumpers<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.850> wires<00:04:14.150> coming

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
there are some jumpers the wires coming

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.660 
there are some jumpers the wires coming
from<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:15.170> potentiometers<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.459> light

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
from the potentiometers and the light

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.039 
from the potentiometers and the light
and<00:04:17.830> that's<00:04:18.830> about<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.630> there<00:04:20.630> are<00:04:20.660> not<00:04:20.870> too

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
and that's about it there are not too

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.440 
and that's about it there are not too
many<00:04:21.080> components<00:04:21.700> it's<00:04:22.700> not<00:04:22.970> too<00:04:23.120> expensive

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
many components it's not too expensive

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.040 
many components it's not too expensive
to<00:04:23.840> build<00:04:24.670> the<00:04:25.670> only<00:04:26.120> soldering<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:26.690> have<00:04:26.870> to

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
to build the only soldering you have to

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.650 
to build the only soldering you have to
do<00:04:27.260> is<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:28.040> connect<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.580> external<00:04:28.940> components

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
do is to connect the external components

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.460 
do is to connect the external components
like<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.990> switch<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.680> potentiometers<00:04:31.640> and

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
like the switch the potentiometers and

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.840 
like the switch the potentiometers and
the<00:04:33.470> jacks<00:04:33.950> on<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:35.750> top<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.350> have<00:04:37.250> this<00:04:37.460> black

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
the jacks on the top I have this black

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.540 
the jacks on the top I have this black
surface<00:04:38.630> here<00:04:38.960> which<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:39.740> actually<00:04:39.919> shelf

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
surface here which is actually shelf

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.190 
surface here which is actually shelf
lining<00:04:41.090> it's<00:04:41.690> nice<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.850> sticky<00:04:44.020> so<00:04:45.020> it

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
lining it's nice and sticky so it

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.490 
lining it's nice and sticky so it
doesn't<00:04:45.590> let<00:04:46.190> you<00:04:46.340> put<00:04:46.580> slide<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.390> on<00:04:48.350> the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
doesn't let you put slide and on the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.880 
doesn't let you put slide and on the
bottom<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:49.630> have<00:04:50.630> that<00:04:50.990> one<00:04:51.260> screw<00:04:51.680> going

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
bottom I have that one screw going

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.610 
bottom I have that one screw going
through<00:04:52.419> that<00:04:53.419> keeps<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.110> batteries<00:04:54.470> in

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
through that keeps the batteries in

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.890 
through that keeps the batteries in
place<00:04:54.860> and<00:04:55.160> then<00:04:55.250> I<00:04:55.340> just<00:04:55.550> put<00:04:55.880> two<00:04:56.690> more

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
place and then I just put two more

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.620
