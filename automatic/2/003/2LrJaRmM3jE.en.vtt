roughly<00:04:14.300> six<00:04:14.690> foot<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.319> would<00:04:15.470> take<00:04:15.590> a

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.140 
centimeter or two so 181 centimeters 180
centimeters<00:04:20.350> under<00:04:21.350> 83<00:04:21.949> I<00:04:21.979> think<00:04:22.280> is<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.610> six

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150

Australian<00:06:26.140> sort<00:06:26.350> of<00:06:26.440> heritage<00:06:27.390> so<00:06:28.390> I<00:06:28.450> don't

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
Australian sort of heritage so I don't

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.719

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
and certainly the Chevrolet one looks a

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.120
