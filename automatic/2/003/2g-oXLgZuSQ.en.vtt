00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
think we want to give you something that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.990 
think we want to give you something that
looks<00:00:51.230> feminine<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:53.219> has<00:00:53.460> maybe<00:00:53.730> some

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
looks feminine but has maybe some

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.450 
looks feminine but has maybe some
strength<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.840> some<00:00:55.110> edge<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.309> need

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
strength to it some edge I think we need

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.069 
strength to it some edge I think we need
a<00:00:56.489> little<00:00:56.789> bit<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.059> edge<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.960> we

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
a little bit of edge I think that we

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.360 
a little bit of edge I think that we
should<00:00:58.289> maybe<00:00:58.469> make<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.859> grow<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.280> little

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
should maybe make you grow up a little

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.639 
should maybe make you grow up a little
bit<00:00:59.699> with<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> hairstyle<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.379> kind

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
bit with it with a hairstyle that kind

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.319

I was ready for this one once I said

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.740 
I was ready for this one once I said
throw<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.930> headshot<00:02:21.290> out<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> window<00:02:21.860> just

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
throw the headshot out the window just

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.160

you<00:02:23.750> know<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.379> great<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.310> next<00:02:25.580> step<00:02:26.170> almost

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
you know it's great the next step almost

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.740 
you know it's great the next step almost
there

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.210 

yeah<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:32.780> think<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.050> whole<00:02:33.260> process<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:34.069> about

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
yeah I think this whole process is about

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.300 
yeah I think this whole process is about
finding<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.269> look<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.660> owning<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.080> look<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.470> so

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
finding a look and owning a look and so

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.030 
finding a look and owning a look and so
I've<00:02:37.910> developed<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:38.810> idea<00:02:39.170> that's<00:02:39.739> been<00:02:39.920> in

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
I've developed this idea that's been in

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.460 
I've developed this idea that's been in
my<00:02:40.160> head<00:02:40.430> for<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.790> long<00:02:40.849> time<00:02:41.269> so<00:02:42.080> it's<00:02:42.230> all<00:02:42.440> one

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
my head for a long time so it's all one

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.640 
my head for a long time so it's all one
big<00:02:42.920> package<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.760> it's<00:02:44.090> about<00:02:44.650> discovering

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
big package and it's about discovering

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.940 
big package and it's about discovering
it<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.330> creating<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:48.230> embracing<00:02:48.799> it

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
it and creating it and then embracing it

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.760 
it and creating it and then embracing it
and<00:02:49.069> owning<00:02:49.640> it
