00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.139
 that is very demanding finds this 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.910
 to get splits between 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.130
 organizer 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.390
 Scoring pressure on the opponent's point 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.500
 guard is challenging 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.000
 therefore, of course, is as a player as 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.390
 Toni couple or wise as a player like 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.820
 Tony Parker is one of the world's best 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.460
 basketball players can only be considered as 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.379
 defend team 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.269
 that's how it will be with me in 2009 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.860
 yet so I wanted me and everyone else 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.780
 prove that I am also this level 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.839
 belong that I belong there and with it 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.489
 can play and now in 2013 it is like this 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.980
 that I really like with this 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.200
 team can be as successful as 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.420
 it's somehow possible with that too 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.570
 background that I have such a big one 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.920
 responsibility and to do so 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.690
 I do not worry so much about it now 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.940
 the single player of the opponent 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.969
 team so practically natural though 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.649
 not as a challenge for me now 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.259
 in any form but I am 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.920
 so how can we twelve others 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.920

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.560
