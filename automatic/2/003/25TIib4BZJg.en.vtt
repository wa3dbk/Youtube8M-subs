00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.230 

when<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:03.899> was<00:00:04.110> in<00:00:04.230> college<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.830> came<00:00:05.339> across<00:00:05.520> a

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
when I was in college I came across a

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.540 
when I was in college I came across a
gestural<00:00:06.870> line<00:00:07.109> that<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.470> sort<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.980> felt<00:00:08.280> a

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
gestural line that I sort of felt a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.390 
gestural line that I sort of felt a
kinship<00:00:08.970> with<00:00:09.240> him<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.809> good<00:00:10.530> bit<00:00:10.710> into<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.250> I

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
kinship with him a good bit into it I

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.690 
kinship with him a good bit into it I
was<00:00:11.900> realizing<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.650> line<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:14.130> getting

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
was realizing that the line was getting

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.300 
was realizing that the line was getting
muddy<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.260> next<00:00:16.470> step<00:00:16.650> was<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.980> cut

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
muddy and so the next step was to cut

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.040 
muddy and so the next step was to cut
the<00:00:17.340> negative<00:00:17.789> space<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.630> layer<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the negative space out and layer the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.120 
the negative space out and layer the
drawings<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.090> what<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> do<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.350> basically<00:00:22.859> I

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
drawings so what I do is basically I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.370 
drawings so what I do is basically I
start<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> plan<00:00:24.390> or<00:00:24.660> an<00:00:24.750> idea<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> how<00:00:25.350> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
start with the plan or an idea of how I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.769 
start with the plan or an idea of how I
want<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.740> approach<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.250> piece<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.880> then<00:00:27.029> map

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
want to approach the piece and then map

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.200 
want to approach the piece and then map
out<00:00:28.019> where<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> lines<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.760> more

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
out where the lines are going to be more

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
out where the lines are going to be more
or<00:00:30.269> less<00:00:30.390> these<00:00:31.260> are<00:00:31.410> two<00:00:31.560> pieces<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.040> are

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
or less these are two pieces that are

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.030 
or less these are two pieces that are
relatively<00:00:33.180> recent<00:00:33.630> they're<00:00:33.780> unframed<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
relatively recent they're unframed the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.310 
relatively recent they're unframed the
individual<00:00:35.579> drawings<00:00:36.030> are<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.360> attached<00:00:36.780> so

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
individual drawings are not attached so

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160 
individual drawings are not attached so
I<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.829> sort<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.040> pick<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.719> layer<00:00:39.899> so

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I can just sort of pick up the layer so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.540 
I can just sort of pick up the layer so
you<00:00:40.200> know<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.559> you're<00:00:40.680> looking<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.399> so

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you know what you're looking at and so

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.060 
you know what you're looking at and so
these<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.030> individual<00:00:42.780> sheets<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.770> paper

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
these are individual sheets of paper

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.200 
these are individual sheets of paper
that<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.850> layered<00:00:45.180> together<00:00:46.579> when<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> sit<00:00:48.180> at

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
that are layered together when I sit at

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.760 
that are layered together when I sit at
the<00:00:48.390> table<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.960> get<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.230> table<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the table when I get at the table to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.639 
the table when I get at the table to
draw<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> very<00:00:51.149> quick<00:00:51.390> process<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
draw it's a very quick process so I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.529 
draw it's a very quick process so I
might<00:00:52.980> take<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> handful<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.969> pencils

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
might take a handful of pencils

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.569 
might take a handful of pencils
depending<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> heart<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
depending on the heart and so this is a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.979 
depending on the heart and so this is a
age<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:58.440> I'll<00:00:58.859> draw<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.449> I'm<00:01:00.690> drawing

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
age so I'll draw and then as I'm drawing

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.500 
age so I'll draw and then as I'm drawing
rather<00:01:01.410> than<00:01:01.800> taking<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.550> individual<00:01:03.059> pencil

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
rather than taking one individual pencil

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.420 
rather than taking one individual pencil
drawing<00:01:04.049> until<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.589> gets<00:01:04.979> dull<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
drawing until it gets dull and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.310 
drawing until it gets dull and
sharpening<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.540> all<00:01:06.810> my<00:01:06.840> pencil

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
sharpening it I have all my pencil

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920 
sharpening it I have all my pencil
sharpened<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.090> draw<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.750> then<00:01:09.840> I

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
sharpened and I and I draw and then I

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
sharpened and I and I draw and then I
drop<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.409> pencils<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.250> drawing<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
drop the pencils as I'm drawing it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.719 
drop the pencils as I'm drawing it
enables<00:01:12.750> me<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.960> keep<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.619> flow<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.400> piece

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
enables me to keep the flow of the piece

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.450 
enables me to keep the flow of the piece
and<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> keeps<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> immediate<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.500> me<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.860> so

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and it keeps it immediate to me and so

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.789 
and it keeps it immediate to me and so
these<00:01:17.970> pencils<00:01:18.420> probably<00:01:18.930> get<00:01:19.080> chopped<00:01:19.439> down

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
these pencils probably get chopped down

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.530 
these pencils probably get chopped down
sometimes<00:01:20.280> too<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.880> course<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.240> their<00:01:21.330> life

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
sometimes too of course of their life

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.660 
sometimes too of course of their life
but<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.770> about<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.580> I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
but really what I like about it and I

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.340 
but really what I like about it and I
think<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:24.780> pencils<00:01:25.229> more

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
think that it's with these pencils more

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.990 
think that it's with these pencils more
than<00:01:25.560> anything<00:01:25.740> else<00:01:26.009> I've<00:01:26.130> ever<00:01:26.159> used<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
than anything else I've ever used is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.929 
than anything else I've ever used is
that<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.390> graves<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:28.229> consistent<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.670> only

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that the graves are consistent not only

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.090 
that the graves are consistent not only
within<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.329> pencil<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.110> within<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.650> pencils

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
within the pencil but within the pencils

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.200 
within the pencil but within the pencils
I<00:01:32.840> use<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.960> handful<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.530> pencils<00:01:35.040> each<00:01:35.790> time<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
I use a handful of pencils each time I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
I use a handful of pencils each time I
draw<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.020> don't<00:01:37.079> want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.470> go<00:01:37.560> from<00:01:37.799> one

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
draw and I don't want to go from one

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.100 
draw and I don't want to go from one
page<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> another<00:01:39.180> age<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.869> it'd<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
page to another age and it'd be a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.719 
page to another age and it'd be a
different<00:01:40.380> quality<00:01:41.040> line<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.549> very

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
different quality line it's very

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.630 
different quality line it's very
important<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.270> everything<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.750> consistent

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
important that everything is consistent

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.649 
important that everything is consistent
probably<00:01:44.640> used<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.090> ten<00:01:45.240> years<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> never

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
probably used it for ten years it never

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.340 
probably used it for ten years it never
had<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> problem

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
had a problem

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.609 
had a problem
that<00:01:46.850> our<00:01:47.850> supplies<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.390> sort<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.689> gone<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that our supplies have sort of gone the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.660
