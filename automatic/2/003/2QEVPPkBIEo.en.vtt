00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
100 you can't add any more to your kit

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590 
100 you can't add any more to your kit
so<00:01:46.710> you've<00:01:46.799> got<00:01:46.979> 100<00:01:47.490> capability<00:01:48.149> points<00:01:48.450> that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so you've got 100 capability points that

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
so you've got 100 capability points that
you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.869> add<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.350> all<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.220> is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
you can add and all you have to do is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.179 
you can add and all you have to do is
hover<00:01:51.030> over<00:01:51.630> whatever<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.500> want<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.920> let's

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
hover over whatever you want like let's

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.950 
hover over whatever you want like let's
say<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> want<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.420> hover<00:01:54.630> over

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
say I want this and you can hover over

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.389 
say I want this and you can hover over
the<00:01:55.049> question<00:01:55.200> mark<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.860> it'll<00:01:56.100> tell<00:01:56.280> you

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the question mark and it'll tell you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.090 
the question mark and it'll tell you
what<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.670> says<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.630> let's<00:01:58.350> say<00:01:58.469> damage

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
what it says so this is let's say damage

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.090 
what it says so this is let's say damage
to<00:01:59.399> greatly<00:02:00.149> increase<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.049> damage<00:02:01.290> from<00:02:01.950> your

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
to greatly increase the damage from your

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.789 
to greatly increase the damage from your
attacks<00:02:02.369> by<00:02:02.670> 40%<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.990> let's<00:02:04.380> say<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.619> like

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
attacks by 40% so let's say I'm like

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.230 
attacks by 40% so let's say I'm like
okay<00:02:05.130> that's<00:02:05.340> really<00:02:05.490> cool<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.939> want<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> be

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
okay that's really cool I want to be

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.059 
okay that's really cool I want to be
able<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.479> damage<00:02:06.930> people<00:02:07.350> more<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.799> drag

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
able to damage people more so I drag

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.190 
able to damage people more so I drag
that<00:02:08.220> over<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.300> let<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.539> go<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.020> it'll

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
that over here and I let it go and it'll

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.740 
that over here and I let it go and it'll
add<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.890> my<00:02:10.920> kit<00:02:11.310> configuration<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.450> it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
add it to my kit configuration and it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
add it to my kit configuration and it
will<00:02:12.840> show<00:02:12.959> me<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.440> 12

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
will show me that I have 12

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.890 
will show me that I have 12
points<00:02:14.100> remaining<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.210> cost<00:02:15.510> 80

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
points remaining because this cost 80

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.980 
points remaining because this cost 80
points<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.070> damage<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.270> then

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
points and so damage to is in and then

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.740 
points and so damage to is in and then
if<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.380> want<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.250> add<00:02:20.460> like<00:02:20.730> health<00:02:21.060> one<00:02:21.420> and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
if I want I can add like health one and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.870 
if I want I can add like health one and
I<00:02:22.290> could<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.220> then<00:02:23.430> all<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.820> to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
I could do that and then all I have to

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.880 
I could do that and then all I have to
do<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.210> add<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.720> whatever<00:02:24.960> name<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.440> want<00:02:25.650> so

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
do is add in whatever name I want so

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.390 
do is add in whatever name I want so
let's<00:02:26.010> call<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.480> killer<00:02:27.950> kit<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.190> I

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
let's call this the killer kit and I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.160 
let's call this the killer kit and I
could<00:02:29.610> leave<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:29.850> like<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.630> then<00:02:30.930> say

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
could leave that like that and then say

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.950 
could leave that like that and then say
that<00:02:31.380> if<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.620> wanted<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:33.300> if<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.570> don't<00:02:33.630> like

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
that if I wanted to and if I don't like

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.380 
that if I wanted to and if I don't like
it<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.320> just<00:02:34.650> click<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.160> trash<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.730> icons

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
it I can just click the trash can icons

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.480 
it I can just click the trash can icons
and<00:02:36.720> it'll<00:02:36.900> get<00:02:37.050> rid<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.260> those<00:02:37.470> abilities<00:02:37.980> so

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
and it'll get rid of those abilities so

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.460 
and it'll get rid of those abilities so
as<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.940> notice<00:02:39.300> every<00:02:39.660> time<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.870> add<00:02:40.140> something

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
as you notice every time I add something

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.070 
as you notice every time I add something
it'll<00:02:40.830> gray<00:02:41.310> out<00:02:41.550> certain<00:02:42.360> abilities<00:02:42.840> that

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
it'll gray out certain abilities that

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.830 
it'll gray out certain abilities that
cost<00:02:43.530> too<00:02:43.830> much<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.250> if<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.490> if<00:02:44.700> I'm<00:02:45.120> over<00:02:45.600> a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
cost too much so if I if I'm over a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.380 
cost too much so if I if I'm over a
certain<00:02:46.470> number<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.830> points<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:48.180> like<00:02:48.360> I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
certain number of points that so like I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.390 
certain number of points that so like I
added<00:02:48.840> fire<00:02:49.050> resistance<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:49.860> can't<00:02:50.220> add

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
added fire resistance so I can't add

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.070 
added fire resistance so I can't add
speed<00:02:50.790> too<00:02:51.090> because<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.480> would<00:02:51.750> take<00:02:51.930> me

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
speed too because that would take me

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.990 
speed too because that would take me
over<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.350> hundred<00:02:52.470> points<00:02:53.160> so<00:02:53.310> Gray's<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.850> out

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
over a hundred points so Gray's that out

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.910 
over a hundred points so Gray's that out
so<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.600> knew<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.810> can't<00:02:55.170> choose<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.440> was<00:02:55.800> it

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
so I knew I can't choose that was it

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.570 
so I knew I can't choose that was it
pretty<00:02:56.070> cool

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
pretty cool

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.370 
pretty cool
so<00:02:57.180> anyway<00:02:57.390> let's<00:02:57.690> say<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.840> want<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.080> design<00:02:58.320> a

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
so anyway let's say I want to design a

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.930 
so anyway let's say I want to design a
kit<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:58.740> let<00:02:58.950> me<00:02:59.010> go<00:02:59.130> down<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.610> know<00:02:59.640> what<00:02:59.790> I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
kit so let me go down you know what I

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.360 
kit so let me go down you know what I
like<00:03:00.420> let's<00:03:01.290> go<00:03:01.470> with<00:03:01.620> oh<00:03:01.800> here<00:03:02.100> we<00:03:02.220> go

like let's go with oh here we go
we've<00:03:02.790> got<00:03:03.030> point<00:03:03.450> e<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.840> greatly<00:03:04.830> increase

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
we've got point e to greatly increase

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.400 
we've got point e to greatly increase
the<00:03:05.610> chance<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.030> finding<00:03:06.240> weapons<00:03:06.570> heavy

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
the chance of finding weapons heavy

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.320 
the chance of finding weapons heavy
weapons<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.070> chests<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.550> sounds<00:03:08.820> cool<00:03:09.060> let's

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
weapons in chests that sounds cool let's

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.600 
weapons in chests that sounds cool let's
add<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.860> what<00:03:10.860> else<00:03:11.010> do<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.190> want<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.490> add

add that what else do you want to add

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.540 
add that what else do you want to add
let's<00:03:11.970> add<00:03:12.180> Bowser<00:03:12.810> 1<00:03:13.350> increase<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.310> damage

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
let's add Bowser 1 increase the damage

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.010 
let's add Bowser 1 increase the damage
done<00:03:15.650> done<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.850> princess<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.540> let's<00:03:18.870> you

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
could actually design a whole team like

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.600 
could actually design a whole team like
design<00:04:45.060> for<00:04:45.450> kits<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.080> then<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.710> could<00:04:46.980> show
