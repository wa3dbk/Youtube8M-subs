00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 Talk to people or welcome to one more. 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.870
 video and this video here I go okay 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.330
 Spoken killer includes diesel black 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.160
 good flag 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.640
 many people informed me that the game is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.880
 very slow and then I broke the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.900
 head and manage to solve 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.910
 good first the error is not of the game and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.300
 the configuration of your 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.149
 video for who has geforce this video 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.800
 this is for you 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.800
 so come on, let's go to the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.379
 nvidia control 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.899
 we go in settings the program 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.719
 and we'll add the game 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.680
 here on the video card we go 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.170
 put that here we will open 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.930
 done it we go on 2 here we go 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.239
 put on nvidia high processor 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.109
 performance 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.570
 now here we will go down and here 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.060
 in this part the maximum number of frames pre- 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.240
 rendered here we'll put in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.470
 4 always the last option if you have a 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.060
 The more you put in the last option 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.470
 Good here we will not move or will 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.490
 remembering look at this setting here 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.460
 before they live there, it leaves 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.939
 range correction off 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.040
 Okay, done that your game will not be 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.470
 slower but we'll have to 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.939
 set up inside the game not to 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.430
 stay law so I'll stop here the video and 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.150
 I'll put it in the fred now so I can 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.119
 record 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.840
 good people here we go in the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840
 options 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:57.090
 the graphics will leave this setting 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.299
 here in the minimum settings but the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.200
 game graphics are perfect 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:06.750
 here you leave computer revolution 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.929
 quality of the environment is very low 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.150
 texture quality off shadow 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.620
 low 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:19.430
 reflection on off moves 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.159
 off and here v5 connected 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.370
 Good people, this is for us to get. 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:28.189
 better in-game performance 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.980
 You will see the good difference if you 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:34.549
 want to leave an option enabled let 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.930
 but what if you leave everything here in medium 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.890
 the game will take more on the part of the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.530
 graphics 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.849
 so here is this setting here 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:50.180
 in good performance paulo nor the video and 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.599
 copenhagen compensates configuration here is 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.709
 This galley was worth watching. 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:00.230
 thing, just call facebook or 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.030

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.030
