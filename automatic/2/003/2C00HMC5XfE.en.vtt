00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
that out for everyone and that's pretty

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.000 
that out for everyone and that's pretty
much<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:37.000> looked<00:03:37.690> around<00:03:37.810> everyone<00:03:38.740> had<00:03:38.920> the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
much it I looked around everyone had the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.760 
much it I looked around everyone had the
wrong<00:03:39.220> settings<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.570> just<00:03:41.080> didn't<00:03:41.500> really

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
wrong settings and I just didn't really

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.530 
wrong settings and I just didn't really
think<00:03:41.950> anyone<00:03:42.550> should<00:03:42.670> be<00:03:42.790> posting<00:03:43.210> settings

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
think anyone should be posting settings

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.210 
think anyone should be posting settings
if<00:03:43.660> they<00:03:43.780> didn't<00:03:43.960> have<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:44.200> right<00:03:44.350> ones<00:03:44.590> so

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.430 
if they didn't have the right ones so
I've<00:03:45.460> got<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.820> correct<00:03:46.030> ones<00:03:46.330> they're<00:03:46.930> 100%
