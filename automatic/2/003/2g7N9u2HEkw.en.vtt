scourge as though I got a ton of skirt
is<00:01:51.450> getting<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:52.170> take<00:01:52.380> out<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:52.740> carrier

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

is getting in they take out one carrier
only<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.000> carrier<00:01:54.360> critically<00:01:54.750> may<00:01:54.960> have

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
taken out of Coursera to as well but

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
taken out of Coursera to as well but
this<00:01:56.780> scourge<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.930> not<00:01:58.140> quite<00:01:58.350> doing<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.680> much

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
damage as they could have I think he

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.709 
damage as they could have I think he
probably<00:01:59.909> should<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.240> targeted<00:02:00.600> those

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
probably should have targeted those

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.899 
probably should have targeted those
Corsairs<00:02:01.200> instead<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.399> reduce<00:02:02.729> those

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
Corsairs instead and reduce those

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.539 
Corsairs instead and reduce those
numbers<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.329> now<00:02:04.079> more<00:02:04.380> Curtis<00:02:04.770> scourge<00:02:05.399> is

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
that the major thing here is that much

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.530 
that the major thing here is that much
he<00:03:42.070> doesn't<00:03:42.519> have<00:03:42.610> those<00:03:42.790> Reapers<00:03:43.180> anymore

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
and I'm not sure exactly where those

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.009 
and I'm not sure exactly where those
rivers<00:03:45.070> went<00:03:45.310> but<00:03:45.910> he<00:03:46.060> had<00:03:46.239> those<00:03:46.390> rivers<00:03:46.780> and

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
location that he can go to so there

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.240

there<00:06:14.150> is<00:06:14.270> that<00:06:14.479> still<00:06:15.100> although<00:06:16.100> i<00:06:16.130> don't

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
there is that still although i don't

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.840 
taking that but man if much can starve
luxury<00:06:24.710> out<00:06:24.890> though<00:06:25.040> like<00:06:25.280> I<00:06:25.370> said<00:06:25.520> he's<00:06:25.669> been

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
luxury out though like I said he's been

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.180 
luxury out though like I said he's been
kind<00:06:26.120> of<00:06:26.210> holding<00:06:26.750> out<00:06:27.110> this<00:06:27.140> whole<00:06:27.350> time<00:06:27.620> if

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
kind of holding out this whole time if

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.190 
kind of holding out this whole time if
theoretically<00:06:28.640> could<00:06:29.090> starve<00:06:29.450> luxury<00:06:29.870> out<00:06:29.960> he

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
theoretically could starve luxury out he

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.930 
theoretically could starve luxury out he
may<00:06:30.440> be<00:06:30.500> able<00:06:30.710> to<00:06:30.800> stand<00:06:31.070> a<00:06:31.310> chance<00:06:31.370> in<00:06:31.850> the

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
may be able to stand a chance in the

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.060 
may be able to stand a chance in the
long<00:06:32.090> run<00:06:32.120> oh<00:06:32.479> here<00:06:32.840> comes<00:06:33.050> some<00:06:33.229> swarm<00:06:33.500> here

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
long run oh here comes some swarm here

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.100 
long run oh here comes some swarm here
comes<00:06:34.340> some<00:06:34.550> swarm<00:06:34.910> swarm<00:06:35.660> with<00:06:36.020> the

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
comes some swarm swarm with the

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.860 
comes some swarm swarm with the
zerglings

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
zerglings

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.420 
zerglings
and<00:06:36.960> so<00:06:37.290> those<00:06:37.440> zerglings<00:06:37.890> are<00:06:38.010> basically

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
and so those zerglings are basically

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.980 
and so those zerglings are basically
immune<00:06:38.760> to<00:06:38.910> everything<00:06:39.150> much<00:06:39.390> has<00:06:39.600> because<00:06:39.930> he

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
immune to everything much has because he

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.450 
immune to everything much has because he
doesn't<00:06:40.230> have<00:06:40.500> those<00:06:40.680> rivers<00:06:41.070> there's<00:06:41.280> no

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
doesn't have those rivers there's no

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.920 
doesn't have those rivers there's no
rivers<00:06:41.760> to<00:06:41.880> speak<00:06:42.090> of<00:06:42.240> and<00:06:42.330> so<00:06:42.540> this<00:06:42.690> whole

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
rivers to speak of and so this whole

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.150 
rivers to speak of and so this whole
base<00:06:43.170> is<00:06:43.200> now<00:06:43.500> going<00:06:43.650> to<00:06:43.740> get<00:06:43.830> destroyed

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
base is now going to get destroyed

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.070 
base is now going to get destroyed
because<00:06:44.730> of<00:06:44.910> the<00:06:45.060> lack<00:06:45.240> of<00:06:45.270> he<00:06:45.690> does<00:06:45.870> have<00:06:46.050> a

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
because of the lack of he does have a

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.650
