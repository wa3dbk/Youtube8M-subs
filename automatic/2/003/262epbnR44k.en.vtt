00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.720 

in<00:00:21.660> our<00:00:21.840> last<00:00:22.019> lesson<00:00:22.349> we<00:00:22.980> took<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.400> look<00:00:23.609> at

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
in our last lesson we took a look at

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.999 
in our last lesson we took a look at
this<00:00:23.880> fruit<00:00:24.119> tree<00:00:24.329> and<00:00:24.539> realized<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:25.919> of

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
this fruit tree and realized that two of

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.909 
this fruit tree and realized that two of
the<00:00:26.099> branches<00:00:27.079> needed<00:00:28.079> to<00:00:28.169> come<00:00:28.349> out<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.770> is

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
the branches needed to come out one is

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.089 
the branches needed to come out one is
to<00:00:29.070> horizontal<00:00:29.699> when<00:00:30.509> is<00:00:30.660> too<00:00:30.810> vertical<00:00:31.099> they

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
to horizontal when is too vertical they

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.640 
to horizontal when is too vertical they
didn't<00:00:32.369> meet<00:00:32.519> our<00:00:32.699> criteria<00:00:32.970> of<00:00:33.690> 10<00:00:34.470> o'clock

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
didn't meet our criteria of 10 o'clock

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.439 
didn't meet our criteria of 10 o'clock
and<00:00:35.339> 2<00:00:35.550> o'clock<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> we'll<00:00:38.909> just<00:00:39.059> cut<00:00:39.269> those

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
and 2 o'clock so we'll just cut those

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.890 
and 2 o'clock so we'll just cut those
out<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.519> the<00:00:41.519> tree<00:00:41.790> will<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.210> much<00:00:42.870> more

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
out and the tree will have much more

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.290 
out and the tree will have much more
light<00:00:45.140> much<00:00:46.140> more<00:00:46.409> air<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.820> existing

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
light much more air and the existing

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.819 
light much more air and the existing
branches<00:00:49.039> will<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> lot<00:00:50.430> healthier<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.649> we

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
branches will be a lot healthier and we

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.729 
branches will be a lot healthier and we
have<00:00:53.010> our<00:00:53.219> angles<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.239> 10<00:00:54.660> o'clock<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.440> 2

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
have our angles of 10 o'clock and 2

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.479 
have our angles of 10 o'clock and 2
o'clock<00:00:56.840> there's<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.109> minor<00:00:58.440> problem<00:00:58.739> near

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
o'clock there's one minor problem near

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.990 
o'clock there's one minor problem near
the<00:00:59.670> top<00:01:00.379> this<00:01:01.379> branch<00:01:01.710> starts<00:01:02.190> out<00:01:02.429> at<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the top this branch starts out at the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.749 
the top this branch starts out at the
right<00:01:03.149> angle<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:03.629> then<00:01:03.840> goes<00:01:04.019> horizontal

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
right angle but then goes horizontal

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.219 
right angle but then goes horizontal
what<00:01:05.759> we<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:07.740> direct<00:01:08.490> growth<00:01:09.200> by<00:01:10.200> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
what we can do is direct growth by a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
what we can do is direct growth by a
proper<00:01:10.830> pruning<00:01:11.070> cut<00:01:12.320> we'll<00:01:13.320> take<00:01:13.560> off<00:01:13.850> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
proper pruning cut we'll take off the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.650 
proper pruning cut we'll take off the
horizontal<00:01:15.770> extension<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.970> branch<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
horizontal extension of this branch and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.130 
horizontal extension of this branch and
direct<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> growth<00:01:19.880> at<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.750> proper

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
direct the growth at more of a proper

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.910 
direct the growth at more of a proper
angle

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.670 

it's<00:01:28.920> extremely<00:01:29.550> important<00:01:30.080> when<00:01:31.080> making<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it's extremely important when making a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.910 
it's extremely important when making a
cut<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.640> cut<00:01:33.060> exactly<00:01:33.690> at<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.350> proper<00:01:34.860> place

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
cut to cut exactly at the proper place

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.450 
cut to cut exactly at the proper place
each<00:01:37.920> branch<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.910> it<00:01:39.090> meets<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> trunk

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
each branch as it meets the trunk

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.230 
each branch as it meets the trunk
creates<00:01:41.460> an<00:01:42.260> area<00:01:43.260> a<00:01:43.560> swollen<00:01:44.040> area<00:01:44.400> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
creates an area a swollen area the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.530 
creates an area a swollen area the
collar<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.850> needs<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.510> be

some<00:02:21.710> orchardists<00:02:22.400> now<00:02:22.670> are<00:02:23.560> modifying<00:02:24.560> the

some orchardists now are modifying the

some orchardists now are modifying the
central<00:02:25.160> leader<00:02:25.310> system<00:02:25.760> slightly<00:02:26.440> they'll

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
central leader system slightly they'll

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.790 
central leader system slightly they'll
cut<00:02:27.740> out<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.070> center<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.390> tree<00:02:29.720> when<00:02:30.650> it

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
cut out the center of the tree when it

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.740 
cut out the center of the tree when it
gets<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.130> be<00:02:31.310> eight<00:02:31.670> or<00:02:31.820> ten<00:02:32.030> feet<00:02:32.270> tall<00:02:33.460> and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
gets to be eight or ten feet tall and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.690 
gets to be eight or ten feet tall and
then<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:36.430> tree<00:02:37.430> will<00:02:37.790> develop<00:02:38.480> two<00:02:38.810> or<00:02:39.020> three

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
then this tree will develop two or three

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.510 
then this tree will develop two or three
leaders<00:02:40.700> at<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.330> very<00:02:41.540> top<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.520> increase

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
leaders at the very top and increase

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.240 
leaders at the very top and increase
fruit<00:02:43.880> bearing<00:02:44.180> area<00:02:44.750> near<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.740> top<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:45.980> the
