well we're here today to go and look at
a<00:00:05.150> site<00:00:05.510> near<00:00:05.870> Loch<00:00:06.260> Ness<00:00:06.560> which<00:00:07.370> is<00:00:07.519> where

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
a site near Loch Ness which is where

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.940 
a site near Loch Ness which is where
first<00:00:08.000> group<00:00:08.269> hold<00:00:08.690> their<00:00:08.960> Duathlon<00:00:09.590> event

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
first group hold their Duathlon event

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.280 
first group hold their Duathlon event
and<00:00:10.220> last<00:00:11.000> year<00:00:11.270> they<00:00:11.450> suffered<00:00:11.810> very<00:00:12.050> badly

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
and last year they suffered very badly

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.930 
and last year they suffered very badly
from<00:00:12.500> midges<00:00:12.890> at<00:00:13.040> one<00:00:13.160> of<00:00:13.310> these<00:00:13.460> station

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
from midges at one of these station

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.119 
from midges at one of these station
points<00:00:14.360> so<00:00:15.080> we're<00:00:15.440> going<00:00:15.620> up<00:00:15.740> to<00:00:15.770> have<00:00:15.920> a<00:00:15.950> look

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
points so we're going up to have a look

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.340 
points so we're going up to have a look
at<00:00:16.219> that<00:00:16.309> site<00:00:16.609> today<00:00:16.820> to<00:00:17.180> see<00:00:17.480> if<00:00:17.570> we<00:00:17.750> can<00:00:17.960> plan

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
at that site today to see if we can plan

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.100 
at that site today to see if we can plan
and<00:00:18.620> carry<00:00:18.770> out<00:00:18.920> a<00:00:19.039> really<00:00:19.430> important

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
and carry out a really important

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.630 
and carry out a really important
experiment<00:00:21.110> on<00:00:21.260> some<00:00:21.500> new<00:00:22.010> repellents<00:00:22.580> that

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
experiment on some new repellents that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.520 
experiment on some new repellents that
we're<00:00:22.970> developing<00:00:23.510> at<00:00:23.930> Aberdeen<00:00:24.320> and

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
we're developing at Aberdeen and

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.650 
we're developing at Aberdeen and
Rothamsted<00:00:24.890> I've<00:00:25.760> never<00:00:26.090> heard<00:00:26.330> of<00:00:26.449> anybody

dying from midge bites but it is true

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.519 
dying from midge bites but it is true
that<00:00:28.640> some<00:00:28.880> people<00:00:28.910> react<00:00:29.480> quite<00:00:29.720> badly<00:00:30.020> to

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
that some people react quite badly to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.849 
that some people react quite badly to
their<00:00:30.710> bites<00:00:31.930> also<00:00:32.930> they<00:00:33.140> are<00:00:33.230> painful<00:00:33.530> by

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:33.859 
their bites also they are painful by

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:35.410 
their bites also they are painful by
it's<00:00:34.039> much<00:00:34.190> more<00:00:34.340> painful<00:00:34.550> than<00:00:35.000> the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
it's much more painful than the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.139 
it's much more painful than the
mosquitoes<00:00:36.140> at<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.190> time<00:00:37.430> that<00:00:37.640> it<00:00:37.760> happens

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
mosquitoes at the time that it happens

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.910 
mosquitoes at the time that it happens
and<00:00:38.510> people<00:00:38.870> just<00:00:39.020> don't<00:00:39.140> like<00:00:39.410> them<00:00:39.620> at<00:00:39.739> all

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
and people just don't like them at all

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.850 
and people just don't like them at all
the<00:00:40.760> first<00:00:40.880> monster<00:00:41.180> trial<00:00:41.630> is<00:00:41.899> very<00:00:42.260> exciting

the first monster trial is very exciting

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.049 
the first monster trial is very exciting
for<00:00:42.890> us<00:00:43.130> because<00:00:43.550> it<00:00:43.670> gives<00:00:43.700> us<00:00:43.940> the

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
for us because it gives us the

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.330 
for us because it gives us the
opportunity<00:00:44.300> to<00:00:44.899> work<00:00:45.079> with<00:00:45.220> around<00:00:46.220> a

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
well the first monster challenge is

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.950 
well the first monster challenge is
bringing<00:01:01.520> people<00:01:01.700> all<00:01:02.059> sorts<00:01:02.390> of<00:01:02.600> people<00:01:02.780> a

bringing people all sorts of people a

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.350 
bringing people all sorts of people a
great<00:01:03.170> cross-section<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:04.100> society<00:01:04.280> from<00:01:05.180> all

walks of life into an area like the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.350 
walks of life into an area like the
Highlands<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.720> Scotland<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.820> over<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.850> period

Highlands of Scotland and over a period

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.170 
Highlands of Scotland and over a period
when<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.380> veggie<00:01:12.650> population<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:13.520> fairly

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
when the veggie population is fairly

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.090 
when the veggie population is fairly
high<00:01:15.940> there<00:01:16.940> are<00:01:17.060> places<00:01:17.479> going<00:01:18.380> down<00:01:18.680> England

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
high there are places going down England

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.700 
high there are places going down England
for<00:01:19.280> example<00:01:19.420> local<00:01:20.420> areas<00:01:21.020> where<00:01:21.260> you<00:01:21.409> find

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
for example local areas where you find

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.010 
for example local areas where you find
the<00:01:21.830> same<00:01:22.040> species<00:01:22.400> of<00:01:22.760> midge<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.720> indeed

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
the same species of midge and indeed

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.870 
the same species of midge and indeed
this<00:01:24.229> species<00:01:24.740> goes<00:01:24.979> all<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.280> way<00:01:25.400> down<00:01:25.700> to

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
this species goes all the way down to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.000 
this species goes all the way down to
the<00:01:25.970> South<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.390> France<00:01:26.420> but<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:27.470> have<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.890> have

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
the South of France but you have to have

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.640 
the South of France but you have to have
the<00:01:28.189> right<00:01:28.420> larval<00:01:29.420> habitat<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:30.140> is<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.409> key

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
the right larval habitat that is the key

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.190 
the right larval habitat that is the key
to<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:30.979> all<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:31.850> have<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.240> have<00:01:32.390> swampy

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
to it all so you have to have swampy

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.219 
to it all so you have to have swampy
ground<00:01:34.150> that<00:01:35.150> will<00:01:35.330> support<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.840> larvae

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
ground that will support the larvae

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.820 
ground that will support the larvae
through<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.650> wintertime<00:01:38.350> well<00:01:39.350> from<00:01:39.619> our

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
through the wintertime well from our

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.590 
through the wintertime well from our
research<00:01:40.220> we've<00:01:40.520> isolated<00:01:41.240> particular

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
research we've isolated particular

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.109 
research we've isolated particular
chemicals<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:43.310> are<00:01:43.460> found<00:01:43.820> in

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
chemicals that are found in

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.240 
chemicals that are found in
non-attractive<00:01:44.990> people<00:01:45.530> more<00:01:45.710> than<00:01:45.860> others

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
non-attractive people more than others

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.069 
non-attractive people more than others
so<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.729> first<00:01:46.939> one<00:01:47.180> we're<00:01:47.360> going<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.600> do<00:01:47.840> is

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
so the first one we're going to do is

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.950 
so the first one we're going to do is
using<00:01:48.920> them<00:01:49.070> as<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.490> scent<00:01:49.909> in<00:01:50.180> a<00:01:50.299> puffer<00:01:50.659> device

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
using them as a scent in a puffer device

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.170 
using them as a scent in a puffer device
inside<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.680> tent

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
inside a tent

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.540 
inside a tent
well<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:53.930> have<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.080> very<00:01:54.320> special<00:01:54.620> device<00:01:55.130> that

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
well we have a very special device that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.310 
well we have a very special device that
we've<00:01:55.700> used<00:01:55.940> in<00:01:56.120> some<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.390> our<00:01:56.600> Windtunnel

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
we've used in some of our Windtunnel

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.650 
we've used in some of our Windtunnel
arenas<00:01:57.800> in<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:57.980> laboratory<00:01:58.640> which<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.480> a

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
arenas in the laboratory which is a
