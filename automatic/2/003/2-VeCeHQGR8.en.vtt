story ended yeah pretty much like all
the<00:02:13.510> others<00:02:13.780> somehow<00:02:14.260> even<00:02:14.650> though<00:02:14.680> we're

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
the others somehow even though we're

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.710 
the others somehow even though we're
only<00:02:14.950> five<00:02:15.310> episodes<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.970> it's<00:02:16.150> possible<00:02:16.599> for

only five episodes in it's possible for
this<00:02:16.840> show<00:02:17.049> to<00:02:17.080> become<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.440> hollow<00:02:17.739> mockery<00:02:18.069> of

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
this show to become a hollow mockery of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.280 
this show to become a hollow mockery of
itself<00:02:18.610> already<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:19.930> only<00:02:20.019> go<00:02:20.260> up

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
itself already but it can only go up

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.550

antimatter<00:02:26.260> unlimited<00:02:27.130> energy<00:02:27.459> source<00:02:27.760> or

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
antimatter unlimited energy source or

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.750 
antimatter unlimited energy source or
minor<00:02:28.299> inconvenience<00:02:29.280> megatron<00:02:30.280> blows<00:02:30.549> up

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
minor inconvenience megatron blows up

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.100 
minor inconvenience megatron blows up
the<00:02:30.880> lab<00:02:31.090> with<00:02:31.299> what<00:02:31.450> appears<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.840> be<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
the lab with what appears to be the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.740 
the lab with what appears to be the
power<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.590> thousand<00:02:33.069> suns<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:34.450> when<00:02:34.660> we

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
power of a thousand suns but when we

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.180 
power of a thousand suns but when we
come<00:02:34.900> back<00:02:35.019> from<00:02:35.170> commercial<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.829> Autobots

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
come back from commercial the Autobots

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.860 
come back from commercial the Autobots
escaped<00:02:36.579> just<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.970> little<00:02:37.209> dinged<00:02:37.420> up<00:02:37.630> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
escaped just a little dinged up and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.870 
escaped just a little dinged up and
Megatron's<00:02:38.530> own<00:02:38.739> guys<00:02:39.010> who<00:02:39.340> were<00:02:39.430> right<00:02:39.640> there

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
Megatron's own guys who were right there

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.640 
Megatron's own guys who were right there
when<00:02:40.030> he<00:02:40.090> set<00:02:40.299> off<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.569> explosion<00:02:41.110> are<00:02:41.290> just

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
when he set off the explosion are just

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.120 
when he set off the explosion are just
fine

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
fine

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.460 
fine
then<00:02:42.519> later<00:02:42.880> when<00:02:43.480> Megatron<00:02:43.930> loads<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.290> bunch

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
then later when Megatron loads a bunch

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.380 
then later when Megatron loads a bunch
of<00:02:44.560> antimatter<00:02:45.040> Energon<00:02:45.640> cubes<00:02:45.970> into<00:02:46.239> himself

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
of antimatter Energon cubes into himself

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.930 
of antimatter Energon cubes into himself
and<00:02:46.720> transforms<00:02:47.319> to<00:02:47.470> gun<00:02:47.650> mode<00:02:47.920> while<00:02:48.670> all<00:02:48.819> it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
and transforms to gun mode while all it

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.430 
and transforms to gun mode while all it
takes<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.299> having<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:49.660> gun<00:02:49.810> smacked<00:02:50.170> out<00:02:50.290> of

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
takes is having the gun smacked out of

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.319 
takes is having the gun smacked out of
Starscream's<00:02:50.980> hand<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:51.819> poking<00:02:52.239> a

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
Starscream's hand then poking a

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.879 
Starscream's hand then poking a
Thundercracker<00:02:52.840> with<00:02:53.049> a<00:02:53.109> jackhammer<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.680> make

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
Thundercracker with a jackhammer to make

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.220 
Thundercracker with a jackhammer to make
them<00:02:54.040> give<00:02:54.220> up<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:55.150> what<00:02:55.389> conclusion<00:02:55.989> can<00:02:56.019> we

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
them give up so what conclusion can we

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.530 
them give up so what conclusion can we
reach<00:02:56.410> from<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.880> antimatter<00:02:57.880> really<00:02:58.239> isn't

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
reach from this antimatter really isn't

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.300 
reach from this antimatter really isn't
as<00:02:58.690> big<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> deal<00:02:59.109> as<00:02:59.170> Star<00:02:59.530> Trek<00:02:59.739> has<00:02:59.859> led<00:03:00.040> us<00:03:00.160> to

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
as big a deal as Star Trek has led us to

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.400 
as big a deal as Star Trek has led us to
believe
