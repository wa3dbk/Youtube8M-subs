you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.220> more<00:01:35.340> than<00:01:35.430> 150<00:01:35.909> or<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.619> about

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you can have more than 150 or so about

twenty-five<00:01:38.369> I'd<00:01:38.880> say<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> freshman<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
twenty-five I'd say I'm a freshman so I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.960 
twenty-five I'd say I'm a freshman so I
take<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> lot<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.189> introductory<00:01:41.579> classes

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
