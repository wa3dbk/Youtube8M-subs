 20 thousand viewers by today's standards it 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.369

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.830

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.390
 of existence 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.130

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.780
 man so what do you need to do 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.940
 I collected 30 character figures from 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.890
 various video games and left alone and 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.290
 darkened version of what you will see on 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.600
 the screen of all heroes the coquette earlier 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.240
 30 pieces and your task is to guess how you can 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.590
 more characters are not necessarily all but 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.030
 the more the better 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.430
 each character has its own ordinal 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.350
 number and you need grace what 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.430
 actually this hero is what game 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.260

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.840
 if met only in certain 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.420
 parts then specify exactly what her answers are 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.620
