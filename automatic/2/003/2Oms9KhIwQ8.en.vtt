off the bat I got a pretty even coverage

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.340 
off the bat I got a pretty even coverage
with<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.070> tinsel<00:01:39.700> speckles<00:01:40.360> but<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.110> flower

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
with the tinsel speckles but the flower

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.260 
with the tinsel speckles but the flower
itself<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:42.130> kind<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.400> interesting<00:01:42.970> because

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
itself is kind of interesting because

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.840 
itself is kind of interesting because
the<00:01:43.660> flower<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.260> large<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:45.100> actually<00:01:45.670> looks

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
the flower so large it actually looks

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.790 
the flower so large it actually looks
kind<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.090> awkward<00:01:46.300> on<00:01:46.630> my<00:01:46.780> nails<00:01:46.990> if<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.680> look

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
kind of awkward on my nails if you look

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.500 
kind of awkward on my nails if you look
closely<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.310> can<00:01:48.340> see<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.970> edges<00:01:49.150> of

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
closely you can see that the edges of

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.630 
closely you can see that the edges of
the<00:01:49.660> flowers<00:01:50.050> actually<00:01:50.320> do<00:01:50.800> not<00:01:50.920> stay<00:01:51.280> flush

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
the flowers actually do not stay flush

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.060 
the flowers actually do not stay flush
onto<00:01:52.210> my<00:01:52.390> nails<00:01:52.630> because<00:01:53.410> my<00:01:53.560> nails<00:01:53.710> are<00:01:53.890> kind

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
onto my nails because my nails are kind

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.450 
onto my nails because my nails are kind
of<00:01:54.160> curved<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.790> flower<00:01:55.150> is<00:01:55.480> very<00:01:55.720> flat<00:01:56.460> so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
of curved and the flower is very flat so

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.010 
of curved and the flower is very flat so
now<00:01:57.730> let's<00:01:57.940> go<00:01:58.060> ahead<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.510> finish<00:01:58.660> painting

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
now let's go ahead and finish painting

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.390 
now let's go ahead and finish painting
the<00:01:59.200> rest<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.470> our<00:01:59.560> nails<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.010> we'll<00:02:00.160> get<00:02:00.250> back

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
the rest of our nails and we'll get back

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:19.010 
the rest of our nails and we'll get back
together<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.970> see<00:02:01.150> how<00:02:01.300> it<00:02:01.420> turns<00:02:01.660> out

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.510 

here's<00:02:20.020> how<00:02:20.230> my<00:02:20.380> nails<00:02:20.560> turned<00:02:20.860> out<00:02:20.980> after<00:02:21.370> the

not<00:02:27.460> lucky<00:02:27.790> enough<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:28.480> catch<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.870> flower<00:02:29.170> but

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
not lucky enough to catch a flower but

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.050 
not lucky enough to catch a flower but
to<00:02:29.890> be<00:02:30.010> honest<00:02:30.280> with<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.580> don't<00:02:30.790> really

I'm in love with how the pink pops on my
blue<00:02:37.870> base<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:43.180> now<00:02:43.390> let's<00:02:43.660> go<00:02:43.780> ahead<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.260> move

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
can see it took me some time to actually

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.520 
can see it took me some time to actually
do<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.120> little<00:02:49.330> bit<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.630> digging<00:02:50.110> in<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> nail

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
do a little bit of digging in the nail

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.770 
do a little bit of digging in the nail
polish<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.340> actually<00:02:51.820> catch<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.209> flower<00:02:52.450> I

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780

blue nail polish so the pink one is a

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.720 
blue nail polish so the pink one is a
little<00:02:56.650> bit<00:02:56.770> more<00:02:56.920> difficult<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.430> get<00:02:57.580> the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.040 

so<00:03:54.490> as<00:03:54.790> you<00:03:54.970> can<00:03:55.090> see<00:03:55.150> here<00:03:55.660> on<00:03:55.810> my<00:03:56.020> index

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
so as you can see here on my index

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.680 
so as you can see here on my index
finger<00:03:56.710> I<00:03:56.890> actually<00:03:57.100> caught<00:03:57.580> two<00:03:57.880> flowers<00:03:58.450> and

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
finger I actually caught two flowers and

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.840 
finger I actually caught two flowers and
I<00:03:59.110> decided<00:03:59.440> to<00:03:59.650> take<00:03:59.770> the<00:03:59.950> moment<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.400> try<00:04:00.790> to

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
I decided to take the moment to try to

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.370 
I decided to take the moment to try to
move<00:04:01.060> around<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.450> flower<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.810> little<00:04:01.900> bit<00:04:02.230> and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
move around the flower a little bit and

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.990 
move around the flower a little bit and
as<00:04:02.830> you<00:04:02.980> can<00:04:03.100> see<00:04:03.160> that<00:04:03.550> wasn't<00:04:03.730> so<00:04:03.880> difficult

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
as you can see that wasn't so difficult

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.630 
as you can see that wasn't so difficult
so<00:04:04.960> as<00:04:05.260> long<00:04:05.440> as<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.740> move<00:04:05.920> quickly<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.490> can

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
so as long as you move quickly you can

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.520 
so as long as you move quickly you can
actually<00:04:06.940> maneuver<00:04:07.570> your<00:04:07.810> flowers<00:04:08.230> around

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
actually maneuver your flowers around

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:17.900 
actually maneuver your flowers around
pretty<00:04:08.800> easily

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.550 

so<00:04:18.910> with<00:04:19.150> these<00:04:19.269> nail<00:04:19.510> polishes<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:20.200> can<00:04:20.350> most

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
so with these nail polishes you can most

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.530 
so with these nail polishes you can most
definitely<00:04:20.650> get<00:04:21.400> away<00:04:21.700> with<00:04:21.910> just<00:04:21.940> having<00:04:22.270> the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.690 
definitely get away with just having the
first<00:04:22.840> coat<00:04:23.140> of<00:04:23.290> nail<00:04:23.470> polish<00:04:23.860> but<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.400> decided

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
started off with my middle finger at

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.740 
started off with my middle finger at
this<00:05:05.980> time<00:05:06.190> because<00:05:06.400> I<00:05:06.760> saw<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.390> caught<00:05:07.630> a

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
this time because I saw that I caught a

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.780 
this time because I saw that I caught a
flower<00:05:08.080> right<00:05:08.350> off<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.620> bat<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.070> I<00:05:09.190> decided<00:05:09.550> to

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
flower right off the bat so I decided to

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.910 
flower right off the bat so I decided to
take<00:05:10.000> advantage<00:05:10.480> of<00:05:10.570> that<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:10.960> put<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.560> on<00:05:11.740> the

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
take advantage of that and put it on the

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.020 
take advantage of that and put it on the
finger<00:05:12.100> that<00:05:12.370> did<00:05:12.520> not<00:05:12.610> have<00:05:12.850> a<00:05:12.880> flower<00:05:13.150> and

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
finger that did not have a flower and

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.370 
finger that did not have a flower and
here's<00:05:16.030> how<00:05:16.210> my<00:05:16.390> nails<00:05:16.570> look<00:05:16.780> after<00:05:17.170> the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
here's how my nails look after the

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.929 
here's how my nails look after the
second<00:05:17.740> coat<00:05:17.920> of<00:05:18.130> nail<00:05:18.280> polish

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.489 

so<00:05:24.939> after<00:05:25.330> examining<00:05:25.870> it<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:25.990> little<00:05:26.319> bit

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:26.499 
so after examining it a little bit

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:28.649 
so after examining it a little bit
closely<00:05:26.889> I<00:05:26.919> noticed<00:05:27.460> that<00:05:27.729> my<00:05:27.999> middle<00:05:28.270> finger

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
closely I noticed that my middle finger

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:30.899 
closely I noticed that my middle finger
and<00:05:28.870> pinky<00:05:29.229> finger<00:05:29.530> did<00:05:30.009> not<00:05:30.189> have<00:05:30.400> as<00:05:30.610> many

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
and pinky finger did not have as many

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.390 
and pinky finger did not have as many
speckles<00:05:31.479> as<00:05:31.689> my<00:05:32.020> other<00:05:32.289> two<00:05:32.620> fingers<00:05:32.800> so<00:05:33.370> I

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
speckles as my other two fingers so I

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.040 
speckles as my other two fingers so I
went<00:05:33.639> back<00:05:33.789> and<00:05:34.060> added<00:05:34.419> just<00:05:34.569> a<00:05:34.689> little<00:05:34.930> bit

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
went back and added just a little bit

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.929 
went back and added just a little bit
more<00:05:35.259> so<00:05:35.650> that<00:05:35.680> it<00:05:35.949> could<00:05:36.099> have<00:05:36.279> the<00:05:36.580> same

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:36.939 
more so that it could have the same

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:49.499 
more so that it could have the same
speckled<00:05:37.749> miss<00:05:37.990> as<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.409> rest<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.710> my<00:05:38.830> nails<00:05:48.509> so

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
speckled miss as the rest of my nails so

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.239 
speckled miss as the rest of my nails so
here<00:05:49.840> are<00:05:49.960> my<00:05:49.990> nails<00:05:50.319> next<00:05:50.620> to<00:05:50.949> their

asked<00:05:54.939> for<00:05:55.210> my<00:05:55.330> final<00:05:55.659> thoughts<00:05:55.900> on<00:05:56.110> these<00:05:56.259> two

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
polish is that it reminds me a lot of

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.179 
polish is that it reminds me a lot of
cherry<00:06:13.330> blossoms<00:06:13.840> blooming<00:06:14.319> or<00:06:14.560> blowing<00:06:15.009> in

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:15.189 
cherry blossoms blooming or blowing in

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.179 
cherry blossoms blooming or blowing in
the<00:06:15.430> wind<00:06:15.629> the<00:06:16.629> only<00:06:17.050> opportunity<00:06:17.770> that<00:06:18.009> comes

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:18.189 
the wind the only opportunity that comes

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.339 
the wind the only opportunity that comes
to<00:06:18.430> mind<00:06:18.639> for<00:06:18.879> me<00:06:19.060> about<00:06:19.389> this<00:06:19.599> nail<00:06:19.839> polish<00:06:20.050> is

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
to mind for me about this nail polish is

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.860 
to mind for me about this nail polish is
that<00:06:20.979> the<00:06:21.129> flowers<00:06:21.520> can<00:06:21.819> be<00:06:22.060> a<00:06:22.089> little<00:06:22.389> tricky

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
that the flowers can be a little tricky

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.719 
that the flowers can be a little tricky
they<00:06:23.319> don't<00:06:23.529> always<00:06:23.740> come<00:06:23.949> out<00:06:24.219> when<00:06:24.430> you<00:06:24.550> need

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
they don't always come out when you need

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.309 
they don't always come out when you need
them<00:06:24.849> so<00:06:25.120> it<00:06:25.180> does<00:06:25.389> take<00:06:25.659> a<00:06:25.689> little<00:06:26.020> bit<00:06:26.139> of

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
them so it does take a little bit of

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.709 
them so it does take a little bit of
patience<00:06:26.800> when<00:06:27.219> using<00:06:27.460> this<00:06:27.669> nail<00:06:27.879> polish<00:06:28.089> but

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
patience when using this nail polish but

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:30.570 
patience when using this nail polish but
I<00:06:28.990> must<00:06:29.199> say<00:06:29.349> that<00:06:29.379> if<00:06:29.710> you<00:06:29.860> have<00:06:30.069> the<00:06:30.219> patience

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
I must say that if you have the patience

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.860 
I must say that if you have the patience
to<00:06:30.729> try<00:06:30.909> it<00:06:30.969> that<00:06:31.449> it's<00:06:31.599> definitely

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
to try it that it's definitely

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.850 
to try it that it's definitely
worthwhile<00:06:33.719> so<00:06:34.719> that<00:06:34.990> actually<00:06:35.319> takes<00:06:35.529> us<00:06:35.680> to

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
worthwhile so that actually takes us to

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.589 
worthwhile so that actually takes us to
the<00:06:35.949> end<00:06:36.129> of<00:06:36.279> my<00:06:36.490> review<00:06:36.909> I<00:06:37.060> hope<00:06:37.270> you<00:06:37.449> guys
