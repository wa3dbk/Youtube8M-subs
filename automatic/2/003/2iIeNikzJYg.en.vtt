a<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:21.150> couple<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> features<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.259> take<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
a a couple of the features we can take a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.770 
a a couple of the features we can take a
look<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> laminate<00:01:23.580> knee<00:01:23.729> pads<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
look at is the laminate knee pads on the

look at is the laminate knee pads on the
synchro<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.470> well<00:01:26.130> as<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.549> side<00:01:26.820> leg<00:01:27.320> pocket

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
synchro as well as the side leg pocket

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.050 
synchro as well as the side leg pocket
for<00:01:29.189> your<00:01:29.220> key<00:01:30.320> if<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.439> look<00:01:31.619> at<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.060> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
for your key if you look at the the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.899 
for your key if you look at the the
wrist<00:01:33.360> seals<00:01:33.780> there's<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.680> double<00:01:35.159> stitch<00:01:35.520> loop

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
wrist seals there's a double stitch loop

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.289 
wrist seals there's a double stitch loop
here<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.560> allows<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.270> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
here and what that allows for is you to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.069 
here and what that allows for is you to
be<00:01:39.540> able<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.840> keep<00:01:40.799> stretching<00:01:41.509> at<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.840> wrist

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
be able to keep stretching at the wrist

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.130 
be able to keep stretching at the wrist
without<00:01:44.210> actually<00:01:45.210> over<00:01:45.630> stretching<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
without actually over stretching the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.710 
without actually over stretching the
wrist<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.710> double<00:01:47.399> extra<00:01:47.729> loop<00:01:47.909> that's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
wrist so this double extra loop that's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.840 
wrist so this double extra loop that's
actually<00:01:48.930> been<00:01:49.259> stitched<00:01:49.670> prevents<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.820> from

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
actually been stitched prevents you from

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.010 
actually been stitched prevents you from
blowing<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.869> seals<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.810> always

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
blowing out the seals so that it always

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.429 
blowing out the seals so that it always
comes<00:01:55.350> back<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.619> its<00:01:56.100> original<00:01:56.219> shape<00:01:57.320> if<00:01:58.320> we

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
comes back to its original shape if we

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.929 
comes back to its original shape if we
take<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> look<00:01:58.829> at<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> back<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> website

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
take a look at the back of the website

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.069 
take a look at the back of the website
the<00:02:00.869> thing<00:02:01.079> goes<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> back<00:02:01.920> zip<00:02:02.869> we'll<00:02:03.869> take<00:02:04.049> a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the thing goes a back zip we'll take a
