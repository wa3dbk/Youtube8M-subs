00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.360 

okay<00:00:01.290> in<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:01.620> video<00:00:01.890> we're<00:00:02.070> going<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.220> do

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
okay in this video we're going to do

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.130 
okay in this video we're going to do
another<00:00:02.580> example<00:00:03.270> related<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.840> law<00:00:04.020> of

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
another example related to the law of

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.440 
another example related to the law of
cosines<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.980> what<00:00:05.790> we<00:00:05.879> want<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.060> do<00:00:06.180> here<00:00:06.390> is

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
cosines and what we want to do here is

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.030 
cosines and what we want to do here is
just<00:00:06.720> find<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.109> measure<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.890> smallest

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
just find the measure of the smallest

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.629 
just find the measure of the smallest
angle<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:09.059> our<00:00:09.150> given<00:00:09.599> triangle<00:00:09.929> here<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.639> we

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
angle in our given triangle here so we

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.870 
angle in our given triangle here so we
have<00:00:11.759> side<00:00:12.059> lengths<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.599> four<00:00:12.900> six<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.530> nine

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
have side lengths of four six and nine

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.570 
have side lengths of four six and nine
the<00:00:14.880> first<00:00:15.330> observation<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.980> smallest

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
the first observation is the smallest

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.939 
the first observation is the smallest
angle<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> be<00:00:18.720> opposite<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.650> side

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
angle is going to be opposite the side

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.099 
angle is going to be opposite the side
of<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.640> triangle<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.180> has<00:00:21.270> shortest<00:00:21.869> length

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
of the triangle that has shortest length

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.470 
of the triangle that has shortest length
so<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.279> side<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:23.670> shortest<00:00:24.060> length<00:00:24.269> would

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
so the side with shortest length would

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.140 
so the side with shortest length would
be<00:00:24.539> our<00:00:24.990> side<00:00:25.289> here<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.890> B<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.400> has<00:00:26.550> length<00:00:26.820> 4

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
be our side here a B that has length 4

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.300 
be our side here a B that has length 4
so<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.109> means<00:00:28.590> again<00:00:28.890> we're<00:00:29.039> trying<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
so that means again we're trying to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.569 
so that means again we're trying to
figure<00:00:29.519> out<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> angle<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
figure out the angle here the the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.260 
figure out the angle here the the
measure<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.300> angle<00:00:33.690> C<00:00:34.550> well<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.880> use<00:00:35.910> law

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
measure for angle C well we can use law

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.670 
measure for angle C well we can use law
of<00:00:36.420> cosines<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.290> 4<00:00:38.219> squared<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.180> would<00:00:39.360> equal

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
of cosines so 4 squared that would equal

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.750 
of cosines so 4 squared that would equal
9<00:00:40.680> squared<00:00:41.190> plus<00:00:41.940> 6<00:00:42.660> squared<00:00:43.370> minus<00:00:44.370> 2<00:00:44.730> times

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
9 squared plus 6 squared minus 2 times

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.220 
9 squared plus 6 squared minus 2 times
well<00:00:45.629> 9<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.860> 6<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:48.629> then<00:00:48.809> that's<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
well 9 and 6 and then that's going to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.529 
well 9 and 6 and then that's going to
help<00:00:49.379> us<00:00:49.590> bring<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.460> our<00:00:50.610> cosine<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.510> angle

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
help us bring in our cosine of the angle

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.340 
help us bring in our cosine of the angle
C<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:53.309> now<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.670> little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.000> arithmetic

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
C so now just a little bit of arithmetic

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.650 
C so now just a little bit of arithmetic
4<00:00:55.350> squared<00:00:55.620> 16<00:00:55.940> 9<00:00:56.940> squared<00:00:57.329> -<00:00:57.510> 81<00:00:58.340> 81<00:00:59.340> plus<00:00:59.820> 36

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
4 squared 16 9 squared - 81 81 plus 36

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.880 
4 squared 16 9 squared - 81 81 plus 36
is<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> give<00:01:01.260> us<00:01:01.410> 117<00:01:02.780> 2<00:01:03.780> times<00:01:04.170> 9<00:01:04.470> times

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
is going to give us 117 2 times 9 times

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.350 
is going to give us 117 2 times 9 times
6<00:01:05.549> let's<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.020> 9<00:01:07.920> times<00:01:08.159> 6<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.549> 54<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:09.270> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
6 let's see so 9 times 6 is 54 if you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.440 
6 let's see so 9 times 6 is 54 if you
double<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.869> you'll<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.229> 108<00:01:11.150> which<00:01:12.150> will<00:01:12.330> be

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
double that you'll get 108 which will be

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
double that you'll get 108 which will be
cosine<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.990> C

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
cosine of C

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.400 
cosine of C
we<00:01:15.040> can<00:01:15.220> subtract<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.820> 117<00:01:16.600> from<00:01:16.870> both<00:01:17.110> sides

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
we can subtract the 117 from both sides

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.170 
we can subtract the 117 from both sides
that's<00:01:17.920> going<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.250> leave<00:01:18.430> us<00:01:18.460> with<00:01:18.610> negative

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
that's going to leave us with negative

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.350 
that's going to leave us with negative
what<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.660> one<00:01:20.020> on<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.290> Left<00:01:21.150> equals<00:01:22.150> negative

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
what a one on the Left equals negative

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.480 
what a one on the Left equals negative
108<00:01:23.790> times<00:01:24.790> cosine<00:01:25.420> of<00:01:25.450> C<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:26.830> can<00:01:26.980> divide<00:01:27.250> both

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
108 times cosine of C we can divide both

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.200 
108 times cosine of C we can divide both
sides<00:01:27.850> by<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.380> negative<00:01:29.380> 108<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:30.970> that<00:01:31.120> will

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
sides by the negative 108 so that will

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.140 
sides by the negative 108 so that will
just<00:01:31.360> leave<00:01:31.510> us<00:01:31.540> with<00:01:31.780> positive<00:01:32.530> 101<00:01:33.100> over<00:01:33.640> 108

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
just leave us with positive 101 over 108

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.380 
just leave us with positive 101 over 108
equals<00:01:35.080> cosine<00:01:35.680> of<00:01:36.070> C<00:01:38.760> squeeze<00:01:39.760> this<00:01:39.940> in<00:01:40.150> here

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
equals cosine of C squeeze this in here

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.440 
equals cosine of C squeeze this in here
101<00:01:41.380> over<00:01:41.560> 108<00:01:42.220> I'm<00:01:42.670> getting<00:01:43.120> that<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.360> be

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
101 over 108 I'm getting that to be

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.650 
101 over 108 I'm getting that to be
point<00:01:43.780> nine<00:01:44.200> three<00:01:44.620> five<00:01:46.470> equals<00:01:47.470> cosine<00:01:48.160> of<00:01:48.220> C

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
point nine three five equals cosine of C

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.090 
point nine three five equals cosine of C
and<00:01:49.660> now<00:01:49.870> if<00:01:50.110> we<00:01:50.140> just<00:01:50.380> take<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.770> inverse

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
and now if we just take the inverse

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.859 
and now if we just take the inverse
cosine<00:01:51.400> of<00:01:51.700> both<00:01:51.880> sides

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.399 

that's<00:01:57.469> going<00:01:57.619> to<00:01:57.710> give<00:01:57.859> us<00:01:57.950> our<00:01:58.070> Anglesey<00:01:58.759> and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
that's going to give us our Anglesey and

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.289 
that's going to give us our Anglesey and
let's<00:02:00.409> see<00:02:00.590> here<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.070> think<00:02:01.399> this<00:02:01.670> should<00:02:02.060> be

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
let's see here I think this should be

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.240 
let's see here I think this should be
let<00:02:02.600> me<00:02:02.630> double<00:02:03.140> check<00:02:03.170> one<00:02:03.590> more<00:02:03.740> time<00:02:03.920> so

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
let me double check one more time so

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.410 
let me double check one more time so
point<00:02:04.810> 935<00:02:05.859> if<00:02:06.859> we<00:02:06.979> do<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.250> inverse<00:02:07.789> cosine<00:02:08.090> of

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
point 935 if we do the inverse cosine of

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.020 
point 935 if we do the inverse cosine of
that<00:02:08.780> I'm<00:02:09.440> getting<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.129> be<00:02:10.250> twenty<00:02:10.670> point

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
that I'm getting this to be twenty point

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.470 
that I'm getting this to be twenty point
seven<00:02:11.780> seven<00:02:12.110> degrees<00:02:13.040> after<00:02:13.849> rounding<00:02:14.299> here

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
seven seven degrees after rounding here

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.869 
seven seven degrees after rounding here
a<00:02:14.510> little<00:02:14.690> bit<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.280> that's<00:02:16.280> all<00:02:16.430> there<00:02:16.549> is<00:02:16.640> to

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
a little bit so that's all there is to

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.400 
a little bit so that's all there is to
it<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:19.090> again<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.540> know<00:02:20.660> we<00:02:20.810> need<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.140> four

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
it and again you know we need the four

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.199 
it and again you know we need the four
isolated<00:02:22.250> at<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.400> beginning<00:02:22.790> on<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:22.970> left

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
isolated at the beginning on the left

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.550 
isolated at the beginning on the left
side<00:02:23.420> again<00:02:23.629> because<00:02:24.019> that's<00:02:24.230> what's<00:02:24.440> going

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
side again because that's what's going

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.280 
side again because that's what's going
to<00:02:24.590> give<00:02:24.799> us<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.280> cosine<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:26.150> this<00:02:26.450> angle<00:02:26.510> that

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
to give us the cosine of this angle that

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.740 
to give us the cosine of this angle that
we<00:02:27.470> want<00:02:27.739> here<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.150> nothing<00:02:29.150> worse<00:02:29.299> than<00:02:29.510> that

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
we want here so nothing worse than that

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.009 
we want here so nothing worse than that
just<00:02:30.410> again<00:02:30.739> just<00:02:31.750> noticing<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.870> the

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
just again just noticing that the

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.960 
just again just noticing that the
smallest<00:02:33.349> angle<00:02:33.920> will<00:02:34.069> be<00:02:34.220> opposite<00:02:34.730> that

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
smallest angle will be opposite that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.690 
smallest angle will be opposite that
side<00:02:35.299> of<00:02:35.450> length<00:02:35.660> four<00:02:35.989> using<00:02:36.920> law<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.220> cosines

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
side of length four using law of cosines

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.250 
side of length four using law of cosines
just<00:02:38.209> being<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.450> little<00:02:38.660> careful<00:02:38.810> with<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
just being a little careful with the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.989 
just being a little careful with the
arithmetic<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.269> that's<00:02:41.269> all<00:02:41.420> there<00:02:41.569> is<00:02:41.599> to<00:02:41.870> it
