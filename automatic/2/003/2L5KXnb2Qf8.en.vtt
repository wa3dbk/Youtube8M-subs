00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
in HTML is used to format content but it

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
goes above and beyond the basic

goes above and beyond the basic
formatting<00:00:21.000> we've<00:00:21.210> done<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:22.410> elements

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
formatting we've done here with elements

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.540 
formatting we've done here with elements
such<00:00:23.580> as<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.880> heading<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:25.380> block<00:00:25.619> quote<00:00:25.890> a

simple bold or an underline those are
easy<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.550> accomplish<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> HTML<00:00:31.019> tag

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260

easy to accomplish with the HTML tag
we've<00:00:31.500> already<00:00:31.679> learned<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.940> span<00:00:33.300> tag

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
we've already learned but a span tag

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.979 
we've already learned but a span tag
allows<00:00:34.980> us<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.370> create<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.640> style<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.480> content

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
allows us to create a style for content

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.750 
allows us to create a style for content
and<00:00:37.079> there's<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> lot<00:00:37.920> more<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.489> when<00:00:38.670> we

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and there's a lot more we can do when we

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.479 
and there's a lot more we can do when we
create<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> style<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.260> let's<00:00:40.290> do<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.340> in

and<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.550> can<00:02:20.730> do<00:02:20.910> one<00:02:21.180> style<00:02:21.540> after<00:02:21.900> another

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
and so we can do one style after another

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.880 
and so we can do one style after another
here<00:02:22.860> inside<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.820> this<00:02:24.030> opening<00:02:24.510> tag<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.500> after

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
here inside of this opening tag so after

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.830 
here inside of this opening tag so after
the<00:02:26.010> semicolon<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.820> before<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.510> double

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the semicolon and before the double

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.680 
the semicolon and before the double
quotes<00:02:28.110> I'm<00:02:28.770> going<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.010> create<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.280> space<00:02:29.690> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
quotes I'm going to create a space and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.350 
quotes I'm going to create a space and
I'm<00:02:30.840> going<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.290> give<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.980> text<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.700> color<00:02:33.030> so

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
I'm going to give this text a color so

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.690 
I'm going to give this text a color so
I'm<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.660> gonna<00:02:33.780> type<00:02:34.020> in<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.260> word<00:02:34.410> color

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
I'm just gonna type in the word color

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.450 
I'm just gonna type in the word color
the<00:02:35.700> colon<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.300> then<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.200> any<00:02:37.830> color<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.190> wish

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
the colon and then the any color I wish

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.140 
the colon and then the any color I wish
and<00:02:38.670> I'll<00:02:38.760> choose<00:02:39.060> red<00:02:40.880> again<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.910> need<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
and I'll choose red again I need a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.580 
and I'll choose red again I need a
semicolon<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:43.200> finish<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:45.330> style<00:02:45.840> let's

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
semicolon to finish that style let's

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.300 
semicolon to finish that style let's
preview<00:02:48.560> now<00:02:49.560> we<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.890> red<00:02:50.190> 18<00:02:50.460> pixel<00:02:51.090> sized

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
preview now we have red 18 pixel sized

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.000 
preview now we have red 18 pixel sized
font<00:02:54.770> now<00:02:55.770> before<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.780> delete<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.930> out<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
font now before I delete it out the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.210 
font now before I delete it out the
non-breaking<00:02:59.580> spaces<00:03:00.120> we<00:03:00.510> had<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:01.220> line

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
non-breaking spaces we had this line

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.760 
non-breaking spaces we had this line
indented<00:03:03.110> now<00:03:04.110> adding<00:03:04.500> all<00:03:04.620> those

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
indented now adding all those

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.060 
indented now adding all those
non-breaking<00:03:05.370> spaces<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:06.000> quite<00:03:06.270> tedious<00:03:07.070> but

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
non-breaking spaces is quite tedious but

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
non-breaking spaces is quite tedious but
if<00:03:08.190> we<00:03:08.310> use<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.490> span<00:03:08.970> tag<00:03:09.170> then<00:03:10.170> we<00:03:10.410> can<00:03:10.620> easily

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
if we use a span tag then we can easily

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.680 
if we use a span tag then we can easily
bump<00:03:12.090> over<00:03:12.360> or<00:03:13.200> tab<00:03:13.530> over<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:14.220> line<00:03:14.910> of<00:03:15.120> content

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
bump over or tab over a line of content

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.680 
bump over or tab over a line of content
or<00:03:16.530> even<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.950> section<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.460> content<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.570> way

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
or even a section of content and the way

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.450 
or even a section of content and the way
we<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.080> is<00:03:19.140> with<00:03:19.380> either<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.680> margin<00:03:20.280> or<00:03:20.400> a

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
we do that is with either a margin or a

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.520 
we do that is with either a margin or a
padding<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.840> I'm<00:03:21.960> going<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.320> create

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
padding and so I'm going to create

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.790 
padding and so I'm going to create
another<00:03:22.590> style<00:03:23.250> which<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> margin<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.840> I

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
another style which is a margin and I

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.530 
another style which is a margin and I
need<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.130> type<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.580> word<00:03:26.670> margin<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.450> I

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
need to type in the word margin and I

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.540 
need to type in the word margin and I
want<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.990> be<00:03:28.110> on<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.290> left<00:03:28.590> side<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.400> the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
want that to be on the left side of the

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.880 
want that to be on the left side of the
content<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.360> add<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.630> dash<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.650> then<00:03:31.800> the

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
content so I add a dash and then the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.200 
content so I add a dash and then the
word<00:03:32.070> left<00:03:32.460> a<00:03:33.230> colon<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.440> then<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.920> space<00:03:35.850> is

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
word left a colon and then the space is

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.050 
word left a colon and then the space is
defined<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:37.140> pixels<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.580> let's<00:03:38.850> just<00:03:39.120> do<00:03:39.360> 25

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
defined with pixels so let's just do 25

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.560 
defined with pixels so let's just do 25
px<00:03:42.060> for<00:03:42.270> pixels<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:43.760> semicolon<00:03:44.760> again<00:03:45.270> to

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
px for pixels a semicolon again to

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.930 
px for pixels a semicolon again to
complete<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.350> style<00:03:46.740> and<00:03:47.670> then<00:03:47.820> we'll

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
complete that style and then we'll

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.310 
complete that style and then we'll
preview<00:03:48.620> now<00:03:49.620> we<00:03:49.680> can<00:03:49.950> see<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.340> our<00:03:51.080> text<00:03:52.080> has

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
preview now we can see that our text has

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.830 
preview now we can see that our text has
been<00:03:52.350> bumped<00:03:52.890> over<00:03:53.010> by<00:03:53.310> 25<00:03:53.850> pixels<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.690> we

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
been bumped over by 25 pixels and so we

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.100 
been bumped over by 25 pixels and so we
have<00:03:54.990> this<00:03:55.170> nice<00:03:55.470> indentation<00:03:56.130> here<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.110> that

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
have this nice indentation here and that

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.010 
have this nice indentation here and that
was<00:03:58.320> done<00:03:58.560> simply<00:03:59.300> through<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.420> span<00:04:00.720> tag

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
was done simply through the span tag

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.020 
was done simply through the span tag
without<00:04:01.290> having<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:02.010> type<00:04:02.340> in<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.730> bunch<00:04:02.850> of

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
without having to type in a bunch of

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.450 
without having to type in a bunch of
non-breaking<00:04:03.600> spaces<00:04:03.900> in<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.290> code<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.340> I

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
non-breaking spaces in the code and if I

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.030 
non-breaking spaces in the code and if I
wanted<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.790> change<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:06.350> I'm<00:04:07.350> spacing<00:04:07.800> I

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
wanted to change that I'm spacing I

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.520 
wanted to change that I'm spacing I
could<00:04:08.220> simply<00:04:08.490> go<00:04:08.640> in<00:04:08.790> here<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.120> edit<00:04:09.530> the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
could simply go in here and edit the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.100 
could simply go in here and edit the
value<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:12.030> if<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.240> want<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.420> increase<00:04:12.600> it<00:04:12.690> by<00:04:12.900> 10

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
value so if I want to increase it by 10

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.140 
value so if I want to increase it by 10
pixels<00:04:13.530> up<00:04:13.770> push<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.100> even<00:04:14.130> further<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:15.120> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
pixels up push it even further to the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.660 
pixels up push it even further to the
right<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.530> because<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.010> margin<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.489> on

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
right that is because the margin is on

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.190 
right that is because the margin is on
the<00:04:18.120> left<00:04:18.390> of<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:19.500> content<00:04:20.600> we<00:04:21.600> see<00:04:21.810> margin

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
the left of the content we see margin

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.580 
the left of the content we see margin
left<00:04:23.660> let's<00:04:24.660> do<00:04:24.780> one<00:04:24.960> more<00:04:24.990> let's<00:04:25.380> add<00:04:25.560> a

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
left let's do one more let's add a

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.730 
left let's do one more let's add a
background<00:04:25.919> color

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
background color

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.110 
background color

color : and this will be in a bit of
code<00:04:39.490> here<00:04:47.009> and<00:04:48.009> that<00:04:48.610> is<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.880> hexadecimal

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
code here and that is the hexadecimal

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.580 
code here and that is the hexadecimal
code<00:04:49.810> for<00:04:50.349> yellow<00:04:50.919> so<00:04:51.520> we<00:04:51.819> will<00:04:52.060> preview<00:04:52.590> and

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
code for yellow so we will preview and

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.879 
code for yellow so we will preview and
now<00:04:53.770> we<00:04:53.830> see<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.220> yellow<00:04:54.669> highlight<00:04:55.090> behind<00:04:55.889> the

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
now we see a yellow highlight behind the

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.770 
now we see a yellow highlight behind the
text<00:04:57.280> or<00:04:57.400> yellow<00:04:57.669> background<00:04:57.940> behind<00:04:58.419> the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
text or yellow background behind the

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.850 
text or yellow background behind the
text<00:05:00.270> now<00:05:01.270> I<00:05:01.300> don't<00:05:01.449> know<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:02.139> hexadecimal

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
text now I don't know the hexadecimal

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.909 
text now I don't know the hexadecimal
codes<00:05:03.550> for<00:05:03.940> colors<00:05:04.330> off<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.229> top<00:05:05.409> of<00:05:05.440> my<00:05:05.590> head

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
codes for colors off the top of my head

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.059 
codes for colors off the top of my head
I<00:05:06.159> had<00:05:06.669> this<00:05:06.819> one<00:05:07.030> picked<00:05:07.240> out<00:05:07.360> already

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
I had this one picked out already

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.399 
I had this one picked out already
but<00:05:09.069> you<00:05:09.190> can<00:05:09.400> get<00:05:09.580> these<00:05:09.789> codes<00:05:10.210> from<00:05:10.630> a<00:05:10.930> lot

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
but you can get these codes from a lot

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.469 
but you can get these codes from a lot
of<00:05:11.440> different<00:05:11.800> resources<00:05:12.310> online<00:05:12.699> or<00:05:13.270> from

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
of different resources online or from

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.110 
of different resources online or from
Photoshop<00:05:14.080> if<00:05:14.259> you<00:05:14.349> use<00:05:14.470> Photoshop<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.669> so<00:05:16.090> I

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
Photoshop if you use Photoshop and so I

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.399 
Photoshop if you use Photoshop and so I
just<00:05:16.240> want<00:05:16.419> to<00:05:16.449> let<00:05:16.569> you<00:05:16.690> know<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:16.840> I<00:05:17.020> didn't

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
just want to let you know that I didn't

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.339 
just want to let you know that I didn't
just<00:05:17.680> pull<00:05:18.340> that<00:05:18.370> out<00:05:18.669> of<00:05:18.699> nowhere<00:05:18.849> I<00:05:19.360> don't

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
just pull that out of nowhere I don't

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.390 
just pull that out of nowhere I don't
really<00:05:20.650> know<00:05:20.860> my<00:05:21.009> colors<00:05:21.340> like<00:05:21.520> that<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:23.400> the

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
really know my colors like that so the

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.300 
really know my colors like that so the
point<00:05:24.669> of<00:05:24.849> this<00:05:25.210> being<00:05:25.569> that<00:05:26.020> we<00:05:26.319> can<00:05:26.680> do<00:05:26.979> a<00:05:27.009> lot

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
point of this being that we can do a lot

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.930 
point of this being that we can do a lot
with<00:05:27.370> the<00:05:27.970> style<00:05:28.479> of<00:05:28.750> our<00:05:28.870> content<00:05:29.500> by<00:05:29.740> using<00:05:30.729> a

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
with the style of our content by using a

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.140 
with the style of our content by using a
spin<00:05:31.389> tag<00:05:32.020> in<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:33.310> content<00:05:33.789> of<00:05:34.000> our<00:05:34.300> page<00:05:34.690> now

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
spin tag in the content of our page now

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.270 
spin tag in the content of our page now
when<00:05:37.150> we<00:05:37.240> get<00:05:37.330> into<00:05:37.479> CSS<00:05:38.020> we<00:05:38.320> will<00:05:38.500> see<00:05:38.770> where

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
when we get into CSS we will see where

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.120 
when we get into CSS we will see where
CSS<00:05:39.880> really<00:05:40.330> is<00:05:40.449> helpful<00:05:40.830> basically<00:05:41.830> what<00:05:41.979> it

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
CSS really is helpful basically what it

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.540 
CSS really is helpful basically what it
does<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.490> it<00:05:42.639> takes<00:05:42.880> all<00:05:43.240> of<00:05:43.270> this<00:05:43.770> out<00:05:44.770> of<00:05:45.310> the

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
does is it takes all of this out of the

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.430 
does is it takes all of this out of the
content<00:05:46.060> of<00:05:46.150> your<00:05:46.180> page<00:05:46.570> and<00:05:46.870> puts<00:05:47.110> it<00:05:47.229> in<00:05:47.320> a

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
content of your page and puts it in a

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.790 
content of your page and puts it in a
different<00:05:47.740> document<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:49.630> it<00:05:49.780> uses<00:05:50.139> divs<00:05:50.469> to

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
different document and it uses divs to

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.439 
different document and it uses divs to
do<00:05:50.919> that<00:05:51.130> and<00:05:51.370> we<00:05:51.490> just<00:05:51.699> talked<00:05:51.909> about<00:05:52.000> divs

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
do that and we just talked about divs

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.390 
do that and we just talked about divs
and<00:05:52.719> so<00:05:53.349> we'll<00:05:53.530> see<00:05:53.680> how<00:05:53.830> all<00:05:53.949> this<00:05:54.070> kind<00:05:54.340> of

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
and so we'll see how all this kind of

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.010 
and so we'll see how all this kind of
comes<00:05:54.639> in<00:05:54.820> together<00:05:54.969> you<00:05:55.210> can<00:05:55.479> imagine<00:05:55.719> that

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
comes in together you can imagine that

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.760 
comes in together you can imagine that
if<00:05:56.319> you<00:05:56.740> were<00:05:56.770> coding<00:05:57.729> a<00:05:58.050> lot<00:05:59.050> of<00:05:59.229> content<00:05:59.650> on<00:05:59.710> a

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
if you were coding a lot of content on a

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.790 
if you were coding a lot of content on a
page<00:06:00.069> and<00:06:00.400> you<00:06:00.490> wanted<00:06:00.819> to<00:06:01.680> format<00:06:02.680> the

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
page and you wanted to format the

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.649 
page and you wanted to format the
content<00:06:03.250> different<00:06:03.520> ways<00:06:03.669> that<00:06:04.060> all<00:06:04.360> of<00:06:04.569> this

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
content different ways that all of this

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.990 
content different ways that all of this
HTML<00:06:05.199> all<00:06:05.620> over<00:06:05.889> the<00:06:05.979> place<00:06:06.190> would<00:06:06.460> really<00:06:06.729> get

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
HTML all over the place would really get

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.300 
HTML all over the place would really get
busy<00:06:07.389> it<00:06:08.169> would<00:06:08.319> get<00:06:08.409> messy<00:06:08.680> it<00:06:09.069> would<00:06:09.190> get

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
busy it would get messy it would get

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.209 
busy it would get messy it would get
hard<00:06:09.580> to<00:06:09.639> read<00:06:10.000> and<00:06:10.300> you<00:06:11.169> would<00:06:11.289> have<00:06:11.469> to<00:06:11.590> spend

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:12.219 
hard to read and you would have to spend

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:15.029 
hard to read and you would have to spend
a<00:06:12.310> lot<00:06:12.430> of<00:06:12.460> time<00:06:12.789> typing<00:06:13.300> all<00:06:13.419> of<00:06:13.539> that<00:06:13.690> in<00:06:14.039> each

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
a lot of time typing all of that in each

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.320 
a lot of time typing all of that in each
time<00:06:15.460> so<00:06:15.880> we'll<00:06:16.060> see<00:06:16.330> in<00:06:16.659> the<00:06:17.669> lessons<00:06:18.669> on<00:06:18.789> CSS

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
time so we'll see in the lessons on CSS

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.860 
time so we'll see in the lessons on CSS
how<00:06:20.110> CSS<00:06:20.440> really<00:06:21.039> makes<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:21.430> easy<00:06:21.669> to<00:06:22.030> create

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
how CSS really makes it easy to create

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.100 
how CSS really makes it easy to create
styles<00:06:23.560> for<00:06:23.949> your<00:06:24.130> content<00:06:24.750> and<00:06:25.750> for<00:06:26.020> your

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
styles for your content and for your

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.950 
styles for your content and for your
website<00:06:26.469> in<00:06:26.560> general<00:06:26.590> using<00:06:27.539> this<00:06:28.539> same<00:06:28.810> kind

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
website in general using this same kind

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.260 
website in general using this same kind
of<00:06:29.080> principle<00:06:29.310> but<00:06:30.310> just<00:06:30.550> applied<00:06:30.909> in<00:06:31.180> a

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
of principle but just applied in a

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.510 
of principle but just applied in a
better<00:06:31.539> way<00:06:31.900> and<00:06:32.280> so<00:06:33.360> if<00:06:34.360> you<00:06:35.010> want<00:06:36.010> to<00:06:36.130> simply

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
better way and so if you want to simply

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.600 
better way and so if you want to simply
style<00:06:37.449> just<00:06:37.599> a<00:06:37.750> bit<00:06:37.930> of<00:06:38.050> your<00:06:38.169> text<00:06:38.650> a<00:06:38.830> bit<00:06:38.889> of

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
style just a bit of your text a bit of

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.320 
style just a bit of your text a bit of
your<00:06:39.729> content

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
your content

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.020 
your content
in<00:06:40.509> your<00:06:41.080> website<00:06:41.530> than<00:06:41.889> the<00:06:42.099> span<00:06:42.430> tag<00:06:42.729> like

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
in your website than the span tag like

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.570 
in your website than the span tag like
this<00:06:43.060> is<00:06:43.770> pretty<00:06:44.770> easy<00:06:45.009> to<00:06:45.220> do

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
this is pretty easy to do

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.339 
this is pretty easy to do
and<00:06:45.879> it's<00:06:46.150> certainly<00:06:46.449> an<00:06:46.569> option<00:06:46.750> and<00:06:47.110> if<00:06:47.199> you

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:47.349 
and it's certainly an option and if you

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:50.879 
and it's certainly an option and if you
want<00:06:47.590> to<00:06:47.710> know<00:06:49.050> what<00:06:50.050> it<00:06:50.139> what's<00:06:50.440> the<00:06:50.620> syntax

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
want to know what it what's the syntax
