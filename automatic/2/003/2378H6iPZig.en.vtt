00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
instruction manual as well very nice

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.920 
instruction manual as well very nice
that<00:02:23.140> they<00:02:23.230> include<00:02:23.409> all<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.129> that<00:02:24.599> we<00:02:25.599> move

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
that they include all of that we move

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.700 
that they include all of that we move
all<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.440> stuff<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.920> side

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
all this stuff to the side

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.960 
all this stuff to the side
and<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.040> will<00:02:28.220> go<00:02:28.430> over<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:30.350> unit<00:02:30.850> all<00:02:31.850> right

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
and we will go over the unit all right

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.940 
and we will go over the unit all right
so<00:02:32.120> let's<00:02:32.240> go<00:02:32.420> over<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.720> actual<00:02:32.960> functions<00:02:33.710> on

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
so let's go over the actual functions on

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.910 
so let's go over the actual functions on
the<00:02:34.490> external<00:02:34.850> battery<00:02:35.360> pack<00:02:35.390> itself<00:02:36.050> give

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
the external battery pack itself give

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
of the video I've got my charge key here

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.290 
of the video I've got my charge key here
now<00:03:43.220> put<00:03:43.490> that<00:03:43.520> alike<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:44.600> i<00:03:45.730> throw<00:03:46.730> my<00:03:46.760> affan

now put that alike so i throw my affan
in<00:03:47.450> here<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.650> should<00:03:51.920> start<00:03:52.280> charging<00:03:52.520> a

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
in here and that should start charging a

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.640 
in here and that should start charging a
boom<00:03:54.310> pretty<00:03:55.310> sweet<00:03:55.960> so<00:03:56.960> it<00:03:57.140> definitely<00:03:57.320> does
