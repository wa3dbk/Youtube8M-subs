00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.370
 good friends here commenting wirless 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.679
 I hope everything goes well there and 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.530
 this is a video that I'm going to make 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:16.290
 to download the mein herr editor of 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.290
 good maps are going to go to the 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.900
 to the link that I will leave in the description 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.900
 OK 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.570
 they will be downloading this mac file 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:34.739
 edit 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 0.1 1.6 win32 vouchers good to climb 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.720
 where they wait I do not know how long it will take 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:47.570
 hour it took more or less and when it opens them 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.570
 they're going to come out this does not open it 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.450
 they expect it to load in sight and it's going to 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.710
 leave this they are going to open the german max 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.840
 edith point excel good and so that 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.879
 let's know, order the chrono 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.570
 sometimes takes less series is that 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.220
 it takes longer and well then 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.540
 now it 's taking a long time 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.540
 but there's nothing to see 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.409
 It's worth for you to sell us that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.140
 this is a mistake 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.920
 I wait for a while that this feels all 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.920
 OK 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.560
 this one opened in mac ed and good now 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.320
 if you think that the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.390
 good computer years passes open the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.580
 start and will not be locked because it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.480
 I spend a lot of this 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:49.340
 and he will be elected 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.340
 this this and this is worth 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.600
 here is so good if you want you can create 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.319
 a new world acting in the world that 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.110
 they were or open a level a level of 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:07.650
 his alex 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.650
 in this video I do not know if I will be able to 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.140
 I will be able to start from the world 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.380
 while being able to 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.920
 use global because I do not think I'm 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.920
 let record 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.629
 Well, I do not think he'll let me record 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.909
 globalia little I think that counts as not 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.060
 Okay , I did not get stuck, I'm not going to 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.060
 open 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.430
 this tells you to program some mod 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.630
 and now this open and it's worth we're already 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.800
 here in it 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.880
 in the how to say 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.980
 good in the world is worth those accountants 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.980
 what they see are the payments are not worth 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.480
 so they can see how we make chains 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:07.230
 we can move the area of 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.230
 respawn can not be followed in network 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.090
 must be born when they die there 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.330
 have it there this where you want 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.060
 mother 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.200
 with this you can move the player 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.739
 pleasure this stamp is worth 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.400
 That's why rigby is me 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.400
 blazer 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.650
 that's me 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.540
 we see what we can see the pleasure where 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.870
 they want it to appear can not be done 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.870
 to appear in the rest person 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.870
 damned 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.349
 you can do several things like that is 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.030
 do not let's go a little bit and I'll go 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.980
 there 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.980
 I'm going to select all these 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.590
 to select all those blocks and 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.390
 pay delight blogs 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.790
 and charge a little while worth 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:07.250
 load went all the blocks going 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:09.950
 from that area and can arrive here not here 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.660
 here and they can fill it with what 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.660
 want in this case would fill d 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.700
 green wool vale 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.290
 they give ok they win field 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.290
 It will take a while to load 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:39.950
 and I would stop that has been dieting 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.890
 as you can see all that part of wool 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.220
 green come there were some trees 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:49.340
 up within this green trowel 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.040
 how do you see everything all of canvas 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.260
 green 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.520
 then you want to be responsible 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.430
 the reds where zombies all of that and 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.980
 we do not 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.520
 the animals 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.819
 the reds where animal animals 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.819
 all right 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.670
 good monsters worth even 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.409
 can do several things paste parts 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.039
 from another world 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:24.729
 it's a control that I do not know what's worth 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.729
 Several things can be done 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.260
 so see a bit how this works 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:37.289
 ya bar filter 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:41.599
 here does not matter the import cancer 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.599
 I think there was control 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:48.720
 What's worth this has been things that 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.260
 if you do not even observe it 's good 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.260
 It has been everything 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.620
 of edith is not worth of the minecraft editor of 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.960
 maps with which you can do several 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.410
 things upload it to download the maps 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.410
 OK 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.160
 Several things can be done with this 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.230
 can create a new very but create everything 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.340
 directly straight , I like to like it 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:20.139
 much to me and well that has been all we 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.659
 we see in the next video 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.819
 I'm going to close this and I met the rest of 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.580
 fans in development 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:29.740
 remember I leave you in the description 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.779

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.779
 download vale 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:45.330
 and that's it, that was all the video we'll see 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:47.300
 in another video worth of minecraft from 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.570
