00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
this also works really well for it's

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
the bridge of the nose would be up here

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.050 
the bridge of the nose would be up here
we're<00:03:40.500> gonna<00:03:40.590> start<00:03:40.920> up<00:03:41.010> high<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.760> then

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060

your nose you're getting photos done

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.520 
your nose you're getting photos done
this<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.090> what<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.300> can<00:04:12.450> do<00:04:12.570> then<00:04:13.320> you're

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
this is what you can do then you're

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.039 
this is what you can do then you're
gonna<00:04:13.650> want<00:04:14.150> where<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.239> shadow<00:04:15.510> would<00:04:15.690> be<00:04:15.870> is

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
gonna want where the shadow would be is

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.990 
gonna want where the shadow would be is
would<00:04:16.230> also<00:04:16.440> be<00:04:16.739> along<00:04:17.190> here<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.730> this<00:04:17.850> would

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
would also be along here so this would

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.130 
would also be along here so this would
just<00:04:18.120> create<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.480> straight<00:04:18.750> line<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.049> then

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
just create a straight line and then

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.170 
just create a straight line and then
this<00:04:19.260> bubbliness<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.160> side<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:21.030> we're

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
this bubbliness on the side so we're

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.270 
this bubbliness on the side so we're
gonna<00:04:21.269> go<00:04:21.510> in<00:04:21.720> where<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.680> nostrils<00:04:23.160> would

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
gonna go in where the nostrils would

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.100 
gonna go in where the nostrils would
curve<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.730> and<00:04:23.940> kind<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.270> curve<00:04:24.480> out<00:04:24.690> and

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
curve in and kind of curve out and

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.560 
curve in and kind of curve out and
create<00:04:25.980> a<00:04:26.010> little<00:04:26.340> bit<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:26.850> triangle<00:04:27.240> kind

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
create a little bit of a triangle kind

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.570 
create a little bit of a triangle kind
of<00:04:27.660> if<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:27.900> was<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.140> triangle<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:28.890> then<00:04:29.370> at

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
of if this was a triangle and then at

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.990 
of if this was a triangle and then at
this

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
this

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.580 
this
part<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.510> we're<00:04:30.600> gonna<00:04:30.690> just<00:04:30.960> shade<00:04:31.230> in<00:04:31.410> that

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
part and we're gonna just shade in that

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.800 
part and we're gonna just shade in that
area<00:04:31.950> right<00:04:32.100> there<00:04:35.120> now<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.300> is<00:04:36.420> still<00:04:36.600> kind

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
area right there now this is still kind

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.090 
area right there now this is still kind
of<00:04:36.900> dramatic<00:04:37.380> all<00:04:37.500> these<00:04:37.650> lines<00:04:37.890> right<00:04:38.040> here

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
of dramatic all these lines right here

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.310 
of dramatic all these lines right here
then<00:04:38.760> this<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.240> Marilyn<00:04:39.720> Monroe<00:04:39.750> trick

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
then this is the Marilyn Monroe trick

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.610 
then this is the Marilyn Monroe trick
she<00:04:40.860> shaded<00:04:41.160> these<00:04:41.910> angles<00:04:42.480> right<00:04:42.930> above<00:04:43.410> her

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
she shaded these angles right above her

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.230 
she shaded these angles right above her
nostrils<00:04:44.130> right<00:04:44.310> here<00:04:44.520> so<00:04:44.760> we're<00:04:44.910> gonna<00:04:45.000> go

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
nostrils right here so we're gonna go

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.800 
nostrils right here so we're gonna go
down<00:04:45.420> kind<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:45.990> make<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.140> V<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:48.150> go<00:04:48.330> down<00:04:48.540> like

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
down kind of make a V and go down like

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.220 
down kind of make a V and go down like
that

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.270 

so<00:04:52.230> it's<00:04:52.380> like<00:04:52.500> you're<00:04:52.680> creating<00:04:53.040> a<00:04:53.100> V<00:04:53.250> right

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
so it's like you're creating a V right

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.750 
so it's like you're creating a V right
here<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:53.700> your<00:04:53.820> nostrils<00:04:55.280> then<00:04:56.280> you<00:04:56.430> can<00:04:56.610> go

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760

could take some playing around and it's

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.840 
could take some playing around and it's
easier<00:05:31.530> with<00:05:31.710> those<00:05:31.860> pencils<00:05:32.340> sometimes<00:05:32.700> too

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.380 
wherever you want it to and then this is
then<00:05:38.760> you're<00:05:38.880> gonna<00:05:38.970> set<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.270> with<00:05:39.360> powder
