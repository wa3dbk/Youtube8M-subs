00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.670 
all right today I'll be showing you how
to<00:00:01.979> make<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.280> text<00:00:02.760> follow<00:00:03.060> shape<00:00:03.840> or<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.470> path

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
to make a text follow shape or a path

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.579 
to make a text follow shape or a path
and<00:00:05.310> it's<00:00:05.640> pretty<00:00:05.910> easy<00:00:06.000> when<00:00:06.420> they<00:00:06.600> drawn<00:00:06.839> so

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
and it's pretty easy when they drawn so

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.450 
and it's pretty easy when they drawn so
first<00:00:07.919> step<00:00:08.099> is<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.400> make<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> new<00:00:08.760> composition

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
first step is to make a new composition

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.589 
first step is to make a new composition
you<00:00:11.460> know<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.670> can<00:00:11.820> put<00:00:11.969> whatever<00:00:12.179> settings

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
you know you can put whatever settings

you want for it I'll make it so I am 25
for<00:00:18.390> 85<00:00:18.619> seconds<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.770> good<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:21.170> first<00:00:22.170> step<00:00:22.410> is

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
for 85 seconds is good and first step is

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.160 
for 85 seconds is good and first step is
to<00:00:23.070> make<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.609> solid<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.449> option<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.019> don't

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
to make a solid this option you don't

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
shape layer and it's not good so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.880

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
numerical path and very much it if you

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.120 
numerical path and very much it if you
don't<00:03:10.530> like<00:03:10.790> how<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.970> stops<00:03:12.329> at<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.750> end<00:03:13.130> you

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
don't like how it stops at the end you

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.349 
don't like how it stops at the end you
can<00:03:14.340> make<00:03:14.579> this<00:03:14.790> an<00:03:15.000> easy<00:03:15.299> ease<00:03:15.660> keyframe<00:03:17.359> and

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
can make this an easy ease keyframe and

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.690 
can make this an easy ease keyframe and
will<00:03:18.959> be<00:03:19.109> smoother<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:22.410> can<00:03:22.620> see

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
will be smoother you can see

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.590 
will be smoother you can see
take<00:03:24.300> this
