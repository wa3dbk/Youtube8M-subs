00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:11.400
 all the two teams in defense have 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.210
 played okay they managed to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.630
 execute their strategy above all 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.039
 the Montepaschi always doubling up 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.769
 arroyo took us off arroyo gave us i 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.619
 shoot from outside and we have it today 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:35.880
 wrong all the shots on 19 shots 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.440
 we were wrong 17 of then 14 15 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.180
 are the TVs 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.879
 to do to do in all non-matches 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 there is nothing to say but we have them 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.300
 wrong 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.450
 at this point also the montepaschi a 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.210
 certain time with 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.410
 the number 39 we had prepared of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.260
 closing in its penetrations 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.530
 so we made some changes and he knows 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.140
 he was good at punishing these changes today 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.810
 with incredible three-point shots 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.970
 which is not his specialty is the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.729
 montepaschi year ahead of us 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.550
 I have to say that pulling it out to him and 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.970
 putting miliaries has changed the game 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.680
 gave us more energy gave us more 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.080
 open penetrations now defense of in 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.979
 montepaschi and made us win one 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.860
 very critical game for us that I think 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.090
 that at this point 90 once for 5 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.399
 percent 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.079
 we can think of the top sixteen asks 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.700
 just as seen the mount paschi 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.320
 compared to the race the first game 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.170
 of the regular season 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.729
 if that seems to have grown as an identity of 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.409
 team a very new team a lot 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.049
 young and perhaps even inexperienced for 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.450
 this level 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.510
 the thing when of montepaschi and them 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.170
 fight 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.000
 as a team for a whole ball too 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.270
 they were unlucky today they have 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.570
 wrong of the very cautious shots with 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.659
 especially green pears 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.020
 after all he didn't make his second TV 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.840
 me the montepaschi between the team that is 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.990
 in the four games remaining in 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.880
 euroleague can always make a blow like 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.880
 has done with moves
