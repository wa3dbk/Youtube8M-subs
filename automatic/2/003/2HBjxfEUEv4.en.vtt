Kansas hospitals outcomes are identical

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.910 
Kansas hospitals outcomes are identical
to<00:01:54.640> males<00:01:54.850> they<00:01:55.390> just<00:01:55.570> do<00:01:55.810> great<00:01:56.320> work<00:01:56.650> and

was<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.260> really<00:02:20.500> great<00:02:20.709> meeting<00:02:20.890> our<00:02:21.250> goal<00:02:21.490> here

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
was a really great meeting our goal here

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.250 
was a really great meeting our goal here
is<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.000> try<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.209> reassure<00:02:22.480> people<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.080> this

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
is to try to reassure people that this

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.570 
is to try to reassure people that this
is<00:02:23.410> something<00:02:23.650> we're<00:02:23.860> comfortable<00:02:24.100> doing

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
is something we're comfortable doing

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.790 
is something we're comfortable doing
it's<00:02:24.910> something<00:02:25.120> we're<00:02:25.540> doing<00:02:26.050> on<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.350> regular

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
basis and we have excellent outcomes and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.350 
basis and we have excellent outcomes and
I<00:02:29.590> think<00:02:29.830> that's<00:02:30.040> what<00:02:30.550> makes<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.970> difference

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
I think that's what makes the difference

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.949 
I think that's what makes the difference
it's<00:02:31.570> common<00:02:32.080> for<00:02:32.110> us<00:02:32.500> aku<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.850> see<00:02:34.060> this<00:02:34.300> fill

the complexity the operation that's

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
tissue valve looks like an actual tissue

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.640 
tissue valve looks like an actual tissue
valve<00:03:19.330> not<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.720> one<00:03:19.840> he<00:03:19.989> would<00:03:20.080> have<00:03:20.140> but<00:03:20.500> what

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
valve not the one he would have but what

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.410 
valve not the one he would have but what
they<00:03:20.799> look<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:22.120> was<00:03:22.269> helpful

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
they look like so that was helpful

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.110 
they look like so that was helpful
because<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:22.989> felt<00:03:23.260> like<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.739> was<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.519> part<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.940> what

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
because I felt like I was a part of what

not going to ask I'm not gonna ask and

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.680 
not going to ask I'm not gonna ask and
