keeps this coating clean and protected

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.540 
keeps this coating clean and protected
because<00:00:33.620> that's<00:00:33.830> what's<00:00:34.040> actually<00:00:34.190> going<00:00:34.489> to

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
because that's what's actually going to

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.830 
because that's what's actually going to
be<00:00:35.350> transformed<00:00:36.350> by<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.590> UV<00:00:36.980> light<00:00:37.660> to<00:00:38.660> allow

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
for the sample to adhere really well so

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
for the sample to adhere really well so
let's<00:00:42.770> set<00:00:44.290> fine<00:00:45.290> adjustment

close the lid on kraji really quickly it

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.699 
close the lid on kraji really quickly it
doesn't<00:02:43.629> matter<00:02:43.780> how<00:02:43.900> long<00:02:44.079> you<00:02:44.200> hold<00:02:44.349> it<00:02:44.560> but

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
doesn't matter how long you hold it but

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.789 
doesn't matter how long you hold it but
if<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:44.860> just<00:02:45.040> snap<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.489> once<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.239> release

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
if you just snap it once and release

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.910 
if you just snap it once and release
that<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:48.000> shines<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.180> quick<00:02:49.540> flash<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.170> UV<00:02:50.620> light

that it shines a quick flash of UV light
and<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.549> allows<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.260> stickiness<00:02:53.260> on<00:02:53.500> this

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
and that allows the stickiness on this

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.789 
and that allows the stickiness on this
specialized<00:02:54.760> slide<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.629> bind<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.620> cryo

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:21.860 
left is your cross-section of a tomato
stone

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.170 

and<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.680> pull<00:03:23.010> really<00:03:23.370> fast<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.910> end<00:03:24.090> up

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
and if you pull really fast you end up

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.970 
and if you pull really fast you end up
taking<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.599> matrix<00:03:24.959> with<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.319> that's<00:03:25.739> not

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
taking the matrix with it that's not

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.740 
taking the matrix with it that's not
ideal<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:29.160> this<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.580> either<00:03:29.760> leave<00:03:30.540> in

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
ideal so this you can either leave in

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.250 
ideal so this you can either leave in
the<00:03:31.400> in<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:33.090> chamber<00:03:33.510> with<00:03:33.750> everything<00:03:34.110> else

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
the in the chamber with everything else

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.400 
the in the chamber with everything else
and<00:03:34.620> kind<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.340> pile<00:03:35.610> them<00:03:35.819> up<00:03:35.940> or<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.300> can<00:03:37.200> put

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
and kind of pile them up or you can put

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.160 
and kind of pile them up or you can put
it<00:03:37.500> into<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.800> rack<00:03:38.430> for<00:03:38.910> saving<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.840> freezer

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
it into a rack for saving in the freezer

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.110 
it into a rack for saving in the freezer
so<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:40.950> can<00:03:41.160> write<00:03:41.310> your<00:03:41.340> sample<00:03:41.849> name<00:03:42.000> in

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
so you can write your sample name in

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.750 
so you can write your sample name in
pencil<00:03:42.269> remember<00:03:43.049> if<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.200> use<00:03:43.260> pen<00:03:43.709> your<00:03:44.489> ink

ethanol<00:03:47.580> washes<00:03:49.610> you<00:03:50.610> can<00:03:50.760> put<00:03:50.910> them<00:03:51.030> into<00:03:51.180> a

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
ethanol washes you can put them into a

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.150 
ethanol washes you can put them into a
regular<00:03:51.660> slide<00:03:51.930> holder<00:03:52.200> but<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.680> like<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.980> put

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
regular slide holder but I like to put

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.890 
regular slide holder but I like to put
it<00:03:53.250> into<00:03:53.519> one<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.790> these<00:03:53.910> carriers<00:03:54.269> because

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
it into one of these carriers because

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.009 
it into one of these carriers because
this<00:03:55.170> will<00:03:55.319> allow<00:03:55.410> us<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:56.280> do<00:03:57.180> dyeing<00:03:57.690> and

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
this will allow us to do dyeing and

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.500 
this will allow us to do dyeing and
staining<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.560> dipping<00:03:58.920> into<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.700> big<00:04:00.120> staining

jar<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.920> keep<00:04:01.950> everything<00:04:02.340> cold<00:04:02.730> there's<00:04:03.569> a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
jar to keep everything cold there's a

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.960 
jar to keep everything cold there's a
freezer<00:04:03.959> right<00:04:04.590> next<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.040> carton<00:04:05.549> so<00:04:05.790> you

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
freezer right next to the carton so you

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.420 
freezer right next to the carton so you
can<00:04:06.120> just<00:04:06.209> walk<00:04:06.360> right
