00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello everyone here once more with 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.750
 today, I am going to show you how to do 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.940
 an arrangement of flowers for your holidays 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.640
 this can be used for the table 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.410
 I hope you like it and we are going to 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.269
 start or how good the first thing 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.230
 he has to build is a little basket 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.050
 like this oasis and paste it to the little basket 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.390
 that we were going to use green leaf as 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.579
 this cloud will use this 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.680
 gannets this time I'm going to 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:38.850
 use copper color white roses and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.340
 copper color too and that's all good 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.500
 the first thing that they have to first thing that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.370
 let's do is put all our 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.579
 green leaf 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.860
 it's all around our basic 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:57.839
 that is this is and has and 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.839
 we have that comes from asia more 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.960
 this arrangement of flowers that is very 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.000
 nice this I use it for wedding ok 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.180
 but if you look for what can 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.540
 use for quinceanera can 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.240
 use the colors that you like 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.630
 It looks very nice and that's how we are like that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.710
 it's like we have to stay with what 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.250
 good where is it to continue 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.220
 as I told you this topic 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.460
 I'm going to use two lines 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:35.450
 two lines with which I will use 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.159
 you can use one two three the 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.310
 that you like depending on the 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.230
 size of your basket my basket is not 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.210
 very big 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.210
 and that's how we have to stay 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:57.260
 and we will continue with the next one 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.260
 As I said, this can be used 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.410
 this I use it for treble 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.640
 that's why I'm using our 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.460
 colors but it's up to you 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.930
 the event they put is how they have it 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:17.470
 that I use these I'm still 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.340
 putting a little bit upwards to 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.980
 Do not look at the whole plan 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.980
 we go a little bit late 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:37.340
 this all this material 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.189
 what is artificial but census can 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.670
 like it is a little bit more expensive but it 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:46.989
 You must know prettier with flowers 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.989
 natural ok 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.519
 we're almost done and that's how we 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.430
 It has to be left I hope you look at it 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.040
 well and now what we are going to do is 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.950
 put our roses we are going to intersperse 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.219
 a rose and a cloud to cover everything 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.660
 the oasis is around a line of 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:13.910
 roses and 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.910
 and as I tell you, it's a 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.329
 so that I 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.690
 let's put a little nailed 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.760
 as well 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.239
 a rose 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.239
 and a cloud that they were looking at 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.440
 let's intersperse 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.350
 none 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.470
 this centerpiece as I told you is 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.040
 also pretty 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.629
 I hope you like it 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.629
 and I live many followed 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.260
 world 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.640
 i 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.819
 interest loading 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.709
 I hope they can explain me to look 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.709
 as I am doing 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.100
 and I think that I'm not going to have 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.540
 enough knots 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.280
 but you can use with that 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.850
 because that is to have like that which I 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.850
 I have 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.400
 and we have to stay here I'm not going 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.220
 to put but you are put that 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.200
 they have enough good 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.710
 and I show you how you have to go 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.710
 staying 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.770
 that's how you do not have to stay ok 

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:46.660
 very 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:50.800
 well now the next step is to do 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:54.570
 a line of alcatraz from between 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.110
 and they put another cloud 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:02.230
 11 that this is for us to cover 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.660
 all the home and do not look at anything 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.050
 oasis 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.449
 in good doctor 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.539
 as I said we are simple to the 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.960
 that you like but can share 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.590
 more noise sooner 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.650
 and that's how we have to stay 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.100
 I told them they are very simple 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:28.530
 nice our present 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.530
 the center of arrangements 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.129
 that's how we have left but now nothing 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.960
 more what I'm going to flip a little bit 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:48.310
 towards me to cover if it makes us 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.010
 missing separate more 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.930
 you have to look here is nothing more 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.370
 I 'm getting an idea but 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.409
 you can add anything 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.360
 take away putting more as I told you this 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.849
 it's just one more idea I want 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.150
 share the idea that he uses it 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.759
 for my wedding and it looked very nice that 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.009
 you do not have to spend a lot of money because 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:15.080
 all the flowers 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.080
 and artificial is evil 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:22.620
 that's all and the prosecutor does not want us 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:27.470
 and now I show you how we stayed 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.470
 our center of view 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.330
 Well, I hope you can see it well 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.750
 If you have any comments or questions 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:46.419
 let me know in the comments of 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.419
 down that we see each other until the next
