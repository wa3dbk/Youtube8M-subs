00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.549
 notes for the production of the film have 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.949
 started to circulate on the internet with a 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.600
 information that is key to the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.510
 conclusion of the new adventure of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.910
 captain america and company in these 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 folios we can read the notes on a 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.410
 scene that happens in the second trailer 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.779
 of the film there developed a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.059
 scene with a throne fighting against the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.550
 marvel superheroes and the ending that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.860
 relate these documents can not be 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.350
 more revealing the final trailer of the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.350
 picadores 2 reveals the bacteria between 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.210
 iron man and hulk but these documents already 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.370
 They are expressing to sell by ebay 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.739
 they offer a much more revelation 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.100
 significant in the comments of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.770
 production of cause 66 have detected 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.649
 the incomplete phrase of julius the troll 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.629
 to know more about that ending is 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.760
 you need to know what you mean with 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.510
 the first word so in the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.310
 discussion forums about the movie 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.620
 heavy to speculate on what to 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.690
 refers the word that most fits with 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.810
 those three letters taking into account the 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.690
 context is explosion or is a 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.850
 explosion kills the throne in the movie 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.710
 but if you want to know more about the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.110
 history seek him thoroughly to try 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.660
 see what the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.760
 author of these documents what more 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.520
 sounds on social networks is that the 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.830
 keyword is fiction so that 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.630
 we could be talking about an end in 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.400
 which the creation of the throne becomes 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.590
 against the villain to help the 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.900
 sinners take down the evil robot 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.360
 However, the 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.580
 possibility that death will not be 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.650
 try a throne but one of the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.470
 androids of the villain since if we 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.120
 we go to the first official trailer 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.190
 we remember that the scene of the fort is 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.920
 riddled with the mechanical minions of 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.080
 tyrant among other subject clark actor 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.300
 break that plays the film agent 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.220
 woodson has commented the plans of 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.410
 marvel to introduce the inhuman 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.080
 in the television series agents of 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.060
 shield last year marvel studios 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.650
 confirmed that they will develop a 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.569
 movie of the 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.049
 that will be released in cinemas in November 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.239
 of 2018 and the president that my face 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.030
 he joked that we could see some of these 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.860
 characters no sooner rather than later 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.439
 much later in the series of 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.230
 television agent of shield introduced 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:32.510
 not only terra genesis the process that gives 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.790
 the inhuman superpowers but the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.920
 first inhuman officer 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.349
 quake also known as skype 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.420
 performed by soul bennet clark break 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.640
 It was enough to express his emotion 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.280
 inhuman in the series and reveals that no 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.959
 will put any creative impediment 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.359
 I'm very happy, I think that 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.670
 inhuman is a large and fresh part 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.700
 of the marvel universe is a great story 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.920
 and let's set something up we're going to get 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.930
 to explore it I'm glad that we are 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.510
 trusting this important part and 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.760
 however , we are going to have the freedom to 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.129
 introduce them in our series to our 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.409
 way like curious data and simple rumor 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.569
 with the appearance of the inhuman in the 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.639
 number of agents to prepare shield 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.159
 his arrival to marvel movies as 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.660
 the picadores 3 fits the possibility of 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.490
 that wolverine is 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.980
 the walt disney zinc as a 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.500
 member of this alien team very 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.420
 similar to the mutants of x-men is 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.670
 possible that they use this strategy 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.980
 to play the clue with century fox 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.930
 since the production company has the 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.420
 rights to have the mutants of 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.940
 marvel on the big screen without marvel 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.370
 studios and walt disney use a 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.900
 wolverine as a human could get 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.420
 to an agreement with your competition and 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.850
 uses a renewed and original version 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.520
 of the Canadian immortal a story that 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.920
 Count the beginnings of man x through 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.600
 of the mists you are governed by jazz the element 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.940
 that activates the powers of the inhuman 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.640
 as we have seen in agents of the 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.800
 SIOT thus can restart 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.500
 history of wolverine using his 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.960
 first name james howlett for example 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.580
 and so be able to count on the most mutant 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.190
 popular marvel comics in the 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.740
 avengers 3 for last latin review 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.440
 notes that a source close to disney 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.560
 he revealed to him that lucasfilm and the director jj 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.200
 abrams could present a trailer more 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.060
 full of 7 star wars along with the 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.700
 premiere of the Avengers 2 the era 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.580
 As you know, the first one will be released 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.500
 May in this new trailer is rumored 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.840
 we can see the hard core of the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.530
 original trilogy that includes luke 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.990
 skywalker just law his cow and in 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.690
 full action something that we miss 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.669
 in the first preview shown and well that 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.230
 everything is for this video is therefore they have 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.300
 been useful and information 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.010
