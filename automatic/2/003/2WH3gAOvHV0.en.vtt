00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
start off by you know with don't fan and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.990 
start off by you know with don't fan and
stir<00:00:37.680> raptor<00:00:37.980> i'm<00:00:38.100> gonna<00:00:38.250> wait<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.610> turn<00:00:38.820> out

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
stir raptor i'm gonna wait you turn out

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.299 
stir raptor i'm gonna wait you turn out
knowing<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:40.079> could<00:00:40.140> potentially<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:41.129> for

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
knowing that it could potentially go for

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
knowing that it could potentially go for
a<00:00:41.430> sharp<00:00:41.790> stone<00:00:42.030> age<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.450> stealth<00:00:42.719> rocks<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.350> I

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
a sharp stone age or stealth rocks so I

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
a sharp stone age or stealth rocks so I
thought<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> better<00:00:44.160> choice<00:00:44.340> would<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.670> go

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
thought the better choice would be to go

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.590 
thought the better choice would be to go
out<00:00:45.030> into<00:00:46.129> shaming<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.280> scary<00:00:47.640> mouth<00:00:47.850> knowing

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
out into shaming and scary mouth knowing

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.330 
out into shaming and scary mouth knowing
that<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.780> will<00:00:49.020> scare<00:00:49.350> him<00:00:49.469> out<00:00:49.530> i<00:00:49.680> will<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that I will scare him out i will do a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.560 
that I will scare him out i will do a
double<00:00:50.789> switch<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> radio

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
to get out of like the wire and see what

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.660 
to get out of like the wire and see what
what's<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.979> at<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.100> point<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.460> thought

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
what's going on at this point I thought

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.810

switch into and it goes out into Trevor

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
switch into and it goes out into Trevor
which<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.130> slacking<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.360> point<00:01:21.509> I'm

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
which is slacking now at this point I'm

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.080 
which is slacking now at this point I'm
like<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.049> was<00:01:22.409> looking<00:01:22.560> at<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.979> base<00:01:23.400> speed<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
like I was looking at the base speed and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.620 
like I was looking at the base speed and
I<00:01:24.390> apparently<00:01:25.259> watched<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.610> wrong<00:01:27.150> because<00:01:27.450> i

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I apparently watched it wrong because i

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
I apparently watched it wrong because i
thought<00:01:27.900> i<00:01:27.960> would<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.320> faster<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.490> seems

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
thought i would be faster so it seems

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240 
thought i would be faster so it seems
like<00:01:29.880> Trevor<00:01:30.450> slacking<00:01:31.079> has<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> higher<00:01:31.560> base<00:01:31.979> B

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
like Trevor slacking has a higher base B

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.980 
like Trevor slacking has a higher base B
than<00:01:32.490> elective<00:01:33.000> wires<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> really

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
than elective wires so that was a really

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.710 
than elective wires so that was a really
facepalm<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.979> my<00:01:35.130> face<00:01:35.369> right<00:01:35.400> there<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.509> um

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
facepalm on my face right there so um

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.060 
facepalm on my face right there so um
he's<00:01:36.930> gonna<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.200> able<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.530> take<00:01:37.710> me<00:01:37.740> out<00:01:37.890> with

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
but a bad thing is i don't have faked

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.650 
but a bad thing is i don't have faked
out<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.700> said<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> thought

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
out on that said because I thought

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.620 
out on that said because I thought
substitute<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.349> we

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
substitute but we
would<00:02:13.720> be<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.930> better<00:02:14.050> choice<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.350> some

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
would be the better choice in some

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.800 
would be the better choice in some
debate<00:02:14.860> expects<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.310> fake<00:02:15.490> out<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.600> seems

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
debate expects to fake out but it seems

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
on into my shaming I was actually

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.130 
on into my shaming I was actually
breaking<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.300> ice<00:03:37.330> shard<00:03:37.690> but<00:03:37.870> instead<00:03:38.050> he

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
breaking the ice shard but instead he

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.650 
breaking the ice shard but instead he
goes<00:03:38.230> for<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.470> four<00:03:39.250> stone<00:03:39.520> age<00:03:39.670> which<00:03:40.420> I

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
goes for the four stone age which I

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.210 
goes for the four stone age which I
don't<00:03:40.720> know<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:40.900> was<00:03:41.080> breaking<00:03:41.320> my<00:03:41.590> switch<00:03:41.890> but

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
don't know I was breaking my switch but

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.640 
don't know I was breaking my switch but
I<00:03:42.640> guess<00:03:43.330> that<00:03:43.600> worked<00:03:43.870> out<00:03:44.020> in<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.260> end<00:03:44.290> for

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
I guess that worked out in the end for

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.860 
I guess that worked out in the end for
him<00:03:44.680> because<00:03:44.920> it<00:03:45.459> gets<00:03:45.640> some<00:03:45.850> nice<00:03:46.300> damage<00:03:46.570> my

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
him because it gets some nice damage my

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.750 
him because it gets some nice damage my
