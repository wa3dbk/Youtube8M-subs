00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
ones that are standard earring size but

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.710 
ones that are standard earring size but
they<00:04:02.859> look<00:04:03.099> much<00:04:03.609> bigger<00:04:03.849> than<00:04:04.000> they<00:04:04.209> are<00:04:04.239> just

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
they look much bigger than they are just

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.750 
they look much bigger than they are just
to<00:04:04.840> see<00:04:05.019> if<00:04:05.109> they<00:04:05.230> look<00:04:05.440> if<00:04:06.099> you<00:04:06.280> like<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.459> look

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
to see if they look if you like a look

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.309 
to see if they look if you like a look
before<00:04:07.209> you<00:04:07.389> go<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:07.810> do<00:04:07.989> the

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
before you go and do the

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.110

the<00:04:10.319> process<00:04:10.859> of<00:04:11.010> gage<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.609> wouldn't<00:04:11.969> say<00:04:12.030> it's

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
the process of gage I wouldn't say it's

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.660 
the process of gage I wouldn't say it's
a<00:04:12.180> painful<00:04:12.390> process<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.950> can<00:04:14.010> be<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.430> painful

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
a painful process it can be a painful

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.969 
a painful process it can be a painful
process<00:04:14.969> but<00:04:15.480> it's<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.079> same<00:04:16.259> level<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.739> pain

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
process but it's the same level of pain

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.699 
process but it's the same level of pain
every<00:04:17.340> time<00:04:17.579> figure<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.209> go<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:19.079> does<00:04:19.350> really

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
every time figure you go it does really

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.259 
every time figure you go it does really
you<00:04:20.070> know<00:04:20.190> what<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.370> threshold<00:04:20.880> would<00:04:20.970> have<00:04:21.120> I'd

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
you know what I threshold would have I'd

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.070 
you know what I threshold would have I'd
say<00:04:21.539> on<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> scale<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.229> maybe<00:04:22.650> like<00:04:23.360> 125<00:04:24.360> you

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
say on a scale of maybe like 125 you

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.620 
say on a scale of maybe like 125 you
never<00:04:25.320> really<00:04:25.650> exceed<00:04:26.130> five<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.389> each

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
never really exceed five it's just each

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.969 
never really exceed five it's just each
size<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.110> get<00:04:28.229> bigger<00:04:28.470> you're<00:04:28.650> gonna<00:04:28.740> feel

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
size you get bigger you're gonna feel

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.360 
size you get bigger you're gonna feel
that<00:04:29.160> same<00:04:29.460> similar<00:04:30.380> pain<00:04:31.380> so<00:04:31.830> once<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.280> get

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
that same similar pain so once you get

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
25 it's not like it's gonna go into six

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.900 
25 it's not like it's gonna go into six
seven<00:04:34.470> eight<00:04:34.530> nine<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.800> ten<00:04:35.190> as<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.759> get
