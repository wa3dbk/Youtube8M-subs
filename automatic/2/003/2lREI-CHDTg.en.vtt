00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.630 
show you how to draw a little fluffy
cloud<00:00:11.809> so<00:00:12.809> first<00:00:13.200> up<00:00:13.350> what<00:00:13.470> we<00:00:13.590> do<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.460> draw

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:14.640 
cloud so first up what we do is we draw

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:22.960 
cloud so first up what we do is we draw
an<00:00:14.970> oval<00:00:15.680> in<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.740> middle<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.369> our<00:00:17.460> page<00:00:21.800> and

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
an oval in the middle of our page and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.640 
an oval in the middle of our page and
then<00:00:23.970> from<00:00:24.150> here<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.810> inside<00:00:25.110> of<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> oval

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
then from here on the inside of the oval

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.160 
then from here on the inside of the oval
we<00:00:26.100> just<00:00:26.310> draw<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.730> whole<00:00:26.910> lot<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.119> little<00:00:27.449> half

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
we just draw a whole lot of little half

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.670 
we just draw a whole lot of little half
circles<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.070> fear<00:00:29.310> either<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:31.380> size

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
circles and we just fear either the size

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.189 
circles and we just fear either the size
of<00:00:31.920> them<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.460> some<00:00:32.669> larger<00:00:33.210> some

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
of them so we have some larger some

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.060 
of them so we have some larger some
smaller<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.290> sickles<00:00:37.620> don't<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
smaller you have sickles don't have to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.150 
smaller you have sickles don't have to
go<00:00:38.190> right<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> edge<00:00:38.940> either<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:40.829> overall

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
go right to the edge either the overall

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.450 
go right to the edge either the overall
is<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.610> guide<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.770> make<00:00:43.920> another<00:00:44.190> large

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
is just a guide so make another large

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.880 
is just a guide so make another large
one<00:00:44.520> there<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.180> another<00:00:46.130> large<00:00:47.130> one<00:00:47.219> there

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
one there and another large one there

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.670 
one there and another large one there
then<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:49.950> want<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> give<00:00:50.309> our<00:00:50.430> cloud<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.410> face<00:00:52.410> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
then we want to give our cloud a face so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.990 
then we want to give our cloud a face so
what<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.399> draw<00:00:54.140> an<00:00:55.140> oval<00:00:55.289> here

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
what we do is we draw an oval here

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.729 
what we do is we draw an oval here
another<00:00:57.000> over<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.230> add<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.649> bit

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
another over there and add a little bit

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.350 
another over there and add a little bit
of<00:00:58.829> light<00:00:59.100> reflection<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> eye<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.059> just

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
of light reflection to the eye so just

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.510 
of light reflection to the eye so just
draw<00:01:00.539> circles<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> air<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.680> shade<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
draw circles in the air and shade in the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.149 
draw circles in the air and shade in the
rest<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> oval<00:01:03.619> then<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.710> draw<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> half

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
rest of the oval then we draw a half

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.899 
rest of the oval then we draw a half
circle<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.909> its<00:01:06.000> mouth<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.369> little<00:01:08.369> circles

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
circle for its mouth and little circles

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.629 
circle for its mouth and little circles
for<00:01:10.069> its<00:01:11.069> cheeks<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> next<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.279> what<00:01:14.429> I'd<00:01:14.520> like

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:14.639 
for its cheeks so next up what I'd like

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:17.059 
for its cheeks so next up what I'd like
to<00:01:14.789> do<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.240> ink<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.049> line<00:01:16.259> drawing<00:01:16.679> the

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069 
to do is ink in the line drawing the

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.480 
to do is ink in the line drawing the
pencil<00:01:17.369> drawing<00:01:17.639> with<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.270> black<00:01:19.139> pin<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.039> we<00:01:20.369> do

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
pencil drawing with a black pin so we do

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:51.020 
pencil drawing with a black pin so we do
that<00:01:20.639> by<00:01:20.819> doing<00:01:20.880> this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.340 

then<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.150> make<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.420> drawing<00:01:52.600> look<00:01:52.870> even<00:01:53.140> more

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
then to make the drawing look even more

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.380 
then to make the drawing look even more
cartoony<00:01:53.800> we<00:01:54.010> just<00:01:54.159> go<00:01:54.280> back<00:01:54.460> in<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:54.970> double

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
cartoony we just go back in and double

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.780 
cartoony we just go back in and double
up<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.510> thickness<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.710> main<00:01:57.070> part<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.640> the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
up the thickness of the main part of the

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.430 
up the thickness of the main part of the
illustration<00:01:58.000> which<00:01:58.479> in<00:01:58.630> this<00:01:58.750> case<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.229> the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
illustration which in this case is the

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.800 
illustration which in this case is the
outside<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.550> cloud<00:02:00.790> so<00:02:01.180> we<00:02:01.210> do<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:01.600> by

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
outside of the cloud so we do that by

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:32.480 
outside of the cloud so we do that by
doing<00:02:02.140> this

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.590 

can<00:02:33.060> we<00:02:33.150> just<00:02:33.300> wait<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.660> ink<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.810> dry<00:02:35.600> then

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
can we just wait for the ink to dry then

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.030 
can we just wait for the ink to dry then
we<00:02:36.690> take<00:02:36.810> our<00:02:36.990> razor<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:37.620> go<00:02:37.710> back<00:02:37.740> in

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
we take our razor and just go back in

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:54.250 
we take our razor and just go back in
and<00:02:38.250> rub<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.670> pencil<00:02:38.880> lines

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.600 

so<00:02:55.260> there<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.950> cutting<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.400> little

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
so there you have it a cutting a little

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:23.160 
so there you have it a cutting a little
fluffy<00:02:56.910> cloud<00:02:57.209> happy<00:02:58.110> drawing

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.230 

you
