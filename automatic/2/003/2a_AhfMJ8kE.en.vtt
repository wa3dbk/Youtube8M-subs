out of bounds you know just you know

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.460 
out of bounds you know just you know
take<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:46.540> chance<00:02:46.720> thought<00:02:46.989> out<00:02:47.110> of<00:02:47.230> mountain

system<00:02:47.799> delivering<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.579> those<00:02:48.849> are<00:02:48.940> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
system delivering and those are the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.550 
system delivering and those are the
things<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.329> he<00:02:49.390> got<00:02:49.510> continue<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:49.989> grow<00:02:50.230> and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
things that he got continue to grow and

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.960 
things that he got continue to grow and
I<00:02:50.829> think<00:02:51.099> he<00:02:51.160> will<00:02:51.370> grow<00:02:51.549> from<00:02:51.579> this<00:02:51.790> game

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970

I think he will grow from this game
because<00:02:52.180> he<00:02:52.840> did<00:02:52.989> some<00:02:53.170> things<00:02:53.349> today<00:02:53.530> they
