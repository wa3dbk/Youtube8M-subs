present<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.390> some<00:00:33.570> strange<00:00:33.930> reason<00:00:34.050> but

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
present for some strange reason but

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.729 
present for some strange reason but
everything<00:00:35.610> else<00:00:35.790> remains<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.270> same<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
everything else remains the same on the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.740 
everything else remains the same on the
front<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> case<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.850> our<00:00:39.000> Nakia<00:00:39.360> logo

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
front of the case we have our Nakia logo

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.180 
front of the case we have our Nakia logo
there<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.870> that's<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
there so that's really it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.580 
there so that's really it
the<00:00:44.940> inside<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.690> kind<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.079> velvety

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the inside here is kind of a velvety

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.170 
the inside here is kind of a velvety
touch<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.280> nice<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> smooth<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
touch and it's nice and smooth on the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.150 
touch and it's nice and smooth on the
outside<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.809> again<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.559> kind<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.890> smeared

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
outside and again it's kind of smeared

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.150 
outside and again it's kind of smeared
on<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.370> back<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.600> put<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> case<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
on the back so we put the case on to the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.840 
on the back so we put the case on to the
place<00:00:56.160> itself<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:57.360> soft<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.899> clips<00:00:58.320> in

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
place itself like soft just clips in

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.680 
place itself like soft just clips in
like<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:01.730> that's<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:03.000> there<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
like that and that's all there is to it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.170 
like that and that's all there is to it
so<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.890> doesn't<00:01:05.369> really<00:01:05.489> outline<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> take

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so it doesn't really outline you take

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.700 
so it doesn't really outline you take
this<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> phone<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:06.960> heart<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.409> honest

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
this to the phone with heart be honest

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.250 
this to the phone with heart be honest
and<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.939> kind<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.540> similar<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.930> smaller

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and it's kind of similar to smaller

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.530 
and it's kind of similar to smaller
cases<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:11.040> available<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:12.119> somebody

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
cases that's available on somebody

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
cases that's available on somebody
remodels<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.520> it's<00:01:14.960> just<00:01:15.960> basically<00:01:16.140> gotta

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
remodels and it's just basically gotta

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.080 
remodels and it's just basically gotta
protect<00:01:16.920> your<00:01:17.130> screen<00:01:17.310> more<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.880> than

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
protect your screen more so than

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.450 
protect your screen more so than
anything<00:01:18.299> else<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.650> rest<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> farm<00:01:20.280> is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
anything else and the rest the farm is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.660 
anything else and the rest the farm is
still<00:01:21.770> kind<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.860> open<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:25.340> anything<00:01:26.340> really

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
still kind of open to anything really

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.120 
still kind of open to anything really
but<00:01:27.270> n<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.720> doesn't<00:01:28.080> interfere<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.770> Harlin

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
but n it doesn't interfere it's Harlin

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.999 
but n it doesn't interfere it's Harlin
anyway<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:30.720> disjointed<00:01:31.259> farm<00:01:31.530> would<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.740> more

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
anyway the disjointed farm would be more

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.149 
anyway the disjointed farm would be more
or<00:01:32.070> less<00:01:32.220> covered<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.850> mean<00:01:33.270> still<00:01:33.680> no<00:01:34.680> problem

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
or less covered I mean still no problem

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.520 
or less covered I mean still no problem
with<00:01:35.310> em<00:01:36.439> access<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.890> two<00:01:38.460> day<00:01:38.790> USB<00:01:39.750> or<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
with em access on two day USB or the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.490 
with em access on two day USB or the
headphone<00:01:41.009> socket<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.110> still<00:01:43.290> have

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
headphone socket there and we still have

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.770 
headphone socket there and we still have
a<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.490> release<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.970> back<00:01:45.329> over<00:01:45.600> from

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
a you can release the back over from

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.410 
a you can release the back over from
here<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:47.159> that's<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.579> basically<00:01:47.790> really

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
here so that's just basically really

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.969 
here so that's just basically really
it's<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.020> give<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.320> look<00:01:49.500> at<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> case

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it's just to give you a look at the case

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.460 
it's just to give you a look at the case
itself<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.670> doesn't<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.140> said<00:01:52.290> I'd

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
itself it doesn't you know as I said I'd

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.700 
itself it doesn't you know as I said I'd
add<00:01:52.649> Heat<00:01:52.829> Ignis<00:01:53.220> -<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.149> nice<00:01:54.710> touch

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
add Heat Ignis - it's just a nice touch

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.289 
add Heat Ignis - it's just a nice touch
that<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:56.159> nice<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.430> flat<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> front

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that it's nice and flat on the front

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.030 
that it's nice and flat on the front
here<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.259> when<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.439> open<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.829> phone

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
here like so so when you open the phone

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.959 
here like so so when you open the phone
you'd<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you'd like that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.100 
you'd like that
and<00:02:00.320> then<00:02:02.119> that's<00:02:03.119> really<00:02:03.509> all<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:03.990> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and then that's really all there is to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.469 
and then that's really all there is to
say<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.189> that's<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.610> quick<00:02:05.729> walk

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
say and so that's just a quick walk

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.300 
say and so that's just a quick walk
