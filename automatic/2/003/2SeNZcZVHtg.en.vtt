00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
because it just washes it right off and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.750 
because it just washes it right off and
also<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.030> only<00:01:58.240> way<00:01:58.510> that<00:01:58.690> those<00:01:58.900> works<00:01:59.290> are

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
also the only way that those works are

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.500 
also the only way that those works are
is<00:02:00.760> when<00:02:01.230> the<00:02:02.230> three<00:02:02.560> actually<00:02:03.310> bites<00:02:03.760> your

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
is when the three actually bites your

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.940 
is when the three actually bites your
dog's<00:02:04.810> skin<00:02:05.550> that's<00:02:06.550> how<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.060> works<00:02:07.300> then<00:02:07.660> they

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
dog's skin that's how it works then they

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.460 
dog's skin that's how it works then they
ingest<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.520> poison<00:02:10.510> which<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.110> frontline

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
ingest the poison which is the frontline

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.940 
ingest the poison which is the frontline
and<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.070> kills<00:02:12.340> them<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.730> they<00:02:12.820> die<00:02:13.000> off<00:02:13.950> so

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
and it kills them and they die off so

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.410 
and it kills them and they die off so
it's<00:02:15.220> like<00:02:15.400> your<00:02:15.580> dog<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.940> always<00:02:16.090> going<00:02:16.360> to

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
it's like your dog is always going to

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.080 
it's like your dog is always going to
have<00:02:16.630> fleas<00:02:16.990> or<00:02:17.320> something<00:02:17.740> but<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.280> never<00:02:18.760> had

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090
