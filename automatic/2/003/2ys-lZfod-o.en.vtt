very fast and not only that it does set

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.960 
very fast and not only that it does set
up<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.360> combos<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.159> it<00:01:08.159> pops<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.850> little

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
to do moves right out of it and then of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
to do moves right out of it and then of
course<00:01:15.450> Pikachu's<00:01:15.960> recovery<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> just

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
course Pikachu's recovery is just

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.460 
course Pikachu's recovery is just
amazing<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.640> two<00:01:17.759> quick<00:01:17.880> attacks<00:01:18.270> reach<00:01:18.659> so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
amazing do two quick attacks reach so

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.530 
amazing do two quick attacks reach so
it's<00:01:20.130> very<00:01:20.280> easy<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.700> make<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> back<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
it's very easy to make it back to the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
it's very easy to make it back to the
stage<00:01:21.750> which<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.080> important<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.799> character

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
stage which is important in a character

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
stage which is important in a character
so<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:24.030> necessarily<00:01:24.630> easy<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
so it's not necessarily easy to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.770 
so it's not necessarily easy to
edgeguard<00:01:26.100> Pikachu<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.210> easy<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> edge
