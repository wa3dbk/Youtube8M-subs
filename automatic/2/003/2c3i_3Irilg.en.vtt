00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.630
 the grandfather of the guys wanted to show everyone what was for me 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.179
 I managed to prove which I can not sleep on 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.610
 his car and cliffs and long ago but found 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.949
 her recently here is such a body 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.750
 cabin filter this enclosure goes to 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.160
 mostly on 5 4 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.600
 with air conditioning if they go as well 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.760
 usually do not put the amount and write 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.160
 third, it is very rarely included too 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.349
 by car and monitors the air conditioner if not 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.920
 then there you just have this little thing 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.380
 reticulum and all the cabin body filter itself 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.540
 there are two kinds there is just a body filter 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.850
 salon filter more precisely which is set 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.100
 and it is simply inserted into the film itself but 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.410
 there are hulls like hull like this one 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.320
 cabin filter filter housing more precisely 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.640
 which is inserted cartridge and cartridge already 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.329
 Go see with such a plastic 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.129
 such a plastic hammer goes into this 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.390
 Plastic filter is inserted but this 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.600
 plastmassk sent me 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 the owner was like he was lying and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.710
 and asked him 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.780
 It cost me all 60 hryvnia shipment 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.479
 cost more and more expensive almost the same 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.760
 money as the body itself is like a filter but 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 This is Victor plastmaski I could not find on 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.020
 its original filter since it 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.509
 too expensive defined i bought idle 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 would be a secret filter 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.110
 bit here cut off its essence and stuck in 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.750
 here in this here plastic body 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:31.860
 chuck take the description kiram write for 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.579
 Sit on the number of this filter I will write 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.549
 This is the filter housing from the same hammer 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.079
 what technos this patron more precisely itself 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.549
 installation process i 'll show ok here 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.689
 all the tools we need 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:53.729
 only to be comfortable to eat and here 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.219
 this thing with the help of this thing we twist 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.150
 here are these plastics and silks and you from 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.990
 set to not easily unscrew 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.990
 here is an equestry thing 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.830
 give us we need to remove this gum by ourselves 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.310
 removes the janitor I will not I just this 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:21.650
 a piece 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:22.430
 I lift neatly reached neatly 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.360
 raise it 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.420
 so here I will take and 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.700
 hooked Vitya further as you see we 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.890
 got to my old filter I him 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.680
 put a group here so as not to get in the way 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.150
 test for a couple in the salon on this principle 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.400
 nothing has changed a heart defect 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.730
 soak up such an easy solution 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.840
 problems can align these such 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.430
 mesh goes standard next video 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.220
 our old building itself is small 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.840
 here one tweet 2 such we need to remove and 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.570
 here we need to remove this here went to 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:05.900
 took this came quite easy to give it two 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:09.340
 cogs and everything 's where these two come from 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.870
 cogs take out this old case 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.480
 so the gum we left in place 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.850
 put the plots gum probably remove 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.940
 gum stop or how much sea is there 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.739
 dirt now clean it all by the way if 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.640
 you are going to make it frost 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.640
 careful to 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.380
 if it were a big frost trial if you 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.400
 plus the mass has frozen on you is not broken 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.560
 so it saved a lot of caution so everything is there 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.720
 He brushed his daughter is all well take 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.360
 Now 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.390
 the gasket which she did not stand then better 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:51.650
 old gum here and put on 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:54.410
 place our station code leave all these 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.200
 the body goes well sat as if from here 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.860
 either now I will tighten two screws and here 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.330
 here is such a body 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.720
 air filter such a mount there 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.920
 and try it here when you do 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.620
 how mounts here this saw him 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.630
 too much or it will alter the old 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.560
 ten 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.090
 make it a bit too 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.310
 it seemed a little thought approach 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.020
 I had to redo the old thing to remove 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.110
 bend a little and everything is just the bottom 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.800
 part with the media set to become on 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.650
 easy to open and court that's all and so 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.770
 properly clamped now install 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.660
 filter itself 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:44.199
 I need to eat everything easily into place I am stupid 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.199
 factory or 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:53.620
 since that's how you see the cabin filter 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.270
 more precisely installed housing new filter 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.280
 Now we breathe the fresh air is 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.770
 the filter is simple i will tell you right away this is not 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.340
 transportation coal protect from odor but from 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.840
 powder we have to protect someone 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.970
