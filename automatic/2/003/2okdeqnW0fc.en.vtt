00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
sure you can go through one of them but

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.470 
sure you can go through one of them but
we'll<00:00:09.510> see<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:09.990> we<00:00:10.230> got<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> one<00:00:11.010> shell<00:00:11.389> with<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
we'll see so we got a one shell with the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.079 
we'll see so we got a one shell with the
pencil<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.380> it's<00:00:13.500> actually<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> 22

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
pencil it and it's actually this is a 22

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.189 
pencil it and it's actually this is a 22
bullet<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.980> size<00:00:17.160> comparison<00:00:17.699> again

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
bullet so the size comparison again

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.620 
bullet so the size comparison again
fairly<00:00:19.199> small<00:00:19.640> say<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.670> found<00:00:21.060> we're<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.570> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
fairly small say I found we're going to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.769 
fairly small say I found we're going to
load<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.189> so<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.490> found<00:00:24.029> out<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> easiest<00:00:24.420> ways

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
load it so I found out the easiest ways

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.279 
load it so I found out the easiest ways
to<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.279> barrel<00:00:26.539> rest<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> top<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
to but barrel rest on the top of the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.640 
to but barrel rest on the top of the
firing<00:00:29.070> pin<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> trigger<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.119> hammer<00:00:30.650> so

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
firing pin on the trigger a hammer so

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.540 
firing pin on the trigger a hammer so
you<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:31.920> insert<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.700> cartridge<00:00:34.399> cock<00:00:35.399> it

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you just insert the cartridge cock it

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.020 
you just insert the cartridge cock it
back<00:00:35.690> good<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.780> go<00:00:37.309> all<00:00:38.309> right<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
back good to go all right it's going to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.750 
back good to go all right it's going to
be<00:00:39.090> pretty<00:00:39.180> loud<00:00:39.480> actually<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.640> yummy<00:00:41.640> get

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
be pretty loud actually so yummy get

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.510 
be pretty loud actually so yummy get
closer<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.239> no<00:00:43.129> come<00:00:44.129> closer<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.809> go

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.220 

and<00:00:52.309> it<00:00:53.309> didn't<00:00:53.820> really<00:00:54.210> shoot<00:00:54.539> through<00:00:54.600> but

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and it didn't really shoot through but

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.270 
and it didn't really shoot through but
oh<00:00:55.610> well<00:00:56.690> actually<00:00:57.690> let's<00:00:58.320> try<00:00:58.559> another<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.920> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
oh well actually let's try another one I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.579 
oh well actually let's try another one I
got<00:00:59.730> another<00:00:59.760> shell<00:01:00.210> somewhere<00:01:00.829> here's<00:01:01.829> one

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
got another shell somewhere here's one

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.600 
got another shell somewhere here's one
let's<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.650> try<00:01:04.979> one<00:01:05.339> cannon<00:01:07.220> all<00:01:08.220> right<00:01:08.369> let

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
let's just try one cannon all right let

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.750 
let's just try one cannon all right let
me<00:01:08.640> talk<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.810> gets<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.350> little<00:01:10.500> debris

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.030 

it's<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.510> hardest<00:01:17.840> part<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:18.890> actually

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
it's the hardest part so this actually

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.500 
it's the hardest part so this actually
better<00:01:19.370> wind<00:01:19.610> up<00:01:19.700> shell<00:01:19.880> pops<00:01:20.120> out<00:01:20.330> because

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
better wind up shell pops out because

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
better wind up shell pops out because
then<00:01:20.660> you<00:01:20.780> have<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:21.050> pull<00:01:21.260> it<00:01:21.410> out<00:01:22.840> yeah<00:01:23.840> that's

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
then you have to pull it out yeah that's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.240 
then you have to pull it out yeah that's
it<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:25.210> don't<00:01:26.210> know<00:01:26.270> what<00:01:26.390> that<00:01:26.540> is<00:01:26.570> home<00:01:27.250> so

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
it I don't know what that is home so

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.340 
it I don't know what that is home so
here's<00:01:28.670> another<00:01:28.820> one<00:01:31.000> all<00:01:32.000> right<00:01:32.680> cock<00:01:33.680> it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
here's another one all right cock it

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:44.039 
here's another one all right cock it
okay<00:01:36.220> three<00:01:36.670> two<00:01:37.090> one<00:01:42.000> yeah<00:01:43.000> didn't<00:01:43.930> shoot
