00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
I'm gonna get this version so let's go

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.510 
I'm gonna get this version so let's go
ahead<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.520> take<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> look<00:02:50.880> at<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> back<00:02:52.520> this

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
ahead and take a look at the back this

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.150 
ahead and take a look at the back this
one<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:54.780> fart<00:02:55.140> well<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.530> only<00:02:55.650> thing<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:55.920> shows

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
one is fart well the only thing it shows

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.729 
one is fart well the only thing it shows
is<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.730> Wii<00:02:57.060> U<00:02:57.209> gamepad<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:58.140> no<00:02:58.380> idea

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
is the Wii U gamepad so I have no idea

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.370 
is the Wii U gamepad so I have no idea
if<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.730> actually<00:02:59.910> works<00:03:00.390> with<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.720> pro

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
if it actually works with the pro

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.860 
if it actually works with the pro
controller<00:03:01.800> or<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:03.330> know<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.630> can<00:03:03.750> use

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
controller or you know if you can use

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
controller or you know if you can use
anything<00:03:04.050> else<00:03:04.290> with<00:03:04.650> it

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
anything else with it

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.580 
anything else with it
I'm<00:03:05.880> gonna<00:03:06.120> guess<00:03:06.450> since<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:07.140> has<00:03:07.320> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
I'm gonna guess since it just has the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.890 
I'm gonna guess since it just has the
the<00:03:08.280> Wii<00:03:08.430> U<00:03:08.580> gamepad<00:03:09.120> it's<00:03:09.300> probably<00:03:09.720> just

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the Wii U gamepad it's probably just

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.380 
the Wii U gamepad it's probably just
that<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:11.130> let's<00:03:11.459> go<00:03:11.580> ahead<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.850> open<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:12.150> bad

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
that so let's go ahead and open a bad

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.740 
that so let's go ahead and open a bad
boy<00:03:12.600> up<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:15.650> these<00:03:16.650> are<00:03:16.830> pre-cut<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:18.299> never

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
boy up and these are pre-cut it's never

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.210 
boy up and these are pre-cut it's never
this<00:03:18.959> easier<00:03:19.380> open<00:03:19.890> up<00:03:20.060> open<00:03:21.060> up<00:03:22.010> wrapping<00:03:23.010> and

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
this easier open up open up wrapping and

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.210 
this easier open up open up wrapping and
things<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.700> nature<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.090> that's<00:03:25.049> cool<00:03:25.380> to

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
things of that nature so that's cool to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.400 
things of that nature so that's cool to
the<00:03:26.340> side<00:03:26.610> pretty<00:03:27.600> sure<00:03:27.780> there's<00:03:27.930> no<00:03:28.080> clothes

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410
