00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.730 
this is the new tain Street flex coil
over<00:00:16.369> specific<00:00:16.850> for<00:00:17.029> the<00:00:17.119> BRZ<00:00:17.480> and<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:18.199> FRS

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
over specific for the BRZ and the FRS

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.470 
over specific for the BRZ and the FRS
and<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:18.980> reason<00:00:19.250> I'm<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:19.550> excited<00:00:19.580> is<00:00:20.180> because

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
I actually installed these on our own

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.840 
I actually installed these on our own
BRZ<00:00:22.939> and<00:00:23.060> I<00:00:23.150> absolutely<00:00:23.590> love<00:00:24.590> them<00:00:24.800> first<00:00:25.730> of

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
BRZ and I absolutely love them first of

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.609 
BRZ and I absolutely love them first of
all<00:00:25.880> let's<00:00:26.420> get<00:00:26.510> a<00:00:26.570> general<00:00:26.930> overview<00:00:27.050> of<00:00:27.439> the

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
all let's get a general overview of the

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.950 
all let's get a general overview of the
coil<00:00:28.130> over<00:00:28.400> itself<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.420> components

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
coil over itself and the components

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.599 
coil over itself and the components
basically<00:00:30.470> what<00:00:30.680> makes<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:31.070> different<00:00:31.550> this

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
basically what makes this different this

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.759 
basically what makes this different this
new<00:00:31.760> straight<00:00:32.059> Street<00:00:32.539> flex<00:00:32.839> coil<00:00:33.530> over<00:00:33.739> kit

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
new straight Street flex coil over kit

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:35.500 
new straight Street flex coil over kit
different<00:00:34.219> than<00:00:34.339> the<00:00:34.429> old<00:00:34.460> flex<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.120> first<00:00:35.359> of

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
different than the old flex so first of

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.020 
different than the old flex so first of
all<00:00:35.600> what<00:00:36.440> I<00:00:36.469> noticed<00:00:37.039> the<00:00:37.219> most<00:00:37.249> was<00:00:37.729> the<00:00:37.879> new

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
all what I noticed the most was the new

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.509 
all what I noticed the most was the new
advanced<00:00:38.389> needle<00:00:38.809> technology<00:00:39.499> that<00:00:40.219> Tanner's

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
advanced needle technology that Tanner's

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.489 
advanced needle technology that Tanner's
put<00:00:40.699> into<00:00:40.940> this<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:41.389> tain<00:00:41.780> says<00:00:41.989> you<00:00:42.139> get<00:00:42.289> a

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:42.499 
put into this and tain says you get a

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:45.819 
put into this and tain says you get a
200%<00:00:43.339> wider<00:00:43.699> range<00:00:44.030> of<00:00:44.179> adjustment<00:00:44.620> with<00:00:45.620> this

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
200% wider range of adjustment with this

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.319 
200% wider range of adjustment with this
and<00:00:45.979> you<00:00:46.039> still<00:00:46.219> get<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.489> 16<00:00:46.909> clicks<00:00:47.179> of

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
and you still get the 16 clicks of

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.569 
and you still get the 16 clicks of
adjustment<00:00:47.749> which<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.019> nice<00:00:48.249> and<00:00:49.249> of<00:00:49.370> course

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
adjustment which is nice and of course

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.910 
adjustment which is nice and of course
it<00:00:49.729> does<00:00:49.909> adjust<00:00:50.389> both<00:00:50.719> rebound<00:00:51.679> and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
it does adjust both rebound and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.559 
it does adjust both rebound and
compression<00:00:52.519> in<00:00:52.609> one<00:00:52.850> click<00:00:53.089> which<00:00:53.239> is<00:00:53.389> great

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:53.569 
compression in one click which is great

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:55.149 
compression in one click which is great
for<00:00:53.839> people<00:00:54.139> like<00:00:54.319> me<00:00:54.530> who<00:00:54.649> want<00:00:54.979> the

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
for people like me who want the

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:56.829 
for people like me who want the
adjustment<00:00:55.819> but<00:00:56.239> they<00:00:56.329> don't<00:00:56.539> want<00:00:56.719> that

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
adjustment but they don't want that

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.660 
adjustment but they don't want that
independent<00:00:57.589> adjustment<00:00:58.010> which<00:00:58.219> is<00:00:58.369> just<00:00:58.579> in

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
independent adjustment which is just in

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.269 
independent adjustment which is just in
my<00:00:58.760> opinion<00:00:59.119> way<00:00:59.359> over<00:00:59.719> my<00:00:59.869> head<00:00:59.979> so<00:01:00.979> it's<00:01:01.129> nice

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:01.279 
my opinion way over my head so it's nice

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:03.129 
my opinion way over my head so it's nice
that<00:01:01.309> you<00:01:01.609> get<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:02.239> you<00:01:02.479> know<00:01:02.659> compression

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:03.139 
that you get that you know compression

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.319 
that you get that you know compression
and<00:01:03.260> rebound<00:01:03.440> in<00:01:03.829> one<00:01:04.100> click<00:01:04.670> like<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:05.180> and

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
and rebound in one click like that and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.359 
and rebound in one click like that and
the<00:01:05.390> other<00:01:05.509> thing<00:01:05.780> is<00:01:05.930> how<00:01:06.200> good<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:06.920> feels

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
the other thing is how good that feels

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.060 
the other thing is how good that feels
when<00:01:07.969> you<00:01:08.090> click<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.990> can<00:01:09.140> actually<00:01:09.469> tell

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
when you click it you can actually tell

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.099 
when you click it you can actually tell
how<00:01:10.609> many<00:01:10.850> clicks<00:01:11.149> you're<00:01:11.539> giving<00:01:11.869> it<00:01:11.990> which

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
how many clicks you're giving it which

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:13.870 
how many clicks you're giving it which
is<00:01:12.259> just<00:01:12.469> again<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.770> nice<00:01:13.070> little<00:01:13.310> feature<00:01:13.549> tane

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
is just again a nice little feature tane

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.330 
is just again a nice little feature tane
is<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.320> really<00:01:15.320> kind<00:01:15.439> of<00:01:15.530> gone<00:01:15.679> all<00:01:15.920> out<00:01:16.100> on<00:01:16.250> this

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
is a really kind of gone all out on this

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.700 
is a really kind of gone all out on this
coil<00:01:16.609> over<00:01:16.850> kit<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.299> let's<00:01:17.990> go<00:01:18.259> over<00:01:18.439> I<00:01:18.469> guess

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
coil over kit and let's go over I guess

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.529 
coil over kit and let's go over I guess
the<00:01:19.009> other<00:01:19.130> parts<00:01:19.460> in<00:01:19.579> it<00:01:19.609> so<00:01:19.880> other<00:01:20.329> thing

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
the other parts in it so other thing

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.139 
the other parts in it so other thing
that's<00:01:20.659> new<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:20.990> seal<00:01:21.590> in<00:01:21.829> internally<00:01:22.700> which

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
that's new is a seal in internally which

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.459 
that's new is a seal in internally which
is<00:01:23.299> going<00:01:23.509> to<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:23.780> really<00:01:23.990> increase<00:01:24.320> on

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
is going to just really increase on

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.770 
is going to just really increase on
jeopardy<00:01:24.939> reliability<00:01:25.939> extend<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.479> service

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
jeopardy reliability extend the service

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.959 
jeopardy reliability extend the service
life<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.409> coil<00:01:27.649> over<00:01:28.009> which<00:01:28.670> is<00:01:28.820> always

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
life of the coil over which is always

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.249 
life of the coil over which is always
really<00:01:29.240> nice<00:01:29.359> especially<00:01:29.659> when<00:01:29.869> you<00:01:29.990> spend

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
really nice especially when you spend

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.590 
really nice especially when you spend
that<00:01:30.530> much<00:01:30.590> money<00:01:30.950> on<00:01:31.039> a<00:01:31.159> coil<00:01:31.399> over<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:32.450> want

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
that much money on a coil over you want

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.149 
that much money on a coil over you want
to<00:01:32.630> be<00:01:32.719> able<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.960> get<00:01:33.109> quite<00:01:33.439> a<00:01:33.469> few<00:01:33.560> miles<00:01:33.890> out

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
to be able to get quite a few miles out

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.370 
to be able to get quite a few miles out
of<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:35.210> should<00:01:35.450> be<00:01:35.570> no<00:01:35.780> problem<00:01:36.229> with

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
of it and that should be no problem with

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.709 
of it and that should be no problem with
this<00:01:36.530> because<00:01:36.850> cane<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:37.969> on<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.270> extra<00:01:38.570> mile

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
this because cane is on the extra mile

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.359 
this because cane is on the extra mile
and<00:01:38.899> give<00:01:39.140> you<00:01:39.259> basically<00:01:39.740> rust<00:01:40.130> and

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
and give you basically rust and

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.459 
and give you basically rust and
corrosion<00:01:40.670> protection<00:01:40.999> so<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:42.020> get<00:01:42.200> some

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
corrosion protection so you get some

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.200 
corrosion protection so you get some
really<00:01:42.740> heavy-duty<00:01:43.219> I<00:01:43.520> think<00:01:43.729> they<00:01:43.819> do<00:01:44.030> like

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
really heavy-duty I think they do like

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.599 
really heavy-duty I think they do like
two<00:01:44.390> layers<00:01:44.569> of<00:01:44.749> powder<00:01:45.259> coating<00:01:45.590> on<00:01:46.429> the

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
two layers of powder coating on the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.550 
two layers of powder coating on the
actual<00:01:46.969> body<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.359> the<00:01:47.509> coil<00:01:47.719> over<00:01:47.960> itself<00:01:48.289> and

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
actual body of the coil over itself and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.859 
actual body of the coil over itself and
then<00:01:48.890> here<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:49.490> have<00:01:49.520> what's<00:01:49.909> called<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.240> z2

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
then here you have what's called a z2

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.349 
then here you have what's called a z2
coating<00:01:51.439> now<00:01:51.950> when<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.159> first<00:01:52.429> touch<00:01:52.789> this<00:01:53.060> it's

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
coating now when I first touch this it's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.569 
coating now when I first touch this it's
still<00:01:53.689> slick<00:01:54.229> like<00:01:54.560> Teflon<00:01:54.859> but<00:01:55.369> it<00:01:55.490> is

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
still slick like Teflon but it is

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.419 
still slick like Teflon but it is
incredibly<00:01:56.649> hard<00:01:57.649> it's<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.009> very<00:01:58.219> hard

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
incredibly hard it's a very hard

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.219 
incredibly hard it's a very hard
material<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.179> it's<00:01:59.299> kind<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.539> funny

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
material and so it's kind of funny

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.260 
material and so it's kind of funny
feeling<00:02:00.859> to<00:02:01.039> me<00:02:01.189> but<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:01.429> really<00:02:01.759> like<00:02:01.939> it<00:02:02.149> and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
feeling to me but I really like it and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.160 
feeling to me but I really like it and
Payne<00:02:02.899> says<00:02:03.139> this<00:02:03.289> is<00:02:03.439> a<00:02:03.880> fluorine<00:02:04.929> resin<00:02:05.929> type

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
Payne says this is a fluorine resin type

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.989 
Payne says this is a fluorine resin type
coating<00:02:06.590> but<00:02:06.799> basically<00:02:07.189> all<00:02:07.460> i<00:02:07.490> care<00:02:07.850> is<00:02:07.880> that

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
coating but basically all i care is that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.160 
coating but basically all i care is that
it's<00:02:08.209> nice<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.450> slick<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.530> smooth

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
it's nice and slick and smooth

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.080 
it's nice and slick and smooth
and<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.890> even<00:02:11.100> when<00:02:11.400> you've<00:02:11.520> got<00:02:11.670> some<00:02:11.880> miles

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
and so even when you've got some miles

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.640 
and so even when you've got some miles
on<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.780> had<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> chance<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> go<00:02:13.440> drive

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
on it like I had a chance to go drive

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.620 
on it like I had a chance to go drive
through<00:02:13.860> salt<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.520> snow<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.970> crud<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.390> grind

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
through salt and snow and crud and grind

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.059 
through salt and snow and crud and grind
and<00:02:15.780> stuff<00:02:15.930> like<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.260> came<00:02:16.560> back<00:02:16.709> in<00:02:16.890> to

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
and stuff like that came back in to

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.160 
and stuff like that came back in to
adjust<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.760> everything<00:02:18.390> was<00:02:18.569> literally

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
adjust it and everything was literally

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.900 
adjust it and everything was literally
smooth<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.950> was<00:02:20.130> right<00:02:20.430> out<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> box

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
smooth like it was right out of the box

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.050 
smooth like it was right out of the box
which<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.270> was<00:02:21.360> really<00:02:21.480> impressed<00:02:21.930> with<00:02:22.020> um

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
which I was really impressed with um

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.790 
which I was really impressed with um
install<00:02:24.060> wise<00:02:24.300> on<00:02:24.510> these<00:02:24.660> exactly<00:02:25.319> like<00:02:25.470> stock

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
install wise on these exactly like stock

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.730 
install wise on these exactly like stock
which<00:02:26.040> was<00:02:26.280> really<00:02:26.910> easy<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.140> guess<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.530> should

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
which was really easy I guess I should

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.140 
which was really easy I guess I should
say<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.100> best<00:02:29.280> way<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.459> put<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.850> literally

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
say the best way to put that literally

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.630 
say the best way to put that literally
took<00:02:30.360> me<00:02:30.540> about<00:02:30.660> two<00:02:30.900> hours<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:32.160> install<00:02:32.310> these

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
took me about two hours to install these

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.800 
took me about two hours to install these
which<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.910> nice<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.209> one<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.450> reasons<00:02:33.750> for

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
which is nice and one of the reasons for

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.350 
which is nice and one of the reasons for
that<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.260> fact<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.800> get<00:02:35.100> om<00:02:36.060> type

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
that is the fact that you get om type

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.750 
that is the fact that you get om type
brackets<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.590> everything<00:02:38.010> bolts<00:02:38.280> up<00:02:38.400> just

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
brackets and so everything bolts up just

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.250 
brackets and so everything bolts up just
like<00:02:38.880> stock<00:02:39.209> you've<00:02:39.420> got<00:02:39.569> your<00:02:39.690> abs<00:02:40.020> lines

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
like stock you've got your abs lines

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.630 
like stock you've got your abs lines
your<00:02:40.470> brake<00:02:40.680> lines<00:02:40.890> everything<00:02:41.310> goes<00:02:41.459> in

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
your brake lines everything goes in

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.400 
your brake lines everything goes in
literally<00:02:42.270> just<00:02:42.540> like<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> stock<00:02:42.989> strut<00:02:43.260> came

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
literally just like the stock strut came

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.750 
literally just like the stock strut came
off<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.830> because<00:02:44.040> you're<00:02:44.160> not<00:02:44.190> swapping<00:02:44.670> over

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
off and because you're not swapping over

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.790 
off and because you're not swapping over
top<00:02:45.060> hats<00:02:45.300> or<00:02:45.480> anything<00:02:45.660> like<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.620> just

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
top hats or anything like that you just

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.350 
top hats or anything like that you just
take<00:02:46.920> off<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.190> old<00:02:47.340> one<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.670> install<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.239> new

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
take off the old one and install the new

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.500 
take off the old one and install the new
one<00:02:48.480> now<00:02:48.810> couple<00:02:49.440> nice<00:02:49.560> features<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.160> this

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
one now couple nice features of this

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.180 
one now couple nice features of this

preload<00:02:53.580> adjustment<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.600> means<00:02:54.900> that

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
preload adjustment so that means that

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.900 
preload adjustment so that means that

you can actually spin this whole unit up

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.930 
you can actually spin this whole unit up
here<00:03:01.070> without<00:03:02.070> messing<00:03:02.310> with<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.610> spring

preload but if you do want to mess with
the<00:03:04.620> spring<00:03:04.860> preload<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.640> adjust<00:03:05.970> these

the spring preload you adjust these

that<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.040> get<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.310> independent<00:03:09.090> -<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.530> my

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
that you get that independent - in my

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.259 
that you get that independent - in my
opinion<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.100> think<00:03:11.130> that's<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.640> very<00:03:12.120> good

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
opinion I think that's a very good

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.259 
opinion I think that's a very good
feature<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:13.230> couple<00:03:13.680> other<00:03:13.800> things<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.430> camber

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
feature a couple other things is camber

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.470 
feature a couple other things is camber
adjustments<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.100> basically<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.549> flex<00:03:17.820> or<00:03:18.450> I

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
adjustments so basically the flex or I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.090 
adjustments so basically the flex or I
guess<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.989> should<00:03:19.170> say<00:03:19.290> both<00:03:19.470> deflect<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:19.920> and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
guess I should say both deflect it and

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.830 
guess I should say both deflect it and
the<00:03:20.220> street<00:03:20.430> flex<00:03:20.640> get<00:03:20.880> give<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.390> two<00:03:21.630> types

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
the street flex get give you two types

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.150 
the street flex get give you two types
of<00:03:21.989> camber<00:03:22.320> adjustment<00:03:22.350> you've<00:03:22.860> got<00:03:23.010> your

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
of camber adjustment you've got your

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.270 
of camber adjustment you've got your
pillow<00:03:23.400> ball<00:03:23.660> camber<00:03:24.660> adjusting<00:03:25.019> top<00:03:25.829> hats<00:03:26.100> up

on<00:03:26.579> top<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.450> course<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:27.840> loosen

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
on top and of course you just loosen

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.350 
on top and of course you just loosen
those<00:03:28.350> up<00:03:28.530> use<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.220> top<00:03:29.370> half<00:03:29.579> around<00:03:30.120> and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
those up use the top half around and

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.819 
those up use the top half around and
there<00:03:30.870> you've<00:03:31.200> got<00:03:31.230> your<00:03:31.380> camber<00:03:31.799> adjustment

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
there you've got your camber adjustment

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.199 
there you've got your camber adjustment
which<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.340> nice<00:03:32.610> because<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.000> adjust

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
which is nice because you can adjust

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.900 
which is nice because you can adjust
this<00:03:33.570> out<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.560> track<00:03:34.829> very<00:03:35.220> easily<00:03:35.549> and

this out of the track very easily and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.520 
this out of the track very easily and
then<00:03:36.360> for<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.600> little<00:03:36.750> bit<00:03:36.840> more<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.110> guess<00:03:37.380> I

then for a little bit more I guess I

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.500 
then for a little bit more I guess I
