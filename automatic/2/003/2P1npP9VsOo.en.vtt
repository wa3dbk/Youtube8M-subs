00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
mean I wear very little makeup to begin

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.039 
mean I wear very little makeup to begin
with<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.290> can<00:02:33.830> even<00:02:34.340> wear<00:02:34.940> less<00:02:35.299> now<00:02:35.629> my

with and I can even wear less now my
fine<00:02:36.799> lines<00:02:37.129> are<00:02:37.640> smoother<00:02:38.860> my<00:02:39.860> pavement

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
fine lines are smoother my pavement

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.860

difference<00:02:41.030> which<00:02:41.269> was<00:02:41.450> one<00:02:41.569> of<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:41.690> main

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
difference which was one of the main

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.990 
difference which was one of the main
reasons<00:02:42.379> I<00:02:42.560> chose<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:43.250> do<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.579> in<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.760> first

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000
