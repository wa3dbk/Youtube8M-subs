for you guys as well it's left me with
more<00:00:25.550> questions<00:00:25.759> than<00:00:26.359> answers<00:00:26.929> because<00:00:27.140> it

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
more questions than answers because it

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.529 
more questions than answers because it
is<00:00:27.829> a<00:00:27.859> really<00:00:28.249> really<00:00:28.399> mystifying<00:00:29.210> trailer

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
is a really really mystifying trailer

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.109 
is a really really mystifying trailer
basically<00:00:30.319> it<00:00:30.949> looks<00:00:31.279> like<00:00:31.460> it's<00:00:31.609> going<00:00:31.759> over

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
basically it looks like it's going over

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.450 
basically it looks like it's going over
most<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.230> previous<00:00:33.680> maps<00:00:34.010> from<00:00:34.280> the

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
most of the previous maps from the

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.220 
most of the previous maps from the
previous<00:00:34.880> zombies<00:00:35.240> maps<00:00:35.450> anyway<00:00:35.810> in<00:00:36.020> this

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
previous zombies maps anyway in this

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.990 
previous zombies maps anyway in this
first<00:00:36.470> segment<00:00:36.770> of<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.190> trailer<00:00:37.430> shown<00:00:37.760> you

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
first segment of the trailer shown you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.910 
first segment of the trailer shown you
and<00:00:38.240> what<00:00:38.390> we've<00:00:38.510> seen<00:00:38.690> in<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:38.930> past<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:39.560> then

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
and what we've seen in the past and then

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.700 
and what we've seen in the past and then
it<00:00:40.040> goes<00:00:40.250> on<00:00:40.280> in<00:00:40.700> a<00:00:40.820> minute<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:41.630> show<00:00:41.930> something

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
it goes on in a minute to show something

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.850 
it goes on in a minute to show something
like<00:00:43.330> what<00:00:44.330> could<00:00:44.540> be<00:00:44.720> in<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.080> future<00:00:45.560> it<00:00:45.650> says

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
like what could be in the future it says

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.950 
like what could be in the future it says
and<00:00:46.430> every<00:00:46.760> story<00:00:47.030> has<00:00:47.090> an<00:00:47.330> ending<00:00:47.480> I<00:00:47.780> think

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
and every story has an ending I think

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.170 
and every story has an ending I think
like<00:00:48.080> that<00:00:48.260> maybe<00:00:48.890> I<00:00:49.070> don't<00:00:49.280> know<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:49.580> really

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
like that maybe I don't know I really

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.180 
like that maybe I don't know I really
hope<00:00:50.390> this<00:00:50.540> isn't<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:50.900> case<00:00:51.110> but<00:00:51.680> I<00:00:51.740> really

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
hope this isn't the case but I really

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.640 
hope this isn't the case but I really
hope<00:00:52.340> they<00:00:52.790> don't<00:00:53.300> end<00:00:53.660> Zombies<00:00:54.140> mode<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:54.560> it

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
hope they don't end Zombies mode but it

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.280 
hope they don't end Zombies mode but it
looks<00:00:54.890> like<00:00:55.250> maybe<00:00:56.030> they're<00:00:56.450> hinting<00:00:56.720> in<00:00:57.110> this

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
looks like maybe they're hinting in this

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.319 
looks like maybe they're hinting in this
trailer<00:00:57.560> that<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:57.920> next<00:00:58.520> zombies<00:00:59.000> piece<00:00:59.210> of

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
trailer that the next zombies piece of

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.470 
trailer that the next zombies piece of
DLC<00:00:59.780> may<00:01:00.320> be<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:00.650> last<00:01:00.829> zombies<00:01:01.370> map<00:01:01.550> ever<00:01:01.940> I

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
DLC may be the last zombies map ever I

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.090 
DLC may be the last zombies map ever I
don't<00:01:02.870> really<00:01:03.140> know<00:01:03.320> but<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.530> really<00:01:03.860> really

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
don't really know but I really really

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.349 
don't really know but I really really
hope<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:04.399> it<00:01:04.519> isn't<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.850> case<00:01:04.969> as<00:01:05.119> you<00:01:05.239> can

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:05.359 
hope that it isn't the case as you can

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:07.480 
hope that it isn't the case as you can
see<00:01:05.509> right<00:01:05.539> now<00:01:05.719> says<00:01:06.409> that<00:01:06.799> every<00:01:06.979> story<00:01:07.280> has

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
see right now says that every story has

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.660

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.730 
lots of you've got loads of ideas about
what<00:01:32.509> some<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:32.990> stuff<00:01:33.229> could<00:01:33.380> mean<00:01:33.560> we've

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
what some of this stuff could mean we've

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.499 
what some of this stuff could mean we've
seen<00:01:33.889> robots<00:01:34.130> we've<00:01:34.520> seen<00:01:34.670> original<00:01:35.179> cast

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
seen robots we've seen original cast

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.899 
seen robots we've seen original cast
we've<00:01:35.719> seen<00:01:35.929> er<00:01:36.109> Rezanov<00:01:37.039> in<00:01:37.219> there<00:01:37.490> without

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
we've seen er Rezanov in there without

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.580 
we've seen er Rezanov in there without
say<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.270> original<00:01:38.630> crack<00:01:38.840> cast<00:01:39.139> it<00:01:39.380> looks

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
say the original crack cast it looks

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.949 
say the original crack cast it looks
like<00:01:39.859> they<00:01:40.009> may<00:01:40.159> be<00:01:40.219> a<00:01:40.310> younger<00:01:40.909> original<00:01:41.719> cast

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
like they may be a younger original cast

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.269 
like they may be a younger original cast
because<00:01:42.109> they<00:01:42.350> don't<00:01:42.499> look<00:01:42.590> exactly<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.159> same

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:43.279 
because they don't look exactly the same

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:45.190 
because they don't look exactly the same
so<00:01:43.819> there<00:01:44.029> might<00:01:44.119> be<00:01:44.179> younger<00:01:44.479> they<00:01:44.719> might<00:01:44.899> be

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
so there might be younger they might be

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.629 
so there might be younger they might be
different<00:01:45.469> characters<00:01:46.009> all<00:01:46.130> together<00:01:46.279> but

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
different characters all together but

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.370 
different characters all together but
what<00:01:47.029> do<00:01:47.119> you<00:01:47.209> guys<00:01:47.359> think<00:01:47.420> its<00:01:47.810> origins<00:01:48.229> the
