00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
isn't the greatest die rise gameplay but

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.040 
isn't the greatest die rise gameplay but
I<00:00:34.980> felt<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.460> made<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> nice<00:00:35.940> recovery<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.840> chose

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
I felt I made a nice recovery and chose

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.889 
I felt I made a nice recovery and chose
a<00:00:37.079> role<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.829> also<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.640> shows<00:00:39.059> how<00:00:39.329> chaotic

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
a role with it also it shows how chaotic

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.869 
a role with it also it shows how chaotic
this<00:00:40.050> map<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> that's<00:00:41.430> part<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
this map can get and that's part of the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549 
this map can get and that's part of the
reason<00:00:42.149> why<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> really<00:00:42.719> enjoyed<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.260> map

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
reason why I really enjoyed this map

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.000 
reason why I really enjoyed this map
without<00:00:44.219> further<00:00:44.460> ado<00:00:44.910> let's<00:00:45.539> begin<00:00:45.780> step<00:00:46.739> one

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
without further ado let's begin step one

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.950 
without further ado let's begin step one
to<00:00:47.160> improving<00:00:47.550> die<00:00:47.820> rise<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.329> my<00:00:48.480> opinion

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
to improving die rise in my opinion

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.630 
to improving die rise in my opinion
would<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.260> make<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> trample<00:00:49.860> seem<00:00:50.039> easier<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
would to make the trample seem easier to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.080 
would to make the trample seem easier to
build

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
build

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.060 
build
I<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.750> trample<00:00:52.230> steam<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.680> multiplayer

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
I like the trample steam and multiplayer

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.160 
I like the trample steam and multiplayer
it<00:00:53.550> creates<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.090> teamwork<00:00:54.360> aspect<00:00:54.719> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
it creates a teamwork aspect that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.959 
it creates a teamwork aspect that
requires<00:00:55.530> everybody<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.610> parts

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
requires everybody to get the parts

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.180 
requires everybody to get the parts
although<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.480> solo<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.289> pain<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> ass

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
although in solo it is a pain in the ass

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.099 
although in solo it is a pain in the ass
to<00:00:59.489> build<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.270> champ<00:01:00.510> will<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.719> makes<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
to build the champ will see makes the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.840 
to build the champ will see makes the
map<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.440> million<00:01:01.859> times<00:01:02.129> better<00:01:02.340> creating<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
map a million times better creating a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
map a million times better creating a
skill<00:01:03.090> gap<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.780> lots<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.229> hidden<00:01:04.470> secrets

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
skill gap and lots of hidden secrets

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.260 
skill gap and lots of hidden secrets
that<00:01:04.979> allow<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.369> better<00:01:05.610> navigate<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that allow you to better navigate the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.800 
that allow you to better navigate the
map

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
map

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.990 
map
it<00:01:07.020> makes<00:01:07.439> smarter<00:01:08.010> players<00:01:08.310> better<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
it makes smarter players better and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700 
it makes smarter players better and
that's<00:01:09.150> why<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.540> enjoy<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.110> although

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that's why I really enjoy it although

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
that's why I really enjoy it although
it's<00:01:11.070> quite<00:01:11.250> annoying<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.000> build<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.420> solo

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it's quite annoying to build in solo

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.200 
it's quite annoying to build in solo
who's<00:01:13.229> gonna<00:01:13.500> want<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> build<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.430> say<00:01:15.030> we

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
who's gonna want to build it I say we

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.999 
who's gonna want to build it I say we
make<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> trampoline<00:01:15.960> easier<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> build<00:01:16.740> so

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
make the trampoline easier to build so

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
make the trampoline easier to build so
that<00:01:17.159> solo<00:01:17.520> players<00:01:17.790> don't<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.080> wait

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that solo players don't have to wait

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.530 
that solo players don't have to wait
hours<00:01:19.830> lugging<00:01:20.280> around<00:01:20.400> parts<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.420> they

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
hours lugging around parts just so they

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.600 
hours lugging around parts just so they
can<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.750> trample<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.290> moving<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> next

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
can have trample so moving on the next

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.969 
can have trample so moving on the next
idea<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.150> improve<00:01:24.270> die<00:01:24.720> rise<00:01:24.990> would<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
idea to improve die rise would be to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.219 
idea to improve die rise would be to
create<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.400> less<00:01:26.909> glitchy<00:01:27.240> who's<00:01:27.689> who

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
create a less glitchy who's who

100<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.520> ridiculous<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> leaderboard

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
100 it's ridiculous that the leaderboard

is flooded with all these glitches and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.810 
is flooded with all these glitches and
it's<00:02:24.570> such<00:02:24.870> an<00:02:25.170> easy<00:02:25.290> glitch<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.190> well<00:02:26.460> known

it's such an easy glitch and well known

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.330 
it's such an easy glitch and well known
then<00:02:27.480> nobody<00:02:27.960> really<00:02:28.290> complains<00:02:28.740> about<00:02:28.980> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
then nobody really complains about it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.520 
then nobody really complains about it
like<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:29.850> should<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:30.540> somebody<00:02:30.990> were<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> sit

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
like we should if somebody were to sit

like we should if somebody were to sit
in<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.860> wall<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.430> Lutron<00:02:32.880> 100<00:02:33.360> everybody<00:02:33.720> would

in a wall in Lutron 100 everybody would
be<00:02:33.990> furious<00:02:34.320> but<00:02:34.560> because<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.040> how<00:02:35.160> easy<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.970> to

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
be furious but because of how easy is to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.910 
be furious but because of how easy is to
produce<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:37.410> don't<00:02:37.590> see<00:02:37.710> as<00:02:37.800> much

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
produce you don't see as much

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.010 
produce you don't see as much
complaining<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.670> don't<00:02:38.820> like<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.480> feel<00:02:39.870> it

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
complaining I don't like this I feel it

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.840 
complaining I don't like this I feel it
ruins<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.530> leaderboards<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.280> I'd<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:41.820> a

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
ruins the leaderboards and I'd like a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.820 
ruins the leaderboards and I'd like a
map<00:02:42.180> where<00:02:42.600> people<00:02:42.870> actually<00:02:43.080> have<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.530> earn

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
map where people actually have to earn

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.610 
map where people actually have to earn
their<00:02:44.040> spot<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:44.400> top<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.030> leaderboards

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
their spot on top of the leaderboards

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.590 
their spot on top of the leaderboards
step<00:02:46.620> forward<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.250> fixing<00:02:47.640> die<00:02:47.850> rise<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.360> to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
step forward to fixing die rise is to

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.110 
step forward to fixing die rise is to
nuke<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.050> dang<00:02:49.320> Bank<00:02:49.709> take<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.340> bank<00:02:50.700> to

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
nuke that dang Bank take the bank to

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.060 
nuke that dang Bank take the bank to
thank<00:02:51.360> room<00:02:51.660> zombies<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.320> my<00:02:52.500> opinion<00:02:52.920> and

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
thank room zombies in my opinion and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.670 
thank room zombies in my opinion and
then<00:02:53.190> we<00:02:53.340> need<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.670> get<00:02:53.850> rid<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:55.440> fifth

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
then we need to get rid of it the fifth

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.590 
then we need to get rid of it the fifth
and<00:02:55.860> final<00:02:56.190> step<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.640> improving<00:02:57.030> die<00:02:57.330> rise

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
and final step to improving die rise

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.270 
and final step to improving die rise
would<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.140> explore<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.770> sweatshop

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
would be to explore the sweatshop

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.430 
would be to explore the sweatshop
building<00:02:59.670> with<00:03:00.030> only<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.390> top<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.870> bottom

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
building with only the top and bottom
