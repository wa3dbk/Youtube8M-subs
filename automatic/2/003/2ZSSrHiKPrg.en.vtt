00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.760 
modifications to fsx scenery library
that<00:00:13.200> will<00:00:13.410> guarantee<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:15.470> increase<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.710> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
that will guarantee a increase in a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.510 
that will guarantee a increase in a
couple<00:00:17.130> frames<00:00:18.439> so<00:00:19.439> first<00:00:19.980> off<00:00:20.189> you're<00:00:20.400> going

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
couple frames so first off you're going

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.130 
couple frames so first off you're going
to<00:00:20.580> start<00:00:20.820> by<00:00:20.970> opening<00:00:21.000> your<00:00:21.449> flightsim<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
to start by opening your flightsim and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.970 
to start by opening your flightsim and
going<00:00:22.320> into<00:00:22.410> settings<00:00:24.289> then<00:00:25.289> you're<00:00:25.830> going<00:00:25.920> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
going into settings then you're going to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.029 
going into settings then you're going to
go<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.130> your<00:00:26.310> scenery<00:00:26.580> library<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:28.710> once<00:00:28.920> you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
go to your scenery library and once you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.259 
go to your scenery library and once you
open<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.429> senior<00:00:29.640> library<00:00:29.939> you're<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.210> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
open your senior library you're going to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.650 
open your senior library you're going to
see<00:00:30.480> all<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.869> continents<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.679> regions<00:00:32.660> and

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
maybe all the other senior you installed

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.190 
maybe all the other senior you installed
and<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.829> gonna<00:00:37.920> uncheck<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.750> don't

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and so you're gonna uncheck just don't

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.920 
and so you're gonna uncheck just don't
delete<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.500> uncheck<00:00:40.890> all<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.879> scenery<00:00:42.660> that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
delete just uncheck all the scenery that

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
doing this one you should also get game

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.870 
doing this one you should also get game
