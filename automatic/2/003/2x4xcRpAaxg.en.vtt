 I hope bumper frame case Uikakko of aluminum 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:22.160
 Moreover, it is a red of an iron plate 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.670
 There is one feature in this bumper case do it do not need is what tools for mounting 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:30.349

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.980
 It can be fixed only by this presentation without 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.280
 Or serious 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.340
 The 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.840
 It now a little because the way mounting special instead of do not need is but it is a great tool 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.680
 I will explain 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.820
 Yes it looks like it's out of the package 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.530
 It is divided into a frame part and a back panel part 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.340
 It is the frame 9 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:01.260
 If there is a nail in the mind of the sleep button 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:09.150
 By thus sliding the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:13.110
 Then the back that I can be resolved here have here is made on the back frame in the entire frame 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:20.590

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:26.020
 Since these six claws are attached , the back panel is extra 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:31.840

 When you want me to be careful, this manner switch is part of the dent on this frame side 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:47.350
 To be true 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:51.060

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.060
