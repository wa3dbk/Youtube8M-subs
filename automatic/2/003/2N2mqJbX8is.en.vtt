00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.440
 For the first time, cotton candy was attempted 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.910
 in Italy back in the 16th century then it 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.730
 delicacy could only afford 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.440
 very rich people Alexander but times 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.389
 changed today cotton candy can 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.190
 allow yourself in general everything 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.590
 and we will now I'm done that to us 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.720
 you will need a trance 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.910
 only sugar is needed 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.410
 just hook sugar right now sugar 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.599
 it is tinted with special food 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.400
 dye harmless harmless 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.019
 absolutely certified just here 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.460
 for this cotton candy machine 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.680
 look there is inside 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.360
 heating element its visible if 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.530
 attack take a closer look I'm here now 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.520
 I fall asleep sugar and when I turn on the machine 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.250
 heating element about melting 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.690
 sugar and it will be liquid 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.430
 fly out of these holes 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.440
 this centrifuge that is when she 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.149
 melted sugar turns under 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.520
 the action of centrifugal force takes off during 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.899
 all parties here, and while he is flying he 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 turns cotton candy 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.070
 Well, it settles on the walls of this trough 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.100
 let me show you straight 1 key from 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.010
 cities we turn on now we turn on 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.630
 heating element and now 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.090
 after a few seconds cotton candy 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.180
 we will begin to form here already 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.799
 if you look closely you can see how she is 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.580
 flies out of the apparatus of elite flies in all 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.229
 side yes then flew you left 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.750
 just take a stick to help 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.560
 wand now I'll show you collect 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.600
 cotton candy 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.619
 so here is rotating the wand around its 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.149
 axis . 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.799
 faster faster faster faster faster 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.420
 here and so cheat you cheat well 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.090
 and you can make a portion of any size 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.859
 how did I get so many 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.450
 talk about the dangers of this sugar 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.819
 delicacy claiming from watts and 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.979
 broken for example in harris maybe 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.049
 if you eat several servings each 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.119
 day but generally in a standard cloud 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.759
 cotton candy contains about 1 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.679
 a teaspoon of sugar a glass of the same tea 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.810
 many add it much more 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.240
 cotton candy can be made in different colors 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.670
 it all depends on the dyes are different 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.959
 dyes different tastes here this one 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.899
 it was written fell tastefully 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:06.810
 preferably not a monastery is it time for us to cherry 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.069
 remind some banana apples i 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.069
 I don't usually use dyes
