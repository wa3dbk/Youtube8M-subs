ring tuning right now if the camera can
see<00:00:12.870> my<00:00:13.080> bolts<00:00:13.410> all<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> way<00:00:13.740> forward<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
see my bolts all the way forward the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.170 
see my bolts all the way forward the
solenoid<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.990> just<00:00:16.199> clicking<00:00:16.940> so<00:00:17.940> I'm<00:00:18.090> gonna

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
solenoid is just clicking so I'm gonna

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.910 
solenoid is just clicking so I'm gonna
start<00:00:18.680> adjusting<00:00:19.680> my<00:00:20.430> lpr<00:00:20.880> out<00:00:21.150> until<00:00:22.820> until<00:00:23.820> I

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
start adjusting my lpr out until until I

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:34.370 
start adjusting my lpr out until until I
tear<00:00:25.920> air<00:00:26.189> getting<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> solenoid<00:00:33.380> don't

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
tear air getting to the solenoid don't

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:48.610 
tear air getting to the solenoid don't
know<00:00:34.530> why<00:00:34.620> you're<00:00:34.770> getting<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.160> solenoid

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.170 

what<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.770> say<00:00:49.950> okay<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.020> this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.230> my<00:00:52.260> zero

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
what you say okay so this is my zero

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.400 
what you say okay so this is my zero
there's<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:56.420> barely<00:00:57.420> air<00:00:57.809> getting<00:00:58.109> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
there's now just barely air getting to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
there's now just barely air getting to
slide<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:02.480> here<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:04.729> one<00:01:05.729> quarter<00:01:06.150> turn<00:01:07.430> my

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
slide so here we go one quarter turn my

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:19.929 
slide so here we go one quarter turn my
bolts<00:01:08.760> halfway<00:01:09.180> back<00:01:17.689> that's<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> quarter<00:01:19.049> turn

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
bolts halfway back that's a quarter turn

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:32.749 
bolts halfway back that's a quarter turn
half<00:01:20.939> turn<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:31.189> three<00:01:32.189> quarters<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
half turn and then three quarters of a

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:59.890 
half turn and then three quarters of a
turn<00:01:45.500> that's<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.619> full<00:01:46.829> turn

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.600 

need<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:00.930> bit<00:02:01.110> more<00:02:03.050> so<00:02:04.070> one<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> quarter

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
need a bit more so one and a quarter

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.850 
need a bit more so one and a quarter
turns<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:09.360> sounds<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:10.020> right<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.730> now<00:02:12.860> we

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
turns that sounds about right so now we

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.190 
turns that sounds about right so now we
got<00:02:14.070> we<00:02:14.610> got<00:02:14.640> pate<00:02:15.530> says<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.800> money<00:02:17.040> now

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
got we got pate says we have money now

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.790 
got we got pate says we have money now
and<00:02:19.490> we<00:02:20.490> have<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> virtue<00:02:21.030> plot<00:02:21.770> courtesy<00:02:22.770> of

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
and we have a virtue plot courtesy of

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.500 
and we have a virtue plot courtesy of
war<00:02:23.340> zone<00:02:23.580> thinking<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.750> Ohio<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:29.450> don't<00:02:30.450> know

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
war zone thinking in Ohio I don't know

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.880 
war zone thinking in Ohio I don't know
if<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.690> camera<00:02:31.020> can<00:02:31.140> see<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.440> clock<00:02:31.650> right

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
if the camera can see the clock right

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:45.580 
if the camera can see the clock right
now<00:02:41.989> okay<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.020> we're<00:02:43.320> not<00:02:43.410> quite<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:43.739> yet

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
now okay so we're not quite there yet

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.740 
now okay so we're not quite there yet
consistency's<00:02:46.590> kind<00:02:46.830> of<00:02:46.890> off<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:48.450> we're<00:02:48.630> going

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
consistency's kind of off so we're going

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.890 
consistency's kind of off so we're going
to<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.320> half<00:02:49.350> times<00:02:50.570> when<00:02:51.570> we're<00:02:51.750> at

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900

to one and a half times when we're at
125<00:02:53.540> now<00:02:55.340> one<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.519> half<00:03:04.549> okay<00:03:05.549> we're<00:03:05.730> at

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
125 now one and a half okay we're at

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.380 
125 now one and a half okay we're at

turns<00:03:10.610> 47<00:03:11.610> degrees<00:03:11.700> Fahrenheit<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:14.120> if<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.299> was

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
turns 47 degrees Fahrenheit so if it was
