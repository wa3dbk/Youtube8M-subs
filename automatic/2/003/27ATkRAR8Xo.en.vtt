in Korea just just raves about it I have
not<00:02:24.390> read<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:25.170> single<00:02:25.710> bad<00:02:25.980> review<00:02:26.010> about

this that it hasn't worked

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.220 
this that it hasn't worked
basically<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.460> just<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.850> mascara<00:02:30.630> fixer<00:02:30.900> but

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
basically it's just a mascara fixer but

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.680 
basically it's just a mascara fixer but
it<00:02:31.320> works<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.710> much<00:02:31.980> better<00:02:32.310> than<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.420> Misha

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
it works so much better than the Misha

Misha one I don't remember but when I
used<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.360> felt<00:02:42.720> like<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.960> wasn't<00:02:43.350> perfect

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
used it I felt like it wasn't perfect

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.730 
used it I felt like it wasn't perfect
but<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.280> one<00:02:44.610> holds<00:02:45.150> your<00:02:45.270> curls<00:02:45.750> like<00:02:46.320> they

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
were like carved out of stone or

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.340 
were like carved out of stone or
something<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.920> once<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.910> brush<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.780> your

edge of house fixer it's from the same

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.660 
edge of house fixer it's from the same

echoes so waterproof gel mascara in
volume<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.840> lash<00:03:28.020> basically<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.160> is<00:03:29.520> a

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
volume and lash basically this is a

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.930 
volume and lash basically this is a
pretty<00:03:30.330> liquidy<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:31.260> very<00:03:32.010> very<00:03:32.489> dark

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
pretty liquidy and very very dark

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.330 
pretty liquidy and very very dark
mascara<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:34.020> has<00:03:34.320> like<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> normal<00:03:35.130> mascara

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
mascara it has like a normal mascara

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.180 
mascara it has like a normal mascara
wand<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.150> formula<00:03:36.660> like<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.320> says<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:37.770> gel

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
wand the formula like it says it's gel

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.280 
wand the formula like it says it's gel
like<00:03:38.970> gel<00:03:39.300> eyeliner<00:03:39.840> gel<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:42.290> super

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
like gel eyeliner gel so it is super

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.770 
like gel eyeliner gel so it is super
clear<00:03:43.680> like<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.190> pitch<00:03:44.610> black<00:03:44.640> first<00:03:45.480> off

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
clear like it's pitch black first off

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.910 
clear like it's pitch black first off
and<00:03:46.550> it<00:03:47.550> does<00:03:47.970> not<00:03:48.300> clump<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.290> much<00:03:49.680> it's

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
and it does not clump that much it's

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.850 
and it does not clump that much it's
it's<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.430> pretty<00:03:50.700> liquidy<00:03:51.030> formula<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.500> it's

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
it's a pretty liquidy formula so it's

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.540 
it's a pretty liquidy formula so it's
light<00:03:53.370> on<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:54.060> lashes<00:03:54.680> however<00:03:55.680> when<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.220> use

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
light on the lashes however when I use

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.900 
light on the lashes however when I use
this<00:03:56.940> on<00:03:57.630> its<00:03:57.959> own<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.530> crumbled<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.370> little<00:03:59.700> bit

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
this on its own it crumbled a little bit

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.410 
this on its own it crumbled a little bit
also<00:04:00.540> another<00:04:01.260> downside<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:02.400> because<00:04:03.239> it's

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
also another downside is because it's

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.070 
also another downside is because it's
gel<00:04:03.900> formula<00:04:04.620> once<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.910> goes<00:04:06.209> on<00:04:06.420> your<00:04:06.600> skin<00:04:06.870> it

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
gel formula once it goes on your skin it

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.790 
gel formula once it goes on your skin it
will<00:04:07.350> not<00:04:07.620> get<00:04:08.370> off<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.750> make<00:04:10.140> sure<00:04:10.170> not<00:04:10.410> to

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
will not get off so make sure not to

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.590 
will not get off so make sure not to
make<00:04:11.160> mistakes<00:04:11.370> when<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.209> apply<00:04:12.540> this

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
make mistakes when you apply this

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
product but besides that it's very very

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.490 
product but besides that it's very very
