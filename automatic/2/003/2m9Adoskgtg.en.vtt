00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
little bit lighter weight holds a little

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.430 
little bit lighter weight holds a little
bit<00:02:28.550> less<00:02:28.820> etc<00:02:29.570> so<00:02:29.750> there<00:02:29.900> are<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:29.990> lot<00:02:30.020> of

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
wide mouth the sportsman does makes it

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.720 
wide mouth the sportsman does makes it
easier<00:02:45.849> to<00:02:45.879> get<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> food<00:02:46.269> in<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.569> out<00:02:46.660> so

easier to get the food in and out so

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.440 
easier to get the food in and out so
definitely<00:02:48.730> start<00:02:48.910> out<00:02:49.000> with<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.150> quality

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
definitely start out with a quality

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.229 
definitely start out with a quality
thermos<00:02:49.840> now<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:51.430> next<00:02:51.730> thing<00:02:51.849> you<00:02:52.000> want<00:02:52.030> to

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
thermos now the next thing you want to

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.600 
thermos now the next thing you want to
do<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.050> want<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.380> pre-heat<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:54.040> thermos

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
do is you want to pre-heat the thermos

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.250 
do is you want to pre-heat the thermos
before<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.090> put<00:02:55.269> any<00:02:55.450> food<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.959> or<00:02:56.050> start

before you put any food in it or start

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.410 
before you put any food in it or start
cooking<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.830> want<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.130> bring<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.880> thermos<00:02:58.239> up

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
cooking you want to bring the thermos up

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.770 
cooking you want to bring the thermos up
to<00:02:58.750> temperature<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.500> reason<00:03:00.370> for<00:03:00.580> that<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.940> if

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
to temperature the reason for that is if

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.479 
to temperature the reason for that is if
your<00:03:02.019> thermos<00:03:02.319> is<00:03:02.470> cold<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.129> pour<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
your thermos is cold and you pour the

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.990 
your thermos is cold and you pour the
boiling<00:03:03.670> water<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.500> well<00:03:05.500> part<00:03:06.370> of<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.580> energy

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
boiling water in well part of the energy

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.610 
boiling water in well part of the energy
and<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.239> boiling<00:03:07.660> water<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:08.110> going<00:03:08.349> to<00:03:08.440> be

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
and that boiling water is going to be

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.160 
and that boiling water is going to be
dissipated<00:03:09.340> just<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.209> heat<00:03:10.420> up<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.750> thermos

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
dissipated just to heat up the thermos

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.850 
dissipated just to heat up the thermos
so<00:03:13.200> definitely<00:03:14.200> want<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.380> pre-heat<00:03:14.680> your

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
so definitely want to pre-heat your

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.949 
so definitely want to pre-heat your
thermos<00:03:15.340> now<00:03:15.489> there's<00:03:15.730> multiple<00:03:16.690> ways<00:03:16.720> of

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
thermos now there's multiple ways of

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.930 
thermos now there's multiple ways of
doing<00:03:17.019> that<00:03:17.319> one<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.680> could<00:03:17.799> just<00:03:18.040> heat<00:03:18.790> up

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
doing that one you could just heat up

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.870 
doing that one you could just heat up
tap<00:03:19.209> water<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.810> put<00:03:20.079> some<00:03:20.519> run<00:03:21.519> some<00:03:21.700> hot

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
tap water and put some run some hot

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.600 
tap water and put some run some hot
water<00:03:22.060> in<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.510> which<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:23.829> okay<00:03:24.040> but<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.489> don't

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
water in it which is okay but I don't

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.210 
water in it which is okay but I don't
really<00:03:24.819> like<00:03:25.060> using<00:03:25.239> just<00:03:25.750> hot<00:03:25.930> water<00:03:26.220> partly

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
really like using just hot water partly

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.470 
really like using just hot water partly
you<00:03:27.280> have<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.489> sit<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.910> let<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.120> water<00:03:28.390> run

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
you have to sit and let the water run

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.069 
you have to sit and let the water run
for<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.170> while<00:03:29.380> before<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.950> get<00:03:30.099> any<00:03:30.280> hot<00:03:30.459> water

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
for a while before you get any hot water

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.949 
for a while before you get any hot water
what<00:03:32.079> I'd<00:03:32.170> really<00:03:32.500> recommend<00:03:33.690> along<00:03:34.690> with<00:03:34.870> the

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
what I'd really recommend along with the

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.479 
what I'd really recommend along with the
thermos<00:03:35.349> is<00:03:35.470> you<00:03:35.590> get<00:03:35.739> something<00:03:36.010> like<00:03:36.069> this

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
thermos is you get something like this

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.840 
thermos is you get something like this
which<00:03:36.790> is<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:37.239> an<00:03:37.540> electric<00:03:38.019> kettle<00:03:38.579> these<00:03:39.579> work

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
which is a an electric kettle these work

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.059 
which is a an electric kettle these work
great<00:03:40.239> they're<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.720> fastest<00:03:41.530> way<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.739> boil

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
great they're the fastest way to boil

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:43.319 
great they're the fastest way to boil
water<00:03:42.280> we're<00:03:42.519> going<00:03:42.609> to<00:03:42.700> talk<00:03:42.850> about<00:03:43.090> more

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
water we're going to talk about more

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.759 
water we're going to talk about more
about<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.720> in<00:03:43.930> another<00:03:43.989> video

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
about that in another video

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.420 
about that in another video
but<00:03:46.079> electric<00:03:47.079> kettle<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.440> really<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.069> great

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
but electric kettle is really a great

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.250 
but electric kettle is really a great
companion<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.150> go<00:03:49.329> along<00:03:49.510> with<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.810> thermos

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
companion to go along with the thermos

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.430 
companion to go along with the thermos
also<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.100> can<00:03:51.310> get<00:03:51.459> these<00:03:51.609> for<00:03:51.910> as<00:03:52.000> low<00:03:52.209> as<00:03:52.440> 20

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
also you can get these for as low as 20

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.099 
also you can get these for as low as 20
or<00:03:53.470> 20<00:03:53.980> something<00:03:54.280> dollars<00:03:54.900> probably<00:03:55.900> not

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
or 20 something dollars probably not

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.629 
or 20 something dollars probably not
this<00:03:56.260> model<00:03:56.709> but<00:03:56.889> there<00:03:57.100> are<00:03:57.220> models<00:03:57.579> that

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
this model but there are models that

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.780 
this model but there are models that
work<00:03:57.940> well<00:03:58.180> for<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.600> price<00:03:59.370> so<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.430> boil

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
work well for that price so you boil

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.580 
work well for that price so you boil
your<00:04:00.880> water<00:04:01.980> first<00:04:02.980> off<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:04.230> just<00:04:05.230> enough<00:04:05.470> to

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
your water first off and just enough to

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.800 
your water first off and just enough to
fill<00:04:05.739> up<00:04:05.859> the<00:04:05.950> thermos<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:06.549> you<00:04:07.299> take<00:04:07.630> that

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
fill up the thermos so you take that

something somewhere on line depends on

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.909 
something somewhere on line depends on
the<00:04:43.810> consistency<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.470> like<00:04:44.650> with<00:04:44.800> your

but about three and a half cups of water

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.970 
but about three and a half cups of water
so<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.440> would<00:04:47.590> get<00:04:47.770> up<00:04:47.980> I<00:04:48.100> forgot<00:04:48.400> my<00:04:49.980> measuring

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
so I would get up I forgot my measuring

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
so I would get up I forgot my measuring
cup<00:04:51.420> mine<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:53.740> I<00:04:53.770> would<00:04:53.950> then<00:04:54.220> measure<00:04:54.730> out<00:04:54.970> the

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
cup mine so I would then measure out the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.760 
cup mine so I would then measure out the
amount<00:04:55.360> of<00:04:55.480> water<00:04:55.690> for<00:04:56.080> example<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:56.530> measure

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
amount of water for example I measure

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.580 
amount of water for example I measure
out<00:04:56.860> three<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.310> a<00:04:57.370> half<00:04:57.520> cups<00:04:58.410> once<00:04:59.410> this

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
out three and a half cups once this

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.379 
out three and a half cups once this
water<00:04:59.830> boiled<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.550> poured<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:00.880> in<00:05:01.000> here<00:05:01.240> I

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
water boiled and I poured it in here I

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.090 
water boiled and I poured it in here I
would<00:05:01.960> take<00:05:02.139> my<00:05:02.290> three<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:02.590> a<00:05:02.650> half<00:05:02.770> cups<00:05:02.919> of

would take my three and a half cups of

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.330 
would take my three and a half cups of
water<00:05:03.160> pour<00:05:03.790> it<00:05:03.910> into<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.210> electric<00:05:04.570> kettle

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
water pour it into the electric kettle

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.870 
water pour it into the electric kettle
and<00:05:06.660> get<00:05:07.660> it<00:05:07.780> to<00:05:07.900> boiling<00:05:08.669> why<00:05:09.669> does<00:05:09.850> that

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
and get it to boiling why does that

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.470 
and get it to boiling why does that
water<00:05:10.180> was<00:05:10.330> starting<00:05:10.600> to<00:05:10.660> boil<00:05:10.870> I<00:05:11.169> would<00:05:12.480> pour

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
water was starting to boil I would pour

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.600 
water was starting to boil I would pour
out<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:14.260> hot<00:05:14.440> water<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.889> was<00:05:15.040> in<00:05:15.130> my<00:05:15.250> thermos

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
out the hot water that was in my thermos

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.280 
out the hot water that was in my thermos
that<00:05:15.639> preheated<00:05:16.240> it<00:05:16.800> put<00:05:17.800> in<00:05:17.919> my<00:05:18.070> oat<00:05:18.220> groats

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
that preheated it put in my oat groats

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.720 
that preheated it put in my oat groats
put<00:05:20.290> in<00:05:20.470> my<00:05:20.710> three<00:05:21.100> and<00:05:21.190> a<00:05:21.220> half<00:05:21.340> cups<00:05:21.550> of<00:05:21.669> water

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
put in my three and a half cups of water

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.240 
put in my three and a half cups of water
once<00:05:22.270> it's<00:05:22.450> finished<00:05:22.630> boiling<00:05:23.169> pour<00:05:24.070> it<00:05:24.130> in

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
once it's finished boiling pour it in

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
once it's finished boiling pour it in
there<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:25.440> seal<00:05:26.440> it<00:05:26.590> all<00:05:26.710> up<00:05:26.820> give<00:05:27.820> it<00:05:27.940> a<00:05:28.000> shake

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
there and seal it all up give it a shake

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.670 
there and seal it all up give it a shake
just<00:05:28.540> to<00:05:28.630> make<00:05:28.750> sure<00:05:28.990> everything<00:05:29.350> is<00:05:29.470> well

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
just to make sure everything is well

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.520 
just to make sure everything is well
distributed<00:05:30.120> then<00:05:31.120> I<00:05:31.150> would<00:05:31.419> put<00:05:31.690> it<00:05:31.810> flat<00:05:32.320> on

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
distributed then I would put it flat on

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.909 
distributed then I would put it flat on
the<00:05:33.250> counter<00:05:33.780> and<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:35.110> reason<00:05:35.440> for<00:05:35.470> that<00:05:35.650> if

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
the counter and the reason for that if

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.840 
the counter and the reason for that if
you<00:05:36.040> have<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.430> like<00:05:36.640> this<00:05:37.950> then<00:05:38.950> obviously<00:05:39.250> the

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
you have it like this then obviously the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.130 
you have it like this then obviously the
heavier<00:05:40.180> ingredients<00:05:40.660> are<00:05:40.720> going<00:05:40.870> to<00:05:40.930> sink

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
heavier ingredients are going to sink

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.590 
heavier ingredients are going to sink
the<00:05:41.320> bottom<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:42.010> they<00:05:42.669> won't<00:05:42.880> cook<00:05:43.090> nearly<00:05:43.479> as

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
the bottom and they won't cook nearly as

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.390 
the bottom and they won't cook nearly as
evenly<00:05:43.870> where<00:05:44.200> if<00:05:44.290> you<00:05:44.410> spread<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:44.830> out<00:05:45.040> by

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
evenly where if you spread it out by

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.800 
evenly where if you spread it out by
laying<00:05:45.700> it<00:05:45.820> up<00:05:45.880> on<00:05:46.510> its<00:05:46.750> side<00:05:48.120> it<00:05:49.120> will<00:05:49.540> still

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
laying it up on its side it will still

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.560 
laying it up on its side it will still
settle<00:05:50.169> some<00:05:50.410> but<00:05:51.220> over<00:05:51.490> a<00:05:51.520> wider<00:05:51.850> area<00:05:52.000> and

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
settle some but over a wider area and

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.440 
settle some but over a wider area and
your<00:05:52.780> food<00:05:53.020> will<00:05:53.200> cook<00:05:53.350> more<00:05:53.380> evenly<00:05:54.120> so<00:05:55.120> the

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
your food will cook more evenly so the

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.540 
your food will cook more evenly so the
last<00:05:55.630> question<00:05:55.870> would<00:05:56.169> be<00:05:56.200> how<00:05:57.190> do<00:05:57.250> you<00:05:57.370> know

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
last question would be how do you know

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.350 
last question would be how do you know
when<00:05:57.760> it's<00:05:57.940> done

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
when it's done

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.050 
when it's done
well<00:05:58.570> on<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:59.140> website<00:05:59.530> I<00:05:59.560> give<00:05:59.890> times<00:06:00.580> for

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
well on the website I give times for

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.700 
well on the website I give times for
different<00:06:01.150> foods<00:06:01.570> and<00:06:01.960> how<00:06:02.140> long<00:06:02.320> they<00:06:02.500> take

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
different foods and how long they take

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.840 
different foods and how long they take
to<00:06:02.820> to<00:06:03.820> be<00:06:04.000> finished<00:06:05.010> but<00:06:06.010> often<00:06:06.370> you<00:06:06.490> can<00:06:06.640> tell

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
to to be finished but often you can tell

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.680 
to to be finished but often you can tell
just<00:06:07.180> by<00:06:07.350> just<00:06:08.350> by<00:06:08.470> shaking<00:06:08.919> it<00:06:09.190> if<00:06:09.940> there's<00:06:10.300> um

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
just by just by shaking it if there's um

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.219 
just by just by shaking it if there's um
if<00:06:11.470> in<00:06:11.890> just<00:06:12.280> the<00:06:12.370> way<00:06:12.490> of<00:06:12.640> the<00:06:12.850> the<00:06:13.229> contents

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
if in just the way of the the contents

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.860 
if in just the way of the the contents
move<00:06:14.530> if<00:06:14.890> it<00:06:15.100> feels<00:06:15.340> very<00:06:15.430> watery<00:06:16.030> unless

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
move if it feels very watery unless

then<00:06:58.480> you<00:06:58.630> might<00:06:58.810> be<00:06:59.080> looking<00:06:59.410> at<00:06:59.500> an<00:07:00.130> hour<00:07:00.460> two

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
then you might be looking at an hour two

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.480 
then you might be looking at an hour two
hours<00:07:01.240> and<00:07:01.650> probably<00:07:02.650> ready<00:07:02.980> to<00:07:03.070> eat<00:07:03.160> at<00:07:03.340> that

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
hours and probably ready to eat at that

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.160 
hours and probably ready to eat at that
point<00:07:04.080> anyway<00:07:05.220> those<00:07:06.220> are<00:07:06.250> the<00:07:07.090> steps<00:07:07.330> oh<00:07:07.690> I

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.170 
point anyway those are the steps oh I

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.540 
point anyway those are the steps oh I
guess<00:07:08.500> there<00:07:08.680> is<00:07:08.770> a<00:07:08.800> last<00:07:09.070> step<00:07:09.280> and<00:07:09.490> that

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
guess there is a last step and that

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.340 
guess there is a last step and that
would<00:07:09.700> be<00:07:10.020> cleaning<00:07:11.020> and<00:07:11.770> luckily<00:07:13.230> I've<00:07:14.230> got
