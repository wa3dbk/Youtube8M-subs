00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 It is already morning and what should I do today 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.660
 I'm always fishing, so I'm going to go search for a new continent today 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.660
 Oh cat 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.200
 I 'm always using this bland boat 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:26.020
 Do you want to try a new ship I made recently ? 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:29.289
 So there is no sense that this is a new ship 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.370
 But this ship has a special ability 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.880
 so 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.880
 that is 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.060
 Dah of it is possible to fly in the sky 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.560
 Isn't this so great I can fly a ship I made myself 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.440
 No fun 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.440
 It seems to be able to fly everything that I made 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.039
 I'm going to go crazy when I get off this 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.920
 want to go 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.909
 Something hot wow ah ah day 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.920
 You can jump to the island where you can get a total representative and get off 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.920
 Hurry day is coming to here 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.369
 Good morning soon 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.369
 Coming soon 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.280
 painful 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.909
 If you have this parachute you'll do a good jump, it should be fine 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.049
 Good 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.049
 I will go 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.210
 It looks like it was saved 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.210
 Was dangerous was another immediately be burned to death at 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.960
 It was good 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:05.130
 Hyde also put this time to the throat introduce here is the mode that to arch eyes PlayStation 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.130
 The parachute is also a degree 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.709
 Then we will introduce the item 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:19.860
 A total of 6 items are added in these two modes 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:24.510
 I will teach you how to make it, but it is hard to see , but it is a recipe for parachute . 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.900
 Place the silkworm's thread diagonally to the left and right in the middle of the bottom 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.370
 And that's no way 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.420
 Placed three and next will continue to introduce the AIA balloon 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:39.700
 The air balloon is a very important item for the ship to fly 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:43.900
 It is a floater that can be done by simply putting wool on the cloud Ito meeting below 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.890
 This non-rotor seems to items that do not sink the ship 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.910
 Oak wood and wool 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.910
 I can do it 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:57.310
 Hmm 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:03:04.120
 We followed this with 6 ea thread surface and is it seems something like how to make is the speed meter of Ugesu 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:10.280
 How to make the glass was placed on the four ends of the glass, put a red stone in the middle, its upper left 2 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:17.060
 Put gold on one and put two irons on the lower right side next. 6 ea thread face next 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:20.870
 Doo is how to make Ugesu recipe is here I am a little while ago and the reverse is apparently what pressure gauge manner 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:25.480
 And the next one is used to operate the ship 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:30.060
 It is a tip marker , please make it in the feeling that is reflected now 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.060
 Let's teach how to make a ship here 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.220
 Hmm 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:41.250
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.250
 At first we take out these three which we explained just before 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.250
 I am 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.170
 And like this please 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.170
 Right click to get on / off 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.030
 car 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.410
 Hmm 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:04.420
 That there say whether is a failure work because failure of the 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:07.920
 When the stone stairs here and the air balloon are attached and moved together 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.920
 It is supposed to move 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.140
 I am 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.140
 Yes this is the way home in front of you 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.790
 It was 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:27.610
 And I think this is the door What if one funny 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.610
 This is sometimes a bug when you move the ship 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.479
 Let's move the ship by taking the stone stairs 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.150
 Hmm 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.370
 not 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.990
 Yes I can move but I can't fly 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.330
 Here we will explain the air balloon Whenever you make a ship air 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:55.660
 You must put on a balloon 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.860
 It is also 40% but this is also changing the somewhere in which file 1% and crab 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.490
 Seems to be able 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.200
 Because the Lord is an idiot 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.180
 I do not understand well I am sorry 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.690
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.690
 Let's actually make a suitable ship and fly 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:22.490
 Speaking of which this also corresponds to multi 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.490
 In the creator's video, I had a pleasant air travel with my friends 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.460
 Yes it is complete 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:36.770
 Let your hand move Let the ship fly with the x key The z key when you descend 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.770
 is 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:45.270
 We recommend a third person viewpoint when you are on a ship 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.270
 Because it is easy to see the surroundings 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.790
 Movement is the same feeling as an ordinary ship 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.960
 I am 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:59.660
 me 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:03.700
 And this ship has one more feature 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.700
 The ship floats when I get off 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.110
 It is like this 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.280
 So here to arch first description of the PlayStation is's it 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.630
 Then parachute also the degree of explanation 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.260
 Hmm 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.260
 Hmm 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
 Hmm 

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:34.950
 How to use parachute is easy 

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:37.760
 Just right click when it's falling 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:41.249
 I made a mistake 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.249
 Let's change the game mode and try to fly 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.249
 Hmm 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:52.110
 Hmm 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:55.700
 It's like opening a parachute and it will slowly fall off 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.449
 It seems that it is safe to throw it away while falling 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.689
 It hurts 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:03.400
 Hmm 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:04.320
 I do not know why I got damage now 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.200
 Hmm 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.200
 Then what if it is used on the ground 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.340
 It becomes this 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.340
 Itai Itai 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.390
 It will be buried on the ground 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:32.620
 Parachute and any explanation will be up to here 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:33.520
 This in two of even throat introduce wrote in the comments if there is that you do not know what's it 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:39.910
 Please give me 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:45.510
 Or the method of introduction re p main You have written in the description field has wanted to raise even live video 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:45.510
 Thank you for watching Ne Nego by all means when you raise
