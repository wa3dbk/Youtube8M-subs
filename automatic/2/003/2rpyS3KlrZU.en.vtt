00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
unfortunately I've been really trying to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.670 
unfortunately I've been really trying to
get<00:01:05.880> my<00:01:06.030> try<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.479> my<00:01:06.659> Vespa<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> said<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
get my try at my Vespa and said but I

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.710 
get my try at my Vespa and said but I
haven't<00:01:07.860> had<00:01:07.979> too<00:01:08.159> much<00:01:08.310> luck<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.180> bring<00:01:09.600> him

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
haven't had too much luck so I bring him

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.300 
haven't had too much luck so I bring him
back<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:10.470> sock<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:11.010> go<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
back in my sock just go for the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.700 
back in my sock just go for the
earthquake<00:01:11.790> they<00:01:11.939> get<00:01:12.150> some<00:01:12.299> damage<00:01:12.600> off<00:01:12.810> does

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
earthquake they get some damage off does

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.840 
earthquake they get some damage off does
pretty<00:01:13.890> good<00:01:13.979> actually<00:01:14.189> he<00:01:14.490> goes<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
pretty good actually he goes for the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.719 
pretty good actually he goes for the
toxic<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> faze<00:01:17.250> me<00:01:17.460> too

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
toxic so that's not going to faze me too

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.740 
toxic so that's not going to faze me too
much<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> he<00:01:20.640> withdraws<00:01:21.030> expecting<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
much and so he withdraws expecting the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.240 
much and so he withdraws expecting the
earthquake<00:01:22.110> again<00:01:22.470> because<00:01:22.860> he's<00:01:23.009> probably

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
earthquake again because he's probably

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.310 
earthquake again because he's probably
figured<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.790> I've<00:01:24.000> choice<00:01:24.360> tied<00:01:24.630> him<00:01:24.780> he

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
figured out that I've choice tied him he

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.789 
figured out that I've choice tied him he
goes<00:01:25.470> into<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.770> lilligant<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.530> this

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
goes into a lilligant so I know this

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.050 
goes into a lilligant so I know this
thing's<00:01:29.009> probably<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.880> for

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
thing's probably going to go for

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.080 
thing's probably going to go for
equivalent<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.900> my<00:01:31.380> switch<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
equivalent on my switch so this is a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.730 
equivalent on my switch so this is a
good<00:01:33.240> opportunity<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.810> me<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> go<00:01:34.290> into<00:01:34.409> ducks

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
good opportunity for me to go into ducks

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.950 
good opportunity for me to go into ducks
because<00:01:35.400> no<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.700> gets<00:01:35.880> broken<00:01:36.150> aquiver<00:01:36.720> dance

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
because no one gets broken aquiver dance

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
because no one gets broken aquiver dance
in<00:01:37.170> front<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.439> ducks<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.880> doesn't<00:01:39.119> happen

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
in front of ducks it just doesn't happen

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.109 
in front of ducks it just doesn't happen
okay<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:41.159> live<00:01:41.729> event<00:01:42.000> goes<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:44.700> obviously

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
okay so a live event goes is obviously

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.780 
okay so a live event goes is obviously
going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.509> for<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> hidden<00:01:45.930> power<00:01:46.140> move<00:01:46.409> here

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
going to go for a hidden power move here

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.770 
going to go for a hidden power move here
on<00:01:47.790> my<00:01:48.509> ducks<00:01:48.810> I'm<00:01:49.409> focus<00:01:49.950> sash<00:01:50.130> which<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.880> fine

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
but I didn't even actually even need it

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.760

you move on this is Gigi but a fund that
all<00:03:37.040> my<00:03:37.190> stream<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:39.220> yes<00:03:40.220> hopefully<00:03:40.489> be<00:03:40.790> able

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
all my stream and yes hopefully be able

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.009 
all my stream and yes hopefully be able
to<00:03:41.030> do<00:03:41.120> one<00:03:41.269> of<00:03:41.299> these<00:03:41.449> in<00:03:41.599> a<00:03:41.660> couple<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:41.959> weeks

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
to do one of these in a couple of weeks

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.259 
to do one of these in a couple of weeks
or<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.400> such<00:03:44.000> like<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.560> also<00:03:46.269> probably

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
or so and such like that also probably

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.720 
or so and such like that also probably
nearly<00:03:47.720> uploaded<00:03:48.709> all<00:03:48.859> the<00:03:48.889> Wi-Fi<00:03:49.400> battles

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.220 
nearly uploaded all the Wi-Fi battles
ahead<00:03:49.849> from<00:03:50.120> most<00:03:50.359> streams<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.840> think<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.079> might

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
ahead from most streams I think I might

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.069 
ahead from most streams I think I might
have<00:03:51.260> one<00:03:51.560> more<00:03:51.769> after<00:03:51.919> this<00:03:52.129> one<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:53.079> and

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
have one more after this one and and

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.960 
have one more after this one and and
then<00:03:54.829> I'm<00:03:54.919> going<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.129> be<00:03:55.250> getting<00:03:55.370> onto<00:03:55.669> some

then I'm going to be getting onto some
pokemon<00:03:56.449> silver<00:03:56.629> and<00:03:56.870> such<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:57.319> probably<00:03:57.680> a
