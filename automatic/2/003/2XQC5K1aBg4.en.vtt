00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.760
 this provision to the departmental tec loan 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.279
 of bouches-du-rhÃ´ne 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.759
 I present a hundred works of paintings and manuscripts the poet 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.019
 books with manuscripts too 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.279
 and also printed books a small print 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.279
 always right like the others original cars 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.469
 let's avoid that there are two highlights there is a highlight on a michel butor 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:33.500
 I work 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.110
 really a lot of people 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.620
 not very long since it's been a little over four years 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.910
 and with also surrounded by mystery that will come with musicians 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.910
 at kamaishi his pedro solar 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.950
 Arab-Andalusian music 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.530
 so for here as you see so at very different levels I know 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.879
 to explore the forms 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.050
 formats 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.330
 the paper 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.620
 when they are printed characters of course when it's poets 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.790
 major trust what I give them 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.730
 books 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.180
 close by any parent or cat paintings 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.700
 and it's me who's handwriting vacuums 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.960
 for printed books it's the reverse for printed books 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.530
 on the contrary 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.290
 the chicken poet who send me their texts and I who tries to put in 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.160
 scene 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.660
 their words that's why I say director of words like the title 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.880
 of this exhibition 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.610
 so for them among the poets too that I have exposed particularly here 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.570
 there is pierre dhainaut who lived 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.580
 attacked yesterday when we celebrated the 70 years two years at a time the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.180
 media library and museum 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.620
 with him everything happens by correspondence of course it's up to 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.430
 the other end of France so every month I send it work that sends me 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.200
 at work at this rate 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 with a dozen offers 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.660
 so here I am and then me through my work I'm looking forward to poetry 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.620
 of course 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.090
 through the artist book also sports leader the body of the book 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.320
 and I'm trying to demonstrate that for example for manuscripts comes back 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.940
 before the afternoon a laptop which is important especially in our time 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.250
 today a lot talk 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.460
 often of discord disappearance even could live the printed 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.760
 also with the book 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.500
 we are talking about typography of miss from binder this is taken 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.539
 aware that the children's book so different forms 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.489
 and we are still a civilization of purpose 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.929
 this is about so for this exhibition 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:24.319
 that I presented that will last until Saturday, March 1st
