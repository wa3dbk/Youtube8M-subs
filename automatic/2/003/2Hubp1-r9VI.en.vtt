00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
breaking news or truth and I thought I

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.250

but<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:12.110> know<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.590> idea<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.010> we<00:02:13.220> worked<00:02:13.430> in

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
but you know this idea that we worked in

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.390 
but you know this idea that we worked in
concert<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.480> such<00:02:14.750> that's<00:02:15.320> not<00:02:15.530> true<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
concert and such that's not true the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.340 
concert and such that's not true the
next<00:02:16.730> thing<00:02:16.850> he<00:02:17.030> says<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.930> somehow

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
next thing he says is that I somehow

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.440 
next thing he says is that I somehow
caused<00:02:18.770> other<00:02:19.100> people<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.610> be<00:02:19.730> paid<00:02:19.940> less<00:02:20.240> and

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
caused other people to be paid less and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.570 
caused other people to be paid less and
that's<00:02:20.720> actually<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.320> opposite<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
that's actually the opposite of the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.950 
that's actually the opposite of the
truth<00:02:23.020> as<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.280> as<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.340> side<00:02:25.700> note<00:02:25.780> there<00:02:26.780> was<00:02:26.930> a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
truth as a as a side note there was a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.520 
truth as a as a side note there was a
time<00:02:27.260> like<00:02:27.620> years<00:02:27.980> ago<00:02:28.250> when<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.930> guess<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.410> was

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
time like years ago when I guess it was

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.300
