00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.780
 Yes, I'm really throwing out a sweater that comes out with a lame neck special character something like that 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.619
 It's a product. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.980

 Its called fake ah 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.710
 I'm sorry about the map. It's like changing your weapon. What the hell are you calling him? 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.279
 It was ambiguous. 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.700
 If it's shallow, I need to hold it down and hold the pistol. 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.440
 In the same case, it looks like a sniper 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.210
 This time the shot is too jjaljyo some pretty good examples even after we yet 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 I looked around. 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.380
 He said there are some lighter places in the conflict area . 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.740
 There is no exact name. 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:58.190
 Anyway, it looks like swat is not coming. 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:03.920
 So design it beautifully. Oh, it's perfect. 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.910

 The sniper has a short , long, short tripod 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.200
 I think you should be right. 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.820
 Without a gun, it's like a wild flower. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.570
 Or this sniper in the city wrote a snap-sniper sniper instantly 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.280
 I feel a little bit sick of it, but it's like this. 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.570
 If you look at it here, you see these weapons marked with these weapons. 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.310
 Oh, where are you saying it is not a normal display organic and inorganic 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.390

 It is very dangerous to kill a weapon. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000

 When it looks like it can be quite easy 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.910
 That's where we should be. 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.480
 Oh, baby, baby. 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.319

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:09.360
 I do not know exactly. 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:12.129
 We are not really that true. 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:20.020

 Compare any two that are falling and there are more weapons 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:40.030
 I'm going to go in there with a big sword. 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.090
 When you're up and down five, 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.639
 There's no time for grenades 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.540
 I do not think so. 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.540
 I'm going to the target. 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:58.930

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:14.960
 I did not think this was a brown thing on the bridge 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:18.550
 It looks like a andeuleoga Ah, but he'll be coming off of what the iPhone 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.550
 Why is it so difficult to write 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.250
 Let's just look at something similar . 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.390
 It's called Sniper. 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.200
 They explained a lot about that, and before the addition in English and I have to say 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.010
 have 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.330
 So now I do not know what the product is, but it's pretty unique 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.080
 I wonder if 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:42.460
 I would like to show you the products in the day by day. 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:45.760
 That's it. 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.850

 Oh, look at me like this. 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:07.870
 There is no guarantee that stationery will also be released. 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:11.229
 If it is popular, I hope it will be solved again. 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.860
 If not I would go even came sy Ago Comments 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:20.110
 That's not think you'll havea during the long fall 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.580
 If you have a lot of baggage, 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:26.529
 Sounds cool. 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:28.059
 If you come out of the government, you are better than what you buy. 

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:31.300
 I like you with a gun. 

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:37.520
 I think it would be nice to buy one that you like . 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:40.699
 As I said, I think you should buy something like this with weapons. 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:47.029
 You have a government. 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:52.129
 I think it would be nice to have fun buying it for example . 

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:56.330
 Ah this point is a little commemorative, often thoroughly 

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:57.949
 It would be nice if you could lay down and write it. 

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:03.669
 That I gave to eat 

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:03.669
 I hope you will refer to it and give it to me today .
