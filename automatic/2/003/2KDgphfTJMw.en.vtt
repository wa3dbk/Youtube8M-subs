in or you can turn the attack all the
way<00:02:01.880> down<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:02.810> octaves<00:02:03.170> will<00:02:03.289> bloom<00:02:03.530> in

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
way down and the octaves will bloom in

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.539 
way down and the octaves will bloom in
slowly<00:02:04.240> with<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.420> knob<00:02:05.659> all<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.020> way<00:02:06.549> fully

slowly with that knob all the way fully

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.789 
slowly with that knob all the way fully
on<00:02:08.349> you<00:02:09.349> got<00:02:09.470> your<00:02:09.619> filter<00:02:09.979> right<00:02:10.429> here<00:02:11.799> kind

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
on you got your filter right here kind

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.890 
on you got your filter right here kind
of<00:02:12.890> blends<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.640> especially<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.750> higher

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
of blends and especially in the higher

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.990 
of blends and especially in the higher
octaves<00:02:15.410> just<00:02:15.769> puts<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:16.010> filter<00:02:16.340> on<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
octaves just puts a filter on the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.460 
octaves just puts a filter on the
octaves<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.630> kind<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.900> blend<00:02:18.170> them<00:02:18.349> together

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
octaves to kind of blend them together

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.569 
octaves to kind of blend them together
so<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.790> know<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:19.970> get<00:02:20.209> real<00:02:20.450> chimy<00:02:21.579> almost

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
so you know you get real chimy almost

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.069 
so you know you get real chimy almost
piercing<00:02:23.000> high<00:02:23.180> octave<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.660> kind<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.900> when<00:02:23.989> you

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
piercing high octave is kind of when you

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.330 
piercing high octave is kind of when you
use<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.349> an<00:02:24.470> octave<00:02:24.739> pedal<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.069> this<00:02:25.220> will

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
use in an octave pedal so this will

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.050 
use in an octave pedal so this will
really<00:02:25.489> kind<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:26.380> smooth<00:02:27.380> them<00:02:27.650> out<00:02:27.739> together

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
really kind of smooth them out together

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.430 
really kind of smooth them out together
and<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.239> flutter<00:02:29.540> really<00:02:29.930> it's<00:02:30.049> just<00:02:30.260> kind<00:02:30.410> of

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
and the flutter really it's just kind of

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.490 
and the flutter really it's just kind of
like<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.620> rotary<00:02:31.099> effect<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:33.110> kind<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.349> add<00:02:33.470> a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
like a rotary effect to kind of add a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.250 
like a rotary effect to kind of add a
little<00:02:33.709> bit<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.160> organ<00:02:34.880> organ<00:02:35.390> signal<00:02:36.019> kind

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
little bit of a organ organ signal kind

00:02:36.260 --> 00:03:00.220 
little bit of a organ organ signal kind
of<00:02:36.319> organ<00:02:36.680> vibe<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.459> your<00:02:37.670> octave<00:02:38.569> ated<00:02:38.810> signal

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:04:14.770 

Oh

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.090 

over<00:04:15.780> here<00:04:15.989> is<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.430> Vanguard<00:04:17.430> phaser<00:04:17.760> and

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
over here is the Vanguard phaser and

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.820 
over here is the Vanguard phaser and
it's<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.370> it's<00:04:20.639> a<00:04:20.850> dual<00:04:21.090> phaser<00:04:21.480> so<00:04:22.199> your<00:04:22.590> top

it's a it's a dual phaser so your top

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.990 
it's a it's a dual phaser so your top
right<00:04:23.040> here<00:04:23.190> is<00:04:23.310> going<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.460> be<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.639> classic

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
right here is going to be a classic

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.460 
right here is going to be a classic
phaser<00:04:24.449> and<00:04:25.699> then<00:04:26.699> that<00:04:27.360> phase<00:04:27.750> signal<00:04:28.290> is

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
phaser and then that phase signal is

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.270 
phaser and then that phase signal is
running<00:04:29.280> into<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.970> second<00:04:30.570> phaser<00:04:30.840> down<00:04:31.740> here

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
running into a second phaser down here

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.700 
running into a second phaser down here
and<00:04:32.460> you<00:04:33.270> can<00:04:33.419> toggle<00:04:33.750> between<00:04:33.960> like<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.440> very

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
and you can toggle between like a very

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.250 
and you can toggle between like a very
smooth<00:04:35.040> phaser<00:04:35.400> kind<00:04:35.850> of<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.000> pitch<00:04:36.240> do<00:04:37.050> tune

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
smooth phaser kind of a pitch do tune

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.790 
smooth phaser kind of a pitch do tune
phaser<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:38.010> then<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.490> very<00:04:38.669> aggressive<00:04:39.800> kind

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
phaser and then a very aggressive kind

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.750 
phaser and then a very aggressive kind
of<00:04:40.919> a<00:04:41.010> creepy<00:04:41.400> phaser<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:43.620> really<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.699> really

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
of a creepy phaser so I really I really

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.900 
of a creepy phaser so I really I really
hate<00:04:45.210> phaser<00:04:45.479> and<00:04:45.870> so<00:04:46.440> wanted<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.250> do<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.460> phaser

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
hate phaser and so wanted to do a phaser

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.390 
hate phaser and so wanted to do a phaser
that<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:49.500> people<00:04:49.740> are<00:04:49.860> really<00:04:50.010> going<00:04:50.280> to

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
that that people are really going to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.070 
that that people are really going to
like<00:04:50.729> it<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:51.030> I'm<00:04:51.180> going<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:51.479> like<00:04:51.690> that<00:04:51.720> I'm

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
like it that I'm going to like that I'm

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.040 
like it that I'm going to like that I'm
going<00:04:52.229> to<00:04:52.290> want<00:04:52.530> on<00:04:52.650> my<00:04:52.860> board<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.310> so<00:04:54.150> instead

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
going to want on my board and so instead

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.730 
going to want on my board and so instead
of<00:04:55.110> just<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.500> normal<00:04:56.310> phase<00:04:57.110> waveform<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.530> you

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
of just a normal phase waveform that you

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.050 
of just a normal phase waveform that you
always<00:04:58.919> hear<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.430> you<00:04:59.520> hear<00:04:59.700> that<00:04:59.820> as<00:05:00.030> a

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
always hear and you hear that as a

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.550 
always hear and you hear that as a
cliche<00:05:00.479> phaser<00:05:02.270> that<00:05:03.270> phaser<00:05:03.600> is<00:05:03.810> going<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.020> go

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
cliche phaser that phaser is going to go

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.080 
cliche phaser that phaser is going to go
into<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.919> other<00:05:05.040> Fraser<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:05.580> so<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.820> series

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
into the other Fraser and so the series

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.879 
into the other Fraser and so the series
are<00:05:06.180> going<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.360> be<00:05:06.479> phasers<00:05:07.229> going<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.440> work<00:05:07.740> in

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
are going to be phasers going to work in

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.219 
are going to be phasers going to work in
series<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:08.430> kind<00:05:08.970> of<00:05:09.030> create<00:05:09.210> just<00:05:09.419> a<00:05:09.539> bed<00:05:10.080> of

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
series and kind of create just a bed of

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.409 
series and kind of create just a bed of
unrest<00:05:10.710> kind<00:05:11.070> of<00:05:11.130> a<00:05:11.190> strange<00:05:11.460> texture<00:05:11.970> bed<00:05:12.240> of

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
unrest kind of a strange texture bed of

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:40.950 
unrest kind of a strange texture bed of
phase<00:05:14.479> that's<00:05:15.479> really<00:05:15.870> fun<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.110> play<00:05:16.289> with

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:06:42.040 

you

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.140 

and<00:06:43.050> then<00:06:43.770> right<00:06:43.919> here<00:06:43.979> is<00:06:44.160> the<00:06:44.280> Phoenix<00:06:44.790> clean

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
and then right here is the Phoenix clean

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.439 
and then right here is the Phoenix clean

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.350 
outputs there's a eight nine volt 100

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.070 
outputs there's a eight nine volt 100
milli<00:06:52.500> amp<00:06:52.680> outputs<00:06:53.310> for<00:06:53.780> 300<00:06:54.780> milliamps

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
milli amp outputs for 300 milliamps
