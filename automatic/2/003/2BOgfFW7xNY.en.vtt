over<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.549> naming<00:02:43.940> of<00:02:44.030> them<00:02:44.209> if<00:02:44.569> you<00:02:44.750> have

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
over the naming of them if you have

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.069 
over the naming of them if you have
multiple<00:02:45.670> shortcuts<00:02:46.670> on<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:46.879> desktop<00:02:47.269> it's<00:02:47.930> not

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
multiple shortcuts on a desktop it's not

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.960 
multiple shortcuts on a desktop it's not
going<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.319> like<00:02:48.409> having<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.769> same<00:02:48.950> name<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.940> I

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
going to like having the same name so I

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.369 
going to like having the same name so I
was<00:02:50.060> fiddling<00:02:50.359> around<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.810> doing<00:02:50.959> like<00:02:51.349> a

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
was fiddling around and doing like a

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.979 
was fiddling around and doing like a
period<00:02:51.920> at<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.129> end<00:02:52.159> or<00:02:52.639> something<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.420> make

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
period at the end or something to make

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.690 
period at the end or something to make
it<00:02:54.019> look<00:02:54.260> not<00:02:54.470> too<00:02:54.709> bad<00:02:54.889> but<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.129> found<00:02:55.370> if<00:02:55.609> you

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
it look not too bad but I found if you

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.629 
it look not too bad but I found if you
did<00:02:55.879> a<00:02:56.329> space<00:02:57.049> between<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.799> not<00:02:58.190> on<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.430> other

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
did a space between and not on the other

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.410 
did a space between and not on the other
side<00:02:59.019> like<00:03:00.019> first<00:03:00.379> lon<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.209> even<00:03:02.209> if<00:03:02.299> it's

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
side like first lon the even if it's

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.599 
side like first lon the even if it's
only<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.750> one<00:03:03.049> word<00:03:03.769> one<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.159> put<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.489> middle

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
only a one word one is put in the middle

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.849 
only a one word one is put in the middle
kind<00:03:05.329> of<00:03:05.420> gives<00:03:05.569> it<00:03:05.659> a<00:03:05.750> cool<00:03:05.930> little<00:03:06.139> 3d<00:03:06.500> effect

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
kind of gives it a cool little 3d effect

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.330 
kind of gives it a cool little 3d effect
and<00:03:07.129> it<00:03:07.790> doesn't<00:03:08.510> reflect<00:03:09.099> so<00:03:10.099> it<00:03:10.190> works

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
and it doesn't reflect so it works

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.090 
and it doesn't reflect so it works
