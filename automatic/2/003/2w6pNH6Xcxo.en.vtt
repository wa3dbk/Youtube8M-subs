00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.260
 I show you how to make your own 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.070
 protectors for cakes 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.720
 for all 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.300
 at last 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:19.640
 original letters when we started this 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.990
 video there are special also for lining 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.390
 but, if you have to 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.700
 trust they make money because neither what 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.619
 do with contact but not what 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.450
 do with tip so you like to do it 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.279
 with telling what I'm going to teach you 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.020
 how to do it with this that are easy 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.730
 things you can have at home you 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.210
 He cited that yes I think you've seen 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.739
 videos so as to do this first 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.739
 that nothing this one was my first 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.290
 here 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.700
 in your forum 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.140
 then note 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.130
 if you get to notice the sewing of tea 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.570
 that's why you have to buy too 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.820
 flame retarders and sealers of 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.589
 plastic in this smart case for 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.870
 make it a little faster and sturdier 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.390
 true but because the parts very well 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.690
 from the mind that folds 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.300
 we have easy to do it too 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.270
 the nerje gourd is with tape I have 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.890
 thick but ready a crime so be it 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.990
 transparent because you can notice the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.990
 letter that are not ingrid my coffee 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.619
 neither is yola or different 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.270
 different types look at something else very 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.570
 important also of this is what 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.380
 following 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.110
 this 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.229
 you can also teach soccer and 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.649
 everything and set aside 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.020
 everything and then put a sheet of paper and 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.909
 with an iron like that also for 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.909
 ironing you can also have for 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.619
 iron the hair because it seals well and 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.450
 besides the cuts but in this case what 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.630
 I'm going to say with him so it's something else 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.430
 Quick 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.770
 although we started our 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.159
 licit materials that it can be that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.880
 It was also used for folders 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.880
 as well 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.319
 scissors 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.450
 to cut 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.450
 and it's going 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.020
 to be transparent 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:28.020
 and now the good thing to start is going to 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.020
 choose our letter then if this much 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.800
 just a life of three stars 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.030
 They are original, do not worry if we 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.030
 we approach 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.030
 the card in here and accommodate it 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.870
 until the mere corner that is this strong 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.870
 see how 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.560
 I cloth very very well end look what 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.270
 we can do to mark all 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.770
 the goals and you're no longer trying 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.420
 trying 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.190
 like this one that I have here that already has 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.190
 marked in the doubles with this 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.310
 we start 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.260
 but up 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.230
 and we mark our cards well 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.569
 yes 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.680
 program if you want to mark it with a 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.680
 rule or something 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.430
 after no more we unfolded it 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.050
 and it is that he has scored well as you can 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.900
 to appreciate 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:11.850
 the following will leave us and the following 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.850
 is to cut what is order 7 as I do 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.610
 and we have the coria factor 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.610
 yes 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.620
 let's make one like this one let's 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.960
 we're going to put little presumed 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.360
 so let's go through that part I'm going to 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.029
 finish to one side and how it was and the 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.979
 another seeks more than anything that the 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:07.439
 double of this one seems to be left 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.120
 edge that is left for this side so that 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.200
 so that it is well appreciated what is 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.630
 the part 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.250
 main face 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.250
 by cutting on its edges remaining milestones 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.669
 to finish it well and the little corner 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.249
 as being full more trimmed these 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.199
 games 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.199
 so if we are going to cross it 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.060
 when the cord of the machine is more 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.139
 easy because it no longer covers anything 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.729
 but when you cut it 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.740
 it's like from the middle part you have to 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:52.030
 form all the sides this then 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.030
 it clears well 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.909
 at least the letter 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.700
 how can you erase it enough 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:10.330
 I had to look good 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:16.659
 aside, notice that at home for 12 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:19.120
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 back as 10 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.159
 because this part is because it does not fit 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.449
 the fourth one because here already counts 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.819
 this part so more against the 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.680
 matches that has the and not america on 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.449
 everything for today comments subscribe this 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.599
 It was my first video after more 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:35.080
 videos but they will try pure pure 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:38.230
 your script of how to train your clients 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.200
 what are the super rare weird letters 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.689
 how to play you saw very very well 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.580
 explained the videos 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.580
 see how well it was lined 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:53.590
 all that are details that if true 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:57.590
 It is already to your liking as you want it 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.840
