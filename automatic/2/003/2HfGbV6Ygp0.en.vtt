00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:15.380
 Well that's the name of 6 honest Gatchaman and the song after that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.380
 I didn't know what that anime really was 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.130
 It was of course known to Tteyuu hero thing 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:28.780
 Really it is that I wonder become what the wind 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.029
 I imagined and of course if you let me check what role Jun is 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:35.539
 American popular American half 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:40.050
 Lie I see that line like that I can not do that while 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:41.770
 In the course I tried to the very with it generations popular anime of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.490
 6 's anxiety 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.079
 After all generations 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.640
 It does play Tenkejo imperial calendar 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:54.450
 Because I wonder if I get to How so N behind to was very anxiety 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.930
 But because humans play 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:02.060
 So do you go out what you put out 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:06.690
 Very impressed by the love to Gacha when you meet really the first coach ever 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:11.470
 Because in was please explain of the fine over because you think trying to such Fu 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.820
 I think I was also played my own Jomon 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.470
 Say whether coming from those that order from the Director 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.580
 I was able to tell you 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:26.110
 But I think that cormorants Do was very good 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.110
 But that milk seems to love you very much, so it will be a great pleasure 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:35.440
 It was very difficult when I first read only the honest book 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.040
 It is said that the hero hero thing is so much fantasy or such a different world 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.850
 that 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:46.430
 I wondered if it was a story in my imagination but I really thought that person 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.570
 Toka or was so feelings or rather the story of Te 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.650
 Think I Do is carefully painted or was one person's emotions 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.620
 I felt even reading the script 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.620
 I want to play well there but I want to play 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:09.580
 Since the woman one person that in for the 6 o'clock men or Once you say that, of course strength power men 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:13.130
 Feminine Toka or was the strength of not adversely enemy minute that woman 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.330
 Good-looking referred to as the action scene 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.330
 What is it like to feel? 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.040
 Anyone was I thought wow Do not cool properly made aware of that woman of the line 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.930
 Because it was giving me 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.160
 What happened to be after all action 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.780
 You 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.200
 After all I think that it will be safe because I can see and understand the experience but I am very 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.980
 With a clean line 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.970
 Of course we made it and it is easy to move that action scene 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.180
 If you wear something cool you can do something about something that makes you feel a little stronger 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:52.740
 Because it was a true suit that makes me feel like a little 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:57.900
 But after all that I'm out in the middle of that story is high 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:01.770
 Order from everyone around the Tokiwa, which came out in the media is very Aso Te Minisukazudo N' 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.360
 I was able to listen to people around, but it is snow at that time 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.450
 Because I did not publish it 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.800
 Eight rounds say only 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.180
 It's a very part of it, but everyone 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.980
 But that really 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:21.950
 A person who has been to mini-skirt expected this suit also like this I cool new steal 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.950
 A suit that you can think of becoming a six- piece 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:32.940
 Play while I thought the punch and play the I is funny also how said, from the usual from the usual 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:40.610
 Because all this voice did not go boating 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:44.720
 First of all I Naa wonder I really weird from the way that say hit bread in my 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.520
 It's pretty cool to say it's not cool at all for the first time 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.740
 There 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:56.110
 Really be kicking me pretty or with or thought imagination 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.930
 But those of Ayaginurei is I'm nobody was often either Yappa so well parentheses Among them 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.740
 I really do it 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.860
 Of course it was difficult to show it like 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.190
 But wire was really fun yeah 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.000
 It was more interesting from high place 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.520
 Also Toka or was imagined that tone out creativity in the in 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.770
 I hate how heavy it is 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.770
 The part I have to do, so to speak , imagining such 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.970
 It is moving 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:34.110
 Really was fun not contain doing what among the first hit by four men to me in that true 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.110
 I was very worried about this 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.389
 Hey everyone's but I was also part that was refrain from really friendly and is of the nature in the 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.260
 Because who have put 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.470
 Of course burn 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.460
 Because who cares really it means Te' the silk flag 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:54.420
 But in the middle of fighting with 5 people 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:59.490
 Really Toka or was a conversation from the usual or say that it is natural and teamwork 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:01.160
 You said that you were able to build up teamwork in the treatment conversation 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.880
 Really say I Na 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.880
 I felt 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:14.530
 I think that the individuality that is kind to everyone is probably very strong 5 people 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.530
 And it is really there to Tteyuu Toka or was properly coordination among 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.970
 I think amazing Nante was good to put the it 's such a good child Ninda to this member 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.490
 No, but you guys are really said but it sounds so bad 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:32.750
 I think 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:37.160
 Of course, elementary school students have nothing to do with them, and they have nothing to do with age. 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:42.319
 There were a lot of parts that I felt, but it was an ugly mischievous child 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:47.150
 Really various knowledge after to it was really even or each other and that a prank by two people 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:48.639
 I usually have it and I know this in the middle of the shooting. 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.110
 Give me 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.210
 Toka or a lot even if you do not know at all 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.840
 I also compared it every day later 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:01.030
 I'm still high I bought 3001 but I bought 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.880
 It's been a long time since then 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.880
 Really I had become I adult was a little surprised 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:15.970
 Really it is that four o'clock it was amazing Kakkoyoka' 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:19.690
 We do still have to your play with that imagination Toka or was green back 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.110
 Also chan I also of me really wonder actually high school is finished in what Fu 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.560
 I was looking forward to it 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.190
 Let me actually see it 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.910
 The Tteyuu it became this kind of wind 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.610
 It was really exciting to see 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.509
 Really thin 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.980
 It is also used great delicate finely cg 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:41.300
 Patient too 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:42.550
 How to put out to represent the video that the way out is also very delicate in the 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.150
 Masu Na has come out Ttei 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.990
 I felt 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:51.970
 There is of course too also like to something exciting not go 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.970
 But that feeling also comes through 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:03.390
 It is a strong force Ayame who played Jun 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:09.090
 This time I really do that I also play, and how is it completed? 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:12.460
 I was looking forward to it, but it is wonderful than I imagined 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:17.979
 Of course you are on your head 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:19.900
 Human emotions had been transmitted very well to say human beings are fighting is Dattari weakness of 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:24.759
 Fragility or strength 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:26.530
 From that or was the friendship the love of it 's such is really that delicately drawn each person 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:29.830
 I felt really 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:33.920
 Especially that I Jun one girl, so 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:36.880
 It would be nice if women would agree with me 

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.880
 I do not think so 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:43.320
 To have 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.550
 I think that I'm happy if I had you hit in this Gachaman 

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.550
 Please take a look at the theater
