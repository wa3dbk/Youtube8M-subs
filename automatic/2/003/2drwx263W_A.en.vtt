 and a minister in the new delivery of his 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.209
 defender and the veteran soccer saga 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.919
 pro evolution soccer ' which is 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.630
 ready one more year to do the 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.580
 delights of fans of the genre 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.820
 being assigned this time to the 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.000
 pc platforms xbox 360 playstation3 and 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.000
 psp 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.160
 starting with the game modes that 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.169
 the title offers us we will have 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.969
 several possibilities taking in first 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.010
 place the party mode where we can 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.559
 compare friendly encounters both in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.670
 lonely as against other users 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.860
 choosing any of the equipment 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.449
 present in common whether they are clubs 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.449
 soccer or national teams 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.519
 For its part, the second modality 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.559
 flame football life and living are they 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.149
 three options starting with the league 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.250
 master where in addition to playing the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.559
 meetings we will exercise as managers of 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.760
 our favorite football club 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.470
 managing elements such as signings 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 or the budget while we go 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.180
 advancing in the various events of the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.649
 calendar that form the season 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.450
 we also have the league mode 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.880
 master online we will do the same 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.590
 in this case in its online aspect by 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.420
 what we will measure to other teams 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.420
 directed by users around the world 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.530
 the third option is the way to be a 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.270
 legend putting us this in the skin of 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.400
 a single player that will be possible 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.020
 create from scratch with an editor to 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.530
 from there live your entire career 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.390
 professional the main peculiarity of 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.790
 this modality is that we will only control 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.649
 to that one player during matches 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.509
 knowing it was added as a great novelty 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.190
 from which now we can also play 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.190
 occupying the position of the goalkeeper 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.810
 valladolid 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.030
 already to end the modalities of 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.770
 game the title also offers us the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.720
 training mode in which to practice 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.700
 our skills with the ball and the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.620
 competition mode where we have a 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.480
 wide range of championships as per 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.640
 example the uefa champions league and the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.650
 europa league and the seal liberators as well 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.340
 as the power to dispute various leagues to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.340
 Nacional level 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.890
 and precisely in relation to the number of 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.500
 teams and leagues included in the game 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.540
 pro evolution soccer '2014 leaves us a 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.400
 somewhat bittersweet feeling because 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.500
 one side at European level the good news 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.900
 is that we have the complete leagues of 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.849
 spain holland france italy with all 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.650
 teams and players while in 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.420
 Regarding the American leagues 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.280
 we have the whole of Brazil to 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.930
 Argentina and Chile - but nevertheless 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.849
 other leagues like the english the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.670
 Portuguese or German have only been 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.260
 partially licensed this happens 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.329
 equally when we play with the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.250
 national elections counting only 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.250
 some of them with official license 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.870
 For its part, there has also been a 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.489
 drastic reduction in the number of 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.530
 stadiums in which to enjoy the 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.390
 encounters knowing something less than a 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.459
 twenty to choose from so 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.590
 the same has been taken a step back 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.540
 saga in this sense although the majority 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.580
 of them are real stadiums as per 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.590
 example the trafford in england 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.250
 sanction late I do the monumental in 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.250
 Argentina 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.550
 on the occasion failed of a new 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.200
 partner 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.180
 in that way going on now to comment 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.310
 the playability of this new delivery pre 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.260
 volution soccer 2014 gives us 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.210
 enough improvements in the control of 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.220
 players and everything related to 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.720
 the touches the passes or the shots to 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.610
 door what must be added the great 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.350
 work done with the physics of 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.880
 ball certainly the best we've ever 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.880
 seen to date the saga 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.680
 the important thing in the practical section the 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.600
 The most remarkable element is the use of a 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.490
 new motor 'boxing day' of the same 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.340
 created by kojima productions for the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.960
 next metal gear solid 5 us 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.850
 we will find in this aspect with 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.740
 improvements in animations and modeling 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.480
 of the players although nevertheless the 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.670
 game does not seem to be quite right 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.740
 optimized, being able to see sometimes 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.300
 occasional slowdown as well as 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.130
 various failures in intelligence 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.870
 artificial situations where 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.030
 players respond with some slowness 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.030
 or they get rid of a play 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.770
 to the players 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.690
 in addition another negative detail is the fact 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.700
 that the possibility has not been included 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.650
 of playing the games with rain something 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.270
 quite explainable that does indicate 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.990
 that the game is released maybe with 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.990
 too much hurry 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.620
 before concluding we have also 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.419
 stress that sound level has been 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.430
 once again with the participation of 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.470
 the well-known sports journalists 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.509
 july maldonado maldini and carlos 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.940
 martÃ­nez who repeat one more year in 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.979
 the saga however the variety of 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.419
 comments has seemed to us something scarce 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.550
 and even more than the previous ones 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.560
 deliveries being very common to be said 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.289
 again and again the same phrases during 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.060
 a match almost continuously as 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.039
 positive data in what it seems to have 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.780
 improved the game are the chants of the 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.880
 swollen knowing in a greater variety 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.960
 coming you're even running to 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.960
 concrete players 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.149
 in conclusion pro evolution soccer '2014 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.189
 brings some good ideas and news 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:13.080
 to the saga being the first step of which 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:15.119
 promises to be a new rebirth of 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.069
 this popular soccer simulator thank you 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:19.020
 above all the great potential it offers 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.210
 the fox engine something that will be noticed 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.129
 especially in future deliveries when the 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.649
 game of finally jumping to the new 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:27.809
 generation although we believe that the edition 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:29.460
 This year has possibly launched 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:31.080
 before time finding us with 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.240
 several elements that should still 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.710
 cover something more good plus both be a 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.389
 step back in some content 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.149
 regarding what was seen in the edition of 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:40.860
 last year, it has not been possible to reach 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.229
 level of quality that we all would have 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.119
 wanted to be able to position it 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.629
 as a serious candidate for the best game 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:47.629
 of the genus
