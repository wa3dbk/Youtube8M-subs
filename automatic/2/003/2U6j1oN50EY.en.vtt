00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
forward to this for a long time when my

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.000 
forward to this for a long time when my
wife<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.820> I<00:01:00.910> saw<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.180> movie<00:01:01.540> both<00:01:01.989> just<00:01:02.770> were

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.670 
wife and I saw the movie both just were
blown<00:01:03.430> away<00:01:03.760> by<00:01:04.089> how<00:01:04.300> powerful<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.110> story<00:01:05.440> is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.030 
blown away by how powerful the story is
and<00:01:05.979> I<00:01:06.670> think<00:01:06.729> what<00:01:07.119> even<00:01:07.540> makes<00:01:07.720> it<00:01:07.930> more<00:01:08.170> just

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
and I think what even makes it more just

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.340 
and I think what even makes it more just
touching<00:01:09.460> is<00:01:09.580> that<00:01:09.760> it's<00:01:09.910> true<00:01:10.330> this<00:01:11.110> is<00:01:11.170> a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
touching is that it's true this is a

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.990 
touching is that it's true this is a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
there walking around by himself yeah I

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.000 
there walking around by himself yeah I
think<00:01:58.960> it's<00:01:59.260> just<00:01:59.400> mother's<00:02:00.400> intuition<00:02:01.210> just

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
think it's just mother's intuition just

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.660 
think it's just mother's intuition just
something<00:02:03.010> that<00:02:03.040> was<00:02:03.189> just<00:02:03.250> kind<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.549> that

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
something that was just kind of that

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.850 
something that was just kind of that
nagging<00:02:04.240> at<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.780> just<00:02:04.960> said<00:02:05.200> turning<00:02:05.770> to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
nagging at you that just said turning to

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.340 
nagging at you that just said turning to
turn<00:02:06.040> around<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:07.240> think<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.869> those<00:02:08.049> three

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
turn around I think that those three

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.870 
turn around I think that those three
words<00:02:08.530> have<00:02:08.799> been<00:02:08.890> pretty<00:02:09.130> impactful<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.759> my

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880
