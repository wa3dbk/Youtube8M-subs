00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.750
 connected that business that mixes 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.740
 past and future one thing 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.719
 it is unethical this is a modern paradox 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.550
 however old our record today is 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.050
 that 's good 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:26.640
 today we are going to talk about a disc released 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:29.760
 by the label is a record this is a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.650
 disc released in 2014 however if I 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.450
 do not say it was in the year 2014 you 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.170
 could well say that it was the years 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.510
 70 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.969
 look there using 70 again on that channel 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.969
 I think you're more professional than 60 and 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:01:02.149
 70 resembles a little cute pink and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.149
 I'm talking about the subject of your stock. 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.210
 of the boys of the time 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.950
 I think this addiction is being a bit 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.740
 late with the album was released in the year 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.869
 past and that was I ignored him who 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 several times with 12 discs I traveled to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.130
 London I think there playing and you know 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.079
 when you turn things on 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.210
 on this direct drive in stores in são 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.430
 paulo must be sold several times 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.500
 and I never looked for myself and I do not know 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.210
 Why this week I decided was one of the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.310
 best performances I've had with the says is 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.990
 damn hard then more then fast 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.179
 write this text to make this record 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.100
 in this case you're doing the same I 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.979
 It's the right time. Are you sure that the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.090
 band if you who are there enjoy bittles 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.220
 floyd justify the who else tone was 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.670
 everything that was bonus years to crack in the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.159
 late 60's and early 70's you 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.950
 You're going to enjoy it a lot. 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.780
 follow with us, look if you 're there. 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.399
 It's putting a lot of faith. 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.990
 a snow guy started listening to this video 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.149
 who arrives in the area of influence of the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.750
 The band 's name went to the public and 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.220
 said 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.170
 time was one of the best things that 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.929
 happened in that year of 2014 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.329
 the Olympian did not work again in his 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.910
 with the family not to mention it stays 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.230
 nervous noel went public and says that 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.420
 times with one of the best things that 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.010
 It happened in 2014 and so not all being 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.019
 that the voice of reason but the guy and the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.480
 public and talk about the band being good 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.569
 what kind is good even of those a good 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.660
 soul fund this week and or 30 ml 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.880
 That's the way I do not want to live in a 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.040
 world where tinga plays in limbo and 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.319
 some judges fans say that reading or 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.049
 me is better and everything inclusion is very 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.480
 cool function you are there boy of 13 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.000
 14 years that never ventured 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.040
 in this style of music 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.670
 Amy when he knew everybody does 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.160
 seeming to anticipate the movement is 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.260
 everything very reminds us also the paulo to us 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.300
 will get sixth in the pocket early in the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.140
 technology is also there to save 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.380
 money 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.360
 earned relaxes you will get out alive decided 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.100
 This is nothing too complicated. 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.870
 you will not come across the psychedelic 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.720
 side of the 70's that was something that 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.910
 sometimes came extremely kind 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.070
 it's tiring that there oscar to fry the same 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.680
 trio was fucking key band that 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.209
 circled king crimson every one things 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.880
 Such a million a day 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.459
 it's a lot of travel is on pace but she 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.620
 go hand in hand and relax and you will not find 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.680
 this disk is similar to the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.200
 doctor giving the best it is an honor to have faith 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.489
 in reference to a similar battery 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.100
 so it seems that there is something very 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.470
 dried and the bands got the win me 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.390
 I remember, I do not know everything, you know that. 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.760
 music remember me well know the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.940
 vignettes our powers of exchange what kind 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.070
 of cattle history is all hate so to 60 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.900
 dancing with that tall haired girl and 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.500
 wait a little bit just from those 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.910
 psychedelic of 70 he gets very involved 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.830
 another pop hit 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.870
 I'll leave it here for you in the description. 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:03.090
 two songs one flame shelter hats 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.180
 from alter of the floor né 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.090
 Now tell me a song, call Shelter. 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.600
 sound and the other flame that has torque 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.790
 gives a check 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.890
 You have always put these two 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.050
 because we are the team that she 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:26.260
 likes to play well said the coach in 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:29.920
 a climb on good rock n roll Yeyé 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.820
 arrives at the same time will call him hodgkin 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.500
 and it is not work is the pig that a 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.320
 Work is brave, people talked a lot. 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.210
 with this truth profile I think the 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.570
 time may be one of the last two 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.880
 that will appear in this scenario 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.500
 psychedelic pop psychedelic z so this 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.610
 last that Brazil will stay out 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.310
 the joy where it will also say with timbre 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.490
 I have the fox and genres considered more 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.950
 There is a game with the text in mind. 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.960
 they ask does not know what the other will do 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:08.740
 a participation in the new disc in clothes 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:11.560
 then rob nichols nr I did not know the 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.750
 no one at all to work 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.490
 american south africa selection 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.530
 is on the way to a British gate 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.480
 by a passage through the hands to call the 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.760
 best in the area and the team so that for me 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.440
 It is the most important in this scenario much 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.150
 band of this genius so I think the 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.400
 time will be one of the last and will 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.010
 appear because James already 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.230
 and lack society as a whole. 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.270
 will continue the heavy 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.910
 It's boring people will notice it at once. 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.220
 how it would go or whether another genre is 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.190
 a song get some more electronic 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.990
 means of buying itanhangá boy too 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.970
 paula said that their next album 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.190
 will be neutral in the vain bands themselves 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.650
 if reinventing they will saturate 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.510
 Giving up involves creating as well as 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.240
 could I think time really 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.910
 marcelo 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.240
 then discussing this discount is very 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.240
 cool 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.770
 I 'll ask you to enjoy the video. 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.480
 leave a comment only and share 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.169

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:18.629
 so people know the channel gives 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.400
 one checked on the music nation website 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.080
