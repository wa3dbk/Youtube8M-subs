on the video and then I write the rest
of<00:04:21.910> me<00:04:22.030> out

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
of me out

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.650 
of me out
I<00:04:22.960> find<00:04:23.680> cooking<00:04:24.190> is<00:04:24.280> better<00:04:24.520> than<00:04:24.790> looking<00:04:25.360> at

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
I find cooking is better than looking at

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.090 
I find cooking is better than looking at
a<00:04:25.690> recipe<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.199> trying<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.530> duplicate<00:04:26.949> it

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
a recipe and trying to duplicate it

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.070 
a recipe and trying to duplicate it
instead<00:04:27.790> you<00:04:27.970> want<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.180> be<00:04:28.270> able<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.479> make<00:04:28.750> the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
instead you want to be able to make the

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.590 
instead you want to be able to make the
item<00:04:29.440> yourself<00:04:30.040> if<00:04:30.910> you<00:04:31.150> need<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.419> write<00:04:31.540> a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
item yourself if you need to write a

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.870 
item yourself if you need to write a
recipe<00:04:31.840> in<00:04:32.139> this<00:04:32.260> case<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.650> do<00:04:32.710> but<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:33.699> want<00:04:33.790> to

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
recipe in this case I do but you want to

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.820 
recipe in this case I do but you want to
make<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.300> item<00:04:34.540> yourself<00:04:34.930> then<00:04:35.290> write<00:04:35.650> the

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
make the item yourself then write the

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.129 
make the item yourself then write the
recipe<00:04:36.220> otherwise<00:04:37.090> you're<00:04:37.330> working<00:04:37.720> against

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
recipe otherwise you're working against

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.110 
recipe otherwise you're working against
the<00:04:38.260> recipe<00:04:38.680> instead<00:04:39.310> of<00:04:39.400> doing<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.790> cooking

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
the recipe instead of doing the cooking

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.310 
the recipe instead of doing the cooking
part<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.570> know<00:04:42.510> let<00:04:43.510> me<00:04:43.630> just<00:04:43.780> taste<00:04:43.960> this<00:04:44.139> one

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
part you know let me just taste this one

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:52.210 
part you know let me just taste this one
more<00:04:44.530> time<00:04:44.710> some<00:04:44.949> fun

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.850 

as<00:04:52.760> far<00:04:52.970> as<00:04:53.060> I'm<00:04:53.180> concerned<00:04:53.480> it's<00:04:53.630> perfect

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.420 

again<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:59.210> main<00:04:59.360> variation<00:05:00.040> if<00:05:01.040> you<00:05:01.190> want<00:05:01.370> it

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
again the main variation if you want it

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.520 
again the main variation if you want it
to<00:05:01.520> be<00:05:01.640> a<00:05:01.670> little<00:05:01.820> more<00:05:02.000> cheesier<00:05:02.510> you<00:05:03.350> can

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
to be a little more cheesier you can

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.470 
to be a little more cheesier you can
even<00:05:03.920> take<00:05:04.220> half<00:05:04.490> of<00:05:04.670> this<00:05:04.820> put<00:05:05.150> in<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.300> food

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
even take half of this put in the food

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.150 
even take half of this put in the food
processor<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.140> puree<00:05:06.440> it<00:05:06.470> and<00:05:06.650> then

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
processor and puree it and then

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.310 
processor and puree it and then
reincorporate<00:05:07.970> it<00:05:08.090> back<00:05:08.270> into<00:05:08.750> this<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:08.990> mix

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
reincorporate it back into this and mix

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.990 
reincorporate it back into this and mix
it<00:05:09.500> it<00:05:09.980> might<00:05:10.190> make<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.580> little<00:05:10.610> more

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
it it might make it a little more

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.450 
it it might make it a little more
in-depth<00:05:11.690> easier<00:05:12.110> rather<00:05:12.620> than<00:05:12.770> relying<00:05:13.250> on

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
in-depth easier rather than relying on

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.850 
in-depth easier rather than relying on
eating<00:05:13.880> bites<00:05:14.210> cheese<00:05:14.780> which<00:05:15.290> is<00:05:15.440> just<00:05:15.680> fine

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
eating bites cheese which is just fine

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.850 
eating bites cheese which is just fine
for<00:05:16.040> me<00:05:16.100> so<00:05:16.730> there<00:05:16.880> you<00:05:17.000> have<00:05:17.030> it<00:05:17.590> blue<00:05:18.590> cheese

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
for me so there you have it blue cheese

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.240 
for me so there you have it blue cheese
