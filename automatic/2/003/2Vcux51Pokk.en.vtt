00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:09.320
 thanks Alvaro Hermitage good and today we go 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.610
 to say one thing true of sohar guys 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.950
 that everyone in the west where to open 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.629
 packages of things from the south that given 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.550
 the videos and we start what to look for are 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.320
 with term clothing hooks dress 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.830
 the bazaars and what hook the hook 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.390
 that trophy up the cute radio and also 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.000
 you can have it in view if you have a 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.820
 bar if you have a breakfast bar in the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.070
 kitchen table you leave them in sight and 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.810
 the truth is we are going forward 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.640
 let's get our pantry going 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.110
 from our place to our kitchen the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.370
 kitchens totally open in a 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.960
 open kitchen 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.120
 some we paint in glass 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.920
 directly with the gloss in salaries and 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.960
 others on paper from a painting 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.730
 special there is a special painting that is 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.920
 what we are going to do today the law is that 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.829
 I like that you grab these leaves of the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.960
 book recipes the truth the truth are 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.140
 leaves of a book that is leafless 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.320
 out there so we painted 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.270
 give it good this is gloss in am the what 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.339
 I did was put these stencil redonditos 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.369
 that I am delighted that they are the 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.640
 new we are going to fix there well and we paint 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.520
 in a second renewed all your kitchen 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.500
 those horrible things of brooches and coughs or 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.590
 of bags that puts this supermarket 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.869
 this the truth that is divine or 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.870
 also that it also has a place of 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:28.000
 workshop for button obviously and I know 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.550
 whatever you want, we keep whatever you want 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.120
 always little paint when we do 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.720
 stencil and round doll we are going to 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.240
 look a little at the cap of the 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.930
 Talitas the truth that I like them to be 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.280
 smooth that do not have the possibility without 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.290
 some are the imported jars are 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.600
 Well, they come in a plain color and 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.560
 the others painted but with spray 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.560
 let's take out 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.350
 you are magically eye for wet 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.320
 let's leave it out there it 's great and 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.760
 while you look, I have a little bit 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.310
 more this if it is painted on paper and 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.990
 with acrylic not with gloss in amÃ©lie is 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.910
 I'm also seeing what they do in 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.640
 the bars or restaurants people that 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.250
 recycle or decorate the bars available 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.250
 It's also a nice idea if for those 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.670
 divine places that are now like very 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.270
 rustic adame if the shaker is clear 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.120
 for places with wave let's say more 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.040
 young and they are bakeries also with bar 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.330
 you saw that now there is a little bit of everything 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.920
 together 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.570
 the truth that this is good I give you 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.070
 I love this loves all the 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.590
 world and my mom is very good you like me 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.080
 love the color is red another detail 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.600
 He cited how we put it in the jar 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.280
 to give some little bottle I'm going to grab this one 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.130
 look here is painted with gloss in am the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.530
 with white because it can be white can 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.290
 being black can be any color and if 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.060
 we want instead of baking it because this 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.360
 then going to go baking put the paper 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.569
 we are going to put forward the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.319
 only variant that I did not put 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.510
 scotch tape or anything tape double-sided 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.080
 course so that we are perfect 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.880
 back side tape double face pegadito and 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.800
 is in the alonso if you are from 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.170
 situations that I think always add 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.170
 the girls of public times if those 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.330
 they are enameled chats are the veneers 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.459
 of the enameled tag what we show a 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.500
 second as it is painted here if not this is 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.060
 high temperature furnace that is 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.739
 high temperature oven and these 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.190
 ceramics also that this did 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.040
 still 3a 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:50.620
 what is it called are the same paintings no 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.710
 the cases are with the gloss in the oven 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.570
 of the house temperature 150 degrees a 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.220
 an hour and a half and this is high temperature 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.770
 with two high temperature furnaces 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.180
 very fast and great techniques for 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.180
 reuse at home 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.010
