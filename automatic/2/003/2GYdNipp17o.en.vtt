B minor shape just on the top four

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.039 
B minor shape just on the top four
strings<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:36.090> you'll<00:02:37.090> hear<00:02:37.239> chord<00:02:37.569> voicings

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
strings and you'll hear chord voicings

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.690 
strings and you'll hear chord voicings
in<00:02:38.170> reggae<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.500> lot<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.799> times<00:02:38.950> just<00:02:39.069> on<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.489> top

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
in reggae a lot of times just on the top

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.660 
in reggae a lot of times just on the top
strings<00:02:40.500> because<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.739> want<00:02:41.980> them<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.190> stand

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
strings because you want them to stand

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.440 
strings because you want them to stand
out<00:02:43.470> with<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.530> high<00:02:45.130> sound<00:02:48.299> because<00:02:49.299> the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
out with a high sound because the

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.180 
out with a high sound because the
baseline<00:02:49.989> it's<00:02:50.230> going<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.500> oftentimes<00:02:51.010> be

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
baseline it's going to oftentimes be

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.580 
baseline it's going to oftentimes be
playing<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.640> melodic<00:02:52.150> type<00:02:52.360> line<00:02:55.410> or<00:02:56.410> you'll

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
playing a melodic type line or you'll

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.650 
playing a melodic type line or you'll
have<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.769> guitar<00:02:56.980> part<00:02:57.519> that's<00:02:58.239> playing<00:02:58.510> a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
have a guitar part that's playing a

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.990 
have a guitar part that's playing a
similar<00:02:59.079> melodic<00:02:59.920> line<00:03:02.609> something<00:03:03.609> like<00:03:03.790> that

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
similar melodic line something like that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.870 
similar melodic line something like that
so<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.630> want<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.170> contrast<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.190> that's<00:03:06.640> why

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
so you want the contrast and that's why

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.990 
so you want the contrast and that's why
the<00:03:07.600> basic<00:03:08.049> rhythm<00:03:08.320> part<00:03:08.560> generally<00:03:09.430> be<00:03:09.850> on

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
the basic rhythm part generally be on

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.970 
the basic rhythm part generally be on
the<00:03:10.120> top<00:03:10.359> strings<00:03:10.720> with<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> higher<00:03:11.140> sound<00:03:11.470> so

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
the top strings with a higher sound so

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:26.210 
the top strings with a higher sound so
what<00:03:12.160> I'm<00:03:12.310> doing<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:24.370> if<00:03:25.239> this<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.750> beat

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
what I'm doing is so if this is the beat

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.090 
what I'm doing is so if this is the beat
three<00:03:27.220> or<00:03:27.910> you've<00:03:28.209> got<00:03:28.569> sixteenth<00:03:29.139> notes<00:03:32.100> one

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
three or you've got sixteenth notes one

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.430 
three or you've got sixteenth notes one
E<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.609> two<00:03:33.639> E<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.060> A<00:03:34.389> three<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:35.019> a<00:03:35.170> four<00:03:35.200> E

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
E and a two E and A three and a four E

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.440 
E and a two E and A three and a four E
onda<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.299> for<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.660> first<00:03:37.870> two<00:03:38.350> sixteenth

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
onda and for the first two sixteenth

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.849 
onda and for the first two sixteenth
it's<00:03:40.450> just<00:03:40.660> dead<00:03:40.900> string<00:03:41.230> hits<00:03:41.470> where<00:03:41.709> I'm

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
it's just dead string hits where I'm

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.590 
it's just dead string hits where I'm
meeting<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.519> strings<00:03:42.760> by<00:03:42.910> not<00:03:43.060> pressing<00:03:43.450> them

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
meeting the strings by not pressing them

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.059 
meeting the strings by not pressing them
all<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.019> way<00:03:44.079> down<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.380> fretboard<00:03:44.680> and

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
all the way down to the fretboard and

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:53.980 
all the way down to the fretboard and
then<00:03:45.819> I'll<00:03:46.030> squeeze<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.630> cord

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.290 

so<00:03:54.990> I'm<00:03:55.140> going<00:03:55.380> down<00:03:55.680> up<00:03:55.920> on<00:03:56.130> dead<00:03:56.640> string<00:03:57.000> and

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
so I'm going down up on dead string and

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.220 
so I'm going down up on dead string and
then<00:03:58.200> down<00:03:58.440> up<00:03:58.680> on<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.950> court'll<00:03:59.310> hit<00:03:59.460> and<00:04:00.230> I

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
then down up on the court'll hit and I

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.140 
then down up on the court'll hit and I
actually<00:04:01.410> release<00:04:02.040> pressure<00:04:02.670> with<00:04:03.030> the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
actually release pressure with the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.680 
actually release pressure with the
fingers<00:04:03.540> so<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.770> will<00:04:05.070> be<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.300> estacado<00:04:06.300> as

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
fingers so that it will be a estacado as

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.840 
fingers so that it will be a estacado as
sad<00:04:06.900> as<00:04:07.080> possible<00:04:07.620> meaning<00:04:08.460> that<00:04:08.580> it's<00:04:08.730> as

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
sad as possible meaning that it's as

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:18.199 
sad as possible meaning that it's as
short<00:04:09.150> as<00:04:09.360> possible<00:04:14.960> and<00:04:16.820> reggae<00:04:17.820> guitar
