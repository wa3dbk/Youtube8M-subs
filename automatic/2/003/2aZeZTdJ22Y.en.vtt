Atari and 8-bit Nintendo some of the
games<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.960> got<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.810> whopping<00:00:28.250> 32

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
games that we got here are a whopping 32

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.280 
games that we got here are a whopping 32
kilobytes<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.800> we<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.980> go<00:00:32.099> down<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.430> our<00:00:33.290> 16

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
kilobytes or we can go down to our 16

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.150 
kilobytes or we can go down to our 16
kilobytes<00:00:35.030> which<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:37.160> unbelievable

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
kilobytes which is unbelievable

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010 
kilobytes which is unbelievable
considering<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.030> don't<00:00:39.390> think<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.629> remembered

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
considering I don't think I remembered

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.990 
considering I don't think I remembered
down<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.680> last<00:00:40.860> time<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.100> downloaded<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.640> file

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
down the last time I downloaded a file

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.420 
down the last time I downloaded a file
that<00:00:42.300> was<00:00:42.420> only<00:00:42.629> 16<00:00:43.079> kilobytes<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.860> 32

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that was only 16 kilobytes or 32

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.529 
that was only 16 kilobytes or 32
kilobytes<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> whole<00:00:46.260> game<00:00:49.280> anyway

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
kilobytes so it's the whole game anyway

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.490 
kilobytes so it's the whole game anyway
well<00:00:51.539> today<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:53.190> we'll<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.079> we'll<00:00:55.079> put<00:00:55.320> in

kind of like a joystick I really
honestly<00:03:10.299> don't<00:03:10.810> understand<00:03:11.440> why<00:03:11.709> they<00:03:11.950> would

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100

want to have it but yeah I got the two
inside<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.060> box<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:19.769> controllers<00:03:20.769> snap<00:03:21.040> in

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
inside the box and controllers snap in

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.780 
inside the box and controllers snap in
on<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> side<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.000> plug<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:22.900> on<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.260> back

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
for trying to pull the cord out you end

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.700 
for trying to pull the cord out you end
up<00:03:29.019> turning<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.410> whole<00:03:29.530> system<00:03:29.859> around

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
up turning the whole system around

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.910 
up turning the whole system around
