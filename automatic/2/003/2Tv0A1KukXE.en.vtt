00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.540
 and then youtube, I'm linux bsd 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.990
 touch with samsung galaxy s 4g go 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.139
 talk again about moving the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.279
 applications or games for your 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.960
 memory is in something new here is in the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.580
 version 4.3 if I'm not mistaken, it's new, I am 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 I think he did not have it on block 22 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.349
 for example when you see in the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.590
 application management for example 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:37.290
 we have here the downloaded're having a 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.579
 I've already explained why I did not 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.870
 I can move 99% of these people I 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 I can not die by memory card 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.660
 now we have here the sd card 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.910
 we have been running and everyone there is not 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.820
 It is showing two now to you the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.829
 sd card because I just put them down 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.440
 here for the phone but I want 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.620
 explain something else to you 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.170
 when we come here in the download 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.500
 what appears to me is an act 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 also that the barometer 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.560
 defends and maintains that this time or 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.799
 button or it's lipsticks 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.390
 but what happens or the android it only 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.000
 lets you move to the memory card 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.509
 these two here the other two he does not 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.580
 Let me install it and do not leave the rest 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.909
 that 's there he did not leave because he's coming 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.860
 together with the operating system is 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.530
 locked if it is locked and you do not 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.960
 Can move karton if you want 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.860
 One day you can do it but that's not the one. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.770
 issue here 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.560
 the device is not routed as usual 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.060
 I speak to you and always is to make 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.399
 correct form 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.990
 so why do not these two also not 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.100
 lets die because the system 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.450
 operational 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.350
 it should it must determine that btm bdt 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.619
 in that determined it determines that 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.829
 some games apps and not 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.069
 even because it is something that he 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.530
 in the main memory of the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.650
 cell phone and it needs to be in 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.590
 memory in the memory 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.870
 storage and not on the sd card 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.670
 while you play, no problem, you? 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.980
 can move by sd card 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.939
 without any problem and the barometer also 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.049
 he does not miss seeing you guys going to see 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:32.659
 proving here the manager of 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.269
 applications we have all this world 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:38.000
 no one can move me 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.799
 memory card with the exception of 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.950
 Dude, what I told you. 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.049
 he already appears here defends of question 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:50.780
 but we'll see, for example, hi 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:53.230
 okay on that score well on that score the 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.959
 people will try to move it does not leave the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.349
 Government understands it's blocked to 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:05.120
 promote while pro game 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:13.639
 O here it can then then we 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:16.370
 dying move 5.80 and a dollar he has 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:21.799
 total now seven points 89 with 1 point 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:25.129
 77 that is here on the mobile phone and the pt 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.650
 sd card 6.12 mega or so it 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:31.909
 transferred 6.12 - to the card 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.209
 Let's check here now, oh dollar. 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:37.400
 is marked moving there we can 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.769
 simply click here and click here 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.049
 He already fell straight you do not have to stay. 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.900
 choosing which you can not move 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.540
 any process of those is that 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.209
 technical kiss then leaves this list 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.400
 then it makes your life easier 31 points and 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:04:03.979
 Let's see how much is going to move the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:12.790
 sd card has personal space for failure 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:17.840
 to error and there 29 points 50 pro card and 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.039
 2005 for here the cell phone is 50 almost 50 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.729
 51 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.480
 It's ticked and you want to clear it. 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.690
 You come here, uncheck it and send it. 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.180
 move back pro to mobile 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.350
 here for the management is 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.750
 indifferent 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.460
 yeah if you enter obviously you enter 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.710
 here it is already with the information 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.000
 updated and is selling just wanted 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.720
 show that it is a 77 mega point here 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.620
 How much is taking up space on your cell phone? 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.910
 not in total the staff did not leave 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.610
 very clear to you and what happens 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.160
 if I come here and pull the card 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.950
 memory that I will not do it now 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.030
 it disappears with these two icons 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.790
 here he is not he is simply 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.590
 disappears because because the cell phone it 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.360
 He's reading every moment he's reading. 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.660
 memory card 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.330
 He's removed, he does not have any more than 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.460
 although he has an indication of the lord 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.970
 Look I have two uptons games that 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.190
 are on the memory card and it does it 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.660
 when he gives the boot or when 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.600
 Are you going to do something about it? 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.800
 check the game is on the tartan card 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.840
 beauty continues here 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.260
 batman in a moment you take it out 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.350
 he is not gone then he disappears 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.450
 So, folks, something else is yours. 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.700
 phone is taking too long or gives error 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.070
 at the time you execute for example the 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.190
 game may have a problem your card 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.710
 memory then you download the game pro 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.410
 cell if it can not download 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.660
 idea you have to clean forests and install 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.460
 Mom left again and leaves it on the cell phone. 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.290
 and exchanging memory is taking too long 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.490
 to upload applications here too 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:11.610
 to show show the screen that he 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.250
 mount the carton unit can be 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.650
 problem with your memory card 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.370
 a lot of personal attention as I told you 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.900
 you 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.930
 it pays to pay a little more 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.540
 with a card and from a card 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.870
 original is being a whole country at 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.900
 Sometimes the side of the tent is even 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.360
 even the original card than in the store 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.520
 understood to be very careful 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.720
 that's all I ask you all is fine 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.860
 staff so this is more choice 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.420
 o move it now to the 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.730
 card applications or games . 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.730
 memory I already explained another video 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.710
 because all these icons here all 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.410
 these afp zaki I 'll say Maria goes with 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.410
 all these atp and stepped games is not 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:59.080
 possible to move the card because it does 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.070
 part of the operating system is locked 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.380
 and can not 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.080
 but as I said if you want to rudi give 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.210
 for you to move it to the card 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.730
 memory if I'm not mistaken there's a person 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.550
 of the work he did the last of three 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.890
 him and said that it is time to reverse 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.660
 he turned the memory card 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.720
 and memory and storage memory , and 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.320
 card stock he made 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.630
 that 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.720
 only I started to stick sometimes 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.400
 so he had to go back to the theater 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.919
 his gadget and everything else 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.980
 Then he came back and said no, do not let 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:37.870
 Keep quiet and that 's good. 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:39.790
 the conversation was really about how 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.800
 The staff are good, if you like 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.460
 your young man and left a message thank you 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.460
 more
