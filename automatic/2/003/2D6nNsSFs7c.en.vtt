00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.920
 of course, I want to love you too 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.819
 at this point at fuji tv da come 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.980
 I do not even stop it 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.809
 a little bit what to say to uli hoeneß that is 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.940
 a bang what in the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.100
 negotiation came out in general 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.320
 the fact that he is massive 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.020
 has then evaded taxes in which 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.900
 height that really was playing 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.880
 and then, of course, about the verdict 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.349
 discussed and again above really 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.820
 from day to day fiercely next to it now 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.040
 his renouncement of all offices at the fc 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.480
 Bayern Munich for me actually one 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.790
 of course then, too 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.780
 the waiver of the revision 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.760
 First, the defense still 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.129
 had announced 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.719
 and he will go to jail like 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.039
 For a long time he really has to serve up 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.219
 this three and a half years 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.320
 That was the judgment you will see 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.770
 Of course it is a tremendous one 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.360
 emotional theme as you can see if you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.370
 what posts on facebook if you have something 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.770
 twitter if you are in the pub 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.719
 somewhere else with people that speaks 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.510
 It's clear it's about football 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.510
 Emotionally it is about a crime 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.890
 Control is also a whole 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.299
 special story and that since the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.229
 beating waves is clear where I am 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.090
 always just for that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.630
 and there are many discussions about that 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.220
 also posted a facebook post 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.020
 a little differentiated one should that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.640
 So, of course, you can look at everything 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.200
 uli hoeneß now no more than 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.310
 consider moral authority as the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.259
 certainly always yourself 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.909
 that has stopped working 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.729
 By the way, that's the only one 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.290
 history of totally flat or the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.329
 I totally flattened myself in that 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.780
 I would like that personally 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.670
 ask why he until half past one 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.350
 Year to a year ago always as 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.430
 moral instance has occurred too 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.750
 especially when it came to tax sins that went 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.000
 I do not understand it does not understand 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.799
 if you have to know that you're on 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.170
 the other side does something wrong thing 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.060
 is that I do not understand that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.619
 story where it actually is for me 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.820
 Two personalities are still possible 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.450
 I do not get far from it either 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.700
 that me 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.969
 give them what they want with the FC Bayern 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.860
 Munich player manager manager 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.739
 managed and created admire 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.390
 I also always speak of success 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.430
 but very very respectful 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.069
 when it says you have uli hoeneß today 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.480
 in the interview 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.610
 he was someone to look up to 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.400
 Of course that has done for the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.019
 person personality uli hoeneß that 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.049
 Unfortunately, I just have to be so clear 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.530
 say for his accomplishments and doing at the fc 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.360
 Bavaria 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.400
 Of course you can do that completely 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.450
 There is always also cutting off 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.260
 discussions yes we have to too 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.569
 account 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.730
 The man has so much social commitment 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.549
 I have always shown that too 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.049
 admired 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.180
 it remains a bland taste because 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.790
 Of course I can easily 5 6 7 8 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.310
 Donate millions and thus in need 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.430
 do something good if I have 30 million 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.360
 So control evade this is the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.910
 is for me then just something else 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.860
 Sorry but I can not get out of my skin 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.720
 I still want to go outside anyway 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.130
 this video also appeal to all 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.049
 which is still with the big one 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.400
 they still get a blow on it 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.620
 Union , it is still a human being 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.299
 yes I know he does not have others either 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.620
 always made easy yes yes I know 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.450
 everything but so funny it sounds like that 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.230
 I also mentioned a few things here 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.230
 I do not like it that much 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.040
 the choice no i did not have from 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.329
 bad people in fact me 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.450
 consider him a criminal 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.190
 he has been convicted for that 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.900
 he certainly was in for him 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.450
 not just his world he does 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.209
 now and in the end 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.829
 of course that took a while 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.720
 tough the consequences and that 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.400
 I guess that will be the end effect 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.290
 after some back and forth 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.549
 a disposal with you because there is absolutely 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.680
 nothing to discuss with it you should 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.090
 finish the topic at this point as well 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.560
 do not always have to go on like that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.540
 the fc bavaria munich continues 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.010
 club with his football games in 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.380
 continue to be of great regularity 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.790
 winning the club is also thanks to uli 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.739
 Hoeneß so positioned that now 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.970
 Not everything will collapse 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.349
 I do not really see black 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.150
 maybe one more thing 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.130
 bit irritated how long it has been 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.230
 Has lasted 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.650
 until the supervisory board to the supervisory board 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.720
 really sponsor a statement 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.550
 it comes to this whole story that 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.709
 I have to say a little bit to me 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.980
 took a long time that the fans of the fc 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.260
 bavaria that the club members very much 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.640
 extremely behind uli hoeneß stand this 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.090
 lies in the nature of things i would 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.160
 say 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.690
 there are many there too 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.950
 differentiate people but somewhere is 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.510
 like a big family 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.420
 and then one is a not so easy 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.060
 fall and that may sound now 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.190
 strange that is certainly quite 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.560
 well so i wish uli hoeneß and his 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.360
 family in any case much power for 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.640
 the next month will be all right 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.710
 Certainly not easy and hope 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.120
 then for that topic at this point 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.920
 is also really able to finish her 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.450
 can still write your opinion 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.720
 here under the video here is the 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:01.470
 possibility to get rid of something 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.870
 Why do I want to succeed in the 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.160
 network social media area certainly not 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.850
 But that's what I always did 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.380
 very well under control 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.670
 I just want it 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.620
 that's why the whole thing goes on in the frame 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.330
 would like to say what you think about it 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.740
 Hold what we have done 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.300
 now with the verdict bypasses what I from 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.770
 The verdict hold no problem at all 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.230
 I would also next week 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.950
 But it please enter please keep 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.140
 In the honesty that would be nice 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.970
 yes that was it for this topic no 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.530
 by the way also for journalists 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.930
 long waited until I mean mine 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.910
 column at n tv.de wrote that me 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.440
 I expressed myself on facebook because I am only 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.690
 can assess a bit 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.490
 wanted what is really the situation and 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.370
 what really happens in the know 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.260
 reason only since the verdict 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.940
 and now with the consequence of uli 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.110
 hoeneß before I really courage her 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.730
 monument should you 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.060
 However, there must also be how to handle 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.270
 Can not build comments here 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.270
 underneath
