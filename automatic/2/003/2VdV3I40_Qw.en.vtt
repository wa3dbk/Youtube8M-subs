00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello dear people to successor mansell 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.069
 project facts about yu gi oh I have 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.020
 this project before times 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.639
 started somehow back then as a pangea 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 still exists and the dinosaurs the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.309
 So world populated so before six 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.320
 about the beginning of a channel 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.230
 I thought at that time did not say 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.279
 you start with youtube and me 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.680
 as really fun, though 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.480
 At that time I do not really have any 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.000
 had quality standard and the videos 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.820
 have been pretty god I have to be like that 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.470
 say pretty bad today 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.210
 Of course I still do not have one 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.370
 high quali does not qualify high 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.050
 quality standard but he is at least 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.649
 then in the other direction was also 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.960
 no more space 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.050
 Anyway , I thought so why 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.219
 because do not try it again 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.190
 starts again from the beginning with this 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.440
 series gives her a cooler name and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.100
 Makes all the old facts again was mine 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.949
 not many 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.579
 Therefore, I welcome to the successor now 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.629
 already known with the beautiful name 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.629
 epic a blender animation 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.840
 the first fact of today 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.700
 is about the three gadgets 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.490
 I think that's what I forgot my 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 said three gadgets three not 23 okay 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.720
 that's 23 now 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.000
 but I think that one twice and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.550
 What kind of apparatus should that be? 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.620
 The blue apparatus now again right 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:36.900
 Now you know that the 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:40.950
 gadgets look like gears have that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.530
 you know how embarrassing you are 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.840
 also already knew that in the background 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.330
 this phase again gears 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.860
 are already pictured then 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.979
 I comfortable with the selection of facts but 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.070
 but should be more critical 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.050
 okay, I still have one and that 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.790
 gears on a gadget 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.369
 The images are always exactly the same 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.110
 color of the apparatus weiligmann by the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.220
 effect of the apparatus can pick up on the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.180
 they are pictured 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.930
 Did you already know that? No fits 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.880
 but one in three good cut 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.020
 and what else did you know that up 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.340
 every field has lightning too 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.850
 are shown in the background and there 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.920
 there and help and the flashes on 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.720
 have shown an apparatus 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.580
 again always exactly the color of the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.700
 apparatus through which the apparatus 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.520
 gets on which they are pictured 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.810
 apparatus section as far as the first fact 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.819
 let's come to the second 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.680
 Be careful of the following facts 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.480
 not for spectators under 16 years 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.670
 suitable because he worth knowing 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.760
 or instructive include 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.380
 might be fun aside, but ok 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.880
 honestly the following is likely 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.790
 the most meaningful facts not in the 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.620
 entire format will ever bring 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.420
 if he wants to learn something as something then hear 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.080
 if you do not want to learn anything 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.360
 Please leave this room immediately 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.310
 Thank you so much we come now so 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.860
 finally for the second time 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.150
 Actually I do not know how you were 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.980
 but I have often asked myself 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.680
 How often is this card now? 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.540
 at all 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.480
 if i have any important card 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.790
 Always say slime breeders three times 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.260
 tecture into how often I will because 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.510
 pull 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.370
 I once presented this in 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.379
 Shape of a tree diagrams 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.730
 it's actually pretty easy with it 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.219
 a few simple ones 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.500
 and with the rules of the 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:38.739
 tree chart of course you come 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.590
 finally to the result 39 43 3% 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.840
 or pretty much 40 percent of that 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.150
 equals 25 that is, as you will 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.790
 the card if you institute it three times 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.900
 at a deck with 40 cards in two of 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.340
 pull five duels 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.109
 then next, maybe not 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.849
 quite so useful but has not 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.650
 less interesting fact about the map 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.540
 shimmering dragon I just hope you all 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.969
 Schumacher knows what he looks like 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.430
 and that he is in the English truck dragon 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.810
 means or or leister dragon i have 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.569
 no idea how I pronounce the 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.310
 I have no english any more 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.930
 There is also a lot of course 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.120
 want a kite 2 this is called rate 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.310
 but that's what it's called in 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.870
 English truck dragon 2 or 2 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.909
 But not since ever since 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.860
 if you look at the very early issue 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:29.620
 you will notice this fish 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.650
 that it did not last dragon 2 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.919
 or 2 was just called vice 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:41.530
 why do not I have that 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.570
 the slightest trace of kites is shown 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.099
 a brÃ¼ller, but in this case 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.900
 more likely a pusher to pokÃ©mon 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.479
 definition in which everyone gets rid of if he 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.270
 listen to this record and now by her 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:55.030
 brightest jokes in the darkest 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.840
 deepest cruelest scary of the 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.300
 blackest scary evil 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.340
 horrible hell in the dark world 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.949
 And this fact turns to the 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.740
 Names of the 15 world monsters and that means 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.389
 every window world monster like either 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.849
 a color or a metal 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:20.050
 there are things orange green green star 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:23.139
 scarlet kg kg and many more 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.420
 more and every window world monster 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.520
 also has a clothes 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.140
 body parts armor parts so accurate 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.230
 one does not say that with those 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.880
 in his name color the last fact 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.650
 is comparatively boring nevertheless 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.460
 is the story connected with it 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.040
 is better 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.650
 and although I have a few days in 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.720
 Ebay looking for the map big eye 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.070
 because I thought I wants me 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.560
 At some point I wanted to buy 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.200
 just know how much I cost myself 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.930
 see it on ebay the entry big eye 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.250
 no picture unfortunately the guy has apparently 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.130
 no camera or you will not always 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.790
 that puts in there a euro three more 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.460
 hours 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.150
 So I offer and what happens to me 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.120
 stop getting that big eye for 150 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.800
 Unfortunately, it is not this big eye 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.400
 but rather this one here 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.880
 I noticed that Russian eye gave it 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.880
 it ever
