 Hi everyone , how are you? 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.950
 in today's video I will teach you the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.139
 stage is so famous wreath 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.140
 and I know I should have passed before 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.070
 everybody already did but later than 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.529
 no never 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.550
 But to make us we'll need 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.699
 artificial flowers a string cord 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.300
 you're home 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.300
 beetle and hot glue 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.770
 we're going to start cutting first 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.440
 three equal parts of the cord 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.460
 I asked my head and I left about 15 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.870
 centimeters the side of each side 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.180
 Now let's lend a hand one of the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.020
 tips that go out somewhere and franz 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 until the end 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.280
 now we're going to the best part that 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.380
 will adorn france that we did 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.330
 as you can see I have a plant 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.830
 in the end also to give the finishing and 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.960
 running on the floor 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.940
 now I'll put it above the format 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.290
 that will stay in my head leaving 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.910
 by the works and with the little flowers and I go 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.610
 catch my little foot 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.660
 that's the way he is from that era me 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.870
 very thin 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:33.910
 so I cut the tip of trash only 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.910
 so for me to roll on the string 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.259
 I 'm spreading there riding more or 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.670
 less the way I want it to 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.670
 then fixed 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.710

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.460

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.810
 to handle 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.810

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.379

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.390
