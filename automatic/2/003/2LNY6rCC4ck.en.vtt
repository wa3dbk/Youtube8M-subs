00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.960 

so<00:00:01.650> you<00:00:01.709> notice<00:00:02.010> what<00:00:02.129> I've<00:00:02.250> done<00:00:02.429> here<00:00:02.490> is

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
so you notice what I've done here is

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.530 
so you notice what I've done here is
I've<00:00:03.480> created<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.840> link<00:00:04.110> table<00:00:04.529> essentially

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
I've created a link table essentially

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.330 
I've created a link table essentially
this<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.810> course<00:00:06.839> just<00:00:07.319> an<00:00:07.440> example<00:00:07.589> it's<00:00:08.250> a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
this is of course just an example it's a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.190 
this is of course just an example it's a
sample<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.910> shouldn't<00:00:09.570> really<00:00:09.630> necessarily

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
sample that shouldn't really necessarily

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.249 
sample that shouldn't really necessarily
be<00:00:10.610> taken<00:00:11.610> literally<00:00:12.049> because<00:00:13.049> there<00:00:13.200> are

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
be taken literally because there are

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.349 
be taken literally because there are
many<00:00:13.410> other<00:00:13.559> ways<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.549> example<00:00:16.070> right

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
many other ways to for example right

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.810 
many other ways to for example right
link<00:00:18.359> text<00:00:18.660> but<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> give<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.590> an<00:00:19.680> idea<00:00:19.820> I've

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
link text but to give you an idea I've

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.939 
link text but to give you an idea I've
created<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.270> table<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.410> let's<00:00:22.590> say<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.740> had<00:00:22.920> a

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
created this table so let's say I had a

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.429 
created this table so let's say I had a
company<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:24.019> specialized<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.109> office

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
company that specialized in office

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.609 
company that specialized in office
supplies<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.689> for<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> particular<00:00:28.080> section

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
supplies and for the particular section

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.609 
supplies and for the particular section
that<00:00:28.740> I'm<00:00:28.830> focused<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.630> it's<00:00:30.630> mainly<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.410> dry

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that I'm focused on it's mainly the dry

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.560 
that I'm focused on it's mainly the dry
eraser<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.130> whiteboard<00:00:32.669> product<00:00:33.239> business

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
eraser and whiteboard product business

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.310 
eraser and whiteboard product business
so<00:00:34.440> I've<00:00:34.559> got<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:34.739> five<00:00:35.040> keywords<00:00:35.309> here

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
so I've got my five keywords here

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.530 
so I've got my five keywords here
starting<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.350> dry<00:00:37.649> erase<00:00:37.950> markers<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
starting with dry erase markers I have a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.360 
starting with dry erase markers I have a
column<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.379> starting<00:00:40.739> page<00:00:40.920> which<00:00:41.160> means

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
column for the starting page which means

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.650 
column for the starting page which means
the<00:00:41.550> page<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.270> link<00:00:42.800> resides<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:44.660> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the page that the link resides on the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.840 
the page that the link resides on the
landing<00:00:46.050> page<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> page<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.370> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
link is pointing to and then the link

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.040 
link is pointing to and then the link
text<00:00:50.309> which<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> text<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.539> i<00:00:51.690> should<00:00:51.870> use

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
text which is the text that i should use

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.720 
text which is the text that i should use

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
within the link on the starting page so

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.240 
within the link on the starting page so
