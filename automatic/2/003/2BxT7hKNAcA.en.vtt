00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
about the far number being the aiming

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.630 
about the far number being the aiming
point<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.450> its<00:00:39.629> side<00:00:39.899> tackle<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.710> side<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.430> as

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
where we have the the boundary as as our

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.330 
where we have the the boundary as as our
12th<00:00:48.030> defender<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.170> tell<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> kids<00:00:50.039> hey

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
12th defender now we tell the kids hey

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.189 
12th defender now we tell the kids hey
you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.760> nose<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.539> little<00:00:51.750> bit<00:00:51.989> more

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
you can nose it up a little bit more

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.770 
you can nose it up a little bit more
heavily<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.489> need<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.360> your<00:00:54.570> head

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
heavily you don't need to get your head

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.350 
heavily you don't need to get your head
across<00:00:55.129> quite<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.309> much<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:56.820> he's<00:00:57.149> got

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
across quite as much because he's got

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.340 
across quite as much because he's got
nowhere<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> go

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
nowhere to go

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.849 
nowhere to go
so<00:00:58.920> by<00:00:59.129> nosing<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.120> mean<00:01:00.300> usually<00:01:01.230> with

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
so by nosing it up I mean usually with

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
so by nosing it up I mean usually with
our<00:01:02.070> head<00:01:02.280> being<00:01:02.520> across<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> side<00:01:03.510> tackle

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
our head being across on a side tackle

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320 
our head being across on a side tackle
we<00:01:04.080> say<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> far<00:01:04.890> number<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.909> can

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
we say it's the far number now we can

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
we say it's the far number now we can
say<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> near<00:01:07.200> shoulder<00:01:07.740> pad<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
say it's the near shoulder pad of the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.330 
say it's the near shoulder pad of the
running<00:01:08.939> back<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.420> our<00:01:09.930> aiming<00:01:10.380> point<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.189> we

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
running back as our aiming point so we

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
running back as our aiming point so we
say<00:01:11.520> nose<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.210> through<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> near<00:01:12.780> shoulder

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
say nose it up through the near shoulder

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
say nose it up through the near shoulder
nose<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.950> through<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> near<00:01:14.430> shoulder<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
nose it up through the near shoulder the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.090 
nose it up through the near shoulder the
second<00:01:15.960> thing<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.290> I've<00:01:16.500> already<00:01:16.830> talked

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
second thing is I've already talked

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.280 
second thing is I've already talked
about<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.700> use<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.420> sidelines<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.110> your

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
about it is use the sidelines as your

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.219 
about it is use the sidelines as your
12th<00:01:19.710> man<00:01:20.509> still<00:01:21.509> want<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.780> stay<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.200> good

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
12th man still want to stay in a good

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.039 
12th man still want to stay in a good
heavy<00:01:22.710> hip<00:01:23.009> pocket<00:01:23.430> relationship<00:01:24.180> maybe<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
heavy hip pocket relationship maybe a

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.039 
heavy hip pocket relationship maybe a
little<00:01:25.409> bit<00:01:25.590> heavier<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.909> his<00:01:27.090> inside<00:01:27.540> than

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
little bit heavier to his inside than

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.230 
little bit heavier to his inside than
you<00:01:28.080> would<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.770> normal<00:01:28.799> side<00:01:29.520> tackle

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
you would in a normal side tackle

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.230 
you would in a normal side tackle
because<00:01:30.750> again<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.979> most<00:01:32.220> dangerous<00:01:32.820> cut

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
because again the most dangerous cut

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
because again the most dangerous cut
when<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> guy's<00:01:34.110> running<00:01:34.560> down<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.950> field<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
when a guy's running down the field is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.630 
when a guy's running down the field is
the<00:01:36.030> cutback<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.079> let's<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.470> over<00:01:38.100> run<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the cutback so let's not over run it and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.149 
the cutback so let's not over run it and
run<00:01:38.970> out<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.270> Bounce<00:01:39.479> again<00:01:40.170> let's<00:01:40.470> keep<00:01:40.799> him

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
run out of Bounce again let's keep him

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.389 
run out of Bounce again let's keep him
build<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.210> wall<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.750> keep<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:44.040> running

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
build a wall and keep that that running

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.219 
build a wall and keep that that running
back<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.000> wide<00:01:45.270> receiver<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:46.079> the

outside edge between your body and the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
outside edge between your body and the
