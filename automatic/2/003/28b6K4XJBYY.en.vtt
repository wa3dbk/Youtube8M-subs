00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:18.440
 that's for me 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.440
 I will drive out the demons of the past 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.980
 spit blade is not bad but I am a knight cloak and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.250
 dagger 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:38.690
 you will not believe how famously slip on 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:42.290
 board ship a little jump for me 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:52.379
 but a huge jump for everything 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:57.960
 mankind that it was my general 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:04.530
 it turned out a long speech 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:07.820
 their molting curvature it's stylish i 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.479
 should use your abilities 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.350
 a number and enemy heroes also need 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:23.430
 find out why I'm talking all the time 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:28.939
 with itself yes not gloomy news not 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.939
 fear don't just like that talk about 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.189
 my union 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.479
 but we are not too fisher them and 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.479
 emptiness will be jealous 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.710
 there is a prophecy of the elect to 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.210
 carries a balance and 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.110
 oh this is a little prophecy and we would 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.110
 condemned 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.460
 strange anatomy if all people 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:08.190
 one finger contrasted the other way 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:11.910
 normally hold weapons darkness wraps 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.830
 I'm generally hampered by the collection 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.170
 movements 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.170
 Anyone know how to stop it 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.600
 only sometimes i want to return to 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.000
 light 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.000
 maybe we can sunbathe on the beach 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.590
 long time soothsayer from our 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.240
 no people said the appearance of the hero 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:49.640
 which will lead my blade to victory 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:49.640
 so this is not about you and this to me 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.820
