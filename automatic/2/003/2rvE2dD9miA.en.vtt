00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 hi i am andrés I spend my life between 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.250
 music flavors and a little exercise 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.950
 Welcome to my channel together 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.170
 we will learn that feeding exercise 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.299
 and doing what we like the most is the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.460
 combination indicated to maintain the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.460
 health be fit and senses 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.390
 Y 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.470
 yesterday was a sunny day and I took it 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.890
 to try a while and buy something to 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.890
 Cook 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.000
 I came to a market that I like a lot 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.640
 because there I find fresh foods 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.559
 and I do not usually use much 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.750
 most industrial foods 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.820
 they lose part of the nutrients and 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.090
 They contain preservatives and other additives 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.310
 which is better consulted by don Reynaldo 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.530
 they always have fresh vegetables and they 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.570
 I bought some lettuce mushrooms and 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.170
 tomatoes for this service that today 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.170
 they want to teach 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.350
 This ceviche is very easy to prepare and 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.930
 You can use it as a salad as 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.990
 snacks or as a protein intake 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.299
 vegetable in a main dish besides 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.030
 you can refrigerate it from one day to the next 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.950
 and so take it to work to the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.950
 university or where you need 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.430
 with a dry towel clean well 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.070
 mushrooms you never wet them because 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.970
 remember that they should always damage 7 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.560
 leftovers 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.360
 do not forget to keep them inside a 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.750
 plastic bag with some paper 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.790
 absorbent and in the refrigerator cut them in 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.530
 thin sheets or you can even 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.330
 cut them into squares if you want 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.330
 place them then on some cookies 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.100
 cut the onion into small squares 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.660
 try from time to time to use onions 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.610
 of different colors 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.230
 each one has very different flavors and aromas 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.970
 different 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.970
 cut a bit of fresh tomato 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.250
 Squeeze an orange and add a little 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.440
 organic tomato paste is a bit of 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.440
 cilantro or basil and add leave 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.440
 mix all the ingredients 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.720
 they accompany leaving with some source of 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.909
 complex carbohydrates like for example 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.970
 a crispy corn or flour 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.970
 integral 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.380
