Okay I finally found um unrefined shea butter
and it's um 100% pure and it's unrefined and

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.299
it's fairly traded so it's really important
for me to have purity um for the unrefined

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.539
shea butter and that it would be fairly traded
so um.. yeah and I found it it was actually

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.680
found at a co-op a community owned organic
um health food store and they didn't.. before

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.579
they didn't carry it because I used to ask
them all the time if they carried it and I

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:42.680
kept bugging them about it.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:01:03.219
This is um sixteen ounces.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:22.640
Okay so the wonderful creamy feeling that
um I love to talk about with shea butter this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.720
unrefined shea butter is like pure super thick
cream so I'm really..

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.280
The smell, the smell it has like a nutty kind
of like a nutty smell to it I think it smells

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:43.119
good it just smells like a natural like, you
know product from a tree so, I'm really excited

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.360
and I was able to get a lot of it too...and
uh the ultra refined shea butter that um I

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.540
tried had more of an oily feeling to it, and
then the refined, just standard refined, I

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.930
believe it's refined with water had like a
creamier feeling to it, like a thicker cream

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.500
feeling but this stuff is like I almost want
to say it feels like butter, like buttery

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.180
clay because it's so thick and amazing.
