an<00:01:49.970> underdog<00:01:50.300> I<00:01:50.750> think<00:01:51.560> there's<00:01:51.710> definitely<00:01:51.770> a

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
an underdog I think there's definitely a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.060 
an underdog I think there's definitely a
lot<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.400> fans<00:01:52.580> out<00:01:52.850> there<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:53.300> think<00:01:53.650> maybe<00:01:54.650> I

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
lot of fans out there that think maybe I

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.310 
lot of fans out there that think maybe I
will<00:01:55.580> be<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:55.910> second<00:01:56.180> place<00:01:56.360> guy<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:57.050> in<00:01:57.170> my

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
will be the second place guy but in my

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:12.610 
will be the second place guy but in my
opinion<00:01:57.440> that's<00:01:57.860> not<00:01:58.100> going<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.340> have<00:01:58.490> it

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.750 

the<00:02:13.620> loss<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:13.829> definitely<00:02:14.430> strong<00:02:14.730> he's

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the loss is definitely strong he's

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.399 
the loss is definitely strong he's
stronger<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.629> year<00:02:15.689> than<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.049> think<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.290> have

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
stronger this year than I think you have

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.800 
stronger this year than I think you have
been<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.769> past<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.609> he<00:02:17.849> has<00:02:17.999> he<00:02:18.450> has<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.599> lot

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
been in the past but he has he has a lot

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.319 
been in the past but he has he has a lot
