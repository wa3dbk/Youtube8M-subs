 U 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:17.370
 2 go Hello 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:21.390
 Oh, no .

 The phone is coming 5 I can love or not 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:31.400
 Now the phone is bright. It's still pitcher Perth. Yeah . 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:37.970
 I could use it, but I would have divided it. 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:44.230
 Oh, well, why are you making and eating? 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:48.010
 Oh why do you do this today Let's do something with my friend Saw 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.519
 Fight your opponent. 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.449
 If you get used to it , 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.760
 The lifespan of a 1-year-old cellular phone is rather long 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.339
 The 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.339
 It's not like a year . 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.140
 7 8 0 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.890
 Commodity in this age is indispensable in these days 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.670
 It's a cell phone and a computer. 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:20.800
 How soon will it be better to cross? 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.710
 Kim Jungah helps align the two days we will solve Would Thanks to the game 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.030
 I'll start with the phone. 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 Mobile phones account for the highest percentage of home appliance sales 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.450
 I have. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.200
 What a cellphone so life is somewhat 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.930
 5 I 'm looking at this one. 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.890
 Generally, the contract period is two years. 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.010
 Will get a short two years gatguyo phones coming from about the year now I 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.470
 At least three years can be seen until about four years. 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:03.740
 Chapter 4 # more phone replacement cycle of managing and studying the past 3 years 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:10.640
 Factors that determine the life of the battery and the phone is very lcd screens der pattern of 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.720
 The screen distance is actually kept constantly and everyday, the parts will eventually become mules 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.800
 I can not help but notice 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:20.270
 So, the time is fixed, and now also the lcd screen 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.290
 We have a fixed number of scream times. So if you take an example 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:28.760
 For a typical 30,000 hour lcd scream, such as a well rib method , 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:34.520
 Much time do so because consumers are actually talking piece, the more talk switch 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:39.160
 3 I do not want to worry because it is available for 4 years or more Yes 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.160
 Let's take a look at life on the pc. 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:48.500
 We j3 Xiangshan 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:52.940
 Bean rides the time when I was young, deep computing, we write if I roll it up 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.630
 Oh, by writing to the force grandmother.Nice deulsu naopnikka just keep the new models 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.230
 I used this laptop a lot when I actually hit it. 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.280
 Now, no matter what this power is, this program does not work. 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.959
 4 write 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:11.350
 Could you do it with a lifetime? 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.350
 I went to Yongsan where there is a master on the computer . 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:19.430
 Taemin Fuck the results on the computer expert 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:24.260
 V What is intelligence 4 members 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:28.850
 I look into it with a professional hand 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:33.530
 2 connected to the 12 page 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.350
 If you have a problem to choose, or this lcd has reached its end of life 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.660
 If the output does not work, 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:47.239
 There is an easy my life is something that every product and every component life 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:50.380
 It's wrong. Usually desktops or laptops should be well managed in a decade. 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.380
 For more than 10 years 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:59.700
 4 If you are just a simple internet or word work model, 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.070
 If you are using high-end games or specialized programs 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:07.650
 It's a half-life. 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:08.670
 Oh , the longer you run this program for a long time , 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.510
 Going up 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.260
 If you think that the mouse pc life will decrease as the pc temperature goes up 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.630
 It's possible 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.090
 If you write on a cell phone, the life span of the 3 year pc depends on how you manage 10 years more 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.590
 The fact that it may increase or decrease 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:30.990
 The management method is important to that extent . 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:35.280
 Because it is sensitive, it is advisable not to use it at places too high or low. 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:40.500
 And in the case of a cell phone, you can increase the life span even if you manage only the battery. 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:44.370
 The battery on a single charge, and wrote the following to the end as possible. Oh, then again in 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.570
 I think you should use alternating batteries now . 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.760
 I do not think there will be a lot of rushing with sd life, 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.590
 It's not so good . 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:05:00.000
 In case of PC, dust management and periodic power off are required 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:05.550
 If there is a lot of dust, the game will suffer a lot of performance degradation and shorten the life span 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.320
 So , once a year, I clean my PC loan 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.060
 We recommend you remove it and use it 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:17.890
 If you are using the PC for more than 5 hours for 5 to 10 minutes 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:23.620
 You can turn it off for a while and then turn it on again for a longer time 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:27.280
 Enter today's report First queue backbone Complement killing Screening charge 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:33.160
 If you write about 100% of the battery, you are sure to do it. 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:35.620
 In the second mom, the computer replacement cycle is 10 years . 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:40.090
 You must turn it off and then on again. 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:46.060
 The last three new products are tempting. 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:50.400
 You should keep your contract for a longer period of time. 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.400
 Please note that you can use
