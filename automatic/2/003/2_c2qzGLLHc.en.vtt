in<00:03:50.609> my<00:03:50.850> portion<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.480> double<00:03:51.750> digging<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.260> do

in my portion of the double digging I do
my<00:03:52.859> own<00:03:52.980> stunts<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:54.299> idea<00:03:54.570> is<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.750> when<00:03:54.989> you

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
my own stunts the idea is that when you

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.349 
my own stunts the idea is that when you
finish<00:03:55.260> you've<00:03:55.739> got<00:03:55.920> about<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.160> 24<00:03:56.760> plus<00:03:57.060> inch

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
finish you've got about a 24 plus inch

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.420 
finish you've got about a 24 plus inch
