this night has a couple challenges for
sharpening<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.640> one<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> reasons<00:00:45.000> our

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
sharpening and one of the reasons our

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.389 
sharpening and one of the reasons our
customer<00:00:45.539> contacted<00:00:46.110> us<00:00:46.200> was<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.800> we

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
customer contacted us was to see if we

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.830 
customer contacted us was to see if we
would<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.640> any<00:00:47.820> trouble<00:00:48.180> with<00:00:48.360> these

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
would have any trouble with these

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.279 
would have any trouble with these
different<00:00:49.520> geometries<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:51.000> chisel<00:00:51.510> point

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
different geometries this chisel point

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.279 
different geometries this chisel point
here<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.489> these<00:00:53.610> two<00:00:53.940> opposing<00:00:54.870> curves

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
here and then these two opposing curves

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.930 
here and then these two opposing curves
we've<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.680> an<00:00:55.770> inside<00:00:56.100> curve<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> big

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
we've got an inside curve with a big

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
we've got an inside curve with a big
radius<00:00:57.360> here<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.870> outside<00:00:58.710> curve<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
radius here an outside curve with a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.400 
radius here an outside curve with a
pretty<00:00:59.430> big<00:00:59.609> radius<00:00:59.969> -<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.140> odd

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
pretty big radius - and in this odd

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.850 
pretty big radius - and in this odd
chiseling<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:03.180> looking<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.199> these

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
chiseling and looking at it these

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.820 
chiseling and looking at it these
corners<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.390> vertexes<00:01:07.320> need<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> stay

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
corners all the vertexes need to stay

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.060 
corners all the vertexes need to stay
really<00:01:07.979> nice<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> crisp<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:10.830> would<00:01:10.979> be

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
really nice and crisp so that would be

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.200 
really nice and crisp so that would be
one<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.400> challenges<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:12.000> really

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
one of the challenges that we really

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.090 
one of the challenges that we really
look<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> sharpening<00:01:13.290> process<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.950> how

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
look at in the sharpening process is how

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.550 
look at in the sharpening process is how
can<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.540> sharpen<00:01:15.540> each<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.840> these<00:01:15.930> edges<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
can we sharpen each of these edges and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.560 
can we sharpen each of these edges and
keep<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.610> transitions<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.810> crisp<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
keep the transitions of really crisp so

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.760 
keep the transitions of really crisp so
but<00:01:21.570> thankfully<00:01:21.930> what<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.140> wicked<00:01:22.380> edge<00:01:22.439> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
but thankfully what the wicked edge is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
but thankfully what the wicked edge is
pretty<00:01:23.040> easy<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.450> first<00:01:24.659> got<00:01:24.810> this

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
pretty easy to do when we first got this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.440 
pretty easy to do when we first got this
knife<00:01:25.400> yesterday<00:01:26.400> afternoon<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.970> had<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> huge

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
knife yesterday afternoon it had a huge

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.690 
knife yesterday afternoon it had a huge
gouge<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> chisel<00:01:29.070> portion<00:01:29.430> which

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
gouge out of the chisel portion which

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730 
gouge out of the chisel portion which
was<00:01:29.880> easy<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.329> fix<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.170> I'll<00:01:31.259> show<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.530> how<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
was easy to fix and I'll show you how I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.850 
was easy to fix and I'll show you how I
did<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.159> first<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.450> I'm<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.530> mount<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
did that first so I'm gonna mount the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.670 
did that first so I'm gonna mount the
knife<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> clamp<00:01:35.900> with<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.110> blade<00:01:37.350> side

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.700 
knife in the clamp with the blade side
down<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.700> chisel<00:01:38.909> side<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.720> because

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
down and the chisel side up and because

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.700 
down and the chisel side up and because
this<00:01:41.520> side<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.759> sharp<00:01:42.140> right<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.619> don't

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
this side is sharp right here I don't

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.069 
this side is sharp right here I don't
want<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.220> get<00:01:44.970> scratched<00:01:45.299> up<00:01:45.509> or<00:01:45.720> dinged<00:01:45.930> up

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
want it to get scratched up or dinged up

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.749

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
on the inside of the clamp so I'm just

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.429 
on the inside of the clamp so I'm just
going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.939> wrap<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> small<00:01:48.930> square<00:01:49.409> of

chamois<00:01:49.950> cloth<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.579> then<00:01:51.540> I'm<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.780> to

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
chamois cloth and then I'm going to

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.539 
chamois cloth and then I'm going to
slide<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.140> into<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> clamp<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.340> this

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
slide it into the clamp just like this

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.950 
slide it into the clamp just like this
edge<00:01:54.450> down<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.939> set<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.240> until<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.689> drops

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
edge down and just set it until it drops

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.249 
edge down and just set it until it drops
and<00:01:58.259> snug<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.280> top<00:01:59.579> with<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.600> key<00:02:00.930> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and snug up the top with this key and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.940 
and snug up the top with this key and
then<00:02:01.680> snug<00:02:02.670> up<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.820> bottom<00:02:03.210> even<00:02:03.450> more

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
then snug up the bottom even more

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.039 
then snug up the bottom even more
and<00:02:04.700> now<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.240> blade<00:02:05.420> is<00:02:05.570> really<00:02:05.720> very

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
and now that the blade is really very

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.770 
and now that the blade is really very
firmly<00:02:06.380> clamped<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:10.120> so<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.209> first<00:02:11.330> step<00:02:11.480> is

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
firmly clamped and so the first step is

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.620 
firmly clamped and so the first step is
going<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.020> be<00:02:12.700> setting<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.790> angle<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.180> 24

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
going to be setting the angle to 24

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.720 
going to be setting the angle to 24
degrees<00:02:14.930> when<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.680> was<00:02:15.860> experimenting<00:02:16.489> with<00:02:16.520> it

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
degrees when I was experimenting with it

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.699 
degrees when I was experimenting with it
yesterday<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.510> use<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> little<00:02:18.050> marker<00:02:18.440> trick

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
yesterday I I use a little marker trick

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.740 
yesterday I I use a little marker trick
where<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.580> color<00:02:19.880> in<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.150> bevel<00:02:20.510> like<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:22.750> and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
where I color in the bevel like this and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.990 
where I color in the bevel like this and
then<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:23.959> see<00:02:24.200> how<00:02:24.830> much<00:02:25.010> marker<00:02:25.459> is<00:02:25.550> coming<00:02:25.880> off

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
then I see how much marker is coming off

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.729 
then I see how much marker is coming off
when<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.209> brush<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.630> stones<00:02:26.870> a<00:02:27.050> process<00:02:27.470> and

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
when I brush the stones a process and

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.640 
when I brush the stones a process and
adjust<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.580> 24<00:02:29.000> degrees<00:02:29.300> was<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.930> pretty<00:02:30.530> good

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
adjust and 24 degrees was a pretty good

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.620 
adjust and 24 degrees was a pretty good
fit<00:02:30.890> for<00:02:31.130> all<00:02:31.610> actually<00:02:32.000> all<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.239> edges<00:02:32.510> on

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
fit for all actually all the edges on

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.300 
fit for all actually all the edges on
the<00:02:32.720> knife<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.739> now<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.160> knife<00:02:34.280> is

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
the knife so now that the knife is

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.120 
the knife so now that the knife is
clamped<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.300> angles<00:02:35.690> are<00:02:35.900> set<00:02:36.170> here<00:02:37.069> on

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
clamped and the angles are set here on

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.710 
clamped and the angles are set here on
the<00:02:37.310> bottom<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.910> 24<00:02:38.510> degrees<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:39.140> like<00:02:39.739> that

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
the bottom to 24 degrees just like that

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.390 
the bottom to 24 degrees just like that
it<00:02:41.720> simply<00:02:42.140> slide<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.620> stones<00:02:42.860> onto<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.220> rod

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
it simply slide the stones onto the rod

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.270 
it simply slide the stones onto the rod
and<00:02:43.810> go<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.870> work<00:02:45.080> in<00:02:45.350> alternating<00:02:45.830> strokes

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
and go to work in alternating strokes

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.390 
and go to work in alternating strokes
just<00:02:50.200> like<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:51.799> really<00:02:52.069> easy<00:02:52.250> to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
just like that it's really easy to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.380 
just like that it's really easy to
maintain<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.940> angle<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.510> nice<00:02:54.290> steady<00:02:54.590> contact

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
maintain the angle a nice steady contact

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.820 
maintain the angle a nice steady contact
throughout<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.540> stroke<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:59.680> stroking<00:03:00.680> that

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
throughout the stroke and stroking that

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.830 
throughout the stroke and stroking that
up<00:03:01.209> removing<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.330> gaps

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
up removing the gaps

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.920 
up removing the gaps
really<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:03.470> took<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.620> matter<00:03:03.830> of<00:03:03.950> minutes<00:03:04.940> to

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
really just took a matter of minutes to

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.809 
really just took a matter of minutes to
regrind<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.500> bevels<00:03:06.860> really<00:03:07.069> quickly<00:03:07.459> and

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
regrind the bevels really quickly and

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.349 
regrind the bevels really quickly and
then<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:09.019> then<00:03:09.590> polish<00:03:09.859> them<00:03:09.980> back<00:03:10.130> out<00:03:10.370> so

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
then and then polish them back out so

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.849 
then and then polish them back out so

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
drops with some diamond paste so I'm

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.319 
drops with some diamond paste so I'm
just<00:03:15.829> finishing<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.609> work<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:16.970> they<00:03:17.030> did<00:03:17.209> on

yesterday alright so now I'm going to
switch<00:03:24.859> grits<00:03:25.220> on<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.459> straps<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.090> just

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
switch grits on the straps and just

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:34.260 
switch grits on the straps and just
continue<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.019> polish<00:03:27.440> it

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.370 

and<00:03:35.270> that's<00:03:35.420> that's<00:03:35.690> really<00:03:35.810> it's<00:03:36.230> very

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
and that's that's really it's very

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.930 
and that's that's really it's very
simple<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.830> do<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.130> chisel<00:03:37.460> portion<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.880> the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
simple to do the chisel portion of the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.530 
simple to do the chisel portion of the
blade<00:03:38.150> I'm<00:03:38.930> just<00:03:39.110> going<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.320> wipe<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.560> off<00:03:40.540> you

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
blade I'm just going to wipe it off you

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.110 
blade I'm just going to wipe it off you
might<00:03:41.720> be<00:03:41.840> able<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.020> see<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.700> mirror<00:03:43.700> polish

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
might be able to see the mirror polish

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.910 
might be able to see the mirror polish
there<00:03:44.330> on<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.710> bevel<00:03:47.530> just<00:03:48.530> came<00:03:48.770> out

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
there on that bevel just came out

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.390 
there on that bevel just came out
looking<00:03:49.100> great<00:03:49.550> here

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.250 

and<00:03:53.700> it's<00:03:53.879> extremely<00:03:54.390> sharp<00:03:56.810> okay<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:57.870> for<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
and it's extremely sharp okay so for the

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.130 
and it's extremely sharp okay so for the
next<00:03:58.349> portion<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.220> blade<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.870> just<00:04:00.870> take<00:04:01.019> it

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
next portion of the blade I just take it

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.839 
next portion of the blade I just take it
out<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.379> clamp<00:04:04.280> pull<00:04:05.280> my<00:04:05.400> little<00:04:05.610> piece<00:04:05.700> of

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
out of the clamp pull my little piece of

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.300 
out of the clamp pull my little piece of
chamois<00:04:06.060> out<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.629> then<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.560> take<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.129> depth

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
chamois out and then I take the depth

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.440 
chamois out and then I take the depth
key<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:09.299> put<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.659> into<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.769> top<00:04:10.950> set<00:04:11.159> of<00:04:11.250> holes

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
key and put it into the top set of holes

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.509 
key and put it into the top set of holes
set<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.569> knife<00:04:12.750> firmly<00:04:13.739> on<00:04:13.980> top<00:04:14.099> of<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.340> depth

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
set the knife firmly on top of the depth

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.810 
set the knife firmly on top of the depth
key<00:04:14.930> with<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.049> blade<00:04:16.260> up<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:17.160> just<00:04:17.430> snug<00:04:17.669> it

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
key with the blade up and just snug it

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.990 
key with the blade up and just snug it
up<00:04:18.290> and<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:19.500> ready<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.829> go<00:04:21.199> so<00:04:22.669> when<00:04:23.669> I<00:04:23.729> want

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
up and it's ready to go so when I want

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.909 
up and it's ready to go so when I want
to<00:04:24.090> preserve<00:04:24.500> particularly<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:25.650> little

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
to preserve particularly this little

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.219 
to preserve particularly this little
vertex<00:04:26.280> here<00:04:26.639> what<00:04:27.479> I've<00:04:27.600> got<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.810> think<00:04:27.930> about

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
vertex here what I've got to think about

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.070 
vertex here what I've got to think about
is<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:29.789> stone<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.240> going<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.449> travel<00:04:30.720> in

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
is that the stone is going to travel in

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.710 
is that the stone is going to travel in
one<00:04:31.470> plane<00:04:31.830> here<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.180> want<00:04:33.389> to<00:04:33.419> avoid

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
one plane here and I want to avoid

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.920 
one plane here and I want to avoid
allowing<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.710> rock<00:04:34.919> over<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.720> round<00:04:36.720> that

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
allowing to rock over and round that

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.320 
allowing to rock over and round that
portion<00:04:37.320> off<00:04:37.470> so<00:04:37.830> as<00:04:38.310> long<00:04:38.400> as<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.639> just<00:04:38.669> hold<00:04:39.180> my

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
portion off so as long as I just hold my

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.480 
portion off so as long as I just hold my
stun<00:04:39.600> flat<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.169> Street<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:40.800> section<00:04:41.220> first

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
stun flat and Street this section first

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.180 
stun flat and Street this section first
it's<00:04:42.449> very<00:04:42.510> easy<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.500> can<00:04:43.560> just<00:04:43.860> go<00:04:43.979> to<00:04:44.010> the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
it's very easy and I can just go to the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:52.650 
it's very easy and I can just go to the
alternating<00:04:44.610> strokes<00:04:44.940> just<00:04:45.150> like<00:04:45.479> this

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.560 

and<00:04:53.800> then<00:04:54.800> when<00:04:54.950> I<00:04:54.980> go<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.820> front<00:04:56.360> portion

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
and then when I go to the front portion

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.390 
and then when I go to the front portion
thing<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.170> just<00:04:57.350> set<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.650> stone<00:04:57.830> on<00:04:58.070> and

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
thing and I just set the stone on and

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.730 
thing and I just set the stone on and
keep<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.180> in<00:04:59.300> that<00:04:59.330> plane<00:04:59.840> throughout<00:05:00.560> the

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
keep it in that plane throughout the

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.860 
keep it in that plane throughout the
stroke<00:05:01.040> being<00:05:01.760> careful<00:05:02.150> not<00:05:02.270> to<00:05:02.480> roll<00:05:02.660> back

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
stroke being careful not to roll back

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.810 
stroke being careful not to roll back
over<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.320> way

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
over this way

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.490 
over this way
so<00:05:04.820> that's<00:05:05.030> really<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.600> biggest<00:05:06.320> challenge

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
so that's really the biggest challenge

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.620 
so that's really the biggest challenge
of<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:06.920> knife<00:05:07.070> is<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.550> is<00:05:07.940> it's<00:05:08.420> really<00:05:08.540> not

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
of the knife is that is it's really not

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.030 
of the knife is that is it's really not
much<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:09.110> challenge<00:05:09.470> at<00:05:09.590> all<00:05:09.650> it's<00:05:09.980> very

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
much of a challenge at all it's very

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.940 
much of a challenge at all it's very
easy<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.900> maintain<00:05:11.900> that<00:05:12.350> flame<00:05:12.650> throughout

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
easy to maintain that flame throughout

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.780 
easy to maintain that flame throughout
the<00:05:13.070> stroke<00:05:13.460> just<00:05:15.250> treating<00:05:16.250> each<00:05:16.340> section

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
the stroke just treating each section

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.540 
the stroke just treating each section
separately<00:05:17.030> when<00:05:17.690> we<00:05:17.780> do<00:05:17.900> topically<00:05:18.550> it's

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
separately when we do topically it's

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.830 
separately when we do topically it's
really<00:05:19.730> the<00:05:19.850> same<00:05:19.970> procedure<00:05:20.390> you<00:05:20.510> want<00:05:20.780> to

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
really the same procedure you want to

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.350 
really the same procedure you want to
keep<00:05:21.020> that<00:05:21.230> geometry<00:05:21.590> nice<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:22.250> crisp<00:05:22.520> from

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
keep that geometry nice and crisp from

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.680 
keep that geometry nice and crisp from
the<00:05:23.960> transition<00:05:24.610> planes<00:05:25.610> on<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.090> kana<00:05:26.420> blade

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
the transition planes on the kana blade

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.780 
the transition planes on the kana blade
and<00:05:26.780> it's<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.020> same<00:05:27.230> thing<00:05:27.260> just<00:05:27.490> one<00:05:28.490> plane

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
and it's the same thing just one plane

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.120 
and it's the same thing just one plane
and<00:05:29.090> then<00:05:29.480> a<00:05:29.510> second<00:05:29.930> thing<00:05:30.080> like<00:05:30.290> that<00:05:33.130> and

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
and then a second thing like that and

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.160 
and then a second thing like that and
that's<00:05:34.310> really<00:05:34.490> all<00:05:35.240> there<00:05:35.450> is<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:35.900> on<00:05:36.020> this

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
that's really all there is to it on this

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.680 
that's really all there is to it on this
knife<00:05:36.640> nothing<00:05:37.640> complicated<00:05:37.970> it<00:05:38.330> was<00:05:38.390> a<00:05:38.450> very

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
knife nothing complicated it was a very

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.740 
knife nothing complicated it was a very
easy<00:05:38.960> fun<00:05:39.950> night<00:05:40.160> to<00:05:40.370> sharpen<00:05:40.790> it's<00:05:41.480> great

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
easy fun night to sharpen it's great

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.860 
easy fun night to sharpen it's great
steel<00:05:42.110> and<00:05:42.670> it<00:05:43.670> just<00:05:44.030> came<00:05:44.180> out<00:05:44.360> beautifully

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
steel and it just came out beautifully

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.760 
steel and it just came out beautifully
it's<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.770> bit<00:05:45.920> wide<00:05:46.160> so<00:05:47.230> it's<00:05:48.230> not<00:05:48.380> going<00:05:48.500> to<00:05:48.590> be

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
it's a bit wide so it's not going to be

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.980 
it's a bit wide so it's not going to be
what<00:05:49.550> they<00:05:49.670> call<00:05:49.820> hair<00:05:50.030> popping<00:05:50.270> sharp<00:05:50.660> just

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
what they call hair popping sharp just

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.710 
what they call hair popping sharp just
because<00:05:51.290> it's<00:05:51.500> it's<00:05:52.100> a<00:05:52.250> wide<00:05:52.460> utility<00:05:53.060> edge<00:05:53.420> at

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
because it's it's a wide utility edge at

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.740 
because it's it's a wide utility edge at
24<00:05:54.530> degrees<00:05:54.800> per<00:05:55.010> side<00:05:55.220> but<00:05:56.120> it's<00:05:56.600> still

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
24 degrees per side but it's still

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.560 
24 degrees per side but it's still
shaving<00:05:57.020> sharp<00:05:57.470> and<00:05:57.800> it's<00:05:58.040> going<00:05:58.250> to<00:05:58.310> be

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
shaving sharp and it's going to be

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.430 
shaving sharp and it's going to be
slashing<00:05:59.570> right<00:05:59.720> through<00:05:59.900> paper<00:06:00.110> and

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
slashing right through paper and

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.070 
slashing right through paper and
everything<00:06:00.680> else<00:06:00.830> very<00:06:00.920> easily<00:06:01.780> but<00:06:02.780> because

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
everything else very easily but because

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.390 
everything else very easily but because
it's<00:06:03.230> a<00:06:03.260> little<00:06:03.440> bit<00:06:03.560> wider<00:06:03.680> would<00:06:03.950> be<00:06:04.040> super

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
it's a little bit wider would be super

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.490 
it's a little bit wider would be super
durable<00:06:04.580> so<00:06:05.390> the<00:06:05.480> kind<00:06:05.690> of<00:06:05.720> utility<00:06:06.140> work<00:06:06.290> that

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
durable so the kind of utility work that

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.720 
durable so the kind of utility work that
you<00:06:06.620> would<00:06:06.770> use<00:06:06.890> it<00:06:07.040> for<00:06:08.200> so<00:06:09.200> that's<00:06:09.290> really<00:06:09.530> a

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
you would use it for so that's really a

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.909 
you would use it for so that's really a
razor<00:06:10.730> knife<00:06:10.880> by<00:06:11.270> John<00:06:11.450> Graham<00:06:11.860> sharpen<00:06:12.860> on
