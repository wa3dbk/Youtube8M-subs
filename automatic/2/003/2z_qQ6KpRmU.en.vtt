miles a lot of distance when you're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.170 
miles a lot of distance when you're
talking<00:00:53.640> about<00:00:53.820> space<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.559> roughly

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
talking about space this is roughly

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.290 
talking about space this is roughly
they're<00:00:57.180> saying<00:00:57.480> five<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.020> 16<00:00:58.559> meters<00:00:59.300> 15

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
they're saying five to 16 meters 15

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.060 
they're saying five to 16 meters 15
metres<00:01:00.629> being<00:01:00.899> about<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> size<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> one

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
metres being about the size of the one

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.030 
metres being about the size of the one
that<00:01:02.309> impacted<00:01:03.030> over<00:01:03.239> Russia<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.010> is

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
that impacted over Russia so this is

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 
that impacted over Russia so this is
just<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.400> heads<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:06.119> found<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.630> couple<00:01:06.840> i

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
just a heads up they found a couple i

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:19.570 
just a heads up they found a couple i
believe<00:01:08.390> lr6<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.080> lr<00:01:10.710> seven<00:01:14.689> and<00:01:16.460> CLC<00:01:17.460> seven

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
believe lr6 and lr seven and CLC seven

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.310 
believe lr6 and lr seven and CLC seven
which<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.759> discovered<00:01:21.150> will<00:01:21.420> fly<00:01:21.630> by<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.049> june

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
which was discovered will fly by on june

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.190 
which was discovered will fly by on june
sixteenth<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.689> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:24.990> where<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
sixteenth and you can see where the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.219 
sixteenth and you can see where the
distance<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.920> there<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.520> lunar<00:01:26.759> distance

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
distance is on there the lunar distance

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.700 
distance is on there the lunar distance
quite<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> ways<00:01:28.500> out<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.909> 49.4<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:31.470> moon

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
quite a ways out it's 49.4 one the moon

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.690 
quite a ways out it's 49.4 one the moon
is<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.310> lunar<00:01:32.700> distance<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:35.280> gives

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
is one lunar distance so if that gives

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.030 
is one lunar distance so if that gives
you<00:01:35.880> an<00:01:36.030> idea<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.570> how<00:01:36.869> close<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.439> object<00:01:37.950> is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
you an idea of how close this object is

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.130 
you an idea of how close this object is
about<00:01:38.310> about<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.090> come<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> come

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
about about to come it's going to come

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.499 
about about to come it's going to come
less<00:01:40.470> than<00:01:40.710> half<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.250> far<00:01:41.820> away<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.329> moon

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
less than half as far away as the moon

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.030 
less than half as far away as the moon
is<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:44.090> it's<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.329> coming<00:01:45.509> close<00:01:46.040> just

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
is so it's going to be coming close just

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.590 
is so it's going to be coming close just
a<00:01:47.159> heads<00:01:47.369> up<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.640> anyone<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.119> there<00:01:48.270> the
