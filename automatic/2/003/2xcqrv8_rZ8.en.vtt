00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.990 
of Hyrule the chronology of the entire
series<00:01:09.869> how<00:01:10.409> each<00:01:10.710> game<00:01:11.040> relates<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.880> each

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
series how each game relates to each

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.130 
series how each game relates to each
other<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.840> order<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.500> them<00:01:13.650> all<00:01:14.150> now<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.659> long

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
other the order of them all now I a long

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.690 
other the order of them all now I a long
time<00:01:16.380> ago<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.830> kind<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> gave<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.520> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
time ago just kind of gave up and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
time ago just kind of gave up and
thought<00:01:17.909> man<00:01:18.290> each<00:01:19.290> game<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.890> its<00:01:20.100> own

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
thought man each game is its own

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.710 
thought man each game is its own
individual<00:01:20.820> game<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.540> actually

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
individual game but they are actually

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.140 
individual game but they are actually
are<00:01:22.170> all<00:01:22.590> related<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.909> have

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
are all related and they all have

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.450 
are all related and they all have
actually<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.770> universe<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.950> which<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.250> work

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
actually a universe in which they work

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.120 
actually a universe in which they work
