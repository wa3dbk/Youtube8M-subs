00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
use an overlock machine it would just be

00:01:48.920 --> 00:02:01.290 
use an overlock machine it would just be
like<00:01:49.100> 1/4

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:11.510 

you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.440 

okay<00:02:12.520> so<00:02:12.580> now<00:02:12.910> I'm<00:02:12.970> gonna<00:02:13.090> cut<00:02:13.240> off<00:02:13.270> the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
okay so now I'm gonna cut off the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.720 
okay so now I'm gonna cut off the
sleeves<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.710> is<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.980> folded<00:02:15.310> side<00:02:15.460> of<00:02:15.580> my

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
sleeves so this is the folded side of my

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.070 
sleeves so this is the folded side of my
cover<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.240> could<00:02:16.360> have<00:02:16.450> been<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.630> other<00:02:16.750> side

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
cover it could have been the other side

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.060 
cover it could have been the other side
but<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:18.370> sleeve<00:02:19.120> up<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.630> large<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.140> fit<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
but a sleeve up to a large to fit the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.040 
but a sleeve up to a large to fit the
rest<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.730> fabric<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.750> reason<00:02:22.930> why<00:02:23.020> I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
rest of the fabric so the reason why I

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.680 
rest of the fabric so the reason why I
folded<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.620> over<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:24.130> four<00:02:24.430> layers<00:02:24.670> now<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.660> I

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
folded it over is four layers now so I

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.270 
folded it over is four layers now so I
could<00:02:25.870> cut<00:02:26.050> out<00:02:26.140> both<00:02:26.380> sleeves<00:02:26.740> on<00:02:26.890> one<00:02:27.040> time

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
could cut out both sleeves on one time

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.210 
could cut out both sleeves on one time
but<00:02:27.520> if<00:02:27.760> you're<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.870> can<00:02:29.050> only<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.680> folded

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
but if you're you can only do folded

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.190 
but if you're you can only do folded
over<00:02:30.310> one<00:02:30.580> time<00:02:30.790> if<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.030> want<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.420> do<00:02:31.630> one<00:02:31.900> at<00:02:32.140> a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
over one time if you want to do one at a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.850 
over one time if you want to do one at a
time

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
time

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.340 
time

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
going to hem this whole edge so you're

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.969 
going to hem this whole edge so you're
just<00:05:11.689> going<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.080> fold<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:12.919> a<00:05:13.189> half<00:05:13.879> an<00:05:14.060> inch

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
just going to fold it a half an inch

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.080 
just going to fold it a half an inch
actually<00:05:15.979> I'm<00:05:16.099> going<00:05:16.189> to<00:05:16.250> 1/4<00:05:16.759> of<00:05:16.909> an<00:05:17.000> inch

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090

because this is a curve and the smaller
you<00:05:20.120> fold<00:05:20.389> it<00:05:20.569> but<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.379> more<00:05:21.529> neater<00:05:21.770> it<00:05:22.009> will

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
you fold it but the more neater it will

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.800 
you fold it but the more neater it will
look<00:05:22.340> so<00:05:22.550> I'm<00:05:22.610> going<00:05:22.759> to<00:05:22.819> fold<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.330> over<00:05:23.449> really
