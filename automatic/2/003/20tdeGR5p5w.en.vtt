00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.549
 welcome to this new video this is 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.250
 it's about one thing that all rockers 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.529
 everyone who plays pop rock even 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.470
 Celtic music classical music music 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.100
 blues fusion of everything we have to 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.470
 know him 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.620
 the beautiful thing is that one thing that you can 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.570
 do instinctively but if you know what 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.020
 you are doing you can take him 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.210
 much more profit is a very 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.980
 simple 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.980
 we have a pulse that makes 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.480
 if you know a little of the solfege they are called 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.480
 Black can go slow or they can go fast 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:56.829
 Well this rhythm or these black is 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.039
 can divide in two ways each 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.839
 black here we have the black one we can 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:08.460
 divide them in two then makes 1 and 2 and 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.460
 3 and 4 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.909
 is divided in two each table creates this 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.110
 it's called binary subdivision when it 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.289
 speaks of rock music that refers to the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.619
 subdivision mostly rock means 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.619
 no way 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:46.030
 the weaning of tdt 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:52.750
 who loves you 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:55.110
 what dtr project itt that you land 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.110
 tdt 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.900
 I took it away 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.900
 t 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.550
 from you 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.300
 if you want to use my theme to practice 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.360
 the binary subdivision and the subdivision 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.550
 would have then here you have this version 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.550
 its binary division 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.100
 of the right hand 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:00.420
 well and now when we do it injury 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.420
 then do ternary subdivision 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.370
 Y 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.370
 dt 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.410
 his binary vision rock style 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.530
 two 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.880
 why 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.640
 Y 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.840
 well this has been what I wanted 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.299
 share with you and now it's 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.000
 question of applying it and also listening 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.389
 Every time you listen to music, ask yourself 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.360
 that is your binary or ternary vision if 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.690
 is binary is often given the 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:41.760
 name of the rock and if stern area is given 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:41.760
 the souffl√© mode and the farewell of hey
