00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.090 

another<00:00:02.700> way<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.909> do<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:04.529> use<00:00:04.560> some<00:00:04.980> of

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
another way to do this is to use some of

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.759 
another way to do this is to use some of
the<00:00:06.080> 18<00:00:07.080> gauge<00:00:07.290> wire<00:00:11.120> contraction<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.900> then

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
the 18 gauge wire contraction and then

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.250 
the 18 gauge wire contraction and then
what<00:00:14.009> I'm<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.250> do<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.580> actually<00:00:15.260> put

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
what I'm going to do is actually put

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380 
what I'm going to do is actually put
this<00:00:16.440> through<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.369> roots<00:00:17.940> on<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> end<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.330> my

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
this through the roots on the end of my

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.550 
this through the roots on the end of my
bracelet<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.279> then<00:00:20.279> make<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:21.170> circle<00:00:22.170> lipstick

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
bracelet and then make a circle lipstick

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.580 
bracelet and then make a circle lipstick
rasp<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:25.289> end<00:00:25.529> here<00:00:26.779> as<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.080> see<00:00:28.170> clip

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
rasp on the end here as you can see clip

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.980 
rasp on the end here as you can see clip
that<00:00:28.769> binge<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.269> we're<00:00:30.269> going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> take<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
that binge in we're going to take and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.580 
that binge in we're going to take and
run<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.470> through<00:00:31.740> both<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.640> those<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:36.590> mean

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
run this through both of those I mean

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.470 
run this through both of those I mean
we're<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.920> bend<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.340> towards<00:00:39.239> middle

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
we're going to bend up towards middle

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.590 
we're going to bend up towards middle
and<00:00:40.440> let<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.620> cross<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.570> just<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.719> this

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
and let it cross over just like this

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.020 
and let it cross over just like this
okay<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.070> then<00:00:47.070> you'll<00:00:47.190> take<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.640> side<00:00:48.620> and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
okay and then you'll take one side and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.680 
okay and then you'll take one side and
start<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.270> wrap<00:00:51.480> around<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:53.489> other<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
start to wrap around the other one and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.470 
start to wrap around the other one and
make<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> couple<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.680> loops<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.329> go

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
make a couple of loops and just to go

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.200 
make a couple of loops and just to go
around<00:00:57.750> that<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.699> will<00:01:02.850> cut<00:01:03.059> that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
around that and we will cut that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.760 
around that and we will cut that
sections

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.399 

picture<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.010> close<00:01:12.549> it<00:01:12.580> out<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:13.840> fly<00:01:14.140> against

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
picture and close it out get fly against

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.980 
picture and close it out get fly against
their<00:01:14.619> with<00:01:14.799> flat<00:01:15.369> nose<00:01:15.549> pliers<00:01:15.580> or<00:01:16.270> retain

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
their with flat nose pliers or retain

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:30.910 
their with flat nose pliers or retain
those<00:01:17.140> blares<00:01:17.440> get<00:01:17.710> one

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.100 

and<00:01:31.310> then<00:01:31.640> we<00:01:31.759> will<00:01:31.909> do<00:01:32.060> because<00:01:32.509> in<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:33.049> case

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
and then we will do because in this case

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.440 
and then we will do because in this case
I<00:01:33.500> like<00:01:33.770> using<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.490> dowel<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.150> make<00:01:35.299> a<00:01:35.330> nice

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
I like using a dowel to make a nice

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.280 
I like using a dowel to make a nice
little<00:01:35.689> circle<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.840> you're<00:01:38.840> just<00:01:38.990> want<00:01:39.229> to

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
little circle and you're just want to

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.200 
little circle and you're just want to
bend<00:01:39.470> your<00:01:39.619> wire<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.159> side<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:40.790> 90<00:01:41.149> degree

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
bend your wire to the side a 90 degree

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.030 
bend your wire to the side a 90 degree
angle<00:01:41.750> just<00:01:42.110> like<00:01:42.259> you're<00:01:42.409> doing<00:01:42.710> when<00:01:42.979> you're

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
angle just like you're doing when you're

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.680 
angle just like you're doing when you're
making<00:01:43.340> folders<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:45.530> you're<00:01:46.159> going<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.340> wrap

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
making folders and you're going to wrap

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.039 
making folders and you're going to wrap
this<00:01:47.690> wire<00:01:48.020> around<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.530> dowel<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:50.049> then

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
this wire around the dowel and then

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.570 
this wire around the dowel and then
you're<00:01:51.200> going<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:51.380> wrap<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.619> couple<00:01:52.100> loops<00:01:52.280> at

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
you're going to wrap a couple loops at

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.219 
you're going to wrap a couple loops at
the<00:01:52.640> end<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:54.289> wire<00:01:58.330> right<00:01:59.330> there<00:01:59.659> which

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
the end of the wire right there which

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.810 
the end of the wire right there which
will<00:02:00.439> connect<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.130> other<00:02:01.310> bits<00:02:01.640> that

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
will connect to the other bits that

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.059 
will connect to the other bits that
you've<00:02:01.970> wrapped<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.509> little<00:02:02.920> regarding<00:02:03.920> one

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
you've wrapped a little regarding one

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.219 
you've wrapped a little regarding one
seamless<00:02:04.369> piece<00:02:04.759> I<00:02:07.330> mean<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.660> have<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.019> end

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
seamless piece I mean you have the end

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.070 
seamless piece I mean you have the end
off<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.709> flatten<00:02:10.100> that<00:02:10.130> out<00:02:10.720> with<00:02:11.720> your<00:02:11.870> flat

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080
