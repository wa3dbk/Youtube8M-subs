00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
the HTC and Sony smartphones so I

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.680 
the HTC and Sony smartphones so I
presume<00:04:08.520> that<00:04:08.550> it<00:04:08.730> should<00:04:09.030> work<00:04:09.240> with<00:04:09.510> other

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.580 
devices as well on the other hand I
found<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.990> few<00:04:13.380> shortcomings<00:04:14.130> for<00:04:14.880> example

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
found a few shortcomings for example

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.680 
found a few shortcomings for example

is a bit strange that you can only

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.220 
is a bit strange that you can only
reject<00:04:29.850> but<00:04:30.180> not<00:04:30.870> answer<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.620> calls<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:33.230> think

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
reject but not answer the calls I think

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.290 
reject but not answer the calls I think
it<00:04:34.350> would<00:04:34.560> be<00:04:34.680> useful<00:04:34.710> in<00:04:35.220> some<00:04:35.520> situations

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
it would be useful in some situations

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.930 
it would be useful in some situations
what<00:04:37.080> is<00:04:37.230> more<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.890> functionality<00:04:38.730> is

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
what is more the functionality is

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.780 
what is more the functionality is
limited<00:04:39.570> just<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:40.070> notifications<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.310> the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
limited just to notifications and the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.150 
limited just to notifications and the
reminder<00:04:42.390> I<00:04:42.600> believe<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.590> this<00:04:43.860> device

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
reminder I believe that this device

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.610 
reminder I believe that this device
could<00:04:44.460> be<00:04:44.520> used<00:04:44.910> for<00:04:45.060> example<00:04:45.690> as<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.930> remote

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
could be used for example as a remote

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.670 
could be used for example as a remote
camera<00:04:46.980> controller<00:04:47.640> or<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.690> may<00:04:48.810> program<00:04:49.470> it

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
camera controller or you may program it

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.030 
camera controller or you may program it
to<00:04:50.010> do<00:04:50.370> other<00:04:50.700> stuff<00:04:51.120> anyway<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:52.320> think<00:04:52.919> that

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
to do other stuff anyway I think that

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.040 
to do other stuff anyway I think that
these<00:04:53.250> functions<00:04:53.850> could<00:04:54.090> be<00:04:54.270> easily<00:04:54.510> broad

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
these functions could be easily broad

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.560 
these functions could be easily broad
wire<00:04:55.380> software<00:04:56.010> updates<00:04:56.460> so<00:04:56.910> the

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
wire software updates so the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.170 
wire software updates so the
functionality<00:04:58.380> could<00:04:58.650> be<00:04:58.830> expanded<00:04:59.460> well

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
functionality could be expanded well

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.560 
functionality could be expanded well
we'll<00:05:00.690> look<00:05:00.930> for<00:05:01.229> that<00:05:01.380> in<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.650> future<00:05:01.919> it<00:05:02.570> was

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
we'll look for that in the future it was

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.140 
we'll look for that in the future it was
