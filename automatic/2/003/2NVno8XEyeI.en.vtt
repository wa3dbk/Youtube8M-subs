00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.299
 Hello and welcome to a Vision News and indeed he had around 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:14.449
 Developers of Yukon Yukon previously want to boxed today in the App Store 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.370
 released and it is about the good old curse of the board in a show fight 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.560
 his sayings and forms heavily loaded so that 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.340
 is basically a sweet little song for the release on the tenth of June 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.269
 pending 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.449
 We're going to start that's actually an iPhone Active Asset 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.000
 just zoomed in here on the iPad so who could that too 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.829
 in the iPod Touch all for one order or even iPad play and indeed you have 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.479
 Here are various temples that you can turn off, for example 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.130
 exactly or 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
 what else is there 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 exactly 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.270
 if you want to exhibit the whole country you have to give it a new device 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.270
 must tremble 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.450
 who and where we read on then play a total of 25 together with Ã¶zdemir 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.420
 can and of course you can also use the situation quite well Mr 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.210
 that's exactly what the Grazer said now also for the iPhone 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.900
 one here 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.610
 yes there it looks to be active on the iPhone touch me if this still remains weak 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.860
 Yes, it does 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.630
 since you can already see the quality differences in the audio of the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.600
 two devices ste 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.730
 Again, the district 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.540
 for that needs 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.840
 so it's the whole thing again for the iPhone we go back to the iPad 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.200
 and say goodbye with something suitable times, see if we what we 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.010
 to have 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.080
 then it will and around 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.220
 You do not want that you do not want to see what you have here 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.319
 but that fits very well so in that sense with jux words 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.409
 Until next time
