00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.130 
can't not try to elbow him that's when
your<00:01:26.610> training<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.299> what<00:01:27.540> happened<00:01:27.840> there

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
your training is what happened there

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.160 
your training is what happened there
now<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> hand<00:01:29.159> not<00:01:29.340> rich<00:01:29.549> pose<00:01:29.970> Hanan<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:31.049> he

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
now the hand not rich pose Hanan then he

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.050 
now the hand not rich pose Hanan then he
will<00:01:31.350> bring<00:01:31.470> him<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> close<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
will bring him in to the close in the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.670 
will bring him in to the close in the
gap<00:01:33.090> that's<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> whole<00:01:34.200> idea

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
gap that's the whole idea

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.950 
gap that's the whole idea
take<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.159> technique<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.750> make<00:01:36.930> sure

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
take this technique here to make sure

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170 
take this technique here to make sure
the<00:01:37.320> body<00:01:37.560> inside<00:01:38.040> arm<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.610> line<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.119> can

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the body inside arm in line so you can

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.719 
the body inside arm in line so you can
control<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> gap<00:01:39.900> okay<00:01:40.140> carry<00:01:40.770> on

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:53.120 

attack

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:06.810 

little<00:01:54.130> bit<00:01:54.220> faster<00:02:05.040> okay<00:02:06.040> stop<00:02:06.310> for<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.490> second

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
little bit faster okay stop for a second

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.210 
little bit faster okay stop for a second
now<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.570> whole<00:02:07.840> ideas<00:02:08.350> are<00:02:08.590> when<00:02:09.070> you

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
now the whole ideas are when you

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.859 
now the whole ideas are when you
practice<00:02:09.640> all<00:02:09.820> this<00:02:10.000> line<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.630> same

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
practice all this line the same

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.470 
practice all this line the same
principle<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.560> hand<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.220> petition<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.209> later

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
principle the hand the petition so later

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.690 
principle the hand the petition so later
on<00:02:13.660> when<00:02:14.020> when<00:02:14.860> you're<00:02:15.040> getting<00:02:15.130> delivered

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
on when when you're getting delivered

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.940 
on when when you're getting delivered
better<00:02:15.910> your<00:02:16.540> hand<00:02:16.750> can<00:02:16.930> come<00:02:16.959> over<00:02:17.590> there<00:02:17.740> to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950
