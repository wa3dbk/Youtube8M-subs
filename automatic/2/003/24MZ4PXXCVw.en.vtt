00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.520
 between them 1 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.420

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.030
 goes with this conflict around you 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.969
 height of about 150 thousand then 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.419

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.479
 therefore require 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.059

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.579
 NTV plus 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.799
