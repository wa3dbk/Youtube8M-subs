00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.609
 today I 'm going to talk about something that seemed 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560
 totally unthinkable a few years ago and 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.049
 is that they already exist are already starting 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.679
 to make bicycles without chains 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.879
 without the use of any type of chain 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.590
 some change the mechanism of 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.320
 impulse transmission of the legs to 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.760
 the other wheels replace the chain 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.939
 for another material that does the same 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.039
 game but do not need oiled we will see 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.470
 what advantages and disadvantages does each 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.939
 type and what models are incorporated in 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.410
 everyone's money we have the call 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.880
 bicycle unleashed this model 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.560
 may be the most widespread in this way 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.460
 and innovative and innovative to present the 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.680
 bicycles is called vice simple of the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.900
 pedals are on the axle of the wheel 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.400
 rear so it is not necessary 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.830
 chain to transmit force 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.780
 I do not know if it will be very comfortable or very 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.180
 manageable but it is clear that it solves 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.210
 the problem of fat spots the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.310
 footloose bicycle loose feet either 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.140
 It carries chain although for this model 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.450
 it's somewhat easier to get around this 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.240
 difficulty since the bike attention is 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.140
 electric if it has pedals but this is 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.360
 what they do is 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.870
 an energy that recharges the battery is 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.640
 say when turning when pedaling we are not 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.200
 spinning any axis that moves any 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.940
 chain but we're simply 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.350
 recharging a battery and thanks to this 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.440
 battery with an electric motor 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.720
 we will move the wheels the bicycles without 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.880
 string unchained as from django's 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.800
 tarantino who meet many times 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 in a folding version they are practical for 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.550
 an urban use can even reach 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.460
 be good to perform some 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.200
 acrobatics but obviously they do not count 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.960
 with the power or with the versatility 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.660
 of the classic bicycles then we have 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.130
 the model called belt or cardan and 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.259
 that other manufacturers do not want 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.940
 complicate so much by modifying a design 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.100
 which for centuries After 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.320
 has been working what they do is 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.300
 replace the chain with a strap that 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.880
 it's much quieter and you do not need 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.710
 be lubricated and for this reason not 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.720
 it releases the grease that usually dirty the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.429
 clothes with black spots since 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.200
 at the end of time to have gone 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.840
 absorbing pollution particles 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.759
 and mud in general has darkened the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.380
 Strap can be made of kevlar or of 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.200
 other material and a brand that the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.290
 incorporates for example is sterility 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.810
 the beige bicycles or what they present 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.489
 It is a shaft drive is 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.739
 as you can see in the image that you are 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.560
 watching right now in the video in one of 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.239
 a system of two rigid axes united 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.620
 each other by joints that goes 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.599
 inside a structure that protects it 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.209
 what eliminates the need for cleaning 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.920
 and greased the gimbal that also 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.810
 incorporates in motorcycles trucks and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.000
 automobiles is an invention of late 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.860
 19th century that at the time was very popular 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.810
 on bicycles because it prevented 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.269
 long, vaporous clothes get caught in 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.799
 the chain stopped being manufactured because 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.810
 was compatible with the changes of 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.630
 speeds but now it's come back a lot 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.000
 more advanced also presents the advantage 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.370
 that gears do not jump or no 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.650
 external parts that move now 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.180
 let's talk about the covers chains is 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.590
 very likely that we want to finish 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.269
 with the problem of fat and the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.730
 Hooks on the chain of our bike 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.260
 but that we have something less than wanting to 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.720
 make a sudden disbursement in a 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.700
 new bike for this reason we can 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.220
 stay with the middle way and 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.380
 just cover the area with a box 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.510
 a protector or a copper chains 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.270
 it can be a whole lid or a 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.160
 piece in the shape of 9 that surrounds the chain 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.620
 in the part that surrounds the plate and in the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.600
 superior travel of the chain of what 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.430
 ways you avoid the fat spots and 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.540
 the hooks with the chain sure 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.400
 you have solved the problem a long time ago 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.170
 but if you are considering buying yourself 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.960
 a new bike would you go to one of 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.240
 these without chain would avoid the problems 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.830
 of the spots you think is much better 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.540
 since there is no chain you can not 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.580
 jump the march and provoke some 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.140
 accident I would like to read your 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.340
 opinions in the comments if we 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.340
 we see in the next video
