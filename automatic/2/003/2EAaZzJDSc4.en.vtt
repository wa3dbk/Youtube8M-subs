00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.799
 welcome to one more video in x 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.809
 curiosity the atomic weapons are the 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.820
 most terrible and destructive artifact that 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.469
 man has never invented just enough 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.509
 a few to reduce to use 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.920
 our civilization in more than one 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.960
 occasion have been feared possible 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.449
 scenarios of nuclear wars though 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.970
 fortunately so far it has only 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.529
 happened in novels or movies but 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.050
 which is the largest atomic bomb 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.349
 never built good during the war 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.880
 cold on October 30, 1961 in new 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.790
 zembla an ocean archipelago 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.530
 arctic glacial the Soviet Union detonated 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.500
 in a demonstration the one known as 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.739
 sar bomb weighed 27 tons and 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.300
 average 8 meters long by 2 wide 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.309
 this pump combined the fusion of 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.289
 hydrogen with the fission of uranium and it was 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.899
 able to release a power of 50 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.390
 equivalent to 50 million megatons 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.730
 tons of TNT for you to make a 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.640
 idea would suppose more than 12,000 pools 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.250
 Olympic Games - full of TNT exceeds three thousand 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.870
 800 times to the little boy bomb thrown 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.820
 about hiroshima during the second 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.890
 World War was launched from a 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.479
 bomber modified specially for 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.460
 the occasion at eleven thirty of the 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.130
 tomorrow and at an altitude of 15,000 meters 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.720
 three minutes later about 4000 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.740
 meters of tone 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.439
 immediately the temperature around 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.390
 of the bomb increased millions of degrees 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.420
 the pressure below it reached 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.979
 the 211 kilos per square meter 10 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.380
 times greater than that there are 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.360
 tires of a car the energy 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.220
 luminous was so powerful that it could be 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.950
 sight and even at a distance of 1000 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.929
 kilometers with cloudy sky the wave 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.240
 of shock was powerful enough 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.820
 as to break thick glasses to more 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.259
 900 kilometers from the explosion and it 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.420
 he knows he turned around the earth 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.330
 three times before disappearing by 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.270
 complete the mushroom cloud raised to a 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.009
 maximum altitude of 64 thousand meters the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.840
 thermal energy was so great that 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.119
 It could have caused burns 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.310
 third grade the most serious to any 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.350
 person who is less than 90 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.539
 kilometers of the explosion for not 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.560
 suffer any type of burn 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.929
 to get away up to 140 kilometers 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.390
 randomly it is the most energetic device 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.040
 never used and the most powerful its 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.840
 power equals the energy that 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.900
 consumed norway for more than half 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.450
 of the year 1998 to double what the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.220
 earth receives from the sun every second the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.620
 seismic waves of the explosion were 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.150
 detected all over the world even if 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.650
 we compare it with the energy that 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.569
 hypothetically the level or impact 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.819
 of the asteroid of the yucatan peninsula 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.500
 which was probably responsible for 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.510
 one of the mass extinctions of the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.760
 land we find that this 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.700
 bomb is four million times more 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.519
 weak the most impressive thing is that this 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.569
 bomb could be twice as powerful 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.519
 initially it was designed to 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.830
 reach 100 megatons and to be 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.019
 much more radioactive but shortly before 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.970
 of the detonation was modified by the 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.860
 scientists realized that it was 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.720
 too dangerous and although the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.640
 explosion is performed in an area of 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.459
 tests the area contaminated by dose 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.560
 lethal radiation would be enormous the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.959
 100 megaton version would have created 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.209
 a crater just under 2 kilometers 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.310
 in diameter would have supposed to release the 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.450
 25 percent of all radiation 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.310
 released to the environment 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.739
 since the invention of atomic weapons 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.540
 and its rains will go though this factor 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.599
 it always depends on the conditions of the 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.790
 climate would have spread 1640 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.560
 kilometers and could have given in five 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.690
 hours ordered quantities and chasms of 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.150
 radiation to anyone who gets 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.330
 you will find less than 700 kilometers 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.670
 the bomb 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.160
 but if the random bomb was thrown in 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.740
 your city there is a website called 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.780
 nuclear if it grows and dotcom that gives us 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.520
 choose between several pumps thrown at 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.650
 throughout history the conditions in 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.450
 which would be launched and a place to 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.730
 perform the simulation and information 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.650
 that we want to obtain for example let's 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.390
 detonate the bomb in madrid and we 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.730
 they show among other data of which already 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.350
 the area has been talked about when detecting and 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.390
 bomb and the number of deaths and injuries 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.520
 estimated that in this case it is three 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.160
 million 800 thousand and one million one hundred thousand 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.750
 people respectively if you are 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.770
 interested I will leave you in the description 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.770
 link to the page 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.519
 despite all this the use of a pump 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.260
 like sar for war purposes is not 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.690
 completely feasible due to its great weight and 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.220
 difficult to transport the huge amount of 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.710
 energy that is lost as it goes out 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.510
 farewell to outer space and the 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.889
 fact that it would only be effective in 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.720
 very populated areas 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.780
 rather it was created with motives of 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.889
 research and propaganda 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.590
 currently in a hypothetical scenario 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.669
 of nuclear war weapons would be used as 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.560
 the ballistic missiles 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.690
 intercontinental that as its name 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.550
 indica are able to travel huge 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.800
 distances without the need for an airplane 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.740
 transport them and fly to the place 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.660
 exact indicated before detonating they release 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.520
 nuclear warheads that spread 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.830
 for the territory and create many 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.350
 small explosions 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.630
 we also have non-rubber pumps 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.490
 neutrons are similar to the bomb of 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.470
 hydrogen but they release a proportion 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.750
 much higher energy from 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.300
 fusion that fission get free 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.670
 up to 7 times more radiation and this is from 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.890
 high penetration when detonating a bomb in 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.200
 that and relatively little destruction of 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.300
 structures and buildings but a lot of damage 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.040
 and death in any type of living being 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.780
 even though they are 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.300
 inside vehicles or facilities 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.760
 armored or armored is also a 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.230
 much shorter duration radiation 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.120
 disappears in about 48 hours what 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.529
 it would allow to continue making maneuvers 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.089
 military in the area the short time 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.949
 that was all if you want to continue 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.629
 Discovering how I will always leave you 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.549
 some videos in the description that 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.199
 I 'm sure you'll like it too if 

00:05:37.549 --> 00:05:41.479
 you want me to upload a video talking 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.129
 on a specific subject you can always 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.019
 use the comment box 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.639
 do not forget lyon like this video and 

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:48.109
 subscribe to the channel if you have not yet 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.639
 you were to be aware of everything 

00:05:48.109 --> 00:05:51.639
 that goes up and until next time
