however<00:01:06.910> I<00:01:07.300> prefer<00:01:07.510> it<00:01:08.050> if<00:01:08.230> it's<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.680> little<00:01:08.950> bit

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
however I prefer it if it's a little bit

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.850 
however I prefer it if it's a little bit
smaller<00:01:10.170> 3<00:01:11.170> by<00:01:11.520> 5<00:01:12.520> 15<00:01:13.330> however<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.350> can<00:01:14.590> go

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
smaller 3 by 5 15 however it can go

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.340 
smaller 3 by 5 15 however it can go
quite<00:01:15.760> small<00:01:17.370> and<00:01:18.370> so<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:19.000> all<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.420> icons

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
quite small and so that all of the icons

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.440 
quite small and so that all of the icons
possible<00:01:21.220> are<00:01:21.430> viewable

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.270 

now<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:26.130> next<00:01:26.640> top<00:01:26.939> four<00:01:27.240> applications<00:01:28.280> can

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
now these next top four applications can

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.560 
now these next top four applications can
be<00:01:29.310> ran<00:01:30.030> any<00:01:30.330> time<00:01:30.659> when<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.360> system<00:01:33.360> is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
be ran any time when the system is

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.649
