it's it's been a trying time

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.490 
it's it's been a trying time
specifically<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.960> haven't<00:01:16.170> played<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.470> well

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
specifically we haven't played as well

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.039 
specifically we haven't played as well
as<00:01:16.650> we'd<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:18.299> hang<00:01:18.450> our<00:01:18.570> hat<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
as we'd like to to hang our hat on and

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.100 
as we'd like to to hang our hat on and
where<00:01:19.320> our<00:01:19.920> group<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:21.090> believe<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.900> got

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
where our group we believe is it's got

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.600 
where our group we believe is it's got
lots<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.470> room<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.799> grow<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.430> that's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
lots of room to grow and so that's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.469 
lots of room to grow and so that's
always<00:01:23.850> puts<00:01:24.720> added<00:01:25.259> pressure<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.070> then

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
always puts added pressure on and then

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.880 
always puts added pressure on and then
much<00:01:27.479> more<00:01:27.720> under<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> microscope<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.770> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
much more under the microscope if you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
thought at times we were we seem like we

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.100 
thought at times we were we seem like we
were<00:02:01.649> overmatched<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.759> lot<00:02:02.909> areas<00:02:03.299> they

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
were overmatched in a lot areas they

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.679 
were overmatched in a lot areas they
kept<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.560> very<00:02:04.770> simple<00:02:05.130> game<00:02:05.189> plan<00:02:05.610> they<00:02:06.420> got<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
kept a very simple game plan they got to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.119 
kept a very simple game plan they got to
the<00:02:06.780> red<00:02:06.930> line<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.439> dumped<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> puck<00:02:07.920> in

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the red line and you dumped the puck in

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.729 
the red line and you dumped the puck in
and<00:02:08.420> we<00:02:09.420> refused<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.289> early<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
and we refused to do that early in the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.570 
and we refused to do that early in the
hockey<00:02:10.890> game<00:02:11.330> for<00:02:12.330> whatever<00:02:12.599> reason

but<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.030> seems<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.660> be<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:16.610> mandate<00:02:17.090> for

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
responded with a goal and it kind of

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.460

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.840 
rest of the game will come back to I'm
sure<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.080> will<00:03:45.459> well<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.489> think<00:03:46.970> again<00:03:48.160> we<00:03:49.160> look

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
sure it will well I think again we look

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.000 
sure it will well I think again we look
at<00:03:50.000> that<00:03:50.180> line<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.840> we<00:03:51.080> feel<00:03:51.350> confident<00:03:51.980> that

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
at that line and we feel confident that

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.400 
at that line and we feel confident that
we<00:03:52.130> can<00:03:52.280> put<00:03:52.519> that<00:03:53.150> line<00:03:53.510> on<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.900> ice<00:03:54.019> against

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
we can put that line on the ice against

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.180 
we can put that line on the ice against
any<00:03:54.620> line<00:03:54.830> we've<00:03:55.220> played<00:03:55.820> so<00:03:56.030> far<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:57.680> when<00:03:58.100> you

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
any line we've played so far so when you

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.190 
any line we've played so far so when you
have<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.550> type<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.820> confidence<00:03:59.450> in<00:03:59.600> in<00:03:59.900> the
