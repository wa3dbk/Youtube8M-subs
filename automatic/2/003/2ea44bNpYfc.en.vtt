second half of the season that we didn't

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.380 
second half of the season that we didn't
perhaps<00:00:24.349> kick<00:00:24.710> on<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:25.040> push<00:00:25.189> on<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.399> way<00:00:26.270> we

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
perhaps kick on and push on the way we

should have done or the way we hope to

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.650 
should have done or the way we hope to
do<00:00:27.820> but<00:00:28.820> I<00:00:28.849> think<00:00:29.059> if<00:00:29.149> you<00:00:29.239> analyze<00:00:29.630> it

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
do but I think if you analyze it

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.290 
do but I think if you analyze it
properly<00:00:30.380> sit<00:00:30.619> down<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:30.980> look<00:00:31.099> at<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.460> second

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
properly sit down and look at the second

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.790 
properly sit down and look at the second
half<00:00:32.390> compared<00:00:32.720> to<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:32.899> first<00:00:33.110> half<00:00:33.260> there

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
half compared to the first half there

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.770 
half compared to the first half there
are<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:33.950> number<00:00:34.040> of<00:00:34.280> factors<00:00:34.489> that<00:00:34.910> affected

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
are a number of factors that affected

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.880 
are a number of factors that affected
the<00:00:35.899> form<00:00:36.110> in<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.320> second<00:00:36.620> half<00:00:36.710> of<00:00:36.830> the

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
season and it's something that we will

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.110 
season and it's something that we will
look<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:39.650> put<00:00:39.890> right<00:00:40.040> for<00:00:40.220> next<00:00:40.400> year<00:00:40.490> of

word but it's been a great challenge

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.540 
word but it's been a great challenge
it's<00:00:50.900> one<00:00:51.079> I've<00:00:51.260> waited<00:00:51.470> a<00:00:51.950> number<00:00:52.250> of<00:00:52.370> years

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
it's one I've waited a number of years

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.440 
it's one I've waited a number of years
for<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.970> long<00:00:53.300> time<00:00:53.570> for<00:00:53.840> a<00:00:55.180> support<00:00:56.180> an<00:00:56.300> hour

for a long time for a support an hour
Pervis<00:00:56.900> came<00:00:57.590> that<00:00:57.739> way<00:00:57.829> I<00:00:57.860> have<00:00:58.070> enjoyed<00:00:58.340> it

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
Pervis came that way I have enjoyed it

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.700 
Pervis came that way I have enjoyed it
I'm<00:00:59.570> probably<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.110> second<00:01:00.410> half<00:01:00.500> of<00:01:00.620> the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
I'm probably the second half of the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.010 
I'm probably the second half of the
seasons<00:01:01.040> been<00:01:01.450> more<00:01:02.450> difficult<00:01:02.660> more

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
seasons been more difficult more

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.800 
seasons been more difficult more
challenging<00:01:03.050> and<00:01:04.089> again<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.329> a<00:01:05.390> person<00:01:05.689> s

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
came that way more enjoyable than the

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.770 
came that way more enjoyable than the
first<00:01:07.430> half<00:01:07.549> because<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.939> first<00:01:08.149> half<00:01:08.329> of<00:01:08.600> the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
first half because the first half of the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.910 
first half because the first half of the
season<00:01:09.020> everything<00:01:09.409> went<00:01:09.560> great<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:09.830> the

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
season everything went great and the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.219 
season everything went great and the
second<00:01:10.250> half<00:01:10.340> there<00:01:10.490> has<00:01:10.580> been<00:01:10.670> more<00:01:11.229> more

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
second half there has been more more

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.110 
second half there has been more more
disruptions<00:01:12.740> more<00:01:12.950> more<00:01:13.310> complications<00:01:13.940> more

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
disruptions more more complications more

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.990 
disruptions more more complications more
problems<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:14.860> it's<00:01:15.860> it's<00:01:16.250> something<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:16.760> if

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
problems and it's it's something that if

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.460 
problems and it's it's something that if
I'm<00:01:17.150> going<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.420> be<00:01:17.630> good<00:01:17.810> at<00:01:17.900> this<00:01:17.990> job

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
I'm going to be good at this job

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.990 
I'm going to be good at this job
and<00:01:18.830> I<00:01:18.920> think<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.280> far<00:01:19.310> I've<00:01:19.580> shown<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:19.790> I<00:01:19.940> can

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
and I think so far I've shown that I can

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.300 
and I think so far I've shown that I can
I<00:01:20.390> can<00:01:21.080> step<00:01:21.290> up<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.650> mark<00:01:21.770> if<00:01:22.010> I'm<00:01:22.100> going

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
I can step up to the mark if I'm going

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.280 
I can step up to the mark if I'm going
to<00:01:22.370> improve<00:01:22.670> myself<00:01:22.970> then<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:23.840> have<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.140> learn

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
to improve myself then I have to learn

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.710 
to improve myself then I have to learn
from<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.820> more<00:01:25.820> from<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.090> second<00:01:26.390> after<00:01:26.570> this

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
from the more from the second after this

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.850 
from the more from the second after this
season<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.110> I'm<00:01:27.170> all<00:01:27.290> from<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.530> first<00:01:27.680> half

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
season and I'm all from the first half

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.770 
season and I'm all from the first half
of<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.100> season<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.549> think<00:01:29.000> when<00:01:29.450> we<00:01:29.540> spoke

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
of the season I think when we spoke

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.690 
of the season I think when we spoke
before<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.440> season<00:01:30.830> kicked<00:01:31.040> off<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.400> said<00:01:31.610> to

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
before the season kicked off you said to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.580 
before the season kicked off you said to
me<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:31.909> anticipated<00:01:32.690> more<00:01:32.900> sleepless<00:01:33.200> nights

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
me you anticipated more sleepless nights

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.380 
me you anticipated more sleepless nights
