00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
boat and the great thing about a jig is

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.360 
boat and the great thing about a jig is
because<00:02:56.050> it's<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:56.350> weedless<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:56.980> comes<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.340> a

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
because it's so weedless it comes to a

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.100 
because it's so weedless it comes to a
lot<00:02:57.520> of<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.670> cover<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.450> can<00:02:58.600> kind<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.870> fish

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
lot of that cover you can kind of fish

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
lot of that cover you can kind of fish
it<00:02:59.260> through<00:02:59.290> some<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.650> those<00:02:59.710> hard-to-reach

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
it through some of those hard-to-reach

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.720 
it through some of those hard-to-reach
places

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
places

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.700 
places
and<00:03:01.210> again<00:03:01.570> comes<00:03:01.870> out<00:03:02.020> of<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.170> snags<00:03:02.500> real
