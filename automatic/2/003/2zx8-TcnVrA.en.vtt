00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
two-part panel epoxy which is good for

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.250 
two-part panel epoxy which is good for
any<00:01:00.059> kind<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.359> vehicle<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.719> doesn't<00:01:01.140> really

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
use the quarters for structural support

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.299 
use the quarters for structural support
which<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.409> says<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.860> has<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> frame

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
which just says this has a frame

it's<00:01:34.830> no<00:01:35.100> longer<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.430> straight<00:01:35.759> line<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.090> look

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
it's no longer a straight line you look

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.340 
it's no longer a straight line you look
down<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> thing<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.960> still<00:01:37.140> fairly

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
down the thing it's still fairly
