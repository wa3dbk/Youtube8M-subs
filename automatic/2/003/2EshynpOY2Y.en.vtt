00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
and everyone today I'm I'm gonna do a

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.400 
and everyone today I'm I'm gonna do a
small<00:00:05.580> review<00:00:05.850> about<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.420> battery<00:00:07.140> V<00:00:07.259> so

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
small review about this battery V so

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.209 
small review about this battery V so
theta<00:00:08.120> its<00:00:09.120> Glen<00:00:09.960> diesel<00:00:10.410> fighter<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.920> brought

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
theta its Glen diesel fighter I brought

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.620 
theta its Glen diesel fighter I brought
this<00:00:11.340> from<00:00:11.580> from<00:00:12.179> eBay<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:14.480> one<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
this from from eBay and one of the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.029 
this from from eBay and one of the
reasons<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.960> bought<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.650> because<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
reasons I bought this it's because I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.529 
reasons I bought this it's because I
have<00:00:17.250> two<00:00:18.119> batteries<00:00:18.330> here<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:20.300> some<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.420> them

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
have two batteries here and some of them

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.259 
have two batteries here and some of them
are<00:00:21.689> very<00:00:22.260> old<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.430> wanted<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.760> see<00:00:23.939> if<00:00:24.060> this

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
are very old and I wanted to see if this

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.410 
are very old and I wanted to see if this
could<00:00:24.480> actually<00:00:25.199> make<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> difference<00:00:26.180> in<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
could actually make a difference in the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.019 
could actually make a difference in the
old<00:00:27.689> batteries<00:00:28.109> if<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.920> could<00:00:29.099> make<00:00:29.279> them<00:00:29.429> last

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
old batteries if I could make them last

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.500 
old batteries if I could make them last
longer

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
longer

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.590 
longer

this particular model has auto sensing

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.869 
this particular model has auto sensing
for<00:00:45.809> for<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> voltage<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:47.280> means<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.850> can

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
for for the voltage this means it can

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
for for the voltage this means it can
operate<00:00:48.180> at<00:00:49.079> 12<00:00:50.000> 24<00:00:51.000> 36<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:52.289> 48<00:00:54.680> they

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
operate at 12 24 36 and 48 they

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
operate at 12 24 36 and 48 they
recommend<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.370> case<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> batteries<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
recommend in case the batteries to to

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.270 
recommend in case the batteries to to
discharge<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.309> discharge<00:00:59.809> you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:01.100> use<00:01:02.100> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
discharge the discharge you can use this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.479 
discharge the discharge you can use this
button<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.730> select<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.690> desired<00:01:04.140> voltage<00:01:04.489> due

button to select the desired voltage due

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.219 
button to select the desired voltage due
to<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.970> you'll<00:01:06.150> fight<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.570> battery<00:01:06.930> for

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
to this you'll fight the battery for

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.350 
to this you'll fight the battery for
example<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.710> your<00:01:07.890> battery<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.280> 24<00:01:08.790> volts<00:01:09.150> but

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
example if your battery is 24 volts but

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.760 
example if your battery is 24 volts but
if<00:01:10.460> if<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.670> reading<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.090> too<00:01:12.299> low<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.810> won't

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
if if the reading is too low you won't

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
if if the reading is too low you won't
be<00:01:13.890> able<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.820> know<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.210> correct<00:01:15.930> voltage

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
be able to to know the correct voltage

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.580 
be able to to know the correct voltage
so<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> set<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.159> by<00:01:17.400> hand<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.409> I<00:01:19.409> just

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
so you have to set it by hand so I just

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.710 
so you have to set it by hand so I just
gonna<00:01:19.770> flip<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> look<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> on

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
gonna flip it here have a look on the on

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.690 
gonna flip it here have a look on the on
the<00:01:21.840> back<00:01:22.369> it<00:01:23.369> says<00:01:23.930> rejuvenate<00:01:25.369> lead<00:01:26.369> acid

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the back it says rejuvenate lead acid

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340 
the back it says rejuvenate lead acid
batteries<00:01:27.110> auto-sensing

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
batteries auto-sensing

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.850 
batteries auto-sensing
12<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.490> 48<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.210> said<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> working

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
12 to 48 like I said this is the working

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.359 
12 to 48 like I said this is the working
amperage<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:35.329> will<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.450> about<00:01:36.630> 20<00:01:37.369> 20

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
amperage it's will be about 20 20

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.510 
amperage it's will be about 20 20
milliamps<00:01:39.259> that's<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.409> bad<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> big

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
milliamps that's not bad it's a big

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.380 
milliamps that's not bad it's a big
amperage<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.270> two<00:01:42.720> amps<00:01:43.140> big<00:01:44.009> voltage<00:01:44.460> because

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
amperage of two amps big voltage because

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.600 
amperage of two amps big voltage because
the<00:01:45.630> theory<00:01:46.110> behind<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.399> will

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the theory behind this is that it will

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.399 
the theory behind this is that it will
inject<00:01:48.329> voltage<00:01:48.840> into<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> battery<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
inject voltage into the battery so that

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.780 
inject voltage into the battery so that
the<00:01:52.409> battery<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.920> release<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.119> sulfites

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
the battery can release the the sulfites

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.020 
the battery can release the the sulfites
and<00:01:57.439> here's<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.560> frequency<00:01:59.130> usually<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.880> have

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and here's a frequency usually I have

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.819 
and here's a frequency usually I have
seen<00:02:00.270> other<00:02:00.420> diesel<00:02:01.229> fighters<00:02:01.560> they<00:02:01.649> work

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
seen other diesel fighters they work

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.020 
seen other diesel fighters they work
about<00:02:02.659> 5000<00:02:03.659> kilo<00:02:04.140> hertz<00:02:04.469> 3000<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
about 5000 kilo hertz 3000 this is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.970 
about 5000 kilo hertz 3000 this is
actually<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> first<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:06.869> i<00:02:06.899> see<00:02:07.140> at

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
actually the first one i see at

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.230 
actually the first one i see at
thousand<00:02:08.400> kilohertz<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:10.340> working<00:02:11.340> amps<00:02:11.670> it

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
thousand kilohertz of working amps it

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.170 
thousand kilohertz of working amps it
says<00:02:12.570> five<00:02:13.350> milliamps

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
says five milliamps

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.840 
says five milliamps
there's<00:02:15.180> also<00:02:15.330> another<00:02:15.750> feature

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
there's also another feature

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.550 
there's also another feature
specification<00:02:17.850> on<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.630> doesn't

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
specification on this that it's doesn't

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.540 
specification on this that it's doesn't
say<00:02:19.860> here<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.300> has<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:22.160> low<00:02:23.160> voltage

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
say here is that it has a low voltage

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.990 
say here is that it has a low voltage
cutoff<00:02:23.790> at<00:02:24.270> 11<00:02:24.840> volts<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.550> case<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:26.970> are

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
cutoff at 11 volts so in case you are

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.570 
cutoff at 11 volts so in case you are
dissipating<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.020> battery<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:29.340> battery

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
dissipating a battery and that battery

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.300 
dissipating a battery and that battery
is<00:02:30.030> not<00:02:30.150> connected<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.780> any<00:02:30.930> charger<00:02:31.380> if<00:02:32.070> the
