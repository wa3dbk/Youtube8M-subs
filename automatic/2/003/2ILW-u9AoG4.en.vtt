hello<00:00:01.449> this<00:00:02.350> is<00:00:02.409> a<00:00:02.590> tutorial<00:00:03.040> how<00:00:03.760> to<00:00:03.790> change

00:00:04.079 --> 00:00:04.089 
hello this is a tutorial how to change

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:10.440 
hello this is a tutorial how to change
the<00:00:04.299> brake<00:00:04.509> pads<00:00:04.779> on<00:00:05.319> a<00:00:05.399> 2010<00:00:06.480> Honda<00:00:07.480> CRV<00:00:09.450> it's

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
the brake pads on a 2010 Honda CRV it's

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.030 
the brake pads on a 2010 Honda CRV it's
very<00:00:10.660> simple<00:00:11.050> straightforward<00:00:11.320> it's<00:00:11.769> for<00:00:11.950> the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
very simple straightforward it's for the

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.900 
very simple straightforward it's for the
front<00:00:12.370> brake<00:00:13.000> pads<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.680> we<00:00:18.100> take<00:00:18.280> off<00:00:18.430> the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
front brake pads so we take off the

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.410 
front brake pads so we take off the
wheel<00:00:19.570> of<00:00:19.720> course<00:00:19.930> tires<00:00:21.000> make<00:00:22.000> sure<00:00:22.120> you<00:00:22.270> have

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
wheel of course tires make sure you have

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.880 
wheel of course tires make sure you have
your<00:00:23.730> your<00:00:24.730> truck<00:00:24.970> and<00:00:25.120> stance<00:00:25.590> that's<00:00:26.590> one

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
your your truck and stance that's one

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.850 
your your truck and stance that's one
and<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:29.050> other<00:00:29.200> one<00:00:29.320> over<00:00:29.560> there<00:00:29.710> on<00:00:29.770> the

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
and that the other one over there on the

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.230 
and that the other one over there on the
other<00:00:30.010> side<00:00:30.160> I'm<00:00:30.610> pretty<00:00:30.790> sure<00:00:30.910> you<00:00:31.000> can<00:00:31.120> see

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
other side I'm pretty sure you can see

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.810 
other side I'm pretty sure you can see
both<00:00:31.420> of<00:00:31.450> them<00:00:32.010> put<00:00:33.010> them<00:00:33.100> in<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.280> jack<00:00:33.520> stands

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
both of them put them in the jack stands

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.390 
both of them put them in the jack stands
don't<00:00:34.510> ever<00:00:34.660> risk<00:00:34.900> anything<00:00:35.290> safety<00:00:36.160> first

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
don't ever risk anything safety first

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.260 
don't ever risk anything safety first
and<00:00:37.360> it's<00:00:38.170> pretty<00:00:38.440> much<00:00:38.530> straight<00:00:38.920> forward<00:00:42.270> so

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
and it's pretty much straight forward so

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:52.900 
and it's pretty much straight forward so
this<00:00:43.510> is<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:44.490> 14<00:00:46.800> let<00:00:47.800> me<00:00:47.860> show<00:00:48.040> you

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.970 

this<00:00:53.360> is<00:00:53.480> a<00:00:53.510> 14<00:00:54.380> millimeter<00:00:56.410> let's<00:00:57.410> you<00:00:57.560> folks

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
this is a 14 millimeter let's you folks

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:06.840 
this is a 14 millimeter let's you folks
here<00:00:58.510> focus<00:00:59.590> 14<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:02.690> it's<00:01:03.110> just<00:01:04.630> clockwise

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
here focus 14 and it's just clockwise

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.670 
here focus 14 and it's just clockwise
allusions<00:01:07.850> clockwise<00:01:08.360> there's<00:01:09.170> one<00:01:09.440> there

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
allusions clockwise there's one there

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.230 
allusions clockwise there's one there
and<00:01:12.010> sometimes<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:13.640> happened<00:01:13.910> to<00:01:14.000> me<00:01:14.120> right

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
and sometimes it happened to me right

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.820 
and sometimes it happened to me right
now

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
now

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.080 
now
there's<00:01:15.830> um<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.320> going<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.590> spin<00:01:19.090> with

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
there's um this is going to spin with

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.620 
there's um this is going to spin with
the<00:01:20.120> bolt

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
the bolt

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.460 
the bolt
I<00:01:21.640> don't<00:01:22.640> know<00:01:22.700> if<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:22.820> can<00:01:22.970> see<00:01:23.270> or<00:01:23.510> hear<00:01:23.540> that

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
I don't know if you can see or hear that

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.260 
I don't know if you can see or hear that
one

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
one

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.719 
one
that's<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.390> 3/4<00:01:27.070> mile<00:01:28.070> at<00:01:28.160> least<00:01:28.340> that's<00:01:28.550> what<00:01:28.700> I

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
that's a 3/4 mile at least that's what I

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.140 
that's a 3/4 mile at least that's what I
used<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:30.680> stop<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.490> from<00:01:31.580> spinning<00:01:31.880> together

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
used to stop it from spinning together

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
used to stop it from spinning together
with<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.570> bolt<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:34.729> can<00:01:34.910> see<00:01:35.090> they're<00:01:35.330> three

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
with the bolt you can see they're three

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.060 
with the bolt you can see they're three
quarters<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.800> just<00:01:37.729> hold<00:01:37.940> this<00:01:38.920> see<00:01:39.920> it's

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
quarters I just hold this see it's

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.580 
quarters I just hold this see it's
spinning<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.630> then<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.780> did<00:01:41.960> with<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.200> 14

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
spinning and then I did with the 14

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.240 
spinning and then I did with the 14
clockwise<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:43.610> it's<00:01:44.330> L<00:01:45.259> come<00:01:45.560> off

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
clockwise and it's L come off

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.460 
clockwise and it's L come off
maybe<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:46.759> spinning<00:01:47.150> together<00:01:47.330> you'll<00:01:48.200> be

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
maybe it's spinning together you'll be

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.060 
maybe it's spinning together you'll be
able<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.710> see<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:53.390> then<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:54.380> second<00:01:54.890> one

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
able to see it and then the second one

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.680 
able to see it and then the second one
is<00:01:55.690> right<00:01:56.690> here<00:01:57.280> it's<00:01:58.280> also<00:01:58.429> a<00:01:58.580> 14<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.270> also<00:01:59.420> has

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
is right here it's also a 14 it also has

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.350 
is right here it's also a 14 it also has
this<00:01:59.960> here<00:02:00.259> in<00:02:00.890> case<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:01.910> starts<00:02:02.149> turning

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
this here in case it starts turning

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.999 
this here in case it starts turning
together<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:03.170> just<00:02:03.200> use<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.759> 3/4<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:06.800> hold

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
together you just use that 3/4 to hold

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.730 
together you just use that 3/4 to hold
it<00:02:07.130> in<00:02:07.250> place<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.670> then<00:02:07.789> just<00:02:07.850> unbolt<00:02:08.600> so<00:02:09.590> it's

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
it in place and then just unbolt so it's

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.570 
it in place and then just unbolt so it's
pretty<00:02:09.920> straightforward<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:13.100> process

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
pretty straightforward the process

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:55.930 
pretty straightforward the process
shouldn't<00:02:14.540> take<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.720> long

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:24.750 

you

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.330 

so<00:03:25.209> were<00:03:25.750> these<00:03:25.900> back<00:03:26.110> together<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.680> mean<00:03:27.190> it's

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
so were these back together I mean it's

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.140 
so were these back together I mean it's
pretty<00:03:27.489> simple

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
pretty simple

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.670 
pretty simple
I<00:03:28.180> don't<00:03:28.930> even<00:03:29.019> had<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.349> see<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.590> whole

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
I don't even had to see the whole

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.520 
I don't even had to see the whole
process<00:03:30.150> um<00:03:31.150> once<00:03:31.569> you<00:03:31.720> push<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.140> Pistons

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
process um once you push the Pistons

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.509 
process um once you push the Pistons
back<00:03:32.739> on<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.340> turtle<00:03:34.269> that's<00:03:34.569> all<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.780> got<00:03:34.959> it

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
back on the turtle that's all I got it

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.640 
back on the turtle that's all I got it
you<00:03:37.120> put<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.480> brake<00:03:37.840> pads<00:03:38.140> in<00:03:38.290> here<00:03:38.319> the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
you put the brake pads in here the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.649 
you put the brake pads in here the
correct<00:03:38.890> way<00:03:39.099> it's<00:03:39.849> pretty<00:03:40.120> much<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.450> brake

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
correct way it's pretty much the brake

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.550 
correct way it's pretty much the brake
pad<00:03:40.870> goes<00:03:41.049> like<00:03:41.290> this<00:03:42.599> this<00:03:43.599> is<00:03:43.780> what<00:03:43.989> tells

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
pad goes like this this is what tells

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.460 
pad goes like this this is what tells
you<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.860> have<00:03:44.890> no<00:03:45.160> more<00:03:45.340> brake<00:03:45.549> pads<00:03:46.379> and<00:03:47.379> it

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
you you have no more brake pads and it

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.819 
you you have no more brake pads and it
goes<00:03:47.620> like<00:03:47.830> this<00:03:49.290> then<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.440> ones<00:03:50.620> in<00:03:50.739> the

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
goes like this then the ones in the

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.229 
goes like this then the ones in the
front<00:03:50.980> they're<00:03:51.250> pretty<00:03:51.489> much<00:03:51.610> can<00:03:51.879> go<00:03:52.030> both
