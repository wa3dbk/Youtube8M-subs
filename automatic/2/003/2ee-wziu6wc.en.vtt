00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.250
 and how about youtube community that is 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.200
 co-author with a new video about the 5 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.599
 where I would give them information and opinions 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.219
 from the same game a video was already needed 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.379
 about what, but do not worry 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.519
 I will try to bring more halo videos and not 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.070
 only of the new generation consoles 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.050
 of microsoft and sony like the law of 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.490
 title of this video I will talk to you about 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.260
 a possible new enemy that 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.450
 we will probably have in the next 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.010
 halo game on the other hand lara 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.510
 about the inquisitor's return and 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.610
 some extra details about the 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.190
 respective game let's start with the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.690
 inquisitor the inquisitor is a character 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.489
 like the good master gesture not so 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.589
 important but many of us 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.899
 interested in having it in the next game of 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.789
 halo including me since it is a character 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.129
 that makes it a great video game 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.019
 the same character was born a 10 of 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.899
 December which on the date on which 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.249
 his server is to say I am years like this 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.920
 that you can say that I am the 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:55.719
 inquisitor ok no longer focusing 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.760
 again on the subject in a forum of 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.859
 three four three industris was dedicated 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.170
 an entire section to this great character 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.210
 where in that same section was found 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.100
 written what I'm going to tell you the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.300
 inquisitor return to earth asking 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.990
 Chief support for his teacher 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.869
 finish 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.909
 the covenant although it looks possible is very 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.409
 difficult for this to happen since 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.170
 the inquisitor returned to his home planet 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.720
 looking for peace for a reason and not in vain 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.149
 so it's almost unlikely that he will come back 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.500
 but it is being considered is not known if 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.360
 this was said by tree for 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.670
 three industry or by a fan of it 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.439
 game but logic is considering and 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.899
 was put on a tam tam forum the same 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.729
 company is more likely to 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.409
 events the inquisitor returned 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.780
 takes place but has not yet secured 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.460
 nothing about this in the opinion 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.799
 staff I'm sure the inquisitor 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.179
 will return as the section says to the 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.950
 land asking for the boss's help 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.509
 teacher to end the civil war 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 as bernat but as the master boss 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.860
 he was focused on bringing back his 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.270
 dear partner, I do not think I'm going to 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.220
 want to help the inquisitor with this 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.509
 problem what is possible that the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.340
 Inquisitor tells you that he will help 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.140
 recover will cut but with the condition 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.179
 that help to end the war or 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.979
 maybe it happens the other way around that is to say that it is 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.140
 sick this tell the inquisitor that 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.929
 will help you but only if it helps you 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.640
 recover to cut now let's go to 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.410
 make a few themes of the same video on 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.090
 which is a possible new enemy that 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.530
 can see in the next installment of the 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.420
 great franchise created by him 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.860
 and now driven by three three 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.480
 industries 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.950
 the new possible in emea that may be 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.200
 present in the next installment is 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.540
 short na so this is cut you will say 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.910
 because you have to remember that they cut in 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.380
 Ice 4 was split in different parts 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.930
 to be able to have the didact in this 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.610
 however, this one only gets 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.370
 to be able to finish with the plans of the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.350
 didact more not stopping it forever is 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.470
 possible that the rampant mode of cortana 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.660
 that is to say his bad way you have remained 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.880
 intact and now it's that rampant mode of 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.130
 the same and this one now in this precise 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.959
 moment with the direct is to say that 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.700
 now they probably cut to in the new 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.170
 game of halo exit of the bid minutes and 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.630
 when he himself fell the well of 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.550
 composer the rampant part of cortana 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.890
 he could have gone with him to the well of 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.690
 composer so it is possible that 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.370
 be our new enemy in g and the 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.959
 five or whatever is going to be called the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.190
 new halo game 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.840
 we all know that three for three 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.640
 industries made it clear that cut 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.680
 had died in that jlo 4 since the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.209
 description of the epilogue you see it says 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.250
 that cut was dead and the one that informs 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.630
 of this must continue without it but it 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.579
 they make me very complicated for me 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.380
 imagine the force master cinema of 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.300
 cortana accompaniment 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.220
 maybe what he meant tree for 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.290
 training is sad is that they cut off 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.150
 but for us or rather that the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.190
 true will cut died but sumo 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.750
 rampant water may be alive and is 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.030
 I echo reality that appealing your next 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.530
 attack according to a forum the tree for three 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.510
 industries it was mentioned that the boss 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.790
 teacher will have to convince or remember 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.680
 to cut off who actually what is 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.600
 possible that the reference to bring it from 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.630
 return involves bringing back 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.940
 cortana as it was normally and not now 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.680
 which is bad as we already saw in hello 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.690
 four how do you get cut to how is 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.320
 moody now imagine how to be 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.320
 in turns 5 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.180
 entering something that we had already heard 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.340
 three for three industries confirmed that 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.740
 hey the five is the darkest game of 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.480
 the entire franchise leave it as it will be 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.890
 in several losses of many characters 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.930
 important that are part of the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.790
 franchise and will be observed within the 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.830
 same game planets consumed by the 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.299
 sea ​​and sometimes videos explode 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.760
 or destroy some planets that 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.000
 let's know or not and what do you think of 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.830
 this they believe is false or is true for 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.960
 me partly is true and partly it is 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.539
 false but we'll see 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.280
 with more details in the future and so we 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.530
 It gives more information or perhaps until 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.270
 come out the game next year and well 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.530
