00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.539 
night and then Monday night as well but
sundays<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.930> mondays<00:01:37.380> historically<00:01:38.220> have

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
sundays and mondays historically have

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.999 
sundays and mondays historically have
been<00:01:38.780> beneficial<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> league<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
been beneficial for the league but it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.160 
been beneficial for the league but it
certainly<00:01:41.220> seems<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.820> they<00:01:42.390> want<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> expand

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
certainly seems like they want to expand

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.569 
certainly seems like they want to expand
that<00:01:43.350> calendar<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> little<00:01:44.159> bit<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.520> i

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that calendar out a little bit and i

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
that calendar out a little bit and i
think<00:01:44.790> thursday<00:01:45.000> night<00:01:45.240> football<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
think thursday night football is here to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.260 
think thursday night football is here to
stay<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:47.340> whether<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.180> not

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
stay really whether we like it or not

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.200 
stay really whether we like it or not
you<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.350> been<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.799> league<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.430> working

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
you have been in the league and working

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.060 
you have been in the league and working
in<00:01:51.299> football<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:51.930> long<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> former<00:01:52.770> GM

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
in football for so long as a former GM

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.280 
in football for so long as a former GM
so<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:53.610> about<00:01:53.790> how<00:01:54.390> important<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
so you know about how important this is

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.440 
so you know about how important this is
as<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> business<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> NFL<00:01:56.939> continues<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
as a business and the NFL continues to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.179 
as a business and the NFL continues to
give<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.500> figure<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.070> many

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
give you up and figure out so many

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.399 
give you up and figure out so many
strategies<00:01:59.549> one<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.119> them<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.509> expanding<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
strategies one of them is expanding the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.230 
strategies one of them is expanding the
league<00:02:01.590> overseas<00:02:02.310> how<00:02:02.850> do<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.030> feel<00:02:03.210> about

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
league overseas how do you feel about

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.940 
league overseas how do you feel about
how<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.630> league<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.020> handling<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.740> terms

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
how the league is handling this in terms

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.590 
how the league is handling this in terms
of<00:02:05.130> trying<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.490> increase<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.969> popularity<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
of trying to increase the popularity of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
of trying to increase the popularity of
this<00:02:06.750> well<00:02:07.020> i<00:02:07.140> think<00:02:07.229> there's<00:02:07.649> no<00:02:08.250> question

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
this well i think there's no question

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.710 
this well i think there's no question
that<00:02:09.119> we're<00:02:09.660> seeing<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
that we're seeing a

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.040 
that we're seeing a
a<00:02:11.250> scenario<00:02:12.250> here<00:02:12.640> play<00:02:12.940> out<00:02:13.120> with<00:02:13.420> multiple

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
a scenario here play out with multiple

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.320 
a scenario here play out with multiple
games<00:02:14.290> now<00:02:14.620> going<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.070> be<00:02:15.190> played<00:02:15.520> over<00:02:15.760> at

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
games now going to be played over at

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.080 
games now going to be played over at
Wembley<00:02:16.690> Stadium<00:02:16.720> in<00:02:17.200> London<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.550> think<00:02:18.970> it's

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
Wembley Stadium in London I think it's

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.420 
Wembley Stadium in London I think it's
inevitable<00:02:19.360> before<00:02:20.080> 18<00:02:20.440> goes<00:02:20.680> over<00:02:21.040> there<00:02:21.220> and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
inevitable before 18 goes over there and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.630 
inevitable before 18 goes over there and
what's<00:02:21.910> going<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.120> happen<00:02:22.600> is<00:02:22.990> if<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.890> team<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
what's going to happen is if a team the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.520 
what's going to happen is if a team the
visiting<00:02:25.060> team<00:02:25.270> goes<00:02:25.540> over<00:02:25.990> then<00:02:26.290> they're

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
visiting team goes over then they're

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.770 
visiting team goes over then they're
going<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.740> likely<00:02:27.370> have<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.760> by<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.150> following

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
going to likely have a by the following

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.660 
going to likely have a by the following
weekend<00:02:29.350> because<00:02:29.500> it's<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.220> little<00:02:30.430> bit<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.610> a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
weekend because it's a little bit of a

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.980 
weekend because it's a little bit of a
longer<00:02:30.880> trip<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:31.240> really<00:02:31.510> from<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.780> east

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
longer trip but really from the east

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.660 
longer trip but really from the east
coast<00:02:32.260> it's<00:02:32.620> not<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.040> much<00:02:33.070> further<00:02:33.460> than

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
coast it's not that much further than

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.570 
coast it's not that much further than
say<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.420> New<00:02:34.660> York<00:02:34.960> team<00:02:35.230> flying<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> west

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
say a New York team flying to the west

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.000 
say a New York team flying to the west
coast<00:02:36.820> for<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.180> game<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.660> it's<00:02:37.930> not<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.440> far

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
coast for a game so it's not that far

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.680 
coast for a game so it's not that far
out<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.430> realm<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.240> don't<00:02:40.450> think<00:02:40.540> it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
out of the realm and I don't think it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.030 
out of the realm and I don't think it
would<00:02:40.780> be<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:40.930> difficult<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.680> pull<00:02:42.010> off

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
would be that difficult to pull off

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.480 
would be that difficult to pull off
think<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.940> question<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.720> long<00:02:44.410> term<00:02:44.860> the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
think the question is long term the

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.240 
think the question is long term the
sustainability<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.480> American<00:02:47.110> football<00:02:47.560> over

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
sustainability of American football over

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.199 
sustainability of American football over
in<00:02:49.320> european<00:02:50.320> football<00:02:50.770> territory<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:52.060> an

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
in european football territory it is an

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.940 
in european football territory it is an
interesting<00:02:52.600> mix<00:02:52.990> I<00:02:53.260> know<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> one<00:02:53.620> thing

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
interesting mix I know the one thing

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.520 
interesting mix I know the one thing
players<00:02:54.400> are<00:02:54.670> not<00:02:54.850> happy<00:02:55.240> about<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.080> taxes

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
players are not happy about is the taxes

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.840 
players are not happy about is the taxes
the<00:02:56.770> tax<00:02:57.010> situation<00:02:57.190> because<00:02:57.640> they<00:02:57.730> would

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
the tax situation because they would

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.340 
the tax situation because they would
probably<00:02:58.209> have<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.360> spend<00:02:58.480> taxes<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.200> bone

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
probably have to spend taxes and bone

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.960 
probably have to spend taxes and bone
