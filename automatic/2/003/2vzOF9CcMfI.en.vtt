 lazio the VAT in the last 60 years has multiplied its population by another 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.249
 It was 173 thousand inhabitants in 1950

 the pirates were installed as they came from all over the country 

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:23.510
 around what already exists 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.919
 having as reference central axis

 the historic center of the city 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.989
 that city piece founded in the 16th century 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.850
 just 10 minutes from the government palace and the municipality of Lima 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.780
 fifteen of the congress of the republic and 20 of the courthouse 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.620
 that is to say 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.780
 at a short distance from the centers of national power and in decision-making 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.660
 From Peru 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.720
 is the sector called 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720
 the left bank of the rímac river 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.680
 sends left bank of the river Rímac is embarked between important 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.830
 Avenues some of vent to the port of Callao main port 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.650
 Peruvian 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.940
 other truckloads of nearby industries 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.700
 and another access to the center of Lima 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.300
 in the area approximately 90 thousand people live, the area includes four commas 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.220
 9 square kilometers of extension 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 includes an aria of an industrial nature 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.799
 with an increasingly decadent dynamic my other one of character 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.480
 residential Lambayeque until the same bank of the Rimac River 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.260
 Lamarque primary for the first time in 1954 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.590
 this is an aerial photograph of 1944 it's basically me an agricultural area already 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.320
 in this 1958 photo, the beginning of the urbanization process can be seen 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.640
 in this one the 2007 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.780
 already are all evidence of their problems at the time of the invasion 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.329
 the area was an old dump near the railway line 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.560
 in the margin 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.840
 At least 88 percent of the area is used as a residential area, which 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.290
 25 level 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.850
 of overcrowding approximately 364 inhabitants per hectare 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.000
 it only has a zero point 47% area for recreational use 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.390
 in other words there is no space for recreation and the neighborhood meeting 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.749
 in the public space 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.549
 only 30% of the houses are of a satisfactory state of construction 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.859
 from all the aforementioned context of the conditions in which 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.279
 the population of the left bank of the rímac river is settled 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:30.489
 It presents very complex situations that show vulnerabilities that 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.290
 could face a natural disaster in the face of environmental situations 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.029
 it offered permanent social conjunctures 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.629
 mark the vicious circle of poverty 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.169
 from where access to a better life 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 it becomes literally impossible 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:54.889
 when 70% of the houses on the left bank present problems are more 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.119
 or less acute 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.119
 when about five hundred homes are in deplorable condition 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.599
 when they return to emilia fisher they lie even more taking into account that the 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.689
 Peru is not a seismic zone 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.739
 that's why the old dump leak where the recycling of garbage is 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.739
 became one of the most important tasks 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.149
 by the way the left bank of the rímac river efe 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:24.729
 the recycling carved 70 years everything that was built on the margin 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:27.859
 it has been built on a soft and inconsistent terrain 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.629
 because of that 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.629
 Many homes are cracked or tilted 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:37.039
 the dwellings on the edge of riosa of an absolutely worrying condition 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:40.249
 this image shows the last accident on the left bank 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:45.479
 a house at the foot of the slope was the product of water leaks and 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.889
 falls to the void 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.829
 a person dies 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.240
 but imagine if you do 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.730
 in the area there are many people dedicated to the work of collecting and segregating 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.279
 Solid waste 

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:58.269
 the storage rooms of the material to be segregated 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.619
 they are not safe 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:02.959
 Fire can occur due to short circuits, there were other factors 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.180
 log 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.649
 but cut 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:10.109
 at this level he has an eye 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.109
 director clarified I'm more careful 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.669
 While your smiling living space we want to live in decent conditions 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.029
 in that becoming in damage to your health 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.610
 the citizen of the left bank of the rímac river 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.099
 will present public had correspondent the environment 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.059
 the uncontrolled waste management has been taking place for many years 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:37.080
 solids of all kinds urges the area environmental rehabilitation energies 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.849
 to days 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.849
 Waste segregation has been inadequately 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.759
 however the creators recognize their work 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.759
 can also contribute to environmental improvement 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.340
 it's time for us to collaborate 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.509
 with the environment 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.629
 It's that the recovery of paper and cardboard etc 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.229
 we wanted 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.240
 a pantry 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.809
 against 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.009
 score goals 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.270
 the prelate constantly alcatraz
