we<00:04:09.790> really<00:04:10.000> wanted<00:04:10.270> to<00:04:10.450> do<00:04:11.230> like<00:04:11.560> do<00:04:12.220> something

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
and we just didn't work but I guess

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.550

that's<00:04:16.600> how<00:04:17.290> life<00:04:18.000> goes<00:04:19.000> right<00:04:19.270> you<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:20.350> try

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
that's how life goes right you to try

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.920 
that's how life goes right you to try
something<00:04:20.830> it<00:04:21.130> doesn't<00:04:21.340> work<00:04:21.580> and<00:04:21.850> try<00:04:22.630> again

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
something it doesn't work and try again

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.160 
something it doesn't work and try again
or<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.710> just<00:04:24.040> do<00:04:24.370> something<00:04:24.610> else<00:04:28.170> water

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170
