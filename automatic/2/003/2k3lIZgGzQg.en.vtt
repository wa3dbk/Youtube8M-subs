00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
of go in and create lift only at the

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.120 
of go in and create lift only at the
roots<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.180> don't<00:05:20.360> want<00:05:20.480> to<00:05:20.540> come<00:05:20.720> through<00:05:21.130> the

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
roots you don't want to come through the

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.880 
roots you don't want to come through the
whole<00:05:22.480> definition<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:26.660> you<00:05:26.750> see<00:05:26.960> is<00:05:27.200> sitting

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
whole definition and you see is sitting

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.890 
whole definition and you see is sitting
up<00:05:28.070> now<00:05:28.280> that's<00:05:29.000> what<00:05:29.150> we're<00:05:29.330> going<00:05:29.570> for<00:05:29.630> we're

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
up now that's what we're going for we're

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.270 
up now that's what we're going for we're
trying<00:05:30.110> to<00:05:30.170> create<00:05:30.260> volume<00:05:30.620> so<00:05:32.860> just<00:05:33.860> go<00:05:34.040> in

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
trying to create volume so just go in

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.870 
trying to create volume so just go in
lift<00:05:35.230> separate<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:40.280> see<00:05:40.520> it's<00:05:40.670> kind<00:05:40.850> of

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
lift separate and see it's kind of

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.720 
lift separate and see it's kind of
creating<00:05:41.150> that<00:05:41.330> kind<00:05:41.930> of<00:05:42.020> messy<00:05:42.590> look<00:05:43.340> to<00:05:43.550> it

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
creating that kind of messy look to it

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.970 
creating that kind of messy look to it
so<00:05:44.540> you<00:05:44.630> can<00:05:44.870> really<00:05:45.290> see<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.680> difference

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
so you can really see the difference

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.580 
so you can really see the difference
between<00:05:46.040> this<00:05:46.460> side<00:05:46.700> here<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.600> this<00:05:47.960> side<00:05:48.020> I'm

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
between this side here and this side I'm

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.860 
between this side here and this side I'm
actually<00:05:48.740> going<00:05:48.950> to<00:05:49.010> pick<00:05:49.250> up<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:50.420> front<00:05:50.750> of

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
actually going to pick up the front of

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:57.629 
actually going to pick up the front of
this<00:05:51.020> a<00:05:51.380> little<00:05:51.770> bit<00:05:51.980> so<00:05:52.580> it<00:05:52.700> doesn't<00:05:52.730> look<00:05:53.060> so

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.350 

okay<00:05:58.639> so<00:05:58.699> you<00:05:58.879> don't<00:05:58.940> see<00:05:59.120> the<00:05:59.240> difference

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
okay so you don't see the difference

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.450 
okay so you don't see the difference
like<00:05:59.720> this<00:05:59.960> side<00:06:00.169> it<00:06:00.379> just<00:06:00.560> looks<00:06:00.800> very<00:06:01.190> very

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
like this side it just looks very very

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.860 
like this side it just looks very very
like<00:06:02.419> perfectly<00:06:03.169> laid<00:06:03.650> I<00:06:04.520> did<00:06:05.060> my<00:06:05.300> hair<00:06:05.629> today

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
like perfectly laid I did my hair today

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.080 
like perfectly laid I did my hair today
it's<00:06:06.349> so<00:06:06.590> perfect<00:06:07.129> whereas<00:06:07.430> this<00:06:07.639> side<00:06:07.699> is<00:06:08.060> a

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
it's so perfect whereas this side is a

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.320 
it's so perfect whereas this side is a
lot<00:06:08.330> more<00:06:08.659> messy<00:06:09.650> but<00:06:09.919> you<00:06:10.039> still<00:06:10.340> got<00:06:10.610> you

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
lot more messy but you still got you

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.439 
lot more messy but you still got you
know<00:06:11.479> a<00:06:11.780> lot<00:06:12.229> of<00:06:12.379> definition<00:06:13.129> so<00:06:16.150> you<00:06:17.150> can<00:06:17.330> see

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
know a lot of definition so you can see

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.059 
know a lot of definition so you can see
the<00:06:17.569> difference<00:06:18.020> and<00:06:18.409> it<00:06:18.590> works<00:06:18.740> for<00:06:18.889> both

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:19.069 
the difference and it works for both

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:22.149 
the difference and it works for both
genders<00:06:19.629> you<00:06:20.629> know<00:06:20.780> it<00:06:21.349> just<00:06:21.379> depends<00:06:21.919> on<00:06:22.069> the

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 
genders you know it just depends on the

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:23.469 
genders you know it just depends on the
look<00:06:22.400> that<00:06:22.430> you're<00:06:22.669> going<00:06:22.789> for<00:06:22.940> and<00:06:23.240> I<00:06:23.300> looked

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
look that you're going for and I looked

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:28.300 
look that you're going for and I looked
at<00:06:23.599> you<00:06:23.629> like<00:06:23.960> so<00:06:24.580> again<00:06:25.930> just<00:06:26.930> lifting<00:06:27.409> going

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
at you like so again just lifting going

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:38.499 
at you like so again just lifting going
in<00:06:28.430> with<00:06:28.520> the<00:06:28.610> pick<00:06:29.860> and<00:06:30.860> lift

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:38.509 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.579 

don't<00:06:39.509> overdo<00:06:39.779> it

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:40.589 
don't overdo it

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:42.769 
don't overdo it
because<00:06:41.489> if<00:06:41.609> you<00:06:41.729> if<00:06:41.969> you<00:06:42.089> overdo<00:06:42.449> the<00:06:42.569> roots

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:42.779 
because if you if you overdo the roots

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:45.469 
because if you if you overdo the roots
you<00:06:42.929> go<00:06:43.219> end<00:06:44.219> up<00:06:44.459> losing<00:06:44.729> way<00:06:45.029> more<00:06:45.269> your

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
you go end up losing way more your

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:51.279 
you go end up losing way more your
definition<00:06:46.049> than<00:06:46.169> you<00:06:46.289> really<00:06:46.559> want<00:06:46.829> to<00:06:49.099> but

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.289 
definition than you really want to but

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.269 
definition than you really want to but
hopefully<00:06:52.289> you<00:06:52.409> can<00:06:52.469> see<00:06:52.709> it<00:06:52.739> coming<00:06:53.099> together

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:53.279 
hopefully you can see it coming together

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:57.129 
hopefully you can see it coming together
it's<00:06:53.669> just<00:06:53.819> a<00:06:53.939> real<00:06:54.449> messy<00:06:54.899> twist<00:06:55.229> out<00:06:55.499> but

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139 
it's just a real messy twist out but

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.619 
it's just a real messy twist out but
it's<00:06:58.139> more<00:06:58.499> of<00:06:58.559> like<00:06:58.919> a<00:06:58.949> masculine<00:06:59.549> edge<00:06:59.939> to<00:07:00.419> it

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:00.629 
it's more of like a masculine edge to it

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:05.239 
it's more of like a masculine edge to it
I<00:07:00.899> personally<00:07:01.619> think<00:07:01.829> and<00:07:03.979> it<00:07:04.979> kind<00:07:05.189> of

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:05.249 
I personally think and it kind of

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:11.989 
I personally think and it kind of
resembles<00:07:05.849> like<00:07:06.649> free-forming<00:07:07.649> locks<00:07:10.999> or

00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:11.999 
resembles like free-forming locks or

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:14.299 
resembles like free-forming locks or
like<00:07:12.299> a<00:07:12.329> lion's<00:07:13.169> mane<00:07:13.469> or<00:07:13.799> something<00:07:14.129> like

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:14.309 
like a lion's mane or something like

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:18.499 
like a lion's mane or something like
that<00:07:14.549> so<00:07:15.169> again<00:07:16.610> design<00:07:17.610> essentials<00:07:18.239> twist

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:18.509 
that so again design essentials twist

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:21.109 
that so again design essentials twist
and<00:07:18.659> set<00:07:19.099> and<00:07:20.099> just<00:07:20.309> twist<00:07:20.489> it<00:07:20.699> on<00:07:20.849> right<00:07:21.089> here

00:07:21.109 --> 00:07:21.119 
and set and just twist it on right here

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:37.299 
and set and just twist it on right here
and<00:07:21.599> here's<00:07:22.229> the<00:07:22.469> results
