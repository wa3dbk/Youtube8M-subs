00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.510 
telekinesis I don't know if it's
telekinesis<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:27.630> they<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:27.900> definitely

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
telekinesis but they can definitely

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.730 
telekinesis but they can definitely
throw<00:02:30.770> projectiles<00:02:32.270> shit<00:02:33.270> at<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.660> okay<00:02:34.530> and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
throw projectiles shit at you okay and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.890 
throw projectiles shit at you okay and
it<00:02:34.830> looks<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.150> catching<00:02:36.150> them<00:02:36.240> on<00:02:36.360> fire<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.870> a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
it looks like catching them on fire is a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.530 
it looks like catching them on fire is a
pretty<00:02:37.140> good<00:02:37.320> way<00:02:37.880> well<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.910> was<00:02:39.030> using<00:02:39.239> my

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
pretty good way well I was using my

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.410 
pretty good way well I was using my
incendiary<00:02:41.180> ammo<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.420> shotgun<00:02:42.950> okay<00:02:43.950> I

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
incendiary ammo for the shotgun okay I

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.600 
incendiary ammo for the shotgun okay I
mean<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.690> wouldn't<00:02:46.680> say<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.920> fire<00:02:47.370> works

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
mean I wouldn't say that fire works

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.660 
mean I wouldn't say that fire works
particularly<00:02:48.120> well<00:02:48.770> just<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:49.950> well<00:02:50.550> they

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
particularly well just that well they

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.000 
particularly well just that well they
move<00:02:50.850> around<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.270> lot<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.630> do<00:02:52.260> all<00:02:52.440> they<00:02:52.709> catch

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
move around a lot to do all they catch

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.430 
move around a lot to do all they catch
the<00:02:53.220> if<00:02:53.640> they<00:02:53.730> carry<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.300> fire<00:02:54.540> with<00:02:55.260> them

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
the if they carry the fire with them

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.350 
the if they carry the fire with them
when<00:02:55.680> they<00:02:55.830> teleport<00:02:56.400> no<00:02:56.730> they<00:02:56.910> don't<00:02:57.120> they

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
when they teleport no they don't they

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.220 
when they teleport no they don't they
don't<00:02:58.070> take<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> drink<00:02:59.400> oh<00:02:59.840> shit<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.930> got<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.170> get
