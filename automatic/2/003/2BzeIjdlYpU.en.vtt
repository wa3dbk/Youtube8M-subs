it<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.890> both<00:03:02.480> inhibitor<00:03:03.480> as<00:03:03.720> well<00:03:04.260> as<00:03:04.440> promoter

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
it is both inhibitor as well as promoter

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.520 
it is both inhibitor as well as promoter
but<00:03:06.000> largely<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.700> inhibitor<00:03:08.700> hormone<00:03:09.530> so
