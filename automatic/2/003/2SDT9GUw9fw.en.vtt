00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.880

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.910
 I already have some advertisements and it's 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.340

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:43.559

 continuing to record the video galera 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.030
 because I had a break a day since I had 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:56.390
 someone to intrude on the recording so I 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:59.960

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:41.210

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.239

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.460
 God
