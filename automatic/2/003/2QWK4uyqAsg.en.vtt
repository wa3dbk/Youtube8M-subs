00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
to receive which is like great for me I

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.430 
to receive which is like great for me I
hate<00:01:01.780> long<00:01:02.320> shipping<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.600> that's<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:04.960> lace<00:01:05.170> I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.710 
hate long shipping so that's the lace I
had<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:05.860> do<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.010> little<00:01:06.340> bit<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.610> tweezing<00:01:07.210> in

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
had to do a little bit of tweezing in

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.680 
had to do a little bit of tweezing in
the<00:01:08.590> part<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:09.909> it<00:01:10.180> would<00:01:10.270> look<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.570> little

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
the part so that it would look a little

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.150 
the part so that it would look a little
bit<00:01:10.869> more<00:01:10.990> realistic<00:01:11.260> because<00:01:11.619> when<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:11.890> got<00:01:12.070> it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
bit more realistic because when I got it

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.770
