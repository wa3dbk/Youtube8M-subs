00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.230
 hello women 365 I'm Maria Elisabeth from 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.509
 rivadeneira owner of karma in the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.759
 today's segment I can do it we're going to 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.250
 teach them a technique that is imitation 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.930
 lace 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.440
 This is in keeping with the list of 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.260
 materials the materials are paintings 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.070
 acrylics one dark color and another one 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.059
 white color a eyeliner brush a 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.430
 flat wide brush tracing paper in 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.290
 White 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.140
 a surface on which they want 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.140
 to work 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.140
 tile 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.820
 count on water 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.829
 and dryer the first step to perform 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.769
 this work is let's anchor 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:05.280
 with a dark color in this case I 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:08.640
 I'm using a mdf board 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.780
 they are going to apply two layers leaving to dry 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.780
 between layer and layer 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.979
 It is preferable to use a dark color to 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.979
 that highlights then the lace 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.580
 once we have dried the paint 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.780
 let's trace the design we want 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.200
 Put puts on white tracing paper 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.430
 the design and with a pencil they begin to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.430
 go through the whole drawing 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 this is what should be left 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.540
 once we have the drawing 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.790
 with an eyeliner brush and with paint 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.880
 white acrylic let's start to 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.300
 review and put the details there 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.300
 what to put 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.500
 Now let's put nice details that 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.500
 missing to finish the job 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.810
 with the handle of the brush they will be 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.810
 little dots all around 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.390
 Y 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.880
 well, we continue making dots all 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.330
 around and when you see that 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.930
 nothing is missing to finish 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.720
 we take the dryer to speed up the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.560
 paint drying 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.110
 dry and if you wish you can 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.850
 apply a coat of sealer to 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.580
 can then clean it with a cloth 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.990
 humid the determined product should 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.340
 to be like these samples that we have 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.739
 here 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.830
 remember that we are located on the street 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:42.540
 third number 417 between dates and the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.400
 nuns telephone 23 84 515 remember that 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.540

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.540
