00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.079 

okay<00:00:05.190> now<00:00:05.370> we're<00:00:05.520> going<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.759> do<00:00:05.879> what's<00:00:06.029> called

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
okay now we're going to do what's called

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.600 
okay now we're going to do what's called
a<00:00:06.359> simple<00:00:06.750> stain<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.259> just<00:00:07.830> like<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.130> sounds

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
a simple stain and just like it sounds

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.820 
a simple stain and just like it sounds
it's<00:00:08.790> simple<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.929> fact<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.290> there's<00:00:10.530> not

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
it's simple in the fact that there's not

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.520 
it's simple in the fact that there's not
many<00:00:11.010> steps<00:00:11.429> okay<00:00:12.179> as<00:00:12.389> opposed<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.349> what

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
many steps okay as opposed to what

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.990 
many steps okay as opposed to what
you'll<00:00:13.650> be<00:00:13.799> doing<00:00:13.950> next<00:00:14.309> time<00:00:14.610> which<00:00:14.849> is

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
you'll be doing next time which is

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.480 
you'll be doing next time which is
called<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.330> differential<00:00:15.990> stain<00:00:16.490> differential

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
called a differential stain differential

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.800 
called a differential stain differential
stains<00:00:17.760> help<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.150> distinguish<00:00:18.779> between

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
stains help you distinguish between

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.260 
stains help you distinguish between
different<00:00:19.289> types<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.830> bacteria<00:00:20.060> there's<00:00:21.060> also

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
different types of bacteria there's also

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.820 
different types of bacteria there's also
special<00:00:21.689> stains<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.320> we're<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> do

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
special stains that we're going to do

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.220 
special stains that we're going to do
that<00:00:22.949> look<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.310> specific<00:00:23.910> things<00:00:24.050> but<00:00:25.050> right

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
that look for specific things but right

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.630 
that look for specific things but right
now<00:00:25.410> we're<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> simple<00:00:26.430> stain

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
now we're going to do the simple stain

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.630 
now we're going to do the simple stain
which<00:00:26.880> means<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.330> put<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:27.990> color<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.490> we

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
which means we put on one color and we

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.939 
which means we put on one color and we
wash<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.880> off<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.420> allow<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.810> dry<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
wash it off and allow it to dry the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.959 
wash it off and allow it to dry the
reason<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.369> we're<00:00:32.520> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> give<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
reason that we're going to give the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
reason that we're going to give the
bacterial<00:00:33.570> color<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.559> we<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.800> see

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
bacterial color is so that we can see

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.430 
bacterial color is so that we can see
them<00:00:35.190> under<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> microscope<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:37.170> were<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
them under the microscope if you were to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
them under the microscope if you were to
just<00:00:37.620> take<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> bacteria<00:00:38.520> put<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
just take the bacteria put it on the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.510 
just take the bacteria put it on the
slide<00:00:39.840> put<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> coverslip<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.250> look<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
slide put a coverslip on and look it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880 
slide put a coverslip on and look it
under<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> microscope<00:00:42.110> it's<00:00:43.110> interesting<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
under the microscope it's interesting to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
under the microscope it's interesting to
see<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> movement<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
see because you can see the movement of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.600 
see because you can see the movement of
the<00:00:45.629> bacteria<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.890> they're<00:00:47.070> hard<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> see

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the bacteria but they're hard to see

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
the bacteria but they're hard to see
because<00:00:48.149> they<00:00:48.329> are<00:00:48.480> colorless<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.260> blend<00:00:49.559> in

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
because they are colorless they blend in

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.279 
because they are colorless they blend in
with<00:00:49.860> their<00:00:50.039> background<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.820> we're<00:00:51.539> after<00:00:51.899> we

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
with their background so we're after we

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.189 
with their background so we're after we
fix<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.460> we're<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> stain<00:00:54.809> them<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
fix them we're going to stain them to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.380 
fix them we're going to stain them to
give<00:00:55.350> them<00:00:55.469> color<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> simple<00:00:57.000> stain<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
give them color with a simple stain the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.060 
give them color with a simple stain the
purpose<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.899> doing<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.260> simple<00:00:58.620> stain<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
purpose of doing the simple stain is a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.520 
purpose of doing the simple stain is a
couple<00:00:59.489> things<00:00:59.780> first<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
couple things first of all it's going to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.759 
couple things first of all it's going to
teach<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.190> how<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> properly<00:01:03.239> stain<00:01:03.989> okay

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
teach you how to properly stain okay

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.399 
teach you how to properly stain okay
second<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:05.790> by<00:01:06.270> giving<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.780> color<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
second of all by giving them color you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.289 
second of all by giving them color you
can<00:01:07.590> actually<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:08.250> their<00:01:08.430> morphology<00:01:08.640> or

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
can actually see their morphology or

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.270 
can actually see their morphology or
their<00:01:09.570> shape<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:11.070> their

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
their shape you can see their

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
their shape you can see their
arrangement<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.659> diplo<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.380> its<00:01:13.590> staff

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
arrangement is it diplo is its staff

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.370 
arrangement is it diplo is its staff
flow<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.400> its<00:01:14.610> drug<00:01:14.880> dough<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.200> also

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
flow is its drug dough and you can also

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.710 
flow is its drug dough and you can also
see<00:01:16.830> its<00:01:17.189> size<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.240> we're<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> be

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
see its size so we're going to be

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.300 
see its size so we're going to be
looking<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.170> three<00:01:19.409> different<00:01:19.560> bacteria

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
looking at three different bacteria

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.070 
looking at three different bacteria
they're<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.420> different<00:01:21.840> sizes

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
they're going to be of different sizes

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.050 
they're going to be of different sizes
they're<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.400> different<00:01:23.790> shapes

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
they're going to be of different shapes

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450 
they're going to be of different shapes
and<00:01:24.420> different<00:01:24.869> arrangements<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.920> you'll<00:01:26.340> be

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and different arrangements so you'll be

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.910 
and different arrangements so you'll be
able<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.909> observe<00:01:27.210> those<00:01:27.479> things<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.590> gives

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
able to observe those things that gives

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.370 
able to observe those things that gives
you<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> foundation<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:30.689> go<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you the foundation to then go on to the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.020 
you the foundation to then go on to the
next<00:01:31.650> stain<00:01:32.009> which<00:01:32.220> will<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> Gram<00:01:32.790> stain

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
next stain which will be the Gram stain

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.359 
next stain which will be the Gram stain
when<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.509> start<00:01:33.780> doing<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.650> distinguishing

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
when you start doing the distinguishing

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.999 
when you start doing the distinguishing
between<00:01:35.400> bacteria<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.320> started<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:37.979> with

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
between bacteria so we started out with

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.240 
between bacteria so we started out with
looking<00:01:38.549> at<00:01:38.700> bacteria<00:01:39.530> on<00:01:40.530> plates<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.159> things

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
looking at bacteria on plates and things

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.740 
looking at bacteria on plates and things
like<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.790> looking<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> colony

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
like that and looking at the colony

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.810 
like that and looking at the colony
shape<00:01:42.990> now<00:01:43.770> we're<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.340> looking<00:01:44.670> at

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
shape now we're going to be looking at

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.460 
shape now we're going to be looking at
the<00:01:44.970> actual<00:01:45.270> bacterial<00:01:46.049> shape<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the actual bacterial shape and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.020 
the actual bacterial shape and
arrangement<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:47.460> we'll<00:01:47.670> start<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
arrangement then we'll start the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.179 
arrangement then we'll start the
differentiating<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.200> we're<00:01:49.409> identifying

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
differentiating so now we're identifying

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.850 
differentiating so now we're identifying
the<00:01:50.430> different<00:01:50.579> bacteria<00:01:51.320> now<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the different bacteria now we have the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.819 
the different bacteria now we have the
slides<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.460> previously<00:01:54.380> made<00:01:55.380> smears

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
slides that we previously made smears

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.679 
slides that we previously made smears
and<00:01:55.950> fixed<00:01:57.259> okay<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.340> said<00:01:59.399> before<00:01:59.850> you

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and fixed okay so like I said before you

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.340 
and fixed okay so like I said before you
start<00:02:00.990> any<00:02:01.259> staining<00:02:01.649> procedure<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.909> will

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
start any staining procedure you will

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.070 
start any staining procedure you will
prepare<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.409> smear<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> fix<00:02:05.640> this

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
prepare a smear and fix this

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.370 
prepare a smear and fix this
unless<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.950> procedure<00:02:07.370> tells<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:08.119> not<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.450> so

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
unless the procedure tells you not to so

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.680 
unless the procedure tells you not to so
don't<00:02:09.650> skip<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.250> whole<00:02:10.430> part<00:02:10.729> of<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.060> last

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
don't skip the whole part of the last

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.930 
don't skip the whole part of the last
video<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.470> preparing<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.490> mirror<00:02:13.790> and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
video of preparing this mirror and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.270 
video of preparing this mirror and
fixing<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:14.870> I've<00:02:15.410> already<00:02:15.770> done<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.220> so

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
fixing it so I've already done that so

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.060 
fixing it so I've already done that so
I'm<00:02:16.610> ready<00:02:16.820> for<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.180> staining<00:02:17.420> procedure

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
I'm ready for the staining procedure

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.530 
I'm ready for the staining procedure
there's<00:02:19.070> various<00:02:19.520> simple<00:02:19.880> things<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.420> you

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
there's various simple things that you

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.520 
there's various simple things that you
can<00:02:20.720> use<00:02:21.490> simple<00:02:22.490> stains<00:02:22.910> like<00:02:23.780> these<00:02:24.140> are

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
can use simple stains like these are

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.430 
can use simple stains like these are
stains<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.700> are<00:02:25.880> have<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> negative<00:02:26.570> charge

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
stains that are have a negative charge

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.980 
stains that are have a negative charge
to<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.860> I'm<00:02:28.220> sorry<00:02:28.490> scratch<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.510> have<00:02:29.960> a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
to it I'm sorry scratch that have a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.440 
to it I'm sorry scratch that have a
positive<00:02:30.740> charge<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.520> which<00:02:32.090> allows

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
positive charge to that which allows

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.230 
positive charge to that which allows
them<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.810> adhere<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.340> bacterial<00:02:34.910> cells

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
them to adhere to the bacterial cells

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.390 
them to adhere to the bacterial cells
because<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.140> cells<00:02:36.380> themselves<00:02:36.650> have<00:02:37.370> a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
because the cells themselves have a

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.850 
because the cells themselves have a
slight<00:02:37.760> negative<00:02:38.030> charge<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:38.900> these<00:02:39.620> are

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
slight negative charge so these are

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.830 
slight negative charge so these are
direct<00:02:40.310> stains<00:02:40.640> because<00:02:41.120> they<00:02:41.300> stain<00:02:41.600> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
direct stains because they stain the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.140 
direct stains because they stain the
bacteria<00:02:42.500> later<00:02:43.370> we're<00:02:43.640> going<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.850> see<00:02:44.000> what's

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
bacteria later we're going to see what's

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.880 
bacteria later we're going to see what's
called<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.480> negative<00:02:44.720> stain<00:02:45.320> where<00:02:45.830> it

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
called a negative stain where it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.320 
called a negative stain where it
actually<00:02:46.040> stains<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.700> background<00:02:47.120> instead

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
actually stains the background instead

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.660 
actually stains the background instead
of<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.840> bacteria<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:49.040> we're<00:02:49.220> going<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.400> use

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
of the bacteria so we're going to use

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.430 
of the bacteria so we're going to use
these<00:02:49.940> types<00:02:50.270> of<00:02:50.420> stains<00:02:50.690> like<00:02:50.900> crystal

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
these types of stains like crystal

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.540 
these types of stains like crystal
violet<00:02:52.570> methylene<00:02:53.570> blue<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.250> carbon<00:02:55.250> fusion

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
violet methylene blue and carbon fusion

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.240 
violet methylene blue and carbon fusion
because<00:02:56.300> these<00:02:56.690> are<00:02:56.870> all<00:02:57.110> positively<00:02:57.800> charged

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
because these are all positively charged

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.100 
because these are all positively charged
stains<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.880> only<00:02:59.150> difference<00:02:59.540> between<00:02:59.720> them

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
stains the only difference between them

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.050 
stains the only difference between them
is<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.680> going<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.890> be<00:03:00.950> purple<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.880> is

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
is this is going to be purple this is

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.640 
is this is going to be purple this is
going<00:03:02.209> to<00:03:02.270> be<00:03:02.360> blue<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.320> going<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.530> be

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
going to be blue and this is going to be

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.460 
going to be blue and this is going to be
a<00:03:03.680> red<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.220> procedure<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.360> same<00:03:05.390> but<00:03:06.320> by

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
a red the procedure is the same but by

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.260 
a red the procedure is the same but by
doing<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:06.980> three<00:03:07.220> different<00:03:07.550> stains<00:03:07.850> on<00:03:08.120> our

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
doing the three different stains on our

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.120 
doing the three different stains on our
three<00:03:08.480> different<00:03:08.780> bacteria<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.770> can<00:03:09.800> get<00:03:10.100> a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
three different bacteria you can get a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.740 
three different bacteria you can get a
feel<00:03:10.400> for<00:03:10.610> what<00:03:10.790> different<00:03:11.150> colors<00:03:11.450> look<00:03:11.720> like

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
feel for what different colors look like

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.750 
feel for what different colors look like
so<00:03:12.530> when<00:03:12.709> you're<00:03:12.830> trying<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.220> distinguish

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
so when you're trying to distinguish

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.300 
so when you're trying to distinguish
under<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.150> microscope<00:03:14.600> red<00:03:15.080> blue<00:03:15.860> purple

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
under the microscope red blue purple

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.620 
under the microscope red blue purple
it's<00:03:16.730> going<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:16.970> look<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.239> little<00:03:17.390> bit

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
it's going to look a little bit

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.240 
it's going to look a little bit
different<00:03:18.080> than<00:03:18.230> what<00:03:18.380> they<00:03:18.530> look<00:03:18.769> like<00:03:18.800> here

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
different than what they look like here

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.270 
different than what they look like here
now<00:03:20.090> keeping<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.720> mind<00:03:20.900> these<00:03:21.170> are<00:03:21.230> stains<00:03:21.830> so

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
now keeping in mind these are stains so

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.759 
now keeping in mind these are stains so
you<00:03:22.880> want<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.120> be<00:03:23.209> wearing<00:03:23.480> gloves<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:24.019> do<00:03:24.500> not

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
you want to be wearing gloves I do not

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.770 
you want to be wearing gloves I do not
recommend<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.519> use<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.970> clothes<00:03:26.239> pins<00:03:26.570> it's

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
recommend you use the clothes pins it's

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.449 
recommend you use the clothes pins it's
completely<00:03:27.260> up<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.739> but<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:28.040> think<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.430> just

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
completely up to you but I think it just

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.880 
completely up to you but I think it just
makes<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.940> more<00:03:29.090> cumbersome<00:03:29.630> we<00:03:30.380> have<00:03:30.560> gloves

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
makes it more cumbersome we have gloves

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.530 
makes it more cumbersome we have gloves
on<00:03:31.100> we're<00:03:31.580> not<00:03:31.760> wearing<00:03:31.970> our<00:03:32.180> favorite

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
on we're not wearing our favorite

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.640 
on we're not wearing our favorite
clothes<00:03:32.750> which<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.170> shouldn't<00:03:33.350> be<00:03:33.470> wearing

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650

or something to cover it up these the
work<00:03:39.170> stain<00:03:39.530> does<00:03:39.830> mean<00:03:40.070> stain<00:03:40.370> it's<00:03:40.790> not<00:03:41.030> just

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
work stain does mean stain it's not just

work stain does mean stain it's not just
staining<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.690> bacteria<00:03:42.230> it's<00:03:42.440> staining

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
staining the bacteria it's staining

staining the bacteria it's staining
everything<00:03:43.820> okay<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.660> wear<00:03:45.380> gloves<00:03:45.650> to

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.440 
everything okay so you wear gloves to
make<00:03:46.010> sure<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.310> don't<00:03:46.430> get<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:46.760> on<00:03:46.880> your<00:03:47.060> hands

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
make sure you don't get it on your hands

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.170 
make sure you don't get it on your hands
so<00:03:48.110> basically<00:03:48.560> with<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.860> simple<00:03:49.430> stain<00:03:49.700> all

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
so basically with a simple stain all

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.290 
so basically with a simple stain all
you're<00:03:50.840> going<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.050> do<00:03:51.260> is<00:03:51.500> add<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.070> stain<00:03:52.340> let

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
you're going to do is add the stain let

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.150 
you're going to do is add the stain let
it<00:03:53.450> sit<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:54.170> you're<00:03:54.500> going<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.739> wash<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:54.890> off

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
it sit and you're going to wash it off

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.060 
it sit and you're going to wash it off
okay<00:03:55.910> so<00:03:56.750> I'm<00:03:57.290> going<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.440> do<00:03:57.560> crystal<00:03:57.950> violet

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
okay so I'm going to do crystal violet

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.100 
okay so I'm going to do crystal violet
and<00:03:58.489> then<00:03:58.640> methylene<00:03:59.030> blue<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.510> then<00:03:59.720> karbala

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
and then methylene blue and then karbala

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.630 
and then methylene blue and then karbala
fuchsia<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.709> just<00:04:03.980> squeeze<00:04:04.190> it<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.519> you

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
fuchsia so you just squeeze it and you

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.460 
fuchsia so you just squeeze it and you
literally<00:04:04.940> flood<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.570> smear<00:04:05.900> okay<00:04:06.410> so

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
literally flood the smear okay so

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.400 
literally flood the smear okay so
wherever<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.130> bacteria<00:04:07.640> was<00:04:07.850> you<00:04:08.330> flood<00:04:08.630> it

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
wherever the bacteria was you flood it

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.670 
wherever the bacteria was you flood it
this<00:04:10.890> one<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.130> just<00:04:11.190> had<00:04:11.520> one<00:04:11.670> on<00:04:13.310> his<00:04:14.310> mind<00:04:14.550> blue

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
this one I just had one on his mind blue

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.900 
this one I just had one on his mind blue
and<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.830> one<00:04:16.980> I<00:04:17.010> had<00:04:17.250> one<00:04:17.400> on<00:04:17.550> which<00:04:17.730> was<00:04:17.880> a

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
and this one I had one on which was a

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.539 
and this one I had one on which was a
carbo<00:04:18.269> fusion<00:04:18.630> now<00:04:18.989> remember<00:04:19.350> we<00:04:19.470> had<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:20.010> we

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
carbo fusion now remember we had that we

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.820 
carbo fusion now remember we had that we
had<00:04:20.670> made<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.030> circles<00:04:21.560> say<00:04:22.560> I'm<00:04:22.680> already

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
had made the circles say I'm already

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.390 
had made the circles say I'm already
make<00:04:23.160> them<00:04:23.280> s<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:24.300> would<00:04:24.710> put<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:25.860> circles<00:04:26.250> on

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
make them s you would put the circles on

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.000 
make them s you would put the circles on
the<00:04:26.550> bottom<00:04:26.580> of<00:04:27.420> it<00:04:27.660> because<00:04:28.350> if<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:28.590> put<00:04:28.860> the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
the bottom of it because if you put the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.860 
the bottom of it because if you put the
circles<00:04:29.400> or<00:04:29.520> marker<00:04:29.850> on<00:04:29.940> top<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.510> will<00:04:30.690> wash

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
circles or marker on top it will wash

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.750 
circles or marker on top it will wash
off<00:04:31.170> so<00:04:31.800> make<00:04:31.980> sure<00:04:32.010> when<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.460> put<00:04:32.640> your

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
off so make sure when you put your

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.850 
off so make sure when you put your
slides<00:04:32.970> up<00:04:33.210> here<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.510> stain<00:04:33.780> that<00:04:34.050> this<00:04:34.560> mirror

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
slides up here to stain that this mirror

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.290 
slides up here to stain that this mirror
is<00:04:34.920> facing<00:04:35.280> up<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.610> it's<00:04:35.730> not<00:04:35.880> on<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.150> bottom

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
is facing up and it's not on the bottom

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.670 
is facing up and it's not on the bottom
because<00:04:36.600> you'll<00:04:36.810> end<00:04:36.990> up<00:04:37.080> staining<00:04:37.560> the

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
because you'll end up staining the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.080 
because you'll end up staining the
bottom<00:04:37.950> of<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.130> slide<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.670> it'll<00:04:38.910> all<00:04:39.060> just

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
bottom of the slide and it'll all just

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.360 
bottom of the slide and it'll all just
wash<00:04:39.480> off<00:04:39.750> okay<00:04:40.410> so<00:04:40.470> before<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.980> put<00:04:41.160> them<00:04:41.250> up

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
wash off okay so before you put them up

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.670 
wash off okay so before you put them up
here<00:04:41.550> make<00:04:41.730> sure<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:42.030> stain<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:43.050> on<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.470> up

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
here make sure the stain is on the up

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.980 
here make sure the stain is on the up
side<00:04:43.890> okay<00:04:44.670> we're<00:04:45.270> going<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.420> let<00:04:45.570> those<00:04:45.750> sit

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
side okay we're going to let those sit

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.260 
side okay we're going to let those sit
for<00:04:46.200> 60<00:04:46.530> seconds<00:04:46.950> I've<00:04:47.550> been<00:04:47.730> talking<00:04:48.090> for

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
for 60 seconds I've been talking for

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.360 
for 60 seconds I've been talking for
about<00:04:48.300> 30<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:49.530> let<00:04:49.830> them<00:04:49.890> sit<00:04:50.100> for<00:04:50.340> a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
about 30 so you let them sit for a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.710 
about 30 so you let them sit for a
minute<00:04:50.700> I'm<00:04:50.940> not<00:04:51.000> going<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.330> wait<00:04:51.450> a<00:04:51.480> full

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
minute I'm not going to wait a full

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.870 
minute I'm not going to wait a full
minute<00:04:52.080> but<00:04:52.230> you<00:04:52.590> will<00:04:53.250> wait<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.430> full<00:04:53.700> minute

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
minute but you will wait a full minute

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.150 
minute but you will wait a full minute
can<00:04:54.600> even<00:04:54.810> go<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:54.960> little<00:04:55.140> bit<00:04:55.320> longer<00:04:55.500> it's

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
can even go a little bit longer it's

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.790 
can even go a little bit longer it's
more<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:57.570> let<00:04:57.750> it<00:04:57.870> go<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.050> little<00:04:58.320> bit<00:04:58.590> longer

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
more to let it go a little bit longer

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.220 
more to let it go a little bit longer
rather<00:04:59.130> than<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.520> cut<00:04:59.700> it<00:04:59.820> short<00:04:59.850> so<00:05:00.840> after

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
rather than to cut it short so after

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.380 
rather than to cut it short so after
it's<00:05:01.350> set<00:05:01.590> for<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.890> minute<00:05:02.220> you're<00:05:02.880> going<00:05:03.150> to

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
it's set for the minute you're going to

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.660 
it's set for the minute you're going to
rinse<00:05:03.630> it<00:05:03.920> so<00:05:04.920> you're<00:05:05.040> basically<00:05:05.430> going<00:05:05.610> to

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
rinse it so you're basically going to

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.970 
rinse it so you're basically going to
lift<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.090> slide<00:05:06.360> up<00:05:06.570> and<00:05:06.810> you're<00:05:07.680> going<00:05:07.920> to

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
lift the slide up and you're going to

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.770 
lift the slide up and you're going to
spray<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.460> water<00:05:08.640> on<00:05:08.910> it<00:05:09.060> man<00:05:09.270> this<00:05:09.420> is<00:05:09.570> tough

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
spray the water on it man this is tough

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.240 
spray the water on it man this is tough
water<00:05:10.050> bottles<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.740> don't<00:05:13.800> know<00:05:14.010> if<00:05:14.130> you

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
water bottles and I don't know if you

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.920 
water bottles and I don't know if you
can<00:05:14.370> see<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.670> or<00:05:14.760> not<00:05:14.910> but<00:05:15.120> this<00:05:15.330> smear<00:05:15.690> here

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
can see it or not but this smear here

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.360 
can see it or not but this smear here
you<00:05:16.080> can<00:05:16.230> see<00:05:16.410> the<00:05:16.500> purple<00:05:16.710> that<00:05:17.040> one<00:05:17.250> you

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
you can see the purple that one you

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.550 
you can see the purple that one you
can't<00:05:17.640> even<00:05:18.630> though<00:05:18.750> you<00:05:18.810> can't<00:05:19.140> see<00:05:19.380> that

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
can't even though you can't see that

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.650 
can't even though you can't see that
that<00:05:19.800> doesn't<00:05:20.160> mean<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.310> it's<00:05:20.610> not<00:05:20.760> there<00:05:21.060> it

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
that doesn't mean that it's not there it

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.120 
that doesn't mean that it's not there it
just<00:05:21.900> means<00:05:22.140> that<00:05:22.290> there's<00:05:22.590> not<00:05:22.800> as<00:05:22.980> much

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
just means that there's not as much

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.000 
just means that there's not as much
bacteria<00:05:23.400> there<00:05:24.380> do<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.500> same<00:05:25.740> with<00:05:25.919> this

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
bacteria there do the same with this

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.100 
bacteria there do the same with this
procedure<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:26.730> mean<00:05:27.210> with<00:05:27.390> this<00:05:27.510> slide<00:05:27.810> and

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
procedure I mean with this slide and

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.210 
procedure I mean with this slide and
that<00:05:28.740> is<00:05:28.890> hard<00:05:29.280> bubble<00:05:29.640> teas<00:05:29.880> and<00:05:30.980> this<00:05:31.980> one

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
that is hard bubble teas and this one

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.500 
that is hard bubble teas and this one
okay<00:05:34.010> now<00:05:35.010> we're<00:05:35.880> going<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.060> want<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.300> look<00:05:36.390> at

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
okay now we're going to want to look at

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.820 
okay now we're going to want to look at
these<00:05:36.660> under<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.020> microscope<00:05:37.410> we<00:05:37.680> obviously

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
these under the microscope we obviously

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.920 
these under the microscope we obviously
don't<00:05:38.220> want<00:05:38.310> to<00:05:38.460> do<00:05:38.610> it<00:05:38.700> wet<00:05:38.910> you<00:05:39.150> can<00:05:39.810> also

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
don't want to do it wet you can also

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.540 
don't want to do it wet you can also
rinse<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.440> bottom<00:05:40.740> a<00:05:40.830> little<00:05:40.950> back<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.250> little

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
rinse the bottom a little back a little

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.250 
rinse the bottom a little back a little
bit<00:05:41.730> just<00:05:42.030> to<00:05:42.150> make<00:05:42.210> sure<00:05:42.510> that<00:05:42.750> there's<00:05:43.050> no

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
bit just to make sure that there's no

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.530 
bit just to make sure that there's no
stain<00:05:43.620> excess<00:05:44.550> stain<00:05:44.730> lived<00:05:45.060> on<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.330> slide

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
stain excess stain lived on the slide

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.050 
stain excess stain lived on the slide
okay<00:05:46.290> don't<00:05:46.950> be<00:05:47.070> afraid<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.460> put<00:05:47.640> a<00:05:47.669> lot<00:05:47.910> of

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
okay don't be afraid to put a lot of

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.770 
okay don't be afraid to put a lot of
water<00:05:48.240> on<00:05:48.330> there

water on there

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.870 
water on there
okay<00:05:49.669> now<00:05:50.669> it<00:05:51.210> says<00:05:51.570> to<00:05:51.900> dry<00:05:52.470> them<00:05:52.710> with<00:05:53.640> paper

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
okay now it says to dry them with paper

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.030 
okay now it says to dry them with paper
basically<00:05:54.870> paper<00:05:55.050> towels<00:05:55.410> work<00:05:55.680> fine<00:05:55.890> you

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
basically paper towels work fine you

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.590 
basically paper towels work fine you
don't<00:05:56.220> have<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.490> have<00:05:56.610> a<00:05:56.640> nice<00:05:56.850> type<00:05:57.060> special

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
don't have to have a nice type special

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.420 
don't have to have a nice type special
type<00:05:57.750> of<00:05:57.900> paper<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.800> only<00:05:58.830> thing<00:05:59.250> that<00:05:59.400> I

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
type of paper the only thing that I

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.120 
type of paper the only thing that I
recommend<00:05:59.730> is<00:06:00.330> that<00:06:00.630> you<00:06:00.870> don't<00:06:01.260> rub<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:01.770> and

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
recommend is that you don't rub it and

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.700 
recommend is that you don't rub it and
scratch<00:06:02.700> it<00:06:02.730> off<00:06:03.000> so<00:06:03.690> what<00:06:03.870> I<00:06:03.900> like<00:06:04.200> to<00:06:04.350> do<00:06:04.500> is

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
scratch it off so what I like to do is

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.360 
scratch it off so what I like to do is
just<00:06:05.400> take<00:06:05.550> all<00:06:05.790> of<00:06:05.940> my<00:06:06.090> slides<00:06:07.130> put<00:06:08.130> them<00:06:08.250> on

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
just take all of my slides put them on

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.469 
just take all of my slides put them on
the<00:06:08.460> paper<00:06:08.640> towel<00:06:08.940> at<00:06:09.090> one<00:06:09.270> time

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
the paper towel at one time

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.980 
the paper towel at one time
and<00:06:10.779> then<00:06:11.879> fold<00:06:12.879> it<00:06:13.059> on<00:06:13.210> top<00:06:13.449> of<00:06:13.629> there<00:06:13.749> and

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
and then fold it on top of there and

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.559 
and then fold it on top of there and
then<00:06:14.620> you<00:06:14.800> just<00:06:14.830> dab<00:06:15.309> it<00:06:15.550> you<00:06:16.120> can<00:06:16.270> see<00:06:16.419> what

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.569 
then you just dab it you can see what

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.010 
then you just dab it you can see what
I'm<00:06:16.659> doing<00:06:17.340> then<00:06:18.340> you<00:06:18.520> just<00:06:18.759> dab<00:06:19.029> it<00:06:19.059> to<00:06:19.900> get

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
I'm doing then you just dab it to get

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.619 
I'm doing then you just dab it to get
the<00:06:20.139> water<00:06:20.349> off<00:06:20.469> okay<00:06:21.189> the<00:06:21.699> idea<00:06:21.849> is<00:06:22.330> you<00:06:22.599> don't

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:22.629 
the water off okay the idea is you don't

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:24.390 
the water off okay the idea is you don't
rub<00:06:23.110> because<00:06:23.439> you're<00:06:23.620> you've<00:06:23.979> spent<00:06:24.249> all<00:06:24.370> that

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
rub because you're you've spent all that

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.439 
rub because you're you've spent all that
time<00:06:24.689> fixing<00:06:25.689> a<00:06:25.809> smear<00:06:27.059> you<00:06:28.059> don't<00:06:28.240> want<00:06:28.389> to

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
time fixing a smear you don't want to

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.600 
time fixing a smear you don't want to
rub<00:06:28.569> the<00:06:28.599> bacteria<00:06:29.199> off<00:06:29.289> so<00:06:29.919> you<00:06:30.009> just<00:06:30.279> want<00:06:30.520> to

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
rub the bacteria off so you just want to

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.779 
rub the bacteria off so you just want to
dry<00:06:31.349> now<00:06:32.349> what<00:06:32.559> you<00:06:32.650> can<00:06:32.800> also<00:06:32.919> do<00:06:33.279> to<00:06:33.309> allow<00:06:33.610> it

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
dry now what you can also do to allow it

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.839 
dry now what you can also do to allow it
to<00:06:33.819> dry<00:06:33.999> a<00:06:34.089> little<00:06:34.360> bit<00:06:34.509> longer<00:06:35.520> just<00:06:36.520> to<00:06:36.669> make

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
to dry a little bit longer just to make

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.600 
to dry a little bit longer just to make
sure<00:06:36.879> that<00:06:37.210> you<00:06:37.330> don't<00:06:37.509> get<00:06:37.629> any<00:06:37.870> water<00:06:38.199> or

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610

sure that you don't get any water or
stain<00:06:39.610> on<00:06:39.789> the<00:06:39.909> microscope<00:06:40.539> you<00:06:40.719> want<00:06:40.900> to<00:06:40.990> make

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
stain on the microscope you want to make

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.989 
stain on the microscope you want to make
sure<00:06:41.259> they're<00:06:41.409> completely<00:06:41.559> dry<00:06:42.069> another

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:42.999 
sure they're completely dry another

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:46.509 
up somewhere like you're washing dishes

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:48.779 
up somewhere like you're washing dishes
no<00:06:46.960> you<00:06:47.050> put<00:06:47.199> them<00:06:47.319> in<00:06:47.379> a<00:06:47.439> dish<00:06:47.650> rack<00:06:47.889> you<00:06:48.610> can

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:48.789 
no you put them in a dish rack you can

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.459 
no you put them in a dish rack you can
prop<00:06:48.999> them<00:06:49.210> up<00:06:49.360> here<00:06:49.629> like<00:06:49.810> this<00:06:49.990> and<00:06:50.050> let<00:06:50.379> them

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:50.469 
prop them up here like this and let them

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:53.100 
prop them up here like this and let them
air<00:06:50.650> dry<00:06:50.680> a<00:06:50.919> little<00:06:51.189> bit<00:06:51.370> longer<00:06:51.759> just<00:06:52.089> to<00:06:52.960> make

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
air dry a little bit longer just to make

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.860 
air dry a little bit longer just to make
sure<00:06:53.259> they're<00:06:53.469> completely<00:06:53.889> dry<00:06:54.449> okay<00:06:55.449> you<00:06:55.509> can

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
sure they're completely dry okay you can

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.300 
sure they're completely dry okay you can
do<00:06:56.499> that<00:06:56.680> while<00:06:56.919> you're<00:06:57.009> getting<00:06:57.159> your

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
do that while you're getting your

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.640 
do that while you're getting your
microscope<00:06:57.909> and<00:06:58.120> everything<00:06:58.810> out<00:06:58.960> so<00:06:59.529> that's

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
microscope and everything out so that's

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.580 
microscope and everything out so that's
the<00:06:59.979> simple<00:07:00.370> state
