00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.300
 so well let's continue 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.360
 deal with sparkles just in case 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.400
 I report that this is the second part of the 33 lesson 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.289
 whose theme is sparkles and if you don't 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.150
 watched the first part and pause and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.890
 look first and and here we will 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.590
 deal with new ideas on the topic 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.660
 sequins on the next day I 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 inspired showing chanel we will need 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 not that even sparkles but something 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.860
 mean between sequins and sequins 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.750
 These are the major glitter che go well 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.489
 like me of course you do not have any greens 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.989
 on the green simple arrow we did 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.760
 literally just so let's 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.590
 let's take this golden one here 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.930
 also need and force by the way about 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.879
 I really did n't have to sit down 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.710
 and not the only staple 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.899
 between the skin sparkles instead also 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.180
 fits cream shade retainers for 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.010
 makeup and even eyelash glue can 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.750
 even on the base under the shade to put sparkles 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.850
 but they will unfortunately not be such a rack 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.250
 here I will put an aysil like that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.170
 here's a silicone spatula actually 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.840
 she even close is not necessarily and just 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.030
 cool I put a wider line on 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:16.310
 contour upper eyelashes now dial 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.310
 I will go gold chik and we spread 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:36.580
 head you them on the contour of the eyelashes and the movable 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:38.290
 eyelid here we create the effect of such 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.680
 sprinkled 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.680
 glitter eyes also pull the arrow 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:07.550
 to better form an arrow can 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.770
 like this brush them now move 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.380
 take more gold spangles such straight 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.470
 shining fingers find areas where 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.540
 we have not dried means 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.360
 if it is dry add spangles 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.030
 straight fully cover the movable eyelid 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.160
 these sequins specifically penny honest 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.600
 bought in the transition metro Frunzenskaya 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.590
 when they were still open 30 rubles 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.750
 we empty New Year's Eve I am so 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.460
 shining makeup straight great reason I 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.380
 I will even tell you more for many even 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.300
 only want to immediately mark one 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.060
 very important fact and this makeup technique 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.770
 only an eye if you perform such 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.590
 makeup and take care to have you 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.420
 it was completely tonal 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:00.230
 good face correction 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:04.000
 I will add at least a twin still black 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.000
 I will stroke the contour 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.120
 I remind you that the New Year but that holiday 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.010
 which the whole world is shining and you should not 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.140
 fall behind but here is one very important 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.750
 rule let's agree so if you 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.090
 use sparkles in shiny makeup 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.680
 the dress is no longer needed in sparkle colors 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.870
 are chosen exactly the same as those not 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.690
 if you can not identify with color 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.700
 take the gold they surely go to everyone and 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.709
 best of all use them on eyes 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.659
 because on the cubes they give them pepper and 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.900
 most likely u flow to you in the Olivier and 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.019
 more about the finished products for example 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.329
 strokes 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.159
 with sparkles here is this story which 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.560
 you can immediately throw it away 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.359
 it works in general even a little bit 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.950
 so you can immediately deal with this matter 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.840
 forget the only option is to replace here 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.700
 such aisil just pay 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.530
 attention to the color of the sparkles you have in 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.359
 liners match the color of the sparkles 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.829
 otherwise it will turn out porridge so well 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:04:00.209
 that with Cleopatra we say goodbye and 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.430
 move on so you're here i barely barely 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.079
 Cleopatra washed off previous spangles 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.030
 so to say adhere tightly I want 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.739
 show another trick for shy 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.409
 for those who are still slightly straight shine and 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.190
 shine but gleams like 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.530
 we paint eyelashes 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.340
 here I just see ac because they 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.609
 I have already made up any eyebrow gel 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:25.380
 clear gel applied directly abundantly on 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:30.330
 eyelashes took one eye then the second and with 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.070
 using a brush we put glitter here I 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.580
 took the same gold sparkles as on 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.580
 Cleopatra 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.289
 well with fallen camping sequins that directly 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:57.620
 super tightly stuck skin clean up 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:05:00.650
 brush from the mascara it is for the eyebrows here 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.449
 We are so brilliant turned cilia 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.400
 and the atmosphere is not evident 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.490
 holiday is not lost mistresses so 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.689
 say a note and one more 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.520
 indicative moment 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.520
 real vain now promakivayu sponge 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.080
 let's show you one of your favorites 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.169
 festive red encircle of options 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.169
 contour 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:35.030
 feathered with a cotton swab and put 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.970
 red lipstick and a beris zhirnenky 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.880
 I'll take here such a color about 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.860
 here is this box someone very much 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.250
 I was interested in such a self-made me 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.840
 palette then I ruthlessly new 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.180
 fondant box is sold 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.449
 in almost everyone in the sewing shop 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.240
 in the department of accessories and now in this our 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.100
 fudge 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.790
 I will print gold spangles 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.790
 on center 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.470
 after that I still take the transparent shine and 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.699
 I cover very neatly gog together with 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.060
 Sparkles look so they do not 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.060
 mixed up 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.860
 as with there, well, how does it go? 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.599
 I want to tell you more as a whole 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.729
 beauty rinse vile almost 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.259
 impossible to wipe off with just water or 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.580
 ordinary makeup remover 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.490
 There are some very good options. 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.560
 this makeup remover milky 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.310
 makeup remover oil 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.139
 basis 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.970
 and actually the oil itself can 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.310
 take olive can take baby all 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.259
 well the main thing is to fatty then 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.319
 shine easily sticks ambassador and departs from 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:53.539
 skin in general thank you very much for your attention 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.310
 run closer to sing

 still buy a sequin place honestly 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.639

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.039
