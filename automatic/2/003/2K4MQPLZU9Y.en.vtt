00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:03.030
 in Zurich 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.550
 works as he knows himself 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.940
 the former manager of Hannover 96 and Bayer Leverkusen has a company 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.929
 founded 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.440
 which establishes contact between investors who have money and clubs 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.199
 who need money 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.949
 It is familiar with interested banks and hedge funds 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.069
 really discuss financial companies ONB sports investors 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:29.619
 Percent that really do percent per cent professional business and 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.660
 this or emotion go to it 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.990
 You will not hear about them, you will not see them, they want me 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.960
 the vip-tribune the WHO not in the cabin 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.940
 they dwell in the lineup 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.250
 they want the club to work well at the end economically 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.110
 of course connected with sporting success 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.000
 but in the first place they are interested in the numbers 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.190
 German football is attractive to investors one knows each other 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.680
 Ounce traditional club as well as Dusseldorf or Essen would only by external 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.500
 Donors come back upstairs 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 But the clubs have to give up 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.910
 if someone is human content about Liverpool then a pattern starts that 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.980
 Do not swap management because we do a good job and that will 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.900
 continue to do a good job 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.140
 but if someone takes a club in big 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.770
 Economic percent difficulties then it is just where you in the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.360
 Club does not leave a certain zone or its songs come out though he does 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.890
 Had the stuff 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.210
 then also stuck around problems third round that will be in the West 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.210
 secures at entry just solved 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.310
 indeed 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.119
 There was already an investor who ruled alone in a German club 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.730
 Florian Homm 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.730
 Shareholder of Borussia Dortmund 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.430
 as the BVB 2000 and four before bankruptcy 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.570
 the club has to enforce a capital increase to save itself 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.470
 Major shareholder Rusal with the last moment the fax he demands the resignation 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.130
 Otherwise, he would burst the capital increase 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.410
 Niebaum signs 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.410
 an example of the possible power of 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.130
 there was no investor who has driven a club to the wall but 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.199
 very many club boards 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.039
 and 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.979
 the scenario that somebody comes out of the house after a very short time 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.239
 even that was not seen with investors who lives percent 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.569
 Consider something serious among these are all percent successful entrepreneurs 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.319
 or company 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.469
 successful entrepreneur clubs can make success 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.629
 shows up in Hoffenheim 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.079
 Billionaire Dietmar Hopp 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.559
 If there is no power of decision, it is considered as 10 "and not as 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.049
 investor 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.219
 but his money makes the team succeed 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.209
 and envy arise 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.599
 The fans of Kaiserslautern show their anger 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.579
 while their club is probably descending 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.509
 Hoffenheim rises well 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.509
 it is only with lenders 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.180
 In the end, it can happen that the club can become natural 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.249
 I can say how the members still bitterly united 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:04.679
 in itself and the problem is simply that one of moods around 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:08.939
 This investor is completely dependent and before I believe if all at once 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.729
 yet to play against each other entrepreneurs has it with the essence of 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.409
 Football has little to do 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.129
 the essence of a club has completely changed this man 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.899
 Dietrich Mateschitz and his company made the TSV from Trier 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.089
 Bull Salzburg 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:31.479
 new players new coaches new stadium as well 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.449
 new club colors 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.629
 and that a club becomes the toy of an investor 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.760
 that should be prevented in Germany with a new regulation 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.029
 with remnants of the parent club and the falls 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:49.709
 In the region Doris Zich can in full extent if that must be able too 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.549
 only recommend this because the threads would also be the crisp the emotions 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.059
 Football must be maintained but the Fed also wants a modern one 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.359
 football arena they want an attractive team they do not want 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.189
 always only against the descent does they want we also sport successful 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.599
 Seeing the perspective costs the money that needs to be invested that we want 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.179
 and as a result I think we will have the high brand identity 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:17.019
 happy Fence because we develop successfully in a sporty way 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.409
 powerful infrastructure 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.009
 the Chinese model 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.699
 determines the market 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.819
 The clubs that are staying there have either none or one sooner 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:32.169
 financially weak investor 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.069
 the business football 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:37.069
 is unstoppable in its development 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.190
 There are no percentage points of the statutes are prohibited that football today 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.520
 in short, examples of me ran us dollar 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.530
 who no longer controls with other leagues buzz he competes with 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.340
 Hollywood-film external action is encoded in the entertainment industry and not 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.749
 More just in sports and that's what investors are interested in 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.520
 In the medium term Germany will probably also let investors 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.389
 But the Premier League of English football is way ahead 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.539
 Roman Abramovich jokes with her 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.029
 for Merck in glasses with Manchester 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.689
 the Leon Spinks with Liverpool 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.329
 all together currently in the semifinals of the Champions League
