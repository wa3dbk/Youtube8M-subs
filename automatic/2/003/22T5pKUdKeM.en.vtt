helps<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.950> lot<00:02:34.129> because<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:35.209> meets<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.049> for

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
helps a lot because it meets the for

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.229

some reason I don't know why it just

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.970 
some reason I don't know why it just
makes<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.750> strain<00:02:39.019> a<00:02:39.049> little<00:02:39.349> easier<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.859> get

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
makes the strain a little easier to get

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.370 
makes the strain a little easier to get
through<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.519> little<00:02:41.180> easier<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.810> do<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.290> it
