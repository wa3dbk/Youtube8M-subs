00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:49.499 
to now first of all how much does it

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:53.059 
to now first of all how much does it
cost<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.699> here<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.629> canada<00:00:52.019> with<00:00:52.829> all<00:00:52.979> the

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:53.069

cost so and here in canada with all the
taxes<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.609> options<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.179> probably<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.960> to

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
taxes and options it's probably going to

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.049 
taxes and options it's probably going to
be<00:00:55.079> around<00:00:55.350> 3<00:00:55.589> million<00:00:55.829> bucks<00:00:56.129> which<00:00:56.519> is<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.729> lot

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
be around 3 million bucks which is a lot

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.599 
be around 3 million bucks which is a lot
of<00:00:57.089> money<00:00:57.350> but<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.409> also<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.069> lot<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.280> car

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
of money but you also get a lot of car

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.759 
of money but you also get a lot of car
so<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.329> still<00:01:00.569> a<00:01:00.600> thousand<00:01:01.049> horsepower<00:01:01.350> it's

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
so it's still a thousand horsepower it's

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.840 
so it's still a thousand horsepower it's
still<00:01:01.979> the<00:01:02.129> w16<00:01:02.940> engine<00:01:03.440> twin<00:01:04.440> turbo<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:04.980> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
still the w16 engine twin turbo and it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
still the w16 engine twin turbo and it
is<00:01:06.150> fast<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:07.140> all<00:01:07.320> i<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.710> say<00:01:08.010> now<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.460> i

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
is fast that's all i can say now what i

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and as soon as your throttle it you can

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.990 
and as soon as your throttle it you can
hear<00:01:15.690> those<00:01:15.840> turbos<00:01:16.320> come<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.920> straight<00:01:17.790> away

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
air intakes and that's quite a nice

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.270 
air intakes and that's quite a nice
feeling<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.590> thing<00:01:25.620> that<00:01:25.770> didn't<00:01:26.160> like

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
feeling now one thing that didn't like

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.020 
feeling now one thing that didn't like
about<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.330> fact<00:01:27.690> that<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.520> uses

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
about it was the fact that the it uses

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.680 
about it was the fact that the it uses
the<00:01:30.060> 7-speed<00:01:30.810> twin<00:01:31.430> clutch<00:01:32.430> gear<00:01:33.330> changing

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
the 7-speed twin clutch gear changing

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.930 
the 7-speed twin clutch gear changing
system<00:01:34.250> which<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.400> becoming<00:01:35.730> quite<00:01:35.850> popular

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
system which is becoming quite popular

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.320 
system which is becoming quite popular
now<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.630> spot<00:01:37.050> scales<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.880> works<00:01:39.210> very

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
now on spot scales and it works very

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.110 
now on spot scales and it works very
well<00:01:39.510> but<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> find<00:01:40.410> it<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.070> smooth<00:01:41.490> so

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
well but I find it just to smooth so

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.510 
well but I find it just to smooth so
here<00:01:42.480> on<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.750> gate<00:01:42.990> changes<00:01:43.410> I<00:01:43.650> found<00:01:44.310> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
here on the gate changes I found it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.910 
here on the gate changes I found it
extremely<00:01:45.000> smooth<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.080> can<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
extremely smooth and I can like it a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.050 
extremely smooth and I can like it a
little<00:01:47.220> bit<00:01:48.050> more<00:01:49.050> harsh<00:01:49.410> than<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.880> on

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
little bit more harsh than that like on

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.600 
little bit more harsh than that like on
the<00:01:51.350> Lamborghini<00:01:52.350> Aventador<00:01:52.410> when<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.130> drove

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the Lamborghini Aventador when I drove

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.610 
the Lamborghini Aventador when I drove
that<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.120> track<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.660> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.410> you're

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
that on the track it you know you're

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.780 
that on the track it you know you're
changing<00:01:56.010> gear<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.550> love<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.110> feeling

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
changing gear and I love that feeling

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.200 
changing gear and I love that feeling
but<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.850> think<00:02:00.150> that's<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.480> pretty<00:02:00.780> minor

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
but I think that's a pretty minor

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.230 
but I think that's a pretty minor
problem<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:03.480> this<00:02:03.570> car<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:05.240> certainly

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
problem for this car and certainly

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.550 
problem for this car and certainly

now<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.670> roof<00:02:19.850> system<00:02:20.330> on<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:20.600> which<00:02:20.840> is

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
now the roof system on this which is

now the roof system on this which is
seeing<00:02:21.530> right<00:02:21.770> now<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.400> works<00:02:22.670> like<00:02:23.120> an

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
seeing right now is it works like an

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.630 
seeing right now is it works like an
umbrella<00:02:23.480> system<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.380> it's<00:02:25.190> actually<00:02:25.430> very

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
umbrella system and it's actually very

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.430 
umbrella system and it's actually very
clever<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.450> works<00:02:26.660> super<00:02:26.990> well<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.320> means

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
clever and it works super well it means

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.590 
clever and it works super well it means
you<00:02:27.590> can<00:02:27.740> put<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.430> roof<00:02:28.700> open<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.150> roughly<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
you can put the roof open it roughly a

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.920 
you can put the roof open it roughly a
minute<00:02:29.960> they<00:02:30.140> say<00:02:30.350> which<00:02:31.010> compared<00:02:31.550> to
