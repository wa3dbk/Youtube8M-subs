ordered this from eBay and I came from

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.380 
ordered this from eBay and I came from
Greece<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.980> believe<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.670> originated

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
Greece I believe this was originated

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.200 
Greece I believe this was originated
from<00:00:27.509> Greece<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.580> was<00:00:29.669> pretty<00:00:29.880> cool

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
from Greece so that was pretty cool

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.010 
from Greece so that was pretty cool
um<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.750> wouldn't<00:00:31.320> throw<00:00:31.500> which<00:00:31.650> color<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.340> grab

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
um I wouldn't throw which color to grab

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.240 
um I wouldn't throw which color to grab
I<00:00:34.020> did<00:00:34.410> some<00:00:34.620> research<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.530> ended<00:00:38.039> up<00:00:38.190> just

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
I did some research so I ended up just

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.000 
I did some research so I ended up just
getting<00:00:38.700> number<00:00:39.600> 12<00:00:39.960> which<00:00:40.289> is<00:00:40.320> opal<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:43.010> this

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
getting number 12 which is opal and this

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.200 
getting number 12 which is opal and this
has<00:00:44.250> SPF<00:00:44.760> 30<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:47.039> also<00:00:47.070> has<00:00:47.370> 12<00:00:47.910> gram

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210

of<00:00:48.420> product<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.109> it<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.000> that's<00:00:51.930> considered<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
of product in it so that's considered a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.240 
of product in it so that's considered a
lot<00:00:53.809> I<00:00:55.250> want<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.370> try<00:00:56.609> this<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:57.359> I<00:00:57.660> saw<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
lot I want to try this because I saw the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.529 
lot I want to try this because I saw the
review<00:00:59.820> from<00:01:00.269> let's<00:01:00.960> make<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.429> she<00:01:02.429> did<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> sort

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
review from let's make up she did a sort

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.020 
review from let's make up she did a sort
of<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.719> foundation<00:01:03.899> demo<00:01:04.470> review<00:01:04.980> on<00:01:05.160> the<00:01:05.430> Vichy

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
of a foundation demo review on the Vichy

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.700 
of a foundation demo review on the Vichy
dermablend<00:01:06.990> corrective<00:01:07.430> foundation<00:01:08.430> stick

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
dermablend corrective foundation stick

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.590 
dermablend corrective foundation stick
and<00:01:10.710> then<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.520> thought<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.759> maybe<00:01:12.420> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and then I just thought that maybe I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.899 
and then I just thought that maybe I
should<00:01:12.930> give<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> try<00:01:13.229> since<00:01:13.860> my<00:01:14.070> skin<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.670> going

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
should give a try since my skin is going

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.260 
should give a try since my skin is going
through<00:01:15.439> a<00:01:16.640> really<00:01:17.640> bad<00:01:17.850> period<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.720> time<00:01:19.020> and

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
through a really bad period of time and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.310 
through a really bad period of time and
this<00:01:21.270> supposed<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:23.150> good<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:24.689> skin

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
this supposed to be good for your skin

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.620 
this supposed to be good for your skin
and<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.130> supposed<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> really

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
and it's supposed to be like a really

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.100 
and it's supposed to be like a really
full<00:01:28.110> pigmented<00:01:29.150> full-coverage<00:01:30.150> foundation

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
full pigmented full-coverage foundation

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.800 
then I don't know what happened it got
worse<00:01:58.740> again<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.850> or<00:02:00.090> especially<00:02:00.689> around

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
worse again like or especially around

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.609 
worse again like or especially around
this<00:02:01.110> area

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
this area

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.859 
this area
it<00:02:02.039> just<00:02:02.250> really<00:02:02.579> red<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:06.630> want<00:02:06.810> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it just really red so I just want to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:16.400 
it just really red so I just want to
give<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.289> try<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.590> see<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.190> works

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.780 

you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.030 

so<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.420> comes<00:02:20.599> in<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.930> stick<00:02:21.230> form<00:02:21.560> like<00:02:21.830> this

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
so it comes in a stick form like this

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.140 
so it comes in a stick form like this
and<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.180> opal<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.930> think<00:02:24.260> it's<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.560> bit<00:02:24.769> too

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
and this is opal I think it's a bit too

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.350 
and this is opal I think it's a bit too
pale<00:02:26.150> for<00:02:26.569> me<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.019> maybe<00:02:27.819> I'll<00:02:28.819> see<00:02:29.150> how<00:02:29.299> the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
pale for me so maybe I'll see how the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.410 
pale for me so maybe I'll see how the
coverage<00:02:29.659> is<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.530> then<00:02:30.950> maybe<00:02:31.280> I'll<00:02:31.610> just<00:02:32.000> go

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
coverage is and then maybe I'll just go

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.960 
coverage is and then maybe I'll just go
down<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.900> shade<00:02:33.220> I'll<00:02:34.220> go<00:02:34.430> up<00:02:34.580> or<00:02:34.760> shades

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
down the shade I'll go up or shades

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.119 
down the shade I'll go up or shades
whatever<00:02:37.299> but<00:02:38.299> I'll<00:02:38.510> just<00:02:38.569> give<00:02:39.019> this<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.200> try<00:02:39.440> I

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
whatever but I'll just give this a try I

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.440 
whatever but I'll just give this a try I
already<00:02:40.700> applied<00:02:41.030> sunscreen<00:02:42.879> which<00:02:43.879> is<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
already applied sunscreen which is the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.140 
already applied sunscreen which is the
Peter<00:02:45.290> Tom<00:02:46.480> Thomas<00:02:47.480> Roth<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:48.620> has<00:02:48.920> SPF<00:02:49.190> 15<00:02:49.640> it

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
Peter Tom Thomas Roth this has SPF 15 it

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.660 
Peter Tom Thomas Roth this has SPF 15 it
has<00:02:50.599> SPF<00:02:50.840> 30<00:02:51.110> in<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:51.950> don't<00:02:52.220> really<00:02:52.340> need

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
has SPF 30 in it so I don't really need

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.199 
has SPF 30 in it so I don't really need
to<00:02:52.879> apply<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.420> sunscreen<00:02:53.720> but<00:02:54.590> just<00:02:54.829> in<00:02:54.980> case

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
to apply a sunscreen but just in case

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.059 
to apply a sunscreen but just in case
since<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.329> have<00:02:56.480> really<00:02:56.810> sensitive<00:02:56.989> skin<00:02:57.530> right

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
since I have really sensitive skin right

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.509 
since I have really sensitive skin right
now<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:58.849> I<00:02:58.970> also<00:02:59.180> applied<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.519> nature

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.500

republic<00:03:02.359> botanical<00:03:03.290> pore<00:03:03.680> balm<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:05.239> has<00:03:05.480> a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
republic botanical pore balm this has a

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.289 
republic botanical pore balm this has a
light<00:03:06.470> green<00:03:06.769> tint<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.489> thought<00:03:07.819> it<00:03:08.060> might

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
light green tint so I thought it might

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.869 
light green tint so I thought it might
minimize<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.109> redness<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.680> little<00:03:09.920> bit<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.340> I

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
minimize the redness a little bit and I

concentrate<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:06.990> pigment<00:04:07.410> CNET<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.400> don't

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
concentrate of pigment CNET so you don't

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:18.140 
concentrate of pigment CNET so you don't
really<00:04:08.940> need<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.240> use<00:04:09.570> so<00:04:09.810> much<00:04:16.790> well<00:04:17.790> as<00:04:18.000> you

really need to use so much well as you
can<00:04:18.329> see<00:04:18.540> it's<00:04:18.750> definitely<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.380> lot<00:04:19.680> lighter

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
can see it's definitely a lot lighter

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.020 
can see it's definitely a lot lighter
than<00:04:20.370> my<00:04:20.549> skin<00:04:20.910> tone<00:04:22.310> kind<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.400> scary<00:04:23.730> now<00:04:24.000> I

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
than my skin tone kind of scary now I

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.160 
than my skin tone kind of scary now I
look<00:04:24.210> like<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.450> ghost

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
look like a ghost

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.290 
look like a ghost
so<00:04:25.800> I'm<00:04:25.860> definitely<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.490> definitely<00:04:26.970> have<00:04:27.120> to

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
so I'm definitely I definitely have to

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.740 
so I'm definitely I definitely have to
order<00:04:27.690> another<00:04:28.440> color<00:04:29.310> that's<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:30.030> shade
