00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.319
 and what as it is for boys and girls 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.589
 Welcome to the new organization of the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.150
 pp I present to master but 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.370
 that after making the video yesterday 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.049
 They decided to update the pp client to 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.660
 leave me wrong and put the ready the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.400
 character to be tested is a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.750
 proof is nothing at the moment 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.430
 sure but for now they have already put 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.320
 here so we can try it since 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.210
 they have already said that they are not going to make changes 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.519
 of skills or because it works pretty badly 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.199
 the subject of skills 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.150
 and this character is very much based on it 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.619
 to start talking about the passive 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.540
 the pill what it does is that every time 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.730
 that the enemy has 50% less 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.559
 life we do an auto attack takes away the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.600
 8 percent of your maximum life as damage 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.680
 magical is a very interesting passive 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.649
 for a character that all his 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.840
 skills scale as ade and I think 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.280
 that can be very ope depending on the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.930
 situations because this passion 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.910
 you can only enter once each 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.420
 10 seconds no but what it does is that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.949
 does a lot of damage then for some 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.449
 against some stability is very 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.219
 interesting this passive is very good 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.559
 but for the team fa I do not think 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.570
 will be so useful we will leave 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.540
 spend one for a moment 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.370
 skills because you have litas the q is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.560
 a shuriken that we launched the south and that neither 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.720
 we hurt if we are going to give 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 more enemies because the damage is reduced 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.040
 grace comes now with the w w is 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.510
 our shadow our copy that makes 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.560
 we invoke it, we can move 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.330
 around her we can not 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.070
 control but if we press again the w 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.290
 we can exchange positions with her 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.380
 this can be very useful for all types 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.930
 of situations is an area that makes 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.130
 damage a fairly short area to 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.680
 tell the truth but the grace that it has 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.840
 this character is the energy and the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.000
 activities that you have with your copy the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.770
 we can invoke we can throw the two 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.600
 the shuriken and if they both give him 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.420
 it hurts what happens that the shuriken of 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 the copy what it does is return us 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.720
 does 50% or less of damage and we 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.180
 returns energy the same happens with the is 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.590
 and we throw the copy to our enemy and 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.050
 we launched the and what we do is 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.240
 cause him a slow some damage and a 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.369
 return of energy the return of energy 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.530
 I can do it once by castelló de 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.820
 ability is to say that if we throw the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.200
 copy we can not throw the south and that neither 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.150
 the ea time and give us the two ball 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.060
 energies can not only be a 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.830
 a skill in addition the et has a 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.170
 double utility because for every enemy 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.450
 that we get to put the area reduces the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.160
 yield aw the most powerful life this 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.320
 character is the last and what he does is 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.910
 throw a skill at physical damage that 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.670
 applies to all the physical damage we have 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.400
 100% of our d with an animation 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.070
 pretty cool that the three shades come 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.480
 they hurt, they also put a mark 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.390
 to the enemy that for three seconds 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.010
 explodes makes a double shadow one a 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.710
 is one that comes out behind her in addition 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.130
 this mark when three seconds pass 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.480
 What it does is exploit and inflict 50% of the 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.000
 damage that we have done during those three 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.020
 seconds both physical and magical so 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.180
 which is a very very powerful bus and I think 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.450
 that the grace that this character has 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.370
 to be with this ultimate is what will 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.959
 a very very big damage bus to 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.260
 from the enemy being very hurt 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.730
 that is, when you have 50% less than 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.920
 life but what 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.930
 it did not make much use in terms of 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.209
 tim fain I think it's a character 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.010
 pretty weak I do not see it as a greeting 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.049
 nor as a jungle although with jungle the theme 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.430
 of the shadows is fine at the time 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.840
 to do gangs but I do not see enough 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.720
 weak rather I see it as a 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.660
 kind of heel if it flips over or 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.390
 less equal to the top of damage and the best 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.579
 it can be again an anti-wizard 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.989
 but as you see here what is the subject of 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.120
 the shadows is very good 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.489
 we move away we can make guns we can 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.260
 make some pretty looks 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.170
 eliminate the enemy in a moment 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.250
 hiding in the shadows is very 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.049
 well what happens that the issue of 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.280
 corners is a little mocked the world 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:50.660
 you can not test to perfection but 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.099
 already said to me is a weak character 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.200
 also the energy expenditure that it has is 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.510
 very high here we are going to check the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.430
 theme of the slow we are going to put our 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.859
 shadow are you going to mind lbs are you wheeler 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.099
 the only two that give us back energy 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.349
 we can go back to return the 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.970
 theme of the latter is very powerful but 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.190
 again I think he's missing 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.500
 survival this character or some 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.269
 type of damage bus because beyond the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.919
 South and we have nothing more until 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.510
 decide us until we subtract the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.639
 50% of the enemy's life I do not know I do not 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.680
 just called attention not do not know very 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.150
 well still what future can of this 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.820
 character but again just need to see 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.349
 how the pros and other company carry it 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.340
 to see how it is and the 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.930
 possibilities that it has in the 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.759
 competitive 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.410
 what comes next is a part 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.300
 that I did not know until the day after 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.430
 that recorded the video is testing it 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.020
 there is a combination that can result 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.270
 very interesting the with the last and 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.220
 we can do a pretty skill 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.780
 interesting as you know the last and 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.910
 when we do it invokes a shadow but 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.500
 is that the w also invokes this that 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.570
 it means that if we match 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.479
 our last of our w we can 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.220
 get to have up to two active shadows 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.960
 what is it that we will give to also 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.550
 we can get to do up to one hundred 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.810
 one hundred of our damage controlled the two 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.330
 shadows as you see them we have them here 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.419
 active what I did not know did not come to take 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.250
 very well the subject of skills but 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.009
 yes we can if we manage to match the two 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.599
 men over our enemy and you 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.419
 we make our bus probably we what 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:21.030
 what will we do with a zoom combo then he 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.259
 as I would be would recommend first 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.460
 throw the shadow to our enemy 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.919
 press it 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.270
 what would cause the slow pull our 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.979
 last and once we have the two shadows 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.949
 active throw our shuriken to see if 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.349
 we accept it this would be for me the combo 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.539
 of maximum set damage and this has been 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.960
 everything I hope you liked and we 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.960
 we see the next
