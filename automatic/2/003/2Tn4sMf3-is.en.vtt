of your videos are going to have look a
little<00:01:46.950> bit<00:01:47.040> choppy

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.810 

now<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.469> can<00:01:54.560> see<00:01:54.710> here<00:01:54.829> I'm<00:01:54.979> controlling

now you can see here I'm controlling
fast-forward<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:56.869> rewind<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:57.710> forth<00:01:57.979> and

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
fast-forward and rewind and so forth and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.100 
fast-forward and rewind and so forth and
that<00:01:58.369> works<00:01:58.579> but<00:01:59.270> when<00:01:59.450> we<00:01:59.570> actually<00:01:59.719> try<00:01:59.990> to

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
that works but when we actually try to

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.660 
that works but when we actually try to
watch<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:03.170> looks<00:02:03.350> kind<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.219> like<00:02:04.369> a<00:02:04.429> quick

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
watch it it looks kind of like a quick

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:25.960 
watch it it looks kind of like a quick

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.670 

we've<00:02:26.390> also<00:02:26.510> found<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:26.900> Xing<00:02:27.350> video

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
we've also found that Xing video

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.050 
we've also found that Xing video
sometimes<00:02:28.040> takes<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.310> little<00:02:28.370> bit<00:02:28.610> longer<00:02:28.790> than

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
sometimes takes a little bit longer than

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.420 
sometimes takes a little bit longer than
I<00:02:29.120> expected<00:02:29.210> to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.800 

now<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.900> MK<00:02:39.200> 802<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.680> capable<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.549> handling

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
now the MK 802 is capable of handling

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.839 
now the MK 802 is capable of handling
720p<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.019> 1080p<00:02:42.439> video<00:02:42.829> playback<00:02:43.129> so

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
720p and 1080p video playback so

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.420 
720p and 1080p video playback so
theoretically<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.569> version<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.620> XBMC<00:02:46.010> that's

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
theoretically a version of XBMC that's

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.750 
theoretically a version of XBMC that's
optimized<00:02:46.879> for<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.950> graphics<00:02:48.950> core<00:02:49.189> should

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
optimized for the graphics core should

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.130 
optimized for the graphics core should
be<00:02:49.879> able<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.180> handle<00:02:50.480> some<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.840> those<00:02:50.930> things

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
be able to handle some of those things

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.380 
be able to handle some of those things
but<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.980> particular<00:02:52.159> build<00:02:52.610> not<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.209> much

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
but this particular build not so much

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.390 
but this particular build not so much
let's<00:02:54.200> try<00:02:54.379> another<00:02:54.530> one<00:02:54.650> real<00:02:54.859> quick<00:02:55.069> here

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
let's try another one real quick here

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.449 
let's try another one real quick here
and<00:02:59.530> why<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.560> keep<00:03:00.769> picking<00:03:00.950> black-and-white

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
and why I keep picking black-and-white

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:26.870 
and why I keep picking black-and-white
movies<00:03:01.819> but<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.569> does<00:03:02.780> support<00:03:02.870> color

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.090 

so<00:03:27.480> again<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.840> playback<00:03:28.380> experience<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.980> not

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
so again the playback experience is not

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.740 
so again the playback experience is not
really<00:03:29.520> ideal<00:03:29.670> but<00:03:30.090> overall<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.540> fact<00:03:30.720> that

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
really ideal but overall the fact that

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.270 
really ideal but overall the fact that
you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:31.080> control<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.590> with<00:03:31.800> an<00:03:31.950> Android

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
you can control it with an Android

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.880 
you can control it with an Android
device<00:03:32.490> using<00:03:32.910> XBMC<00:03:33.660> for<00:03:34.050> Android<00:03:34.440> XBMC

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
device using XBMC for Android XBMC

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.890 
device using XBMC for Android XBMC
remote<00:03:35.250> for<00:03:35.430> Android<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.940> pretty<00:03:36.480> impressive

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
remote for Android is pretty impressive

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.750 
remote for Android is pretty impressive
there's<00:03:37.050> also<00:03:37.170> support<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:37.830> text<00:03:38.640> entry

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.860 

you<00:03:41.760> can<00:03:42.200> switch<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.230> gesture<00:03:43.890> mode<00:03:44.660> switch<00:03:45.660> to

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
you can switch to gesture mode switch to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.370 
you can switch to gesture mode switch to
buttons<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:49.580> quickly<00:03:50.580> access<00:03:51.000> music<00:03:53.150> or

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
buttons and quickly access music or

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:04.750 
buttons and quickly access music or
images<00:03:56.720> or<00:03:59.450> TV<00:04:00.450> shows<00:04:00.690> if<00:04:00.990> you<00:04:01.110> have<00:04:01.230> them<00:04:01.440> you

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.370 

can<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:05.850> use<00:04:06.090> these<00:04:06.240> buttons<00:04:06.510> again<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.230> go

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
can just use these buttons again to go

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.700 
can just use these buttons again to go
back<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.740> main<00:04:07.860> menu<00:04:08.930> access<00:04:09.930> your<00:04:10.320> system

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
back to the main menu access your system

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:22.950 
back to the main menu access your system
settings<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.520> info<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.120> forth

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.510 

so<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.560> can<00:04:23.650> see<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.860> user<00:04:24.009> interface<00:04:24.160> again

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
so you can see the user interface again

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.090 
so you can see the user interface again
is<00:04:24.759> pretty<00:04:25.479> decent<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:26.350> it<00:04:26.470> supports<00:04:26.740> add-ons

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
is pretty decent and it supports add-ons

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.300 
is pretty decent and it supports add-ons
all<00:04:27.370> sorts<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.669> interesting<00:04:27.880> things<00:04:28.470> but<00:04:29.470> it

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
all sorts of interesting things but it

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.129 
all sorts of interesting things but it
doesn't<00:04:30.610> really<00:04:30.850> do<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.090> great<00:04:31.240> job<00:04:31.419> with<00:04:31.690> video

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
doesn't really do a great job with video

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.620 
doesn't really do a great job with video
playback<00:04:32.410> yet<00:04:33.070> so<00:04:33.729> again<00:04:34.150> that's<00:04:34.360> a<00:04:34.479> quick

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
playback yet so again that's a quick

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.920 
playback yet so again that's a quick
look<00:04:34.810> at<00:04:34.960> XBMC<00:04:35.440> remote<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.009> XBMC<00:04:36.520> for<00:04:37.240> Android

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
look at XBMC remote and XBMC for Android

I<00:04:42.460> found<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.240> XBMC<00:04:43.660> or<00:04:44.020> it's<00:04:44.229> really<00:04:44.560> well<00:04:44.710> on

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
I found that XBMC or it's really well on

again<00:04:48.490> hopefully<00:04:48.759> we'll<00:04:49.210> see<00:04:49.530> newer<00:04:50.530> builds

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
again hopefully we'll see newer builds

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.189 
again hopefully we'll see newer builds
that<00:04:51.039> take<00:04:51.160> advantage<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:51.690> other<00:04:52.690> hardware

bucks<00:05:07.690> it's<00:05:08.110> pretty<00:05:08.289> impressive<00:05:09.870> assuming<00:05:10.870> it

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
bucks it's pretty impressive assuming it

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.990 
bucks it's pretty impressive assuming it
works<00:05:11.080> in<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:11.949> mean<00:05:12.130> time<00:05:12.340> we<00:05:12.550> know<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:12.880> it

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
works in the mean time we know that it

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.870 
works in the mean time we know that it
does<00:05:13.210> work<00:05:13.479> on<00:05:13.710> more<00:05:14.710> powerful<00:05:15.190> hardware<00:05:15.340> so

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
does work on more powerful hardware so

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.620 
does work on more powerful hardware so
when<00:05:15.970> you're<00:05:16.090> looking<00:05:16.150> at<00:05:16.330> something<00:05:16.479> like

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
when you're looking at something like

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.680 
when you're looking at something like
say<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:16.840> Google<00:05:17.199> Nexus<00:05:17.320> Q<00:05:17.770> which<00:05:18.039> has<00:05:18.250> a
