cars dot com auto review

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.019
I am Kelsey Mays for cars dot com
were at the New York Auto Show checking

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.539
out Mercedes redesign

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.549
GL SUV this is the automaker's

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.880
full-size SUV it competes with other
three-row SUV's

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.670
in the luxury class like the Cadillac
Escalade and the Infiniti

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.449
QX 56 now for 2013 Mercedes says

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.150
it as new turbocharged v8 engines with
better fuel economy

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.720
than before let's check it out affront
to see the redesign headlights have

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.840
the sort of Kirby light pipes here it's
a familiar sight now on a lotta

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.280
other Mercedes vehicles the profile has
a similar sorta

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.370
substantial hefty shape as it did before

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.370
but driving refinement could improve
with this generation it wasn't a bad

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.180
thing with the previous generation but
Mercedes says it's targeting

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.910
quietness levels on PAR with the s-class
flagship

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.170
there's an aromatic suspension and Ernie
with available active stabilizer bars

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.980
the kinda mitigate body roll

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.470
could make this a pretty nimble SUV to
and a bright ass poured in premium

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.950
materials characterize the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.179
interior the upper the dashboard is
wrapped in

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.369
fake leather can be real leather if you
get real leather

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.470
on the seats on this cars probably start
north of sixty thousand dollars why real

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.789
leather isn't standard

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.550
I don't know but Mercedes does give you
this vinyl stuff that doesn't okay job

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.759
can assimilate again

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.990
seguro could sit a little bit higher up
the ground but leg room is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.939
decent and had rooms actually excellent
new feature this year's a power tumbling

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.110
feature for the secular seen a lot of
SUVs have that

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.380
not a big deal here but one cool thing
about Mercedes majors at

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.610
it pulls the head restraints down and if
the front seat is too far

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.069
backwards actually powers the front seat
forward for

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.360
enough clearance and when you get back
into the third row third rows

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.689
usually pretty cramped especially in
SUV's

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.780
not really the case you I've got attack
on a leg room

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.009
for for the third row and any SUV

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.959
and play a veteran here head restraints
come back up they stay outta the way to

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.729
clear visibility for the driver but
overall

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.030
pretty good situation argument behind
the third rose about

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.489
16 cubic feet now a little bit more than
in the prior generation

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.670
there are power folding third row seats
here

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.299
you put him down he got the second row
down looking at about 95%

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.900
94 cubic feet have maximum cargo volume:
that's up about 10 cubic feet over the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.599
prior generation pretty good

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.220
the puts the GL in the Rome the QX 56
the Cadillac Escalade still beats both

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.670
it's got

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.670
close to 110 cubic feet the outgoing
gl-class had a diesel v6 with highway

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.810
gas mileage in the low

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.920
twenties there also v8 engines with
mileage

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.989
in the kids now this new GL has a

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.250
reengineered diesel v6 and the
turbocharged engines

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.540
should help it get about 19 percent
better gas mileage across-the-board

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.069
Mercedes says left to wait until closer
to the cars on sale date this Sept

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.540
