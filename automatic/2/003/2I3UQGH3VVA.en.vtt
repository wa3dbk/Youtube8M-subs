00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.730
 dear aquarianer at the company aqua 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.800
 There are individual ceramics 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.960
 handmade deco items pulled out 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.059
 Of course, for your ornamental fish if 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.949
 you more about this company and the 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.910
 Raymond Breuker the owner of this company 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.550
 he wants to know then he clicks now 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.260
 just click this link and now it will 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.690
 First of all, we explain to Mr. Breuer 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.699
 his assortment what is there for 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.800
 Deco products for harnisch know yes 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:53.839
 right here we have a little one 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.100
 range of spawn caves for harnisch 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.760
 wise compiled 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.010
 we start with small caves 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.190
 front entrance cave that is actually 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.060
 the nonplusultra where we at the 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.610
 breeding and multiplication in the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.979
 Harnisch have the best success 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.789
 had 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.990
 these products start with ten eleven 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.479
 centimeters long and two centimeters 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.450
 diameter and increase depending on 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.220
 harnisch welz art will be the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.350
 diameter larger the cave world longer 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.700
 because the animals are also different sizes 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.890
 It will be in all the years 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.990
 often happens that we have been asked 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.630
 are off if I'm a bit 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.450
 could change the parts of the 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.100
 front entrance and out of this 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.909
 modified front entrance heights like 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.740
 one looks here 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.979
 Get this page input because we 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.780
 actually have several times one more 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.180
 had a better luck with the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.899
 breeding and caring for hanisch 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.979
 will cave in for the 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.600
 one or the other more one 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.030
 fad but it has become 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.850
 Apparently true that this 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.220
 caves with side entrance very much like 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.459
 certain harnisch beings accepted 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.799
 but usually it is like that 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.540
 The front entrance caves like them here 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.170
 lie 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.390
 The standards are actually in almost 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.200
 Every aquarium belongs to the whole 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.240
 great here 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.470
 there I am 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.290
 we are careful that's it 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.240
 a part for large aquariums around the 1000 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.210
 but that's also the harnisch 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.740
 world of a length of 40 centimeters 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.650
 may reach because this envelope has 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.150
 already 30 cm 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.790

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.680
