00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 we will realize today a rougail 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.309
 below our hosts and gossip us then 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.469
 still more simple and pinard 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.790
 country I'm going to explain so in 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.549
 this recipe so it's a rougail of 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.650
 sunu a bit to the traditional except that 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.289
 we will add at the end of cooking a 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.750
 brief of the country so of course it's a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.609
 raw is not that easy 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.010
 find we could replace them with 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.320
 spinach of course and we have a 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.699
 variety a variety of pilots who 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.500
 grow in this a garden for naples 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.410
 the us and then our country we are 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 today I have so I found 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.070
 spinach that grows in the wild 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.590
 we are lucky in this southern place 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.780
 in the rock garden near the seaside 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.940
 find that kind of braid so we can 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.399
 use instead of tetragon 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.250
 so grow country spinach I 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.390
 would say the lack of the world well we have 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.309
 listened to the real ones taught us the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.110
 leaflets pluton we 'll wash them well 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.390
 we could possibly chop them 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.350
 Roughly it's not there it's not 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.420
 the method I chose today 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.649
 I will leave the whole leaves 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.239
 in because they are they are 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.159
 very very young and very tender they 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.380
 will gently melt gently 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.170
 in my eyes and we will find better 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.360
 the leaves so we will use them where 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.430
 I mean wash well drain and 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.550
 leave whole then the welder so 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.110
 this offers another smoked fish 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.810
 traditional in the diet 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.119
 Reunion 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.380
 the story is long but we are going 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.509
 will still mention it was a 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.100
 fish that is not at all in 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.549
 the Indian Ocean area that's fished well 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.130
 beyond and that happens that happens on the 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.979
 sand today I mean the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.610
 most of the time you smoke and smoked salty 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.740
 and dried 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.780
 the sound we're going so we'll put it to 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.369
 Soak soak for 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.009
 drawing them for the concert plus unit 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.869
 can we remove the cave 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.640
 false electro stops who are disappointed 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.630
 although in many families 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.030
 Reunion 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.830
 that is removed is if the skin and 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.600
 edges the central ridge that's called 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.030
 lorrain their unknowingly nook who is really 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.539
 the favorite piece and children and 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.399
 connoisseurs 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.220
 today I removed my in 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.619
 many families it is not 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.289
 less to make this no more 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.319
 appetizing then 107.7 is 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.530
 central for the realization so we're going 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.810
 search skin complains also the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.519
 weight consciousness are so in 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.769
 enough cheating oil we're going 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.120
 so bring back the sonos story 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.950
 well browned well 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.130
 crisp and then we'll extend 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.239
 cooking by adding onions 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.980
 possibly cut in the direction of the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.840
 circumference for mini bracelet 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.060
 it's the cut that's best 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.519
 for the rogues once these 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.799
 onions of slightly so we go so 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.720
 add the chilli spice 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.640
 tomato ginger 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.540
 we're going to be safe whole minera 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.370
 the dish by making the leaves fall 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.200
 spinach country fairies dragons and 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.620
 cook for about 5 to 6 minutes 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.120
 in this mixture when the red line 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.170
 renaud who is ready to put the tomatoes 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.090
 are well cooked 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.519
 so we'll add a brave good 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.739
 drain and time to mix them in 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.049
 as they fall immediately 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.250
 in the red ball falling that means 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.319
 it's a word we use to say that 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.420
 the leaves wither and become 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.450
 soften of itself in in the 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.050
 heat of the dish and we will mix them with 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.140
 gradually 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.600
 we're not sure that either and break 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.080
 about the equivalent of 6 to 7 minutes of 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.960
 cooking are enough to cook and you have 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.000
 everything so that the mixture stays with 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.730
 harmonious colors with the red of 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.190
 tomato and lozère brèdes otherwise we 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.470
 may have a color enough 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.320
 greyness if we sure they have on pure 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.730
 and all the real then the pros the 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.860
 housewife who would have trouble finding 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.680
 tetragon despite a country on 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.240
 could do this same dish in 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.310
 using brèdes the star have 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.990
 possibly and why not 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.360
 pumpkin slivers too so at 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.970
 the initiative of the housewife to vary 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.680
 dishes according to the season and in 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.680
 according to tastes the briefs of each
