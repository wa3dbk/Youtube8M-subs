00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.800
- I'm not only a dad,
I am a grandfather.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.866
- I know.
- Yeah.

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.333
- Congratulations.
- That's her.

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.900
That's her.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.800
That's--my son-in-law
does apps.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.133
That's called MEmoji.

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.800
Look, look, it moves
and it becomes--

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.300
and then you can do that
with your own face.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.600
- Download MEmoji.
- Oh, that's adorable.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.666
- So that's--that's Abby Jacks.

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.300
Isn't that great?
- Oh, congratulations.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.933
- The glasses aren't hers.
Thank you.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.366
That's like the best thing
in the world,

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.400
to become a grandparent.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.166
- Of course it is.

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:28.100
- When your babies--

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.966
[chuckles]
I love grandpa.

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.233
See what she did?
- Yeah.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:32.733
- You see what she--
You're making me melt.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.133
- She did it.
- I can't stop smiling

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.066
when I'm around my--
Look at--

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.700
she gave me the finger.
Look at that.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.000
Isn't that amazing?
- She is adorable.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.566
- I'm number one.
She is adorable.

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.266
- She's got a lot of hair.
How old is that child?

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.500
- She has a lot of hair,
but so does my daughter

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.900
and her husband.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.533
That is--that picture's probably
two weeks old.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.033
Right now she's six weeks old.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.100
- Wow.
- Yes.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.833
- She can make a bun soon
hopefully.

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:57.733
- Look at that.
That was Halloween.

00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.000
She's six weeks old.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.466
I don't think
she's having a good time.

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.000
I-I--look at that look.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.900
She's looking at us, like,
"Why am I a carrot?"

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.000
- She's a ca--
- "Why do I need to be

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.033
"a carrot?

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.033
Take me out
of the carrot outfit."

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:10.033
- No, she was swaddled.
- "I don't--"

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:11.033
- It probably felt good
to be a ca--

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:12.033
- Swaddling is good.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.400
- She was a carrot--
swaddled carrot.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.233
- A swaddled carrot?
- Yeah, which is delicious.

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:17.566
- Oh, there she is.
Look at the size of her cheeks.

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.800
- Yeah, that's--
- Well, no.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.066
She had her wisdom teeth
removed.

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.066
That is not--
[laughter]

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.666
But she's just cheeks.
I just go home,

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.800
I can't wait to go--
from here,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.800
I'm gonna go home
and just hold her.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.300
- Do they live
close to you?

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.600
- Well, I said--
as a gift, I said I would do

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.966
some remodeling
on their house.

00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.333
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's not--

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.000
it's a gift to me because
they have to live

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.333
in my house till
it's done,

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.400
and every morning I get up
and I call the contractor,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
and I say, "Do nothing."

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.266
So they can stay
in my house.

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.100
So they're still at--
I said, "No, it's almost done."

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.666
They go, "What is it?"
"You'll see."

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.166
I can't even figure out
what to do there.

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.500
- Yeah.
- I've done nothing.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.200
- There's nothing.
- But there's a contractor

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.433
at the house.
I go, "You don't want to go

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:56.066
in there with a baby.
There's dust.

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.866
And there's--
we haven't done anything,

00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.766
so they're living with me,

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:01.433
and they're dressing her up
like a carrot.

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:02.566
That's what they do.

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:03.900
- But you're not even home
that much.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.700
- You're always traveling.
- I am traveling.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.900
- And your wife, who you've been
married to for 34 years,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.233
congratulations, 34 years.
- Yes, 35 in March.

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:13.433
Yes.
- So she's home taking care

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.200
of the baby.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.733
- You know what?
They're applauding

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:18.366
because we've been married
for 35 years.

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:21.666
The reason if you ask my wife
why it has lasted for 35 years

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:24.066
is because
I'm never home.
