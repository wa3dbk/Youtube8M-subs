one-of-a-kind t-shirts and also one of a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.530 
one-of-a-kind t-shirts and also one of a
kind<00:02:33.920> well<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:34.790> one<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.090> kind<00:02:35.269> those<00:02:35.420> would

one-of-a-kind so I think that's why the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.080 
one-of-a-kind so I think that's why the
line<00:02:39.440> was<00:02:39.650> longer<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.130> was<00:02:40.220> up<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.370> two<00:02:40.670> hours
