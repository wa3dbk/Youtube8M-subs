00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.190 

why<00:00:57.580> is<00:00:57.640> he<00:00:57.940> leaving<00:00:58.090> up<00:00:58.420> mana<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:58.810> doing

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
why is he leaving up mana and doing

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.770 
why is he leaving up mana and doing
nothing<00:00:59.430> well<00:01:00.430> in<00:01:00.490> the<00:01:00.580> gate<00:01:00.790> did<00:01:01.480> he<00:01:01.540> bring<00:01:01.630> in

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
nothing well in the gate did he bring in

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:11.130 
nothing well in the gate did he bring in
essence<00:01:02.140> scatter<00:01:06.240> die<00:01:07.240> cast<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.660> pre<00:01:07.840> combat<00:01:10.140> no

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
essence scatter die cast a pre combat no

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.270 
essence scatter die cast a pre combat no
because<00:01:11.350> he<00:01:11.440> might<00:01:11.680> have<00:01:11.800> essence<00:01:12.160> scatter

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
because he might have essence scatter

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.250 
because he might have essence scatter
