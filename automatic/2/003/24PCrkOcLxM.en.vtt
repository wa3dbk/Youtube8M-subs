00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.930
 who knows the consumption of chargers 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.180
 telescopic good questions manitou 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.260
 this question is asked is no 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.970
 only he was asked but he 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.099
 today displays consumption 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.450
 got auto motor both on the 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.680
 dashboard on labels and 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.279
 on its website in any 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.630
 transparency 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.550
 is there a risk to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.149
 competitors displayed like this its 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.320
 consumption 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.660
 can it help 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.669
 farmers to better analyze bat pau 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.870
 to reduce it of course it's 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.430
 questions we will be asking 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.960
 marc julienne so he responsible 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.630
 product range chargers 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.150
 telescopic agricultural at manitou you 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.290
 have a scoop at sima 2015 chargers 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.160
 telescopic why we feel the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.750
 fuel 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.490
 and yes like any machine and carts 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.800
 telescopic consumes also exo put in 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.050
 place a program that we have reduced 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.120
 believe themselves fresh murray used to say 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.630
 fully display the consumption of 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.360
 our machines 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.550
 we calculated the consumption of 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.540
 telescopic carts 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.280
 the first thing we realized 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.480
 that there is no standardized cycle on 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.009
 telescopic carts what are the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.060
 four cycles of operation a 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.280
 telescopic 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.740
 firstly we have the handling 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.240
 which is to say the first cycle of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.720
 sureded scopic secondly the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.729
 loading 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.500
 thirdly the road and fourthly 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.820
 if idling or is that the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.620
 farmers can visualize 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.979
 materialize the consumption of their 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.320
 machinery 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.940
 so we made a website 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.549
 on which he can find all the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.590
 consumptions and afterwards also on 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.720
 machines like here in power one displays 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.610
 the consumption of the machine know 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.080
 its consumption and visualize it on the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.580
 dashboard it's possible ah yes 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.650
 in some of our machines gives it 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.240
 and consumption are displayed one can 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.920
 see in real time how much to count in 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.520
 consume what are you the efforts 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.350
 you are doing 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.880
 in winter the design you react on 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.630
 the engine for example where the transmission 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.670
 directly 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.650
 we have machines with its appeal 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.970
 eco mode that helps to better manage the 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.750
 engine power becomes very much on the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.100
 power curve 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.110
 there are automotive systems 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.310
 stop and go to reduce its consumption 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.720
 can we see that on a 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.860
 charger as far as we can see 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.840
 often in slow motion makes it the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.700
 telescopic then the system stop and 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.750
 go this is something we 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.009
 have already worked we have 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.170
 besides machines in the range 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.519
 manitou on telescopic forklifts 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.110
 who are equipped with the 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.730
 save fuel system it's 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.650
 good but also behind the use 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.360
 of a charger there is the maintenance 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.129
 periodic to the resale value is this 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.460
 that all that goes in the same direction then 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.740
 this is also the whole 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.180
 the logic of this stop and go is that 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.160
 while the machine does not actually 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.960
 does not work we stop the engine from 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.070
 suddenly we stop the counter is what 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.410
 makes that resale value is no longer 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.270
 raised spaces to say intervals 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.600
 maintenance can also be 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.000
 pass 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.740
 so we act on the consumption of a 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.730
 side but also say about the value 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.020
 of course the machine 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.340
 overall because the first 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.810
 visitors that you saw on the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.070
 sima are sensitive to these issues of 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.670
 fuel consumption on the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.960
 telescopic 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.240
 people do not necessarily know how 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.710
 maybe how to for 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.480
 optimize this consumption is still 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.980
 once in the program reduces his 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.480
 program one displays in all 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.760
 transparency our consumption 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.080
 we work in builders it's 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.550
 our responsibility to do everything to 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.170
 lower the consumption of our machines 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.090
 and then after we go today too 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.800
 working on the second axis of 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.000
 make people aware 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.040
 how can they themselves too 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.690
 lowering consumption and suddenly 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.940
 it's his deco tips driving it's 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.740
 this simulator is enough these few 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.640
 tunes good driving practices 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.840
 maybe something 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.700
 cyclical that you are not 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.860
 it's the decline in the price of oil 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.870
 Is it going to strengthen 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.960
 farmers' sensitivity to 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.160
 problems role remains one to say a post 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.700
 important expenditure of our machine 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.110
 and anything that can bring it down 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.120
 good to take but especially the approach 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.860
 steep or fits beyond just say of 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.930
 the price aspect of oil 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.000
 it's also how to reduce 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.320
 our ecological footprint is of course 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.270
 less consumption this less 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.350
 emissions of co2 and blow down 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.720
 falling 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.430
 the ecological footprint of the machine and 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.760
 the marcheline use I you 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.540
 thank 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.540
 thank you
