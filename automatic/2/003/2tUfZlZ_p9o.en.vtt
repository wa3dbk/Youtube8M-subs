this<00:00:04.230> recording<00:00:06.319> yeah<00:00:09.889> did<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> bit<00:00:11.099> of

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
this recording yeah did a bit of

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.470 
this recording yeah did a bit of
work<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.519> cars<00:00:11.820> they've<00:00:12.059> got<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> slight

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
work on the cars they've got a slight

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.320 
work on the cars they've got a slight
technical<00:00:12.690> issue<00:00:13.490> remains<00:00:14.490> reversed<00:00:14.910> for<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
technical issue remains reversed for the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.800 
technical issue remains reversed for the
last<00:00:15.680> couple<00:00:16.680> weeks<00:00:17.270> ever<00:00:18.270> since<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.600> started

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
last couple weeks ever since I started

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.779 
last couple weeks ever since I started
in<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> half<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.650> its<00:00:20.220> benefit<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
in the half of it its benefit of the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.720 
in the half of it its benefit of the
heat<00:00:20.939> issue<00:00:21.150> regarding<00:00:22.080> melt<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.740> reverse

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
heat issue regarding melt in the reverse

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.349 
heat issue regarding melt in the reverse
cable<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.980> knowing<00:00:26.279> me<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> plastic

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
cable and knowing me it's like a plastic

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.330 
cable and knowing me it's like a plastic
lined<00:00:27.630> cables<00:00:28.619> there's<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.949> plastic

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
lined cables there's like a plastic

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.429 
lined cables there's like a plastic
sheath<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.910> over<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.420> cable<00:00:30.630> an<00:00:30.960> inside<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
sheath a over the cable an inside the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.290 
sheath a over the cable an inside the
steel<00:00:31.830> thing<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.730> make<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.030> self

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
steel thing is to make like self

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.020 
steel thing is to make like self
lubricating<00:00:33.540> stuff<00:00:34.309> but<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> issue<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.760> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
lubricating stuff but the issue is it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.319 
lubricating stuff but the issue is it
melts<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.570> bitch<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.260> goes<00:00:37.620> solid

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
melts like a bitch and then goes solid

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.260 
melts like a bitch and then goes solid
so<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.600> thought<00:00:39.870> I'd<00:00:39.989> try<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.410> repaired

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
so I thought I'd try and get it repaired

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.340 
so I thought I'd try and get it repaired
was<00:00:42.270> something<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> little<00:00:42.690> bit<00:00:42.809> imaginative

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
was something a little bit imaginative

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.799 
was something a little bit imaginative
was<00:00:43.559> pretty<00:00:43.890> much<00:00:44.149> that's<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.390> goes<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
was pretty much that's what goes in the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.110 
was pretty much that's what goes in the
transmission<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:47.670> where<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.940> touches

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
transmission and that's where it touches

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.700 
transmission and that's where it touches
the<00:00:48.270> manifold<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.050> also<00:00:49.170> touches<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the manifold and it also touches the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
the manifold and it also touches the
manifold<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.850> few<00:00:51.059> other<00:00:51.210> places<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.809> what

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
manifold in a few other places so what

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.950 
manifold in a few other places so what
I'm<00:00:52.050> thinking<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:53.149> Sackhoff<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> sheath<00:00:54.570> some

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
I'm thinking is Sackhoff the sheath some

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470 
I'm thinking is Sackhoff the sheath some
sort<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.289> roller<00:00:55.559> system<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:57.239> bare

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
sort of a roller system and have bare

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.790 
sort of a roller system and have bare
wire<00:00:57.750> coming<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> front<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
wire coming out the front of the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.889 
wire coming out the front of the
transmission<00:01:00.469> straight<00:01:01.469> across<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> gearbox

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
transmission straight across the gearbox

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.149 
transmission straight across the gearbox
because<00:01:03.899> obviously<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.409> won't<00:01:04.589> melt<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
because obviously that won't melt and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.510 
because obviously that won't melt and
then<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.360> release<00:01:07.290> solenoid<00:01:07.799> yanking

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
then have that release solenoid yanking

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.910 
then have that release solenoid yanking
on<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.510> all<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.810> bare<00:01:10.049> wire<00:01:10.320> until

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
on it so it's all just bare wire until

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.200 
on it so it's all just bare wire until
this<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.549> what's<00:01:11.760> way<00:01:11.970> away<00:01:12.090> from

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
this but this is what's way away from

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.359 
this but this is what's way away from
the<00:01:12.390> manifold<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.229> then<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> button<00:01:14.280> on

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the manifold and then have a button on

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.820 
the manifold and then have a button on
the<00:01:14.549> end<00:01:14.610> somewhere<00:01:15.420> instead<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> pull-up

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the end somewhere instead of a pull-up

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.780 
the end somewhere instead of a pull-up
collar<00:01:17.990> that's<00:01:18.990> today's<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.619> project<00:01:22.790> as

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
collar that's today's little project as

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.460 
collar that's today's little project as
you<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.600> supercharger<00:01:25.259> has

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you can see the supercharger has

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.969 
you can see the supercharger has
actually<00:01:25.710> gone<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.240> being

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
actually gone for the time being

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
actually gone for the time being
basically<00:01:28.979> pretty<00:01:29.520> much<00:01:29.759> decided<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.509> with

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
basically pretty much decided that with

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.530 
basically pretty much decided that with
the<00:01:30.840> modern-day<00:01:31.619> VNT<00:01:32.189> that's<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.420> over

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the modern-day VNT that's that over

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.780 
the modern-day VNT that's that over
there<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:34.799> does<00:01:35.009> isn't<00:01:35.280> necessary

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
there it really does isn't necessary

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.929 
there it really does isn't necessary
anymore<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:37.560> thing's<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.070> lively<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.729> just

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
anymore that thing's so lively it's just

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.810 
anymore that thing's so lively it's just
like<00:01:39.210> spools<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.900> pretty<00:01:40.890> much<00:01:41.130> pretty<00:01:41.579> much

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
like spools out pretty much pretty much

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120 
like spools out pretty much pretty much
straight<00:01:42.060> away<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.530> don't<00:01:43.680> need<00:01:43.829> any

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
straight away you just don't need any

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.920 
straight away you just don't need any
more<00:01:44.280> compared<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.850> HUD<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.570> got<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> huge

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
more compared to the HUD it's got a huge

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.510 
more compared to the HUD it's got a huge
amount<00:01:46.049> more<00:01:46.350> compression<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.100> tends<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
amount more compression and it tends to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
amount more compression and it tends to
run<00:01:47.670> once<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.060> warmed<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.630> tends<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.869> run

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
run once it's warmed up it tends to run

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.429 
run once it's warmed up it tends to run
fairly<00:01:49.409> okay<00:01:49.890> without<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.540> we're<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.380> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
fairly okay without it so we're going to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.929 
fairly okay without it so we're going to
have<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> rearrange<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> UM

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
have a bit of a rearrange with the UM

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.330 
have a bit of a rearrange with the UM
Bustos<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.990> no<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.380> try<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.799> tidy<00:01:56.009> up<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.310> bit

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
Bustos is no just try and tidy up a bit

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.709 
Bustos is no just try and tidy up a bit
as<00:01:56.640> we're<00:01:56.790> taking<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.149> long<00:01:57.270> way<00:01:57.329> around<00:01:57.450> at

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
as we're taking the long way around at

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.899 
as we're taking the long way around at
the<00:01:57.780> moment<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.979> Chris's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the moment and Chris's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.429 
the moment and Chris's
looks<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.450> he's<00:02:00.570> making<00:02:00.780> some<00:02:00.990> lights<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
looks like he's making some lights the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.030 
looks like he's making some lights the
standard<00:02:01.799> issue<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.189> Chris<00:02:03.710> okay<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.740> got<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
standard issue for Chris okay I got the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.859 
standard issue for Chris okay I got the
electromagnet<00:02:05.850> solenoid<00:02:06.210> mounted<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:06.719> now

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
electromagnet solenoid mounted there now

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.139 
electromagnet solenoid mounted there now
just<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.560> little<00:02:07.590> bracket<00:02:07.979> off<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> side<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
just a little bracket off the side and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.980 
just a little bracket off the side and
cables<00:02:09.899> joined<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.349> I'm<00:02:11.009> tied<00:02:11.340> up

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
cables joined in I'm tied up

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.330 
cables joined in I'm tied up
but<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.200> seems<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.500> work<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.160> I'm<00:02:13.220> just

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
but it seems to work in so I'm just

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.370 
but it seems to work in so I'm just
gonna<00:02:13.430> run<00:02:13.640> some<00:02:13.850> cables<00:02:14.210> now<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:15.170> hopefully

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
gonna run some cables now and hopefully

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.800 
gonna run some cables now and hopefully
that'll<00:02:15.860> mean<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.580> love<00:02:16.820> Reverse<00:02:17.150> on<00:02:17.780> a

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
that'll mean that I love Reverse on a

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.670 
that'll mean that I love Reverse on a
more<00:02:18.050> reliable<00:02:18.230> manner

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
more reliable manner

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.890 
more reliable manner
I<00:02:18.860> mean<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:19.730> solid<00:02:20.090> cable<00:02:20.300> basically<00:02:20.810> from

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
I mean it's solid cable basically from

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.170 
I mean it's solid cable basically from
their<00:02:21.080> back<00:02:21.320> so<00:02:21.740> it's<00:02:22.340> not<00:02:22.400> an<00:02:22.580> ideal<00:02:22.670> solution

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
their back so it's not an ideal solution

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.470 
their back so it's not an ideal solution
but<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:24.650> should<00:02:24.860> work

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.800 

okay<00:02:32.290> we're<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.770> sport<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.069> wiring

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
okay we're just in the sport of wiring

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.080 
okay we're just in the sport of wiring
when<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.840> we've<00:02:35.170> got<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.410> car<00:02:35.620> back<00:02:35.860> Iran<00:02:36.160> Iran

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
when I we've got the car back Iran Iran

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.059 
when I we've got the car back Iran Iran
and<00:02:37.239> multi-core<00:02:37.660> cable<00:02:37.989> and<00:02:38.170> for<00:02:38.590> me<00:02:38.769> behind

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
and multi-core cable and for me behind

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.180 
and multi-core cable and for me behind
the<00:02:39.160> -<00:02:39.370> up<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.209> front<00:02:40.450> wing<00:02:40.690> here<00:02:41.129> by<00:02:42.129> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
the - up to the front wing here by the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.550 
the - up to the front wing here by the
way<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.720> I'm<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:43.900> connecting<00:02:44.050> into<00:02:44.379> one

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
way that so I'm just connecting into one

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.680 
way that so I'm just connecting into one
of<00:02:44.650> those<00:02:44.709> I've<00:02:44.950> actually<00:02:45.069> relayed<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
of those I've actually relayed it in the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.920 
of those I've actually relayed it in the
engine<00:02:46.989> bay<00:02:47.640> obviously<00:02:48.640> that's<00:02:48.760> not<00:02:48.930> matter

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
engine bay obviously that's not matter

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.600 
engine bay obviously that's not matter
anything<00:02:50.380> yet<00:02:50.530> but<00:02:50.739> I'm<00:02:50.980> just<00:02:51.069> going<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:51.430> that

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
anything yet but I'm just going on that

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.850 
anything yet but I'm just going on that
means<00:02:52.510> just<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.780> face<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:52.959> mounting<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.380> switch

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
means just a face of mounting the switch

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.380 
means just a face of mounting the switch
inside<00:02:54.069> and<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.209> should<00:02:55.390> be<00:02:55.480> working<00:02:57.390> all

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
inside and it should be working all

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.250 
inside and it should be working all
right<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.810> you're<00:02:59.049> combining<00:02:59.560> yesterday<00:03:01.260> well

finished now we're just embarking on

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.870 
finished now we're just embarking on
reroute<00:04:03.900> in<00:04:03.960> the<00:04:04.020> booster<00:04:04.200> doses<00:04:04.760> pretty<00:04:05.760> much

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
reroute in the booster doses pretty much

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.870 
reroute in the booster doses pretty much
sucking<00:04:06.240> off<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.480> sequential<00:04:07.050> setup<00:04:07.730> to<00:04:08.730> go

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
sucking off the sequential setup to go

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.210 
sucking off the sequential setup to go
for<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.180> big<00:04:09.900> compound<00:04:10.290> setup<00:04:10.620> pretty<00:04:10.920> much<00:04:11.100> the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
for a big compound setup pretty much the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.250 
for a big compound setup pretty much the
same<00:04:11.370> as<00:04:11.520> I'm<00:04:11.760> actually

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.680 

okay<00:04:14.620> okay<00:04:15.580> I've<00:04:15.879> totally<00:04:16.180> forgotten<00:04:16.479> what<00:04:16.630> I

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690

okay okay I've totally forgotten what I
said<00:04:16.900> it's<00:04:17.229> got<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.799> earphone<00:04:18.220> yeah

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
said it's got a earphone yeah

said it's got a earphone yeah
 air<00:04:19.780> are<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.680> line<00:04:20.859> by<00:04:21.100> Chris<00:04:21.400> there

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
 air are the line by Chris there

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.550 
 air are the line by Chris there
yeah<00:04:22.360> so<00:04:22.510> we've<00:04:22.630> gone<00:04:22.750> for<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.960> compound<00:04:23.260> shot

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
yeah so we've gone for a compound shot

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.629 
yeah so we've gone for a compound shot
now

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
now

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.730 
now
basically<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.780> twig<00:04:25.990> twin<00:04:26.199> turbos<00:04:26.530> rather

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
basically the twig twin turbos rather

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.129 
basically the twig twin turbos rather
than<00:04:26.889> turbo<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:27.310> supercharger<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:28.449> VT<00:04:28.870> is

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
than turbo and supercharger the VT is

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.560 
than turbo and supercharger the VT is
probably<00:04:29.530> going<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.770> get<00:04:29.830> up<00:04:30.010> sized<00:04:30.479> it's<00:04:31.479> a

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
probably going to get up sized it's a

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.120 
probably going to get up sized it's a
little<00:04:31.810> bit<00:04:31.990> small<00:04:32.320> ready<00:04:32.530> for<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.800> compound

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
little bit small ready for a compound

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.680 
little bit small ready for a compound
setup<00:04:33.460> like<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:33.669> but<00:04:34.330> it<00:04:34.389> will<00:04:34.449> do<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.600> job

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
setup like that but it will do the job

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.560 
setup like that but it will do the job
for<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:34.990> minute<00:04:35.850> so<00:04:36.850> that's<00:04:37.060> basically<00:04:37.419> how

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
for a minute so that's basically how

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.090 
for a minute so that's basically how
that's<00:04:37.780> saying<00:04:38.080> we're<00:04:38.680> rewritten<00:04:38.949> the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
that's saying we're rewritten the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.650 
that's saying we're rewritten the
Boosters<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.639> because<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:40.090> was<00:04:40.210> kind<00:04:40.419> of<00:04:40.449> Criss

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
Boosters is because it was kind of Criss

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.180 
Boosters is because it was kind of Criss
crossing<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.320> it's<00:04:41.500> going<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.740> do<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.889> more

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
crossing so it's going to do a more

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.969 
crossing so it's going to do a more
direct<00:04:42.550> route<00:04:42.760> we've<00:04:43.540> also<00:04:43.690> noticed<00:04:44.199> a<00:04:44.470> very

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
direct route we've also noticed a very

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.900 
direct route we've also noticed a very
large<00:04:46.289> amount<00:04:47.289> of<00:04:47.440> row<00:04:47.740> space

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
large amount of row space

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.000 
large amount of row space
it's<00:04:49.780> just<00:04:49.960> appeared<00:04:50.350> now<00:04:50.530> at<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.740> front<00:04:50.949> of

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
it's just appeared now at the front of

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.700 
it's just appeared now at the front of
the<00:04:51.100> engine<00:04:51.250> which<00:04:51.960> will<00:04:52.960> just<00:04:53.110> put<00:04:53.289> an<00:04:53.350> idea

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
the engine which will just put an idea

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.029 
the engine which will just put an idea
in<00:04:53.830> my<00:04:53.949> head<00:04:53.979> but<00:04:54.460> right<00:04:55.710> okay<00:04:56.710> we've<00:04:56.860> got<00:04:56.979> the

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
in my head but right okay we've got the

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.500 
in my head but right okay we've got the
front<00:04:57.190> end<00:04:57.370> off<00:04:57.639> now<00:04:57.910> I've<00:04:58.060> got<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.360> old

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
front end off now I've got the old

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.200 
front end off now I've got the old
quarter<00:04:58.900> off<00:04:59.400> cool<00:05:00.400> occurs<00:05:00.699> I've<00:05:00.880> never<00:05:01.060> been

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
quarter off cool occurs I've never been

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.029 
quarter off cool occurs I've never been
happy<00:05:01.479> with<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:01.750> being<00:05:02.410> where<00:05:02.530> as<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.830> on<00:05:02.949> the

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
happy with it being where as to on the

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.260 
happy with it being where as to on the
front<00:05:03.250> end<00:05:03.400> it<00:05:03.550> like<00:05:03.639> pushes<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.180> front

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
front end it like pushes the front

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.120 
front end it like pushes the front
bumper<00:05:04.539> out<00:05:04.840> and<00:05:05.020> just<00:05:05.169> looks<00:05:05.350> generically

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
bumper out and just looks generically

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.600 
bumper out and just looks generically
awful<00:05:07.350> so<00:05:08.350> I'm<00:05:08.440> open<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.830> try<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.130> squeeze<00:05:09.400> it

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
awful so I'm open to try and squeeze it

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.300 
awful so I'm open to try and squeeze it
in<00:05:09.789> behind<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.930> intercooler<00:05:11.380> between<00:05:12.190> the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
intercooler on the radiator which is

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.860 
intercooler on the radiator which is
currently<00:05:14.380> occupied<00:05:14.860> by<00:05:14.889> fans<00:05:15.570> but<00:05:16.570> I'm

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
currently occupied by fans but I'm

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.270 
currently occupied by fans but I'm
thinking<00:05:17.440> now<00:05:17.560> that<00:05:17.740> I've<00:05:17.860> got<00:05:19.200> it<00:05:20.280> blocking

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
thinking now that I've got it blocking

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.770 
thinking now that I've got it blocking
the<00:05:21.400> night<00:05:21.580> there's<00:05:22.000> substantial<00:05:22.120> amount

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
the night there's substantial amount

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.170 
the night there's substantial amount
more<00:05:22.990> room<00:05:23.229> at<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.280> front<00:05:24.490> air<00:05:24.820> that<00:05:24.970> I<00:05:25.000> might

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
more room at the front air that I might

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.940 
more room at the front air that I might
go<00:05:25.300> to<00:05:25.360> possibly<00:05:25.750> put<00:05:26.169> a<00:05:26.200> sucker<00:05:26.470> on<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.710> back

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
go to possibly put a sucker on the back

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.409 
go to possibly put a sucker on the back
and<00:05:27.220> get<00:05:27.340> rid<00:05:27.460> of<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.610> one<00:05:27.729> of<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:27.880> front<00:05:28.120> fans

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
and get rid of the one of the front fans

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.170 
and get rid of the one of the front fans
and<00:05:28.720> I<00:05:29.410> put<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.740> oil<00:05:29.800> cooler<00:05:30.130> in<00:05:30.310> there<00:05:30.460> which

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
and I put the oil cooler in there which

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.029 
and I put the oil cooler in there which
should<00:05:31.660> a<00:05:31.780> look<00:05:32.020> better<00:05:32.229> and<00:05:32.470> protect<00:05:32.950> the<00:05:33.010> oil

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
should a look better and protect the oil

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.700 
should a look better and protect the oil
cooler<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.669> just<00:05:34.479> be<00:05:34.690> better<00:05:34.900> overall<00:05:35.260> within

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
cooler and just be better overall within

cooler and just be better overall within
the<00:05:35.889> bumper<00:05:36.160> might<00:05:36.310> actually<00:05:36.460> fit<00:05:36.760> back<00:05:36.940> on

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
the bumper might actually fit back on

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.460 
the bumper might actually fit back on
the<00:05:37.180> car<00:05:37.389> again<00:05:37.599> for<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:37.930> first<00:05:38.080> time<00:05:38.229> in

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
about 12 months other than that we've

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.469 
about 12 months other than that we've
got<00:05:41.349> the<00:05:41.620> blue<00:05:42.070> stripes<00:05:42.460> we'll<00:05:42.729> hook<00:05:43.150> back<00:05:43.360> up

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
got the blue stripes we'll hook back up

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.810 
got the blue stripes we'll hook back up
again<00:05:43.720> now<00:05:43.870> buy<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:44.740> two<00:05:44.979> turbos<00:05:45.400> down<00:05:45.729> the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
again now buy the two turbos down the

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
car and then up through it's a bit dirty

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.750 
car and then up through it's a bit dirty
but<00:05:52.840> ignore<00:05:53.169> that<00:05:53.320> you<00:05:53.620> have<00:05:54.310> to<00:05:54.400> make<00:05:54.550> up<00:05:54.669> a

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
but ignore that you have to make up a

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.150 
but ignore that you have to make up a
better<00:05:54.940> flange<00:05:55.330> for<00:05:55.630> here<00:05:55.900> because<00:05:56.770> it<00:05:57.010> hits

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
better flange for here because it hits

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.589 
better flange for here because it hits
the<00:05:57.280> bonnet<00:05:57.639> at<00:05:57.729> the<00:05:57.820> moment<00:05:58.150> so<00:05:58.270> I<00:05:58.330> wanted<00:05:58.539> to

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
the bonnet at the moment so I wanted to

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.650 
the bonnet at the moment so I wanted to
be<00:05:58.780> facing<00:05:59.050> down<00:05:59.380> a<00:05:59.410> bit<00:05:59.849> let<00:06:00.849> me<00:06:00.970> I<00:06:01.120> say<00:06:01.450> it's

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
be facing down a bit let me I say it's

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.510 
be facing down a bit let me I say it's
the<00:06:01.750> button<00:06:01.960> it<00:06:02.169> it<00:06:02.380> literally<00:06:02.680> vibrates<00:06:03.250> just

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
the button it it literally vibrates just

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.400 
the button it it literally vibrates just
very<00:06:03.820> slightly<00:06:04.150> against<00:06:04.450> the<00:06:04.599> bonnet<00:06:04.840> which

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
very slightly against the bonnet which

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.110 
very slightly against the bonnet which
annoys<00:06:05.680> me<00:06:08.520> probably<00:06:09.520> got<00:06:09.669> the<00:06:09.729> oil<00:06:09.880> cooler

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
annoys me probably got the oil cooler

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.550 
annoys me probably got the oil cooler
mounted<00:06:10.510> there<00:06:10.690> in<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.470> placement<00:06:11.860> of<00:06:11.949> them

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
mounted there in the placement of them

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
that fan that's up there used to be on
