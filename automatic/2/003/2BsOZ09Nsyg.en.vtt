the<00:00:19.150> plus<00:00:19.359> system<00:00:19.570> is<00:00:19.869> very<00:00:20.110> useful<00:00:20.500> for

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
the plus system is very useful for

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.620 
the plus system is very useful for
aiming<00:00:20.980> to<00:00:21.189> rail<00:00:21.400> kick<00:00:21.699> shots<00:00:21.939> off<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.390> short

aiming to rail kick shots off the short

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.019 
aiming to rail kick shots off the short
rail<00:00:22.869> the<00:00:23.619> system<00:00:24.009> is<00:00:24.130> based<00:00:24.340> on<00:00:24.520> the<00:00:24.640> diamond

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
rail the system is based on the diamond

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.600 
rail the system is based on the diamond
numbers<00:00:25.300> on<00:00:25.419> the<00:00:25.509> short<00:00:25.750> rail<00:00:25.960> shown<00:00:26.289> here<00:00:26.619> the

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
numbers on the short rail shown here the

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.609 
numbers on the short rail shown here the
corner<00:00:27.880> pocket<00:00:28.090> diamond<00:00:28.689> is<00:00:28.840> labeled<00:00:29.169> one<00:00:29.380> and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
corner pocket diamond is labeled one and

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.529 
corner pocket diamond is labeled one and
every<00:00:30.070> half<00:00:30.250> diamond<00:00:30.550> increases<00:00:31.239> the<00:00:31.360> count

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
every half diamond increases the count

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.530 
every half diamond increases the count
by<00:00:31.750> one<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.370> first<00:00:33.579> half<00:00:33.760> diamond<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.300> to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
by one so the first half diamond is to

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.229 
by one so the first half diamond is to
the<00:00:35.410> first<00:00:35.680> full<00:00:35.890> diamond<00:00:36.219> is<00:00:36.309> three<00:00:36.610> and<00:00:36.790> so

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
the first full diamond is three and so

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.330 
the first full diamond is three and so
on<00:00:37.390> you<00:00:38.200> can<00:00:38.350> also<00:00:38.469> just<00:00:38.710> remember<00:00:38.980> that<00:00:39.219> the

Plus<00:01:11.360> system<00:01:11.720> is<00:01:11.840> sometimes<00:01:12.049> called<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.590> plus

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
Plus system is sometimes called the plus

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.770 
Plus system is sometimes called the plus
two<00:01:13.190> system<00:01:13.760> one<00:01:14.060> reason<00:01:14.390> is<00:01:14.510> that<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.630> helps

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
two system one reason is that it helps

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.420 
two system one reason is that it helps
you<00:01:14.960> remember<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.619> first<00:01:15.860> diamond<00:01:16.159> is

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
you remember that the first diamond is

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.550 
you remember that the first diamond is
labeled<00:01:16.760> three<00:01:17.060> which<00:01:17.299> is<00:01:17.330> one<00:01:17.690> plus<00:01:17.960> two

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
labeled three which is one plus two

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.680 
labeled three which is one plus two
another<00:01:19.159> reason<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.850> typical<00:01:20.060> kick<00:01:20.479> in

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
another reason is that a typical kick in

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.120 
another reason is that a typical kick in
and<00:01:20.930> out<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.170> corner<00:01:21.409> pocket<00:01:21.590> like<00:01:21.920> this

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
and out of the corner pocket like this

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.210 
and out of the corner pocket like this
shifts<00:01:22.729> up<00:01:22.880> table<00:01:23.240> by<00:01:23.360> two<00:01:23.420> diamonds<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.979> plus

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
shifts up table by two diamonds the plus

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.130 
shifts up table by two diamonds the plus
two<00:01:25.460> shift<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:26.030> created<00:01:26.450> by<00:01:26.540> aiming<00:01:26.900> through

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
two shift is created by aiming through

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.749 
two shift is created by aiming through
the<00:01:27.320> half<00:01:27.530> diamond<00:01:27.830> past<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.340> corner<00:01:28.610> pocket

this<00:05:26.160> can<00:05:26.370> make<00:05:26.520> it<00:05:26.640> easier<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.150> measure

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
this can make it easier to measure

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.020 
this can make it easier to measure

look at how you figure this out at the
table<00:06:02.660> first<00:06:03.660> we<00:06:03.870> start<00:06:04.110> counting<00:06:04.290> diamond

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
table first we start counting diamond

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.700 
table first we start counting diamond
distances<00:06:05.280> from<00:06:05.430> our<00:06:05.610> desired<00:06:05.940> target<00:06:06.710> here

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
distances from our desired target here

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.050 
distances from our desired target here
we<00:06:07.830> have<00:06:08.010> one<00:06:08.419> two<00:06:09.419> three<00:06:09.830> and<00:06:10.830> about<00:06:11.460> four<00:06:11.820> to

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
we have one two three and about four to

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.810 
we have one two three and about four to
the<00:06:12.150> approximate<00:06:12.390> line<00:06:12.870> of<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.110> cue<00:06:13.290> ball<00:06:13.820> now

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
the approximate line of the cue ball now

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.610 
the approximate line of the cue ball now
if<00:06:14.940> we<00:06:15.060> were<00:06:15.180> shooting<00:06:15.330> from<00:06:15.690> four<00:06:16.110> through

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
if we were shooting from four through

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.460 
if we were shooting from four through
four<00:06:16.979> we<00:06:17.340> would<00:06:17.460> hit<00:06:17.610> our<00:06:17.729> desired<00:06:18.030> target<00:06:18.479> but

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
four we would hit our desired target but

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.719 
four we would hit our desired target but
this<00:06:19.620> line<00:06:19.800> doesn't<00:06:20.010> go<00:06:20.160> through<00:06:20.370> our<00:06:20.520> cue

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
this line doesn't go through our cue

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:21.740 
this line doesn't go through our cue
ball<00:06:20.910> so<00:06:21.150> we<00:06:21.240> have<00:06:21.360> to<00:06:21.450> make<00:06:21.570> a<00:06:21.600> small

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
ball so we have to make a small

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.440 
ball so we have to make a small
adjustment<00:06:22.340> since<00:06:23.340> one<00:06:23.580> diamond<00:06:23.850> distance<00:06:24.330> on

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
adjustment since one diamond distance on

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.969 
adjustment since one diamond distance on
the<00:06:24.510> long<00:06:24.690> rail<00:06:24.900> corresponds<00:06:25.650> to<00:06:25.710> two

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
the long rail corresponds to two

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.800 
the long rail corresponds to two
diamonds<00:06:26.310> on<00:06:26.550> the<00:06:26.669> short<00:06:26.910> rail<00:06:27.120> need<00:06:27.510> to<00:06:27.600> shift

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
diamonds on the short rail need to shift

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.510 
diamonds on the short rail need to shift
the<00:06:27.960> but<00:06:28.140> by<00:06:28.350> twice<00:06:28.620> as<00:06:28.800> much<00:06:28.919> as<00:06:29.070> we<00:06:29.190> shift<00:06:29.340> the

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
the but by twice as much as we shift the

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.100 
the but by twice as much as we shift the
tip<00:06:29.729> until<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.270> cue<00:06:30.510> is<00:06:30.630> aligned<00:06:30.900> with<00:06:30.990> the

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
tip until the cue is aligned with the

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.290 
tip until the cue is aligned with the
cue<00:06:31.350> ball<00:06:31.760> now<00:06:32.760> we<00:06:32.820> have<00:06:33.060> the<00:06:33.150> necessary

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
cue ball now we have the necessary

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:41.870 
cue ball now we have the necessary
aiming<00:06:33.960> line<00:06:34.110> for<00:06:34.320> the<00:06:34.410> shot

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.920 

now<00:06:42.880> you<00:06:42.940> shouldn't<00:06:43.300> expect<00:06:43.450> to<00:06:43.690> make<00:06:43.810> the

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
now you shouldn't expect to make the

now you shouldn't expect to make the
shot<00:06:44.170> every<00:06:44.500> time<00:06:44.530> but<00:06:45.400> if<00:06:45.490> you<00:06:45.580> practice<00:06:45.970> with
