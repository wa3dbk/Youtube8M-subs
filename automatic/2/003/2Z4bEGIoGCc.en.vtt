00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:18.480
 one way is that this form had not 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.780
 I could upload videos because I was busy 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.410
 with personal things and with jobs 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.940
 secular within the church 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 arriving 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.160
 for the house for reasons of time 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.400
 more dwarfs after leaving 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.300
 it would be a music disc left 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.570
 computer working 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.440
 and she only took care of it but it's 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.829
 doing 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.660
 a song the song of the pse of glory 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.530
 I had previously uploaded a video 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.390
 but 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.850
 what are the instructions for 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.410
 electric guitar come out this time 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.440
 let's learn a little more like 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.149
 accompaniment on acoustic guitar and 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.949
 well let's go to the song mark of glory 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.200
 I will explain why they are used 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.710
 Within this song you are the saint 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.710
 higher 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.180
 and they are all chords that do not have 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.480
 greater difficulty within what is the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.760
 song then good we started a 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.030
 tutorial saleh we started first 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.010
 with 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.810
 the position of each of the supports 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.970
 inside the lyrics within the song 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.050
 comes out then says the song says 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.500
 when one 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.940
 you are the best 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.840
 they are their backs 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.400
 is your command 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.850
 says put glorious van 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.850
 you are 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.710
 Market Stall 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.710
 Vicente after starting 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.700
 has rested 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.290
 where 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.940
 universal 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.120
 and then comes what that chorus 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.130
 but before moving on to what is the chorus 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.910
 we can put a little bit of Reynosa 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.810
 the rhythm would be if it would be one down 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.500
 upwards 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.450
 not down up and down it comes out 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.450
 then the rhythm would be like this 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.920
 crc 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.859
 saleh would be water 2 above 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:53.400
 all upstairs downstairs upstairs and downstairs 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.400
 i 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.340
 d 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.280

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.870

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.359

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.359

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.620
 i 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.989
 then there we go 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.470
 then comes the part that is very 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:12.150
 known of glory that he says are the 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.150
 progressions by salem that st 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.500

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.050
 well jesus 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.880

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.880
 way to all above 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.620

 if you say do I repeat yes well 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:45.020

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:47.309
 with a fortune 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.249
