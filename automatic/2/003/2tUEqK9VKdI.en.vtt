00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 Boys girls to all the laces test 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.589
 everyone and this is the main crafting no no 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.320
 do not 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.620
 very good and this is minecraft and good 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.299
 as you know today is Thursday today is 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.279
 Thursday with games forgive me that I just 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.160
 of traveling in time was already 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.869
 hallucinating my mental empanada world and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.220
 well you know that every day 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.970
 a mode be it Thursday be Friday be 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.810
 Saturday, whatever day it is Friday 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.250
 whatever is agreed and the mode and 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.590
 true that is totally interesting 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.480
 voucher for the simple fact that 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.220
 that I have read many times in 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.140
 comments stopped bringing a bot that 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.850
 They deliver many envelopes according to mod that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.410
 bring new tools and so on 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.420
 etcetera etcetera and this one brought you well 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.640
 that when we're going to start and we're going 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.250
 by the principle that the most of the most 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.170
 here removes to the best of agreement fire 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 the postmen are exactly the same 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 that has the original minecraft and with 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.590
 all the same goes for us 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.180
 we see find this gold that is 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.070
 now that it is itched like an iron pick 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.440
 from now on all this about it itches with 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.320
 peak of iron onwards except the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.970
 last it will be with good diamond the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.680
 case 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.660
 as you see this would be the order worth 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.130
 when you break it, it will give you the gold and 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.140
 we are going to have to melt it for us 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.300
 give the ingot once you give us the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.840
 ingot let's be able to make us this one 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.920
 crafter or put the block worth of 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.170
 it's here we see people 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.759
 and good we would have the armor is worth 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.080
 now let's see the defenses of the 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.409
 armor buying them there 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.240
 I quietly have the end there 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.880
 we'll put the bucket full of water and it's 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.640
 full and empty is worth a copper door 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.619
 of agreement and copper berries is worth as 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.869
 You see it's a roll because rusty is a 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.700
 pretty funny roll in your 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.259
 respective tools with his sword and 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.520
 other and good we would go to the next 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.590
 order the next now that it was him 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.869
 I do not remember what it 's called dye not 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.640
 I know what it also tells me great not me 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.890
 agreement I know what I knew but I already know 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.369
 he forgets me and well we have what comes 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.179
 being the armor the berries are not there 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.650
 doors in this case is worth this out 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.599
 we will have to heat it in the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.640
 oven to give us the ingot and with 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.170
 delinquent we can do well that this one 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.489
 I was on the ground month in the berries 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.260
 they liked it a lot they are like very 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.330
 blanditas and such that the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.180
 censors the tools we're going to 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.709
 to be able to make one of these is worth a 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.470
 cut to sheep these are for peels 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.299
 they sheared them and all that roll this 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.920
 I like this pretty much, it's going to give us 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.890
 normal that do not work and faster and 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.530
 slower but good is better than having 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.540
 the usual oven that ends up being 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.269
 quite monotonous not 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.709
 you see better this one that is more fun to 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.030
 some way simply with armor is 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.590
 The blue one whistles me and this one has 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.530
 delighted we can make the clubs 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.120
 The wands are so good 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.069
 are two of these the low ones and I have 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.049
 the same characters that are the 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.310
 they are all worth the same as 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.129
 only thing that is going to change is that this new 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.599
 great framework as a tool apart to have 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.569
 ovens we will not see door yes but 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.099
 we can have bow according to 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.670
 next that is here that is the 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.989
 old lady then that same the same 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.959
 Armor of agreement without any problem 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.530
 nothing fences bullion the same but 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.109
 well in this case we will give one to 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.599
 a peeler of these adamantium are worth 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.000
 stronger more resistance go to the end 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.620
 this cut very fast but what are you going 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.680
 to win with this is more resistance from 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.920
 agreement 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.530
 and showed that well this is the last 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.879
 ok and what he will give us is for not 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.459
 this agreement we now that they are 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.540
 faster than normal business hours 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.739
 agreement will give us bow and back we 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.500
 is going to give more doors than by the way 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.780
 They are a bit since that this guess 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.849
 it will be the version it is worth because it comes out like this 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.219
 a little ugly but good is similar and 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.049
 fun does not give us the berries according 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.120
 it's a totally dark one that 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.950
 finds in hell okay and when 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.459
 what pics will automatically give you already 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.109
 the one that is being the gold done badly in 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.840
 you have to melt it or anything like that 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.730
 in agreement 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.069
 and good now we go a little bit to teach 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.340
 these are the normal tools like 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.340
 you see 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.330
 the one with the most resistance is the one of five 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.980
 attacks always because here equal to the 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.080
 first as copper is pointed is 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.440
 it's equivalent to stone 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.780
 exactly the same 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.600
 the team then more of the same or equivalent 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.420
 to a stone worth 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.260
 and in swords equal in agreement or be 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.910
 gold or wood outside with teachers 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.710
 these two which are the ones that we are going to 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.410
 find are also as if they were 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.170
 stone what happens we open the iron 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.550
 we skip it out the next one will be the 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.950
 I thrill that it will be like a peak of 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.320
 diamond of agreement and the sword equal 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.460
 It will be like having a diamond sword 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.410
 then a we go to the mansion is worth it is 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.420
 just like the diamond in agreement and the 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.400
 sword is more of the same and then already 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.220
 we will go to what I saw that is hate 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.200
 It's ok to kill us or if it started or I 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.550
 I know it will be I have no idea what 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.710
 invention I am in greyhound of English and 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.520
 well you say it reminds me of a 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.670
 PokÃ©mon de Onis Pokemon I have no idea 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.170
 that might come have you need 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.790
 attack worth the demand remembered that 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.320
 has 5 is to say that it is more efficient to 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.810
 the time to apply is also valid and the 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.000
 sword does not need nine are two 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.440
 more good points this is something normal and 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.030
 current that we are worth, but if 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.820
 we created it 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.750
 with miter let's see more damage and more 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.850
 efficiency and with the pokemon we are going to 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.110
 have more damage and also fire is worth saying 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.540
 that we do not have have to sing it from 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.510
 agreement and with the armors as it happens 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.580
 x is exactly like here these 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.490
 first two when it is equivalent to the 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.259
 mesh of agreement 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.180
 and then it's around here the left us 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.919
 let's adapt these two so that we see 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.920
 the diamond when I was with the east 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.990
 so nothing happened 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.000
 and this is going to be the most powerful of all 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.340
 agree and that's it 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.070
 I think it's an explanation of the way 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.330
 pretty simple I think that and logic I think 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.310
 that I do not forget anything if I forget 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.870
 Leave it to me in comments and if you 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.700
