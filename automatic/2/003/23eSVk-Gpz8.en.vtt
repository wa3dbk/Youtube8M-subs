 around is absolutely nothing of the lamps 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.700
 torches not even for the gods who 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.349
 watch this snapshot video what is this 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.759
 that it is an application that 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.650
 allows to send messages pictures 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.000
 or videos that lasts only a few 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.439
 seconds even if you are god you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.890
 can the download one just type 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.480
 snapshot face2face cat and it's good the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.430
 Old anti technique is a little 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.500
 confusing snapshot at first why 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.750
 send a photo that will be deleted 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.040
 then the photograph is a marc 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.079
 it's the yamaha myth 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.620
 it tells something it's noble and 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.110
 here I am proud to introduce you to my 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.270
 masterpiece 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.829
 you liked it you want us to talk about it 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.809
 it's funny on snapshot there are often 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.850
 a difference between the snap that you 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.350
 send to someone of the same sex and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.719
 like your friend and the snap while voice to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.770
 someone of the opposite sex 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.270
 such a chick you want to cop it 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.469
 weird this behavior on this match at 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.469
 we are not like that in real life 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.510
 even all receive a snap a little bit 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.400
 cute or even a little naughty 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.650
 only that none is enough when a 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.940
 buddy receives next to you you feel like 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.940
 to see how the economy 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.350
 sorry aprr go hi 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.299
 o the girl 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.399
 i'm going to do like the five tweet to 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.110
 avoid on twitter I book you but it 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.719
 the thing that annoys me about this match at 5 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.939
 the snap of the painter I get 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.070
 sometimes snaps with drawings of phew 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.659
 the guy spent hours and when I 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.369
 compared with mine I feel 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.990
 totally nil quietly the guy 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.490
 with his finger is more talented than you 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.829
 with all the stationery on the planet 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.560
 so when I get that I do not answer 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.179
 not like that the guy who farts a cable it 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.149
 took me three hours to ceusses 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.959
 tablecloth you can answer us - yes I 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.330
 am an asshole 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.430
 4 you can choose the duration of your snap 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.319
 I do not understand what leaves the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.760
 maximum duration for a snap that has 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.030
 no interest 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.630
 why why your cat deserves 10 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.640
 seconds 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.959
 it can happen a lot of stuff in 10 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.910
 seconds you are under arrest 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.660
 you must be wrong janot saved 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.560
 said thank you very much 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.720
 look too many we will die 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.670
 hello mom alex is bitter actually it's 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.530
 a change of side mom and dad 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.000
 We can know who made a 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.310
 screenshot of your snap this is a 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.530
 super nice feature and ya 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.450
 people who make screenshots of 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.970
 all you do what for 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.900
 Seriously I collect photos of 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.900
 people I print them jimmy in our 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.030
 pockets contains 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.980
 2 then there are those who make snap 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.579
 useless at ten seconds and the inverted 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.379
 those who snap a second step 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.120
 the time to see what exactly in one 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.409
 second you thought you were in a game of 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.450
 memorization that's the lack of them 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.680
 one-second snacks are often 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.569
 pictures of beats finally six ovens 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.400
 each I made screenshots a 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.720
 maybe the thing that annoys me the most 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.909
 sure snapshots and when I get a 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.329
 short video but that I'm in 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.329
 quiet 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.610
 I hope it was not interested 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.740
 branch critical not my snapshot 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.150
 are born as mortal sometimes I get 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.930
 memorable stats from my mates we get 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.610
 tap egg bars 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.860
 by the way you can add on snap 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.420
 it's cyprian video just good 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.760
 on the other hand how to speak of snapshot 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.350
 without mentioning the biggest phobia of 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.450
 all users of the application 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.800
 we are all afraid that one day in fact since 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.180
 the beginning we kept all the photos 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.530
 by the way from now on they 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.160
 are available on the internet 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.160
 she salutes 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.710
 oh well you if you feel like if you 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.940
 do not you do what you want 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:09.140
 it's really as you feel it I say 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:10.790
 that way I waited a little word 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.400
 about my previous video 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.740
 I was very clumsy in suggesting that 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.600
 the Roma were thieves I regret 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.880
 to have said that it was really a 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.080
 stupidity on my part never wanted to stir up 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.190
 hate in my videos it's even the 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.380
 strict inverse I do not want 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.150
 stigmatize people or a population 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.920
 I just want everyone to laugh 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.930
 enormously I made a mistake and 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.350
 I hope you will not do it 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.350
 count on you
