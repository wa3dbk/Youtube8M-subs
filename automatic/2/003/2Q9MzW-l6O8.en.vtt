now<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.730> I'm<00:00:18.849> modeling<00:00:19.060> this<00:00:19.330> up<00:00:19.450> in<00:00:19.599> clay<00:00:19.900> in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
now and I'm modeling this up in clay in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.859 
now and I'm modeling this up in clay in
slightly<00:00:21.250> less<00:00:21.640> high<00:00:21.880> relief<00:00:22.300> because<00:00:22.660> the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
slightly less high relief because the

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.509 
slightly less high relief because the
gentleman<00:00:23.410> at<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.529> bottom<00:00:23.920> obviously<00:00:24.369> was

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
gentleman at the bottom obviously was

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.370 
gentleman at the bottom obviously was
much<00:00:24.670> richer<00:00:25.119> because<00:00:25.180> this<00:00:25.390> is<00:00:25.510> going<00:00:25.750> to<00:00:25.840> go

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
much richer because this is going to go

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.529 
much richer because this is going to go
into<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.680> background<00:00:27.160> with<00:00:27.369> Hills<00:00:27.609> coming<00:00:28.420> up
