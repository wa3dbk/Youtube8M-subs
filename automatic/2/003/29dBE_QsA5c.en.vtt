00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.380
 bioclimatic systems for homes in 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.530
 Cold weather 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.570
 the orientation must be taken into account 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.690
 the altitude above sea level 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.060
 the precipitations I lose of side his 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.369
 location according to the rural area or 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.590
 urban presence of buildings 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.720
 neighbors that give shade and so on a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.239
 cold place the ideal is to open towards the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.009
 sun and protected from the winds to 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.290
 be implemented in a climate terrain 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.149
 cold should be oriented the construction of 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.850
 so that receives the most 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.770
 sun throughout the day while 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.380
 high inertia materials are used 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.230
 thermal is to say that they absorb the heat 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.500
 in the day to release it at night there are 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.750
 which isolate is avoided between 25 and 30 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.880
 percent of the energy loss of 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.960
 the whole house 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.820
 recommended isolated to do the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.210
 livable loft and increase the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.960
 comfort reducing energy consumption 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.640
 the soil is avoided between 5% and 10% of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.880
 the loss of energy of the whole house 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.119
 thermally insulate wet areas like 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.939
 cake the bathrooms and kitchens allows to avoid 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.329
 the loss of energy moisture and 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.069
 get better acoustic comfort 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.950
 partition walls partitioning and 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:24.569
 interior walls is avoided between 10% and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.520
 15% of the energy loss isolating 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.189
 thermally we managed to increase the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.700
 thermal and acoustic comfort of the home in 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.560
 preventing wall 20 and 25 percent 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.509
 of the loss of energy helping 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.479
 thermally we managed to increase the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.729
 thermal and acoustic comfort and improve 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.729
 info and permeability of the walls 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.490
 in cold climates the cases need 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.980
 isolate the inhabitants of the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.440
 outside temperature this is achieved with 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.600
 walls made with materials and techniques 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.880
 that produce an enclosure that is a 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.040
 good isolating to achieve an environment 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.650
 inside is isolated from the outside 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.040
 need less heating firewood gas 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.680
 solar kerosene etc to keep us in 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.990
 a healthy temperature to facilitate 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.520
 passive heating with the sun there 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.220
 that guide the bedrooms more 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.740
 used towards the equator line in 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.470
 south america south africa oceania towards the 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.140
 north windows made with profiles 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.730
 of pvc have more insulation 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.250
 thermal energy than those manufactured with 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.190
 materials like aluminum should be 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.590
 to a simple physical law the lower 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.690
 is the thermal conductivity greater than 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.420
 insulation between the materials 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.420
 insulators find wood 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.940
 true 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.030
 concrete 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.090
 the brightness the wall trombe is a system 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.760
 of indirect passive heating is a 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.799
 oriental wall or wall to the sun built 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.379
 with materials that can accumulate heat 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.989
 under the effect of mass allows and a 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.879
 air chamber assembly sheet 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.549
 glass that absorb solar radiation 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.920
 and they heat the internal air effect 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.810
 greenhouse the heat accumulated by the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.750
 wall will be transmitted inside by 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.269
 radiation in addition to the existence of 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.640
 lower and upper openings 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.349
 exterior inside and outside 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.680
 the thermo circulation of the 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.959
 air is created the converted loop or thermos 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.620
 diffusion circulate cold air does 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.830
 of the stay by the trump camera and 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.890
 re-enter the hot instance 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.570
 underfloor heating this is 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.360
 a system that emits heat through 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.400
 of the ground surface the main 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.620
 advantage is that the emission of the 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.170
 heat by radiation that mainly 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.390
 derives from a lower heat loss by 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.850
 the walls ceilings or sun with the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.590
 consequent energy savings for the 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.140
 obtaining the same conditions 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.780
 ticas heat and in the same space 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.700
 you need between 15 and 20 percent 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.250
 less energy in the methods of 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.680
 underfloor heating 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.810
 how the heating works by 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.300
 radiant floor heat occurs 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.820
 under the ground what heats the air 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.430
 interior of the entire room the air 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.040
 hot doing from the roof in this 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.930
 process will heat the entire room 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.780
 also takes advantage of the act factor of 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.940
 Absorption of heat from the human body to 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.610
 release the heat just below the 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.950
 person the body will absorb directly 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.320
 the heat for after heating by 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.360
 underfloor heating depending on the energy 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.190
 they use there are three types of heating 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.409
 by underfloor in the infraction 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.869
 electric 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.879
 heats the system that is under the 

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:43.039
 pavement what heat is produced in 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:45.169
 the heating stand for water 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.599
 hot is the classic system of 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.879
 boilers plus pipes but in this case 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.099
 they are placed under the floor instead 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:54.080
 of radiators from the walls in the 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.360
 carbon fiber extraction is the 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.699
 ultimate heat is transmitted by 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.269
 carbon fiber filaments 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.269
 installed under the floor
