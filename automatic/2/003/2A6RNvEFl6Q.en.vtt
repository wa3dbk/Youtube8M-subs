would<00:04:24.690> love<00:04:24.900> for<00:04:25.310> black<00:04:26.310> ops<00:04:26.340> 2<00:04:26.790> to<00:04:26.970> go<00:04:27.120> back<00:04:27.360> to

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
would love for black ops 2 to go back to

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.630 
would love for black ops 2 to go back to
the<00:04:27.890> no<00:04:28.890> sleight<00:04:29.280> of<00:04:29.310> hand<00:04:29.610> pro<00:04:31.460> system<00:04:32.460> that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
the no sleight of hand pro system that

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.180 
the no sleight of hand pro system that
was<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:33.240> cod4<00:04:33.570> not<00:04:34.110> like<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.500> was<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:34.800> black<00:04:34.950> ops

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
was in cod4 not like it was in black ops

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.240 
was in cod4 not like it was in black ops
1<00:04:35.510> where<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:36.780> had<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:36.990> advanced<00:04:37.650> timing<00:04:38.100> for

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
1 where you had the advanced timing for

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.620 
1 where you had the advanced timing for
the<00:04:38.340> sway<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:40.610> other<00:04:41.610> things<00:04:41.970> like<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.390> i

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
the sway and other things like that i

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.870 
the sway and other things like that i
mean<00:04:42.930> i<00:04:43.110> would<00:04:43.290> love<00:04:43.560> there<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:44.070> not<00:04:44.340> be<00:04:44.610> a

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
mean i would love there to not be a

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.820 
mean i would love there to not be a
sleight<00:04:45.570> of<00:04:45.600> hand<00:04:45.840> pro<00:04:45.930> where<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:46.470> can<00:04:46.650> aim

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
sleight of hand pro where you can aim

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.520 
sleight of hand pro where you can aim
down<00:04:47.010> sight<00:04:47.310> faster<00:04:48.230> something<00:04:49.230> like<00:04:49.380> that

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
down sight faster something like that

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.650 
down sight faster something like that
but<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.740> know<00:04:49.860> there<00:04:50.160> is<00:04:50.190> I<00:04:50.640> know<00:04:50.790> there<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.150> it's

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
but I know there is I know there is it's

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.100 
but I know there is I know there is it's
called<00:04:51.870> speed<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.910> I<00:04:53.910> heard<00:04:54.510> I<00:04:54.810> think<00:04:55.020> from

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
called speed and I heard I think from

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.130 
called speed and I heard I think from
woodysgamertag<00:04:55.440> that<00:04:56.310> speed<00:04:57.120> pro<00:04:57.450> has<00:04:57.810> two

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
woodysgamertag that speed pro has two

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.650 
woodysgamertag that speed pro has two
different<00:04:58.320> effects<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:59.700> can<00:05:00.060> throw

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
different effects you can throw

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.560 
different effects you can throw
equipment<00:05:01.170> faster<00:05:01.560> like<00:05:01.800> quick<00:05:02.010> draw<00:05:02.280> or<00:05:02.640> you

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
equipment faster like quick draw or you

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.900 
equipment faster like quick draw or you
can<00:05:03.840> switch<00:05:04.260> weapons<00:05:04.590> faster<00:05:05.310> like<00:05:05.580> sleight

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
can switch weapons faster like sleight

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.100 
can switch weapons faster like sleight
of<00:05:05.940> hand<00:05:06.240> pro<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:06.960> scout<00:05:07.770> pro<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:09.510> I<00:05:09.780> would

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
of hand pro and scout pro so I would

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.990 
of hand pro and scout pro so I would
probably<00:05:10.700> take<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:12.120> Scout<00:05:12.420> pro<00:05:12.690> effect

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
probably take the Scout pro effect

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.370 
probably take the Scout pro effect
because<00:05:15.000> I<00:05:15.120> get<00:05:15.270> killed<00:05:15.480> all<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:15.840> time<00:05:16.020> trying

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
because I get killed all the time trying

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.870 
because I get killed all the time trying
to<00:05:16.440> switch<00:05:16.650> from<00:05:16.800> one<00:05:17.010> gun<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.520> other<00:05:17.640> when

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
to switch from one gun to the other when

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.420 
to switch from one gun to the other when
they<00:05:17.970> run<00:05:18.150> out<00:05:18.180> of<00:05:18.300> ammo<00:05:18.950> but<00:05:19.950> I<00:05:19.980> would<00:05:20.220> love

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
they run out of ammo but I would love

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.290 
they run out of ammo but I would love
for<00:05:21.230> black<00:05:22.230> ops<00:05:22.410> 2<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:23.070> go<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.550> infinity<00:05:23.880> ward

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
for black ops 2 to go to infinity ward

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
for black ops 2 to go to infinity ward
and<00:05:25.010> figure<00:05:26.010> out<00:05:26.070> how<00:05:26.220> exactly<00:05:27.000> they<00:05:27.300> they<00:05:28.110> did

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
and figure out how exactly they they did

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.500 
and figure out how exactly they they did
the<00:05:28.440> timing<00:05:28.920> for<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.160> cod4<00:05:29.400> sniping<00:05:30.090> system

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
the timing for the cod4 sniping system

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.770 
the timing for the cod4 sniping system
they<00:05:31.050> can't<00:05:31.290> go<00:05:31.440> to<00:05:31.500> bowling<00:05:31.800> anymore<00:05:32.340> I<00:05:32.780> just

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
this game plays a pretty short one I

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.760 
this game plays a pretty short one I
just<00:05:58.050> hope<00:05:58.229> that<00:05:58.400> cod4<00:05:59.400> can<00:05:59.610> come<00:05:59.790> back<00:05:59.970> and

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
just hope that cod4 can come back and

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.659 
just hope that cod4 can come back and
black<00:06:01.770> ops<00:06:02.070> 2<00:06:03.560> doesn't<00:06:04.560> kill<00:06:04.889> sniping<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.550> way

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
black ops 2 doesn't kill sniping the way

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.710 
black ops 2 doesn't kill sniping the way
did<00:06:05.940> in<00:06:06.030> black<00:06:06.210> ops<00:06:06.419> 1<00:06:06.570> I<00:06:07.020> hope<00:06:07.289> Vaughn<00:06:07.620> is<00:06:08.720> he's

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
did in black ops 1 I hope Vaughn is he's

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.180 
did in black ops 1 I hope Vaughn is he's
obviously<00:06:10.050> taking<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.710> lot<00:06:10.860> of<00:06:10.979> feedback

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
obviously taking a lot of feedback

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.370 
obviously taking a lot of feedback
because<00:06:12.090> that's<00:06:12.479> what<00:06:12.630> he<00:06:12.720> does<00:06:12.900> that's<00:06:13.259> like

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
because that's what he does that's like

think<00:06:39.900> the<00:06:40.020> sniping<00:06:40.350> system<00:06:40.740> should<00:06:40.889> be<00:06:40.919> like

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
think the sniping system should be like

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.250 
think the sniping system should be like
in<00:06:41.490> black<00:06:41.729> ops<00:06:41.910> 2<00:06:42.060> if<00:06:42.570> you're<00:06:42.900> even<00:06:43.080> going<00:06:43.199> to

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
in black ops 2 if you're even going to

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.779 
in black ops 2 if you're even going to
get<00:06:43.380> black<00:06:43.650> ops<00:06:43.830> 2<00:06:44.070> do<00:06:44.460> you<00:06:44.550> think<00:06:44.699> it<00:06:44.760> should

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
get black ops 2 do you think it should

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:47.330 
get black ops 2 do you think it should
be<00:06:44.910> like<00:06:45.030> modern<00:06:45.270> warfare<00:06:45.419> 3<00:06:45.570> cod<00:06:46.169> 41<00:06:46.979> or<00:06:47.070> 42

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
be like modern warfare 3 cod 41 or 42

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.790 
be like modern warfare 3 cod 41 or 42
anything<00:06:48.090> like<00:06:48.210> that<00:06:48.240> let<00:06:48.630> me<00:06:49.110> know<00:06:49.199> stay
