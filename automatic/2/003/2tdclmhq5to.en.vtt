00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.899 

cool<00:00:00.659> so<00:00:01.140> let's<00:00:01.170> not<00:00:01.650> waste<00:00:01.709> time<00:00:02.070> we've<00:00:02.610> got<00:00:02.850> a

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
cool so let's not waste time we've got a

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.480 
cool so let's not waste time we've got a
fragment<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.570> lost<00:00:03.810> knowledge<00:00:04.020> 65<00:00:04.950> or<00:00:05.279> like

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
fragment of lost knowledge 65 or like

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.120 
fragment of lost knowledge 65 or like
eighty<00:00:05.700> five<00:00:05.879> percent<00:00:05.940> chance<00:00:06.359> correct

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.130 
eighty five percent chance correct

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.089 
eighty five percent chance correct
stabilize<00:00:08.210> singularity<00:00:09.210> cool<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:10.019> we'll<00:00:10.860> just

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
stabilize singularity cool so we'll just

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.400 
stabilize singularity cool so we'll just
get<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.400> going<00:00:11.639> quickly<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
get that going quickly and the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.340 
get that going quickly and the
stabilized<00:00:13.860> singularity<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.610> pretty<00:00:15.150> cool<00:00:15.599> so

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
stabilized singularity is pretty cool so

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.029 
stabilized singularity is pretty cool so
I<00:00:16.710> kind<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.070> wait<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.250> show<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:18.770> yeah<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
I kind of wait to show you that yeah and

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.420 
I kind of wait to show you that yeah and
I'll<00:00:20.369> see<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.640> understand<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:22.010> there<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.220> go

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
I'll see you understand and there we go

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.720 
I'll see you understand and there we go
stabilize<00:00:24.119> singularity<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> there<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:26.699> go

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
stabilize singularity so there we go

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.089 
stabilize singularity so there we go
this<00:00:27.150> upgrade<00:00:27.539> increases<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.410> efficiency<00:00:28.800> of

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
this upgrade increases the efficiency of

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.370 
this upgrade increases the efficiency of
any<00:00:29.640> devices<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.330> thormann<00:00:30.660> creations<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.260> is

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
any devices or thormann creations it is

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.930 
any devices or thormann creations it is
attached<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.160> another<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.640> our

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
attached to so it's another one of our

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.250 
attached to so it's another one of our
little<00:00:33.000> upgrades<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.290> put<00:00:34.559> over<00:00:35.360> here<00:00:36.360> so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
little upgrades that we put over here so

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
little upgrades that we put over here so
we've<00:00:37.410> got<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.590> quicksilver<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.000> both

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
we've got that quicksilver one and both

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.170 
we've got that quicksilver one and both
of<00:00:39.300> these<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.579> yeah<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> pretty<00:00:41.820> much<00:00:41.910> works

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
of these and yeah it pretty much works

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.729 
of these and yeah it pretty much works
the<00:00:42.390> same<00:00:42.420> way<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.960> we're<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.290> an<00:00:43.350> Earthling

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the same way so we're get an Earthling

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.910 
the same way so we're get an Earthling
crystal<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.640> cane<00:00:44.969> singularity<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.110> don't

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
crystal and I cane singularity and don't

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.529 
crystal and I cane singularity and don't
slam<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:49.520> everything<00:00:50.520> crystal<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.300> no<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
slam so everything crystal in here no I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.170 
slam so everything crystal in here no I
don't<00:00:51.899> that's<00:00:52.739> okay<00:00:52.890> we'll<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.579> grab<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
don't that's okay we'll just grab a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.500 
don't that's okay we'll just grab a
quick<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.570> over<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:55.550> its<00:00:56.550> head<00:00:56.789> stone<00:00:57.180> slab

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
quick one over here its head stone slab

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.459 
quick one over here its head stone slab
as<00:00:57.690> well<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> those<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:00.410> what<00:01:01.410> was

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
as well so get one of those and what was

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
as well so get one of those and what was
the<00:01:01.530> other<00:01:01.649> thing<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.489> arcane<00:01:03.120> singularity

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the other thing the arcane singularity

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.670 
the other thing the arcane singularity
so<00:01:04.290> where<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.240> go<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:07.470> we

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
so where is there there you go and we

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.050 
so where is there there you go and we
just<00:01:07.710> pop<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.729> any<00:01:08.970> other

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
just pop that in just like any other

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.950 
just pop that in just like any other
thing<00:01:09.710> no<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.640> again<00:01:12.630> doesn't

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
thing no not that one and again doesn't

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.660 
thing no not that one and again doesn't
matter<00:01:13.200> where<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.400> long<00:01:14.430> as

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
matter where they go just so long as

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.390 
matter where they go just so long as
they<00:01:15.000> are<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.570> together<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.369> go

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
they are there together so there you go

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.249 
they are there together so there you go
stabilize<00:01:18.090> singularity<00:01:18.720> improves

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
stabilize singularity improves

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.140 
stabilize singularity improves
efficiency<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.840> compare<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
efficiency so if we compare that to

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.899 
efficiency so if we compare that to
whereas<00:01:24.150> our<00:01:24.330> other<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:25.759> where<00:01:26.759> as

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
whereas our other one where as

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.109 
whereas our other one where as
Quicksilver<00:01:27.470> bad<00:01:28.470> improved<00:01:29.430> speed<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.970> one

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
Quicksilver bad improved speed this one

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.999 
Quicksilver bad improved speed this one
grooves<00:01:30.509> efficiency<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.619> I'm<00:01:31.710> not<00:01:31.860> actually

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
grooves efficiency so I'm not actually

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.990 
grooves efficiency so I'm not actually
sure<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.460> differences<00:01:32.970> between<00:01:33.000> those<00:01:35.000> but

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
sure the differences between those but

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.620 
sure the differences between those but
who<00:01:36.299> knows<00:01:36.710> ok<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:39.479> out<00:01:41.540> am<00:01:42.540> i

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
who knows ok so if I just take out am i

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.200 
who knows ok so if I just take out am i
able<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.899> take<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:44.360> maybe<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:47.210> well

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
able to take that one it maybe not well

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.230 
able to take that one it maybe not well
I'm<00:01:48.780> sure<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.560> i<00:01:49.860> take<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.250> down<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.939> will<00:01:51.119> be

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
I'm sure if i take it down it will be

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.370 
I'm sure if i take it down it will be
fine<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:53.360> there<00:01:54.360> go<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.840> took<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
fine so there go it took out the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.350 
fine so there go it took out the
crystals<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:55.950> me<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.880> took<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.180> our

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
crystals for me and it took out our

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.170 
crystals for me and it took out our
Quicksilver<00:01:58.259> core<00:01:58.530> no<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> didn't<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.969> lost

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
Quicksilver core no it didn't we lost

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.240 
Quicksilver core no it didn't we lost
that<00:02:00.299> one<00:02:00.479> oh<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.350> very<00:02:01.500> careful<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.040> him

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that one oh so be very careful with him

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.940 
that one oh so be very careful with him
and<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.119> put<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.420> our<00:02:03.600> kin<00:02:04.079> singularity<00:02:04.770> one

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and we put in our kin singularity one

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.770 
and we put in our kin singularity one
and<00:02:05.750> yeah<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.200> improves<00:02:07.350> efficiency<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and yeah so it improves efficiency so

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.839 
and yeah so it improves efficiency so
cool<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.069> positive<00:02:11.370> or<00:02:11.670> negative

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
cool if you have a positive or negative
