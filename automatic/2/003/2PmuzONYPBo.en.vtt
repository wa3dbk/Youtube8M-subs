thing<00:02:33.730> upside<00:02:34.209> down<00:02:34.540> like<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:35.160> by<00:02:36.160> feeling

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
thing upside down like this by feeling

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.920 
thing upside down like this by feeling
the<00:02:37.000> top<00:02:37.269> hat<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:38.290> Box<00:02:38.560> bottom<00:02:39.459> half<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
the top hat the Box bottom half of the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.080 
the top hat the Box bottom half of the
whole<00:02:41.140> piece<00:02:41.470> it's<00:02:42.100> supposed<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.640> be<00:02:42.760> thinner

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
whole piece it's supposed to be thinner

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.930 
whole piece it's supposed to be thinner
and<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:44.170> difference<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.769> only<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.610> bottom

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
and the difference is only on the bottom

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.289 
and the difference is only on the bottom
on<00:02:46.269> top<00:02:46.690> it's<00:02:47.019> just<00:02:47.080> one<00:02:47.530> smooth<00:02:47.980> piece<00:02:48.340> but<00:02:49.150> at

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
on top it's just one smooth piece but at

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.880 
on top it's just one smooth piece but at
the<00:02:49.420> bottom<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.810> can<00:02:49.989> feel<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> difference<00:02:50.680> in

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
the bottom you can feel a difference in

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.710 
the bottom you can feel a difference in
thickness<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.549> top<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:52.060> thicker<00:02:52.360> than<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
thickness the top is thicker than the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.380 
thickness the top is thicker than the
bottom<00:02:53.080> so<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:53.799> part<00:02:54.250> has<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.430> face<00:02:54.790> down<00:02:55.060> and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
bottom so that part has to face down and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.840 
bottom so that part has to face down and
thus<00:02:55.630> most<00:02:55.810> parts<00:02:56.230> face<00:02:56.410> is<00:02:56.620> up<00:02:56.799> now<00:02:57.549> another

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
thus most parts face is up now another

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.850 
thus most parts face is up now another
position<00:02:58.299> for<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.600> piece<00:02:58.900> put<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.320> down<00:02:59.560> for

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
position for that piece put it down for

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.120 
position for that piece put it down for
now

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
now

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.210 
now
and<00:03:01.510> same<00:03:02.510> thing<00:03:02.540> with<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.950> top<00:03:04.250> has<00:03:05.000> a

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
and same thing with this the top has a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.510 
and same thing with this the top has a
thicker<00:03:10.360> line<00:03:11.360> or<00:03:11.780> piece<00:03:12.590> than<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.190> bottom

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
thicker line or piece than the bottom

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.680 
thicker line or piece than the bottom
half<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:15.160> in<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.340> case<00:03:16.670> that's<00:03:17.090> supposed<00:03:17.540> to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
half so in this case that's supposed to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.870 
half so in this case that's supposed to
face<00:03:17.870> up<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.740> bottom<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.100> supposed<00:03:19.490> to<00:03:19.670> be

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
face up and the bottom is supposed to be

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.530 
face up and the bottom is supposed to be
just<00:03:20.810> one<00:03:21.800> piece<00:03:22.100> smooth<00:03:22.760> piece<00:03:23.320> so<00:03:24.320> also<00:03:25.540> you

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
just one piece smooth piece so also you

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.960 
just one piece smooth piece so also you
can<00:03:26.750> see<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:26.960> at<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.710> top<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.550> has<00:03:28.730> two

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
can see that at the top it has two

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.140 
can see that at the top it has two
sticks<00:03:29.300> going<00:03:29.600> inward<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:30.370> at<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.520> bottom<00:03:31.910> it

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
sticks going inward and at the bottom it

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.470 
sticks going inward and at the bottom it
has<00:03:32.210> two<00:03:33.140> sticks<00:03:33.560> going<00:03:33.860> outwards<00:03:34.520> the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
has two sticks going outwards the

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.750 
has two sticks going outwards the
largest<00:03:36.050> sticks<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.950> are<00:03:37.010> at<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.310> bottom<00:03:37.640> in

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
largest sticks that are at the bottom in

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.670 
largest sticks that are at the bottom in
this<00:03:37.910> case<00:03:38.380> have<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.620> go<00:03:40.510> wherever<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.960> two

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
this case have to go wherever the two

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.410 
this case have to go wherever the two
small<00:03:42.980> hooks<00:03:43.370> are<00:03:43.640> in<00:03:43.790> this<00:03:43.880> case<00:03:44.120> there<00:03:44.330> at

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
small hooks are in this case there at

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.420 
small hooks are in this case there at
the<00:03:44.510> bottom<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.200> we<00:03:45.380> face<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.800> sticks<00:03:46.100> at<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
the bottom so we face the sticks at the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.090 
the bottom so we face the sticks at the
bottom<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.780> middle<00:03:48.110> there's<00:03:48.680> two

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
bottom and in the middle there's two

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.130 
bottom and in the middle there's two
holes<00:03:49.730> for<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.330> sticks<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:50.720> are<00:03:50.870> in<00:03:51.050> the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
holes for the sticks that are in the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.200 
holes for the sticks that are in the
middle<00:03:51.440> this<00:03:51.650> large<00:03:52.280> piece<00:03:52.550> are<00:03:52.760> going<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.030> go

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
middle this large piece are going to go

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.460 
middle this large piece are going to go
into<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:54.500> what<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:54.770> want<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.010> do<00:03:55.250> is<00:03:56.290> put<00:03:57.290> the
