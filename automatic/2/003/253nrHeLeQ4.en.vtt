00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 good to all welcome to the channel today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.910
 we are here to talk about the new 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.490
 generation of video game consoles like all 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.010
 you know that with the xbox 720 and the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.889
 playstation 4 I have not just found 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.809
 new information on these we are going to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.910
 start with playstation 4 the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.800
 playstation 4 of the moment has about 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.230
 errors that are quite serious for me 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 because to play let 's PlayStation 4 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.220
 to have to buy TVs 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.289
 4k which are those that have been 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.380
 presented in the ces de las vegas as 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.000
 I told you no and besides, at the moment they are 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.010
 suffering from problems 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.660
 overheating of these decided you 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.670
 are putting too much pressure you 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.040
 they are putting too much force so that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.739
 the games are in good quality and it's 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.760
 all it does is overheat 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.039
 we are also seeing that they are 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.590
 changing the name is a name that that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.559
 now he has changed to omni is not like ya 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.180
 I said it not now going to be omni the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.579
 true that the name until it comes out 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.809
 we will not know 100% but if what 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.489
 we know are other 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.170
 characteristics also what it looks like 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.219
 that they are putting the batteries are 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.350
 putting the batteries against the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.030
 launch had said that it was going to 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.830
 launch at Christmas and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.810
 and it will be safe to be launched 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.670
 Christmas but rumors are coming out 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 that are going to come out a little before not 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 will go about September more or less and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.549
 is going to start releasing it so that 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.490
 Christmas is the most on the other hand 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.920
 that every time we are seeing that the xbox 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.659
 It is increasingly boom will not be 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.820
 an xbox for me is going to be a console 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.060
 perfect with music like that so 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.729
 we are seeing is going to be a system of 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.380
 384 bits when playstation 4 goes to 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:41.550
 be about 256 and this is to say the xbox 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.110
 will be able to store 500 gb of 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.500
 data per second is to say a 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.869
 brutality the speed of gpu be 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.060
 still superior for what was said to 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.850
 power in terms of what it is 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.819
 playstation 4 is also being said 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.590
 that is going to get what is pixel inside 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.869
 of xbox that is going to have something to do 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.190
 and we are going to be able to see your movies 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.319
 it's about not being able to see your 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.119
 movies in high quality and they go to 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.280
 try to improve everything that is this 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.459
 referring also as we already know 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.020
 will allow to recreate lighting effects 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.880
 sound 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.530
 much you make with Illuminator 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.690
 since they took out also in the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.070
 cesar vega what is that you get of all 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.290
 the room with a projector 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.940
 special glasses and obviously that 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.000
 buy a special TV to be able to 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.980
 play with these characteristics something 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.080
 bad is that not all studies are going to 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.110
 to be able to work at the moment with the games 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.570
 of xbox because they are going to need to work 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.280
 with different and unique graphics engines 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.570
 for this console that will make it so 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.120
 special as we are seeing that it's going to 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.110
 be brutal with music but as we have already 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.180
 said earlier 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.780
 the features have also come out 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.380
 techniques already almost completely defined from 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.270
 what will be playstation 4 and xbox 720 and 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.100
 let's see what version 4 we started 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.650
 out there he's going to have an apu with a 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.360
 fast gpu ie for 4 gb of 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.760
 ram memory ddr3 4 gb gddr5 spill is 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.310
 say having 4 gigs dedicated to what 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.920
 is the graphics card plus the cpu back 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:17.020
 is a cpu system is a system of 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.350
 86 cores and with a 256- bit capable 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.010
 from 3.2 data flops we went to what 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.870
 is xbox 720 of 3 soc system on chip is 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.760
 a method of combining all the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.100
 processing functions cpu gpu be 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.250
 etcetera in a console for certain 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.650
 Venusian socket models mars 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.050
 approximately 8 gigas of ram 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.410
 let's go from 4 how it's going to be 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.739
 more or less playstation 4 to have 8 is 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.260
 say double and 11 whole dedicated to 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.090
 operating system will also have a 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.730
 m of 8mm as I said it has not yet 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.680
 gone up a bit more like I said 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.640
 and now it looks like it's going to be 8000 series 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.890
 800 850 that will be a graphics card 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.080
 of 4 cores that seems to be for me 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:08.190
 something somewhat inaccessible and a cpu to 600 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.220
 thousand exercises with 1.8 gigahertz is 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.750
 a system of 86 cores the prices go 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.450
 to be very very tall and I had already said 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.669
 that were going to be low more or less I 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.760
 what I did was to convert currency not 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.580
 from dollar to euro but for that it will be 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.250
 so it's going to start for 300 dollars it's 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.050
 talking between 300 and 350 dollars and a 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.229
 happen like this for all that is to say they are going to be 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.479
 300 350 euros approximately 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.460
 the cheap version of this xbox that by 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.710
 what we are seeing is going to be brutal in 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.840
 change in the 3 in 4 is going to be quite 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.520
 more expensive since it is not financed as 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.470
 'those also in the microsoft console 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.240
 is funded because we 're going to 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.680
 have to pay as always the live is 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.750
 say the internet to play 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.030
 online and that's why it's going to be a little bit 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.520
 valued so that the expense is not so 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.400
 so big instead in the x instead 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.540
 PlayStation 4 will leave around 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.570
 600 as 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.880
 saying for many places soon 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.070
 is to start hanging links of everything that 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.020
 I'm saying so you can see that I'm not 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.090
 I'm making but so far no 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.040
 I can hang it I hope everything and 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.510
 as soon as you know something more of these 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.670
 news that seems to be quite 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.320
 quite true one hundred percent 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.090
 I went up of them I will inform you many thanks to 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.820
 I hope you like the videos 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.120
 subscribe and like and many favorites 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.120
 Thank you
