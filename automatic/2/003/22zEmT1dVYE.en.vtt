unit and indeed transfer the torque from

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.510 
unit and indeed transfer the torque from

and<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:21.170> way<00:01:21.320> does<00:01:21.620> this<00:01:21.800> is<00:01:22.100> within<00:01:22.580> the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
and the way does this is within the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.400 
and the way does this is within the
power<00:01:23.150> transfer<00:01:23.690> unit<00:01:24.050> we<00:01:24.200> have<00:01:24.380> a

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
power transfer unit we have a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.040 
power transfer unit we have a
synchronizer<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.300> gives<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.690> ability

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
synchronizer and that gives the ability

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.620 
synchronizer and that gives the ability
to<00:01:27.100> disconnect<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.580> drive<00:01:29.090> at<00:01:29.479> the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
to disconnect the drive at the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.810 
to disconnect the drive at the
transmission<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:30.470> then<00:01:31.040> in<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.340> real<00:01:31.520> drive

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
transmission and then in the real drive

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.240 
transmission and then in the real drive
unit<00:01:32.270> instead<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:32.810> having<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.170> differential<00:01:33.770> we
