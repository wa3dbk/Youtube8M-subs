00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
 very cool tutorial I found on

 find cool things to do video and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.739
 As you have seen, the title is a painting. 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.149
 with effective wax chalk is very easy 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.969
 to do is coolest are you make up 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.070
 things because so only today in the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.260
 picture does not have grace israel but do not go the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.420
 then usually has 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.030
 people do this work of art they 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.310
 take a picture of someone holding a 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.470
 umbrella and then when you melt 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.030
 said you do not let him catch you 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.860
 Rain on the drawing, right? 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.450
 no space under the umbrella and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.160
 It's cool for this tactical chapter in 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.140
 but it will not look almost 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.910
 disk will pick up the image 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.340
 I also did it only who has only one 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.720
 person do not know the passer and holding a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.880
 umbrella that a strong image in the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.789

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.859

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.289

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.480
 painting of any size in case 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.370
 I'm using one of ink for 40 days of 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.540
 being a school can be thick 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.280
 size you want 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.350
 the image you are going to use on your board 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.209
 if you do not use or need and then 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.060
 a senator who has the mode function 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.219
 hot and also hot glue 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.219
 [Music] 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.760
 it will be your screen and then you will do 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.099
 endanger color gradients or in the case of 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:04:06.519
 rainbow then red orange yellow 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:04:08.200
 green will follow as I will use a 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.000
 image I have to prevent the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.900
 institutes to be run where this 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.180
 image will stay 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.129
 so I cut a sulfite sheet from the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.900
 size of my image occupying all 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.660
 the space even under the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.639
 Umbrella and then I glued it with glue 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.440
 even the entire edge of the sheet to 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.850
 avoid the dark ink inside and 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.560
 No problem, then it's just 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.060
 pull puts people talk site later 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.460
 comes the coolest part is to put the 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.169
 dryer with hot air in the days around 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.470
 10 second shopkeepers already 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.470

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.169
 won the fauna and flora 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.169
 [Music] 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.869
 And feeling better. 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:55.779
 without him already when I went with my 

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:58.449
 image I see that kagame is because I 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:59.770
 I put a lot of liquid glue and the image 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.749
 cable became excited afterwards. 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.879
 put another image on top and then I used it 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:05.649
 How do you stick your stick? 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.719
 bat is because there will not take place 

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:09.459
 Did you see in the comic I made a game in the 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:11.819
 internet for making me rabbit has a 

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.819
 drawing 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.769

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:42.169

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.879
 there is only one thing is the image that I 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.919
 had glued it with liquid glue 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:50.719
 only it was released then 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:52.969
 prints and pasted another image for 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:55.159
 Up there and there it was always right, it always has 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:56.629
 changed then put glue stick to 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.129
