details<00:03:31.310> I<00:03:31.790> think<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.570> reason<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.200> has<00:03:33.230> it

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
details I think the reason is it has it

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.740 
details I think the reason is it has it
hasn't<00:03:33.770> been<00:03:33.860> done<00:03:34.010> yet<00:03:34.070> is<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.940> mean<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.330> for<00:03:35.630> one

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
hasn't been done yet is I mean I for one

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.590 
hasn't been done yet is I mean I for one
think<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.490> bit<00:03:37.880> premature<00:03:38.030> I've<00:03:38.330> only<00:03:38.480> got

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
think it's a bit premature I've only got

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.090 
think it's a bit premature I've only got
four<00:03:38.810> comics<00:03:39.170> out<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.560> think<00:03:39.740> I'll<00:03:39.920> feel<00:03:40.010> a

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
four comics out I think I'll feel a

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.890 
four comics out I think I'll feel a
little<00:03:40.220> better<00:03:40.340> when<00:03:40.520> I<00:03:40.580> have<00:03:40.700> 12<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.240> and

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
little better when I have 12 and and

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.930 
little better when I have 12 and and
I've<00:03:42.140> got<00:03:42.350> more<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.620> grip<00:03:42.800> on<00:03:42.950> it<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.670> think

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
I've got more of a grip on it I think

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.180 
I've got more of a grip on it I think
but<00:03:44.240> I<00:03:44.300> think<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.630> think<00:03:44.810> you're<00:03:45.190> guaranteed

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190

could take a while but I think you know
we're<00:04:01.430> very<00:04:01.459> fortunate<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.360> kind

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
we're very fortunate that that that kind

of that attention has been turned on us

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.650 
of that attention has been turned on us
now<00:04:04.310> it's<00:04:04.459> just<00:04:04.520> a<00:04:04.670> figuring<00:04:05.300> out<00:04:05.390> what<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.570> do

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
now it's just a figuring out what to do

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.170 
now it's just a figuring out what to do
with<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.930> is<00:04:06.200> it<00:04:06.530> just<00:04:06.770> us<00:04:07.040> or<00:04:07.370> does<00:04:07.760> anyone

with it is it just us or does anyone

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.420 
with it is it just us or does anyone
else<00:04:08.390> get<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.720> feeling<00:04:08.750> Rob<00:04:09.470> Liefeld<00:04:09.740> could
