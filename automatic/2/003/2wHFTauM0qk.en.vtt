00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.840
 Hello the up to what are you doing 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.959
 Hall and Brooks Eva I'm the cooler of 12designer 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.339
 if you do not know what makes 12designer 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.509
 all twelve designers first place from the marketplace for design and vertex 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.460
 surprised us a bit 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.199
 and if you design it as a client, for example, a Christmas card 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.619
 Even big shots have project costs 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.939
 He then travels to our ten thousand designers and the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.789
 enough for you to the line Leading the Rain back to normal 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.150
 Market Square Wüstner 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.690
 but a marketplace I go with offered a say "that one 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.319
 changed the price but 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:44.329
 They make their concrete proposals for the price you set before 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.230
 is 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.430
 there are two 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.160
 You look right as a client holding so you might look in a skater 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.550
 can choose between different designs GEZE people feedback and this 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430
 of course, exactly what he buys 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.020
 so all do not know the cuts because they have to go to the SPD I have one 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.270
 Task to assign as I custom only as a cartoon logon webdesign there 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.269
 press down community makes it so over it 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.400
 exactly one holds more users not pure infected designers but 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.460
 a lot of designers out there in Parow couple are registered with us and 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.510
 If the order is interesting for you 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.750
 how earned money 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.960
 the poster spreads of such contract costs that 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.000
 and there Costa 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.310
 Walter Kasper costs around 24 euros normal project as many as you can 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.670
 Join designers 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.049
 or from a Priener category everyone can only reach those of the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.049
 Did the project experience in the morning cost Hamas 60 euros 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.010
 and what else do I have to do with sales? 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.410
 more so we have arm to about 52 projects a month 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.150
 and Kraus can figure out that we are about 5,000 euros at the time 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.050
 earn and start at 2 we look forward to more police more without 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.560
 In addition, nobody protects us who have earned the big ones 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.220
 Lizards and spoilsport 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.820
 in the sense that I am very sympathetic financed by the satiated 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.010
 get to the west 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.790
 January will be 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.600
 and from the beginning the west of Grupo Intercom come down to incubators 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.550
 Barcelona 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.799
 and they also wanted to be in the German market 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.430
 and craft designers and Dr Dr with our pledges now only 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.619
 Two more escalations found 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.309
 and Hannes opens its Berlin office 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.819
 already unusual how it came to us that we are looking for Basel or Basel 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.059
 Product up games 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:28.430
 yes it was in the end what in total coincidence so poor extent of annually with it 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.469
 considered and wanted to finance our bosses CD 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.949
 Hamilton just talked about the duck to group 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:38.629
 Intercom clock changes were underway for internationalization 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.400
 It was smart and of course Bittner today at exactly the right time 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.799
 Idea came the group then came well and, so to speak, even Northern Europe 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.869
 wanted to expand under 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.909
 to get offenders no funding 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.959
 satisfied and how much had 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.379
 definitely satisfied her arm because pretty much so on 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.209
 Trust and values ​​our continued and is called around the formulation 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.209
 one percent 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.380
 six-figure 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.729
 into consideration 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:09.119
 very good - Christmas cards salzburgischen action because otherwise 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:11.039
 connects if I spe with logo 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.349
 The Christmas Cards puts them all in a bit of advertising for 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.039
 because the company 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:19.719
 boring Steiner cards but we send the products of course on 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.109
 works best 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.799
 Logo of this one world s dirty one gets also a whole 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.079
 Series of submissions so that get the contest for the prize money 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.739
 one also somehow between 50 100 suggestions from which one select 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.459
 can 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.129
 she also does name-finding because he knows how to promote Lisa 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.099
 my name is partly difficult 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.639
 which domains in the open as they of course such 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.180
 out of the competitor Hofi Deloitte ideas submit Musou Versace because the 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.389
 Data different background of an experience and 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.329
 Elena Diversity comes to Steiners through this other approach 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.829
 whose you can choose 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.829
 that costs the average if you go through a logo in Belfort 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.189
 as I think so while traveling to Europe he is traveling for the designer logo 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.409
 Competition states and on average 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.870
 I guess there is something exaggerating Euro has people 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.419
 output 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.759
 Some against 1500 Euro so we have a price without 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:17.639
 say no one should already invest a meeting of the euro in a good duo invest 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.840
 But leave the price decision to the customer of course, even 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.939
 It has to be considered how attractive his project is 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.929
 The sympathetic Cameron and I are for diarrhea companies the Rocker 

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:28.580
 quarter-hour says evolved 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.210
 Kumpf and can be great if times targeted by imagined 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.210
 So far, I think there are four women on the winter-wm surfaces so 5 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.319
 why is that so few women founding and how do you see that 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.050
 m i was his asking 2010 open women question 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.659
 no idea so I do not know any light whole four more founders 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.229
 I do not remember anymore 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.909
 That also means that it's easy to not have gender-specific affairs either 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.300
 then he has like the court test founded idea and also finds money 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.189
 to or financed by yourself 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:01.779
 inconsistently 

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.949
 if you already have such a little macho or a house with 200 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.949
 This is also about everyday life often 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:08.969
 namely not at all 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:10.629
 to this the sins 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:12.379
 No, unfortunately not necessary 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.949
 unnamed industrial engineer studies and then not every day 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.389
 a driver worked year 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.659
 Concept made and around 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.319
 yes strategies 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.749
 Pebbles provide many animals with how much they earn how much they get 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:26.860
 do what she offers what it costs 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.460
 Vienna I think it's basically very cool again the logo has been through 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.460
 a little bit of German to splurge Sulzemoos rings 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.020
 Mehrzad likes to sing 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.669
 and next year 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.830
 two more language versions starts so we are so to speak 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.060
 the European on the way so who are at German English has me 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.060
 At the beginning of it again hy-line punch so hours spanish 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.219
 and Jena would like to establish Thuringia in some markets and before 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.810
 all the old principle that one 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.680
 so also in this one can find out parents because 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.970
 At the moment, people still think its never enough 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.189
 he is also a good way 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.659
 Feeder of many things right now you can hear on the internet is there 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:09.409
 People know how to handle the design template 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:12.520
 and that it's easy to keep up a quick way somehow a lot of cool 

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:16.259
 Ideas to come from, therefore, keep on doing what we do and 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.819
 just grow with it 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.590
 Okan PostScript still earmarked says clone compare to this concern 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.950
 to refer to them in the land registers Idec Inc 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.470
 It is important that the people in this 1 2 1 0 Hesse Praise Herne Beat Gafner die 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.219
 Be a nanny 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:32.849
 all the wind of the fantasy percent no we have 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:36.599
 A difference all around when I had the idea at that time can do that too 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.240
 Astonishingly not yet confessed as before, then that was 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.479
 Mann did not show Walch enough 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.080
 and we're doing a whole bunch of things differently. " 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.080
 Thread name finding introduced to Steve Hooker from Australia 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:51.919
 Mutton on the principle of judgment 12designer that we have such a 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:55.919
 Project Contest has only twelve designers submit their designs 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:00.109
 in order to make it easier for the client to make the trade easier 

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:02.219
 normal projects emerges 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:05.529
 more accurate designer more pure and there sits then you already have that 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.309
 Problem that one is almost flooded 

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:10.300
 good very good as patriots can 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.619
 thanks to Milene awful good luck and around 

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:15.240
 then I want to sing 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.240
 Because she may not want it or her mother 

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:22.059
 okay otherwise, after ninth are the fans want to do 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.750
 PI and Peter g of IFA for the interview, of course, a lot of success 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:28.439
 annoying
