00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.030 
remember my review of Green Lantern it
was<00:03:14.970> similar<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.480> started<00:03:15.870> great<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.410> faltered

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
was similar it started great it faltered

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.949 
was similar it started great it faltered
it<00:03:17.310> crashed<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.209> managed<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.510> come

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
it crashed and then it managed to come

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.160 
it crashed and then it managed to come
back<00:03:19.110> at<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.380> end<00:03:19.520> but<00:03:20.520> after<00:03:21.450> repeated<00:03:21.930> views

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
back at the end but after repeated views

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.870 
back at the end but after repeated views
I<00:03:22.320> think<00:03:22.350> four<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:23.010> little<00:03:23.310> bit<00:03:23.400> better<00:03:23.580> and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
I think four is a little bit better and

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.030 
I think four is a little bit better and
it<00:03:24.300> lends<00:03:24.540> itself<00:03:24.660> more<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.290> second<00:03:25.709> viewing

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
it lends itself more to a second viewing

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.640 
it lends itself more to a second viewing
this<00:03:26.670> is<00:03:26.940> due<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.450> stronger<00:03:27.900> performances

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
this is due to the stronger performances

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.430 
this is due to the stronger performances
and<00:03:28.860> more<00:03:29.100> cohesive<00:03:29.490> script<00:03:30.000> Thor<00:03:30.780> has<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.080> few

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
and more cohesive script Thor has a few

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.140 
and more cohesive script Thor has a few
moments<00:03:31.920> where<00:03:32.070> it's<00:03:32.220> more<00:03:32.400> like<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.610> TV<00:03:33.120> show

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
moments where it's more like a TV show

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.600 
moments where it's more like a TV show
than<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:33.690> movie<00:03:34.050> but<00:03:34.800> then<00:03:34.980> when<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.220> awesome

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
than a movie but then when the awesome

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.100 
than a movie but then when the awesome
stuff<00:03:35.730> happens<00:03:36.240> at<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.480> end<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.750> basically

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
stuff happens at the end you basically

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.720 
stuff happens at the end you basically
forget<00:03:37.500> about<00:03:37.620> all<00:03:37.860> that<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> have<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.610> say

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
forget about all that so I have to say

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.670 
forget about all that so I have to say
this<00:03:38.880> one's<00:03:39.120> pretty<00:03:39.360> damn<00:03:39.660> good<00:03:39.840> I'm<00:03:40.380> feeling

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
this one's pretty damn good I'm feeling

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.860 
this one's pretty damn good I'm feeling
generous<00:03:41.160> so<00:03:41.400> I'm<00:03:41.820> going<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.270> give<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.510> an<00:03:42.630> 8

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
generous so I'm going to give it an 8

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.410 
generous so I'm going to give it an 8
out<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:43.110> 10
