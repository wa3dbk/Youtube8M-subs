I'm<00:03:03.230> going<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.800> start<00:03:04.040> on<00:03:04.160> my<00:03:04.250> temples<00:03:04.640> and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
I'm going to start on my temples and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.130 
I'm going to start on my temples and
work<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.120> down<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.480> my<00:03:05.570> cheekbones<00:03:06.020> the

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
work that down to my cheekbones the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.170 
work that down to my cheekbones the
reason<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.530> am<00:03:06.680> applying<00:03:07.040> my<00:03:07.370> blush<00:03:07.580> so<00:03:07.790> high<00:03:07.970> as

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
reason I am applying my blush so high as

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.420 
reason I am applying my blush so high as
because<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:09.140> gives<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.530> illusion<00:03:09.590> of<00:03:10.040> higher

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
because it gives the illusion of higher

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.360 
because it gives the illusion of higher
cheekbones<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:12.140> just<00:03:12.920> think<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.190> looks

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
cheekbones and I just think it looks

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.130 
cheekbones and I just think it looks
more<00:03:13.550> natural<00:03:13.610> rather<00:03:14.210> than<00:03:14.420> putting<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:14.930> in

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
more natural rather than putting it in

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.900 
more natural rather than putting it in
the<00:03:15.530> lower<00:03:15.740> areas<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.400> your<00:03:16.520> cheek<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:16.850> I'm
