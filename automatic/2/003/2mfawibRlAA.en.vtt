00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.870
 well this is another a new tutorial in 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.940
 the one that teaches them how to download and 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.860
 install the amero class is from the series 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.270
 from minecraft I just was 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.789
 testing in maine 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.640
 pocket edition and for more is not 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.980
 installed in the lesson but hey this one 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.019
 'not the Krafft as you may notice is very 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.849
 similar to what is minecraft is 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.249
 install as any sin and what 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.619
 open and create your monolith I'm going to 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.290
 show what starts from here 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.690
 because being a little bit in charge for 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.220
 that's how they see me it runs very well very 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.720
 fluid does not get stuck or anything 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.630
 here I was playing a little 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.220
 and good as I remove the game 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.710
 description of the video with one that 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.750
 flame warcraft this is not he does not know 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.050
 he taught them this time because he is very 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.820
 similar simply that here in these 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.760
 little squares of us that we have here 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.090
 but also in the same way I leave 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.100
 for you to install it 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.410
 and good as they are going to remove in the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 presentation so that they see that 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.650
 if it works that good to me it runs very 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.330
 well it does not run with me that nothing 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.330
 and well let's go out 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.600
 6 go wyk and good as you see here is 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.710
 If you want to create a new world blend 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.229
 anemia and here tell them 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.290
 excuse me and here they put the name 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.920
 that you like here, delete here and 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:43.940
 they write the name 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:47.270
 and in this ninth edition and well this is 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.670
 all just to show you how it's done 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.260
 very well but here they are and the other one that 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.840
 It called seek equality to the 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.700
 best I say are very similar and good 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.370
