00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.499 
so I actually gave up using the needle
tool<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.500> decided<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.039> use<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.369> pair<00:01:51.820> of<00:01:51.850> these

tool and decided to use a pair of these
tweezers<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.070> much<00:01:54.280> much<00:01:54.550> more<00:01:54.850> easier

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240
