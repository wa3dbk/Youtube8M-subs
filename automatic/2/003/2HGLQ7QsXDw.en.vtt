00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.670 

I<00:00:15.810> think<00:00:16.810> some<00:00:17.020> people<00:00:17.140> are<00:00:17.260> definitely<00:00:17.470> much

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
I think some people are definitely much

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.560 
I think some people are definitely much
more<00:00:17.740> gifted<00:00:18.250> in<00:00:18.430> the<00:00:18.520> technical<00:00:19.000> sense<00:00:19.180> and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
more gifted in the technical sense and

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.510 
more gifted in the technical sense and
some<00:00:20.320> people<00:00:20.530> are<00:00:20.590> much<00:00:20.710> more<00:00:20.740> gifted<00:00:21.160> into

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
some people are much more gifted into

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.100 
some people are much more gifted into
the<00:00:21.670> creative<00:00:22.000> there's<00:00:22.390> no<00:00:22.510> structure<00:00:22.930> kind

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
the creative there's no structure kind

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.730 
the creative there's no structure kind
of<00:00:23.170> sense

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
of sense

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.710 
of sense
I<00:00:23.770> think<00:00:24.160> I'm<00:00:24.220> somewhere<00:00:24.490> in<00:00:24.610> between<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
I think I'm somewhere in between the

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.910 
I think I'm somewhere in between the
reason<00:00:26.170> I<00:00:26.230> wanted<00:00:26.470> to<00:00:26.560> do<00:00:26.710> you<00:00:26.890> know

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
reason I wanted to do you know

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.820 
reason I wanted to do you know
engineering<00:00:27.220> mr.<00:00:27.610> York<00:00:27.820> is<00:00:28.330> that<00:00:28.600> it<00:00:29.290> gives<00:00:29.590> me

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
engineering mr. York is that it gives me

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.519 
engineering mr. York is that it gives me
that<00:00:29.860> chance<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:30.790> have<00:00:30.820> an<00:00:31.060> actual<00:00:32.020> impact<00:00:32.290> on

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
that chance to have an actual impact on

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.260 
that chance to have an actual impact on
the<00:00:32.590> world<00:00:32.740> the<00:00:33.310> way<00:00:33.430> I<00:00:33.490> want<00:00:33.670> to<00:00:33.730> fly<00:00:33.910> artists

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
the world the way I want to fly artists

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.670 
the world the way I want to fly artists
through<00:00:34.420> design<00:00:34.720> which<00:00:35.230> is<00:00:35.350> kind<00:00:35.620> of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
through design which is kind of

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.850 
through design which is kind of
intersection<00:00:36.310> of<00:00:36.430> studio<00:00:36.730> art<00:00:36.880> and<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.680> thing

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
intersection of studio art and the thing

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.220 
intersection of studio art and the thing
about<00:00:38.980> design<00:00:39.280> is<00:00:39.430> that<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:39.820> can<00:00:40.780> affect

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
about design is that you can affect

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.200 
about design is that you can affect
people's<00:00:41.500> behaviors<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.190> infect<00:00:42.579> the<00:00:42.970> world

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
people's behaviors you infect the world

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.569 
people's behaviors you infect the world
through<00:00:43.630> design<00:00:43.989> yeah<00:00:44.590> you'll<00:00:44.770> get<00:00:44.920> buildings

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
through design yeah you'll get buildings

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.160 
through design yeah you'll get buildings
that<00:00:46.030> you're<00:00:46.270> building<00:00:46.510> shape<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.020> way<00:00:47.140> we

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
that you're building shape the way we

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.800 
that you're building shape the way we
live<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:47.890> look<00:00:48.520> at<00:00:48.730> street<00:00:49.120> signs<00:00:49.360> through

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
live you look at street signs through

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.330 
live you look at street signs through
signs<00:00:50.050> affects<00:00:50.380> the<00:00:50.530> way<00:00:50.650> we<00:00:50.680> drive<00:00:51.040> on<00:00:51.250> the

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
signs affects the way we drive on the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.340 
signs affects the way we drive on the
road<00:00:51.520> for<00:00:52.300> my<00:00:52.390> intro<00:00:52.660> to<00:00:52.690> engineering<00:00:52.870> class

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
road for my intro to engineering class

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.170 
road for my intro to engineering class
we<00:00:53.620> work<00:00:53.800> with<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.220> hand<00:00:54.700> over<00:00:54.790> fired<00:00:55.060> upon

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
we work with the hand over fired upon

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.000 
we work with the hand over fired upon
but<00:00:55.540> we<00:00:55.630> found<00:00:55.750> out<00:00:55.960> that<00:00:55.990> fire<00:00:56.350> fart<00:00:56.590> masks

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
but we found out that fire fart masks

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.440 
but we found out that fire fart masks
under<00:00:57.400> it<00:00:57.520> you<00:00:57.610> know<00:00:57.700> they<00:00:57.850> put<00:00:57.970> their<00:00:58.120> masks

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
under it you know they put their masks

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.390 
under it you know they put their masks
on<00:00:58.600> before<00:00:59.110> they<00:00:59.200> go<00:00:59.350> into<00:00:59.530> a<00:00:59.620> building<00:00:59.860> and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
on before they go into a building and

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.980 
on before they go into a building and
walking<00:01:00.610> around<00:01:00.790> their<00:01:01.060> masks<00:01:01.240> absolutely

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
walking around their masks absolutely

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.259 
walking around their masks absolutely
fogs<00:01:02.200> up<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:03.220> we<00:01:03.340> wanted<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.640> create<00:01:03.910> some<00:01:04.150> type

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
fogs up so we wanted to create some type

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.730 
fogs up so we wanted to create some type
of<00:01:04.299> products<00:01:04.659> which<00:01:04.839> would<00:01:05.049> you<00:01:05.320> know<00:01:05.409> clear

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
of products which would you know clear

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.080 
of products which would you know clear
the<00:01:05.920> master<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.520> can<00:01:06.670> see<00:01:06.820> what<00:01:06.970> they're

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
the master that you can see what they're

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.550 
the master that you can see what they're
going<00:01:07.240> if<00:01:07.900> some<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.229> guys<00:01:08.320> said<00:01:08.530> that

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
going if some of the guys said that

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.859 
going if some of the guys said that
they'll<00:01:08.830> actually<00:01:09.009> walk<00:01:09.340> into<00:01:09.700> ladders<00:01:10.030> they

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
they'll actually walk into ladders they

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.480 
they'll actually walk into ladders they
have<00:01:11.080> no<00:01:11.259> idea<00:01:11.500> where<00:01:11.650> they're<00:01:11.799> going<00:01:11.830> it's<00:01:12.400> a

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
have no idea where they're going it's a

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.179 
have no idea where they're going it's a
mask<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.850> so<00:01:13.299> up<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:14.320> through<00:01:14.560> internet

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
mask is so up so through internet

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.010 
mask is so up so through internet
engineering<00:01:15.610> we<00:01:15.790> actually<00:01:16.060> built<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.720> 10x

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
engineering we actually built the 10x

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.080 
engineering we actually built the 10x
fan<00:01:17.320> systems<00:01:17.829> which<00:01:18.400> worked<00:01:18.640> out<00:01:18.790> quite<00:01:18.970> well

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
fan systems which worked out quite well

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.630 
fan systems which worked out quite well
I'm<00:01:19.750> doing<00:01:20.110> both<00:01:20.290> product<00:01:21.130> design<00:01:21.370> and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
I'm doing both product design and

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.300 
I'm doing both product design and
material<00:01:22.630> science<00:01:22.960> right<00:01:23.140> now<00:01:23.260> so<00:01:24.040> product

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
material science right now so product

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.399 
material science right now so product
design<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.880> basically<00:01:25.480> for<00:01:25.840> inventions

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
design is basically for inventions

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.890 
design is basically for inventions
within<00:01:27.100> three<00:01:27.280> months<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:28.150> first<00:01:28.330> first

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.149 
sometimes it disappears you go to get it
so<00:01:46.450> we<00:01:46.540> designed<00:01:46.810> along<00:01:46.900> for<00:01:47.260> that<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.680> then

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
so we designed along for that and then

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.860 
so we designed along for that and then
I'm<00:01:48.340> working<00:01:48.490> on<00:01:48.820> redesigning<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.630> police

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
I'm working on redesigning the police

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.600 
I'm working on redesigning the police
spotlight<00:01:50.110> which<00:01:50.710> was<00:01:50.860> mapped<00:01:51.159> it<00:01:51.310> on<00:01:51.400> every

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
spotlight which was mapped it on every

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.000 
spotlight which was mapped it on every
single<00:01:51.729> police<00:01:52.000> car<00:01:52.260> is<00:01:53.260> this<00:01:53.440> device<00:01:53.770> which

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
single police car is this device which

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.039 
single police car is this device which
hasn't<00:01:54.460> been<00:01:54.640> redesigned<00:01:55.150> 18<00:01:55.570> years

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
hasn't been redesigned 18 years

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.289 
hasn't been redesigned 18 years
but<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:57.009> think<00:01:57.070> my<00:01:57.310> goal<00:01:57.490> for<00:01:57.640> after<00:01:57.880> graduation

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
but I think my goal for after graduation

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.719 
but I think my goal for after graduation
is<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.810> take<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.049> year-long<00:01:59.380> road<00:01:59.770> trip<00:02:00.039> you
