00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.700
 and rightly so that computer manufacturers announced on a number of occasions that they were the 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.089
 to storm the smartphone market and will really come out this year 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.269
 and there they have the donkey with roll again 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:17.810
 pushed forward 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.630
 it's the umpteenth and by the feeling that your device and I ask myself so on it 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.630
 at first glance that still add something to the current range 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.199
 also explained that I know there is in any case good to distinguish with 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.890
 a big wink from all the other tactics of 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.350
 This is mainly due to the curves of the device 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.780
 not only the back it runs bolt but also the front 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.590
 but pick it out 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.860
 someone is slightly better there than i would like but he has it 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.190
 nice an antenna it is just something else 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.240
 from the ass again i would perhaps expect that largely to the 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.090
 side state 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.230
 well i'm here at the back 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.570
 but otherwise the metal is clearly in the minority 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.980
 for a moment the issue that sounds just didn't seem so cool 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.420
 that is a matter where they are slightly different approach see also another 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.000
 indicator lights 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.860
 at the top of the device it was an attack by the plants that indicate whether the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.039
 battery is low 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.460
 or this kick 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.760
 h 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.690
 this time for stuttgart was also for a spokesperson in the north 2 2 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.050
 per cent 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.070
 That is not the latest version of the Android Ma behind its rich people 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.620
 complain 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.930
 everything was dropped and for extra tickets you can always go to the and 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.430
 wrapped up 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.810
 as usual at feyenoord, manufacturers can develop their own interface 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.380
 and that has been done 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.610
 I prefer to be a party at the letter and I later heard the following meeting 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.500
 4 he is a bit confused 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.200
 it is often a bit lost with the field 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 well i dont know who is going for the camera broken but is now on a par 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.020
 that you offer slightly more room in the us revenue 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.770
 that's actually pretty cool 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.950
 and that is a completely upset 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.750
 they feared reports of a top view baluchistan sitting in the middle 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.140
 and it also has many more functions 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.580
 the cac manager of and how is it now and to the left of the home screen 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.789
 are all recently used applications 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.669
 and a bit normal there is no place that is now there for transparent 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.619
 screens on the home screen 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:19.429
 the cool thing is that if your screen has been lured you can go straight from there 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.890
 for the seasoned and drug user it takes some getting used to but it 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.829
 looks great in the easy to use 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.949
 consumers present 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.249
 unfortunately udinese not everywhere consumer feels the included software that the 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.469
 application example of such concerns 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.469
 which looks very cool make is not really nice to use 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.389
 more serious than the calling quality is not great either 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.179
 with the two microphones we are in the ambient noise of filtering out 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.639
 that can not prevent me from still very tinny points 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:54.349
 and that an agent and a 5 megapixel sensor can record these videos 8 it 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.949
 imac result 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:00.119
 but overall i am very satisfied with these lifts with 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.209
 it is not a device for gourmets 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.319
 the sound can be moderate and the camera is not good enough 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.680
 but for those who do not set too high demands on savings is a very nice option 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.599
 if only because winning sees is different from all those sony ericsson state of 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.389
 it and artists
