00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.539 
shade color work quite well for my skin
tone<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:48.500> if<00:01:48.649> you<00:01:48.710> have<00:01:48.859> darker<00:01:49.219> skin<00:01:49.250> than

not though you don't say Universal but

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.080 
not though you don't say Universal but
it's<00:01:55.490> not<00:01:55.670> gonna<00:01:56.920> match<00:01:57.920> if<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:58.549> have<00:01:58.700> darker

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
it's not gonna match if you have darker

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:08.499 
it's not gonna match if you have darker
than<00:01:59.299> my<00:01:59.869> skin<00:01:59.899> tone<00:02:00.319> which<00:02:00.740> is<00:02:00.859> medium<00:02:07.509> the
