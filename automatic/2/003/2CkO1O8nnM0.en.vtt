00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.320
 very good we are all in the world 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.920
 of creative and today I wanted to show you how 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.060
 make an ice rink that makes you 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.039
 run at a tremendous speed 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.730
 more than normal and it's very easy to do 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.400
 we need only little field is ice and 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.980
 something to put on the head that we 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.570
 bounce and we can go faster 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.669
 I'm going to show you how 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.940
 how is this true I ported by the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.940
 creative 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.350
 just the same and we have to be careful 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.970
 with this block so that when we go up 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 we can get work because if not 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.680
 We will not be able to see how I have half a head 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
 stuck inside 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.680
 and we get in here and we start running 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.150
 jump and look at what speed 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.500
 haha and let's jump 1 2 3 4 5 6 up 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.500
 eight blocks we can get to jump 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.449
 I'm going to do it again so you can see it 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:08.040
 it's very easy to do and this can be done 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.800
 implement in the formal micro 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.670
 and well let's pass the easy pass of 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.760
 how it's done and I do not know how to speak today 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.320
 we are ice raptors a good block and 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.320
 nothing more than two for the ice 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.380
 that you can get the ice in 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.560
 our world with the peak of touch of 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.770
 silk and ice have put so that it 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.280
 I can catch it some time ago I think it makes 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.049
 time can be accommodated 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.600
 well there was a moment that can be 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.390
 catch but then what is wrapped 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.070
 put it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.650
 so 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:50.410
 you can not go back to catch good he gets 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.950
 this so that when you go running 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.950
 do not leave 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.710
 Y 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.869
 in the roof 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.640
 you leave a small exit like that and then 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.170
 I know that I know 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.170
 an entry of what you want 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.390
 but it would almost be worth 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:19.120
 and new below trapdoors so that 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:23.250
 make the effect of running 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.320
 because they measure less than half a block 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.790
 and we measure two blocks that 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.330
 it reduces the space we have for 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.300
 jump and it does a weird effect that does not 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.860
 I would know how to explain and 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.130
 that make us bounce and run more 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.130
 Quick 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.950
 good is prat 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.880
 I can not put it 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.810
 It is run and give the button 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.540
 to jump 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.540
 you see haha 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.670
 let's remove the fault 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.140
 and it was made up to date 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.600
 Now enough to stand up good is a writer 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.340
 and that's it and this we can do what 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.340
 we want no matter how much 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.549
 for exam 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.430
 as long as it is not taken out of the 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.859
 food bars or someone blocks us 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.819
 the way that could also happen that 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.819
 you can put a bug 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.740
 We are not on ice or in villas 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.740
 so we would not have 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.370
 and well they are here 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.840
 very easily 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.680
 we already have super good speed was 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.680
 with creative loader 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.840
 give me mode 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.840
 now 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.489
 super speed good this if uncle sam 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.170
 sad today something very easy to do and very 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.660
 Quick 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.540
 and that can save us a lot of time 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.709
 good until the next as always 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.709
 weekly and I ask God
