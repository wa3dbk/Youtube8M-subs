00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 and now everyone and welcome them 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.400
 speak of a come and well this is a 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.350
 special video that they want to attract 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.719
 for several days how to adjust 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.670
 their of their sensitivities in cases 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.280
 of you use you talk to all of you 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.529
 modern warfare 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.180
 but it escapes there those that you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.110
 want but good as they are now 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.670
 watching on screen 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.470
 this is a table of how are the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.730
 goats of interiors of the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 sensitivities that had to be 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.289
 example in the call of duty black ops' 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.930
 one in which was the first subtle broth 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.870
 that I started going was based on a 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.640
 sensitivity from 1 to 10 thing that does not 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.239
 revoked from the camera in all 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.540
 bastards 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.760
 at the time 215 get are 414 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.160
 good sensitivities in cases 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.230
 previous more guaparo whites one 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.510
 either of the holiness in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.359
 four arrived as that initial or high and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.269
 says he said hair in parentheses and 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.769
 when we arrive this way will be the sensitivity 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.749
 87 output in whatever sensitivity 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.659
 worse and kate it would be like that a bit 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.879
 with a little longer more way more 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.980
 fast and what would be the 10 whatever the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.690
 maximum not the most the most bitch of 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.010
 control it in my opinion for those of 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.790
 unai but not because they are the pinches 3g 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.950
 but in the end in blockhaus 1 in the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.290
 sensitivity 8 let's say to the oxidized 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.200
 height in the dose and we will reach the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.829
 obesity but already 14 and the bastard 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.409
 that the cards when I went black 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:30.000
 ops a black ops 2 I said yes in the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.850
 call of duty and in the 21 when they left 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.340
 to 4 that would be height possess in 8 that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.259
 it is in white 2 it would be the same not thing 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.240
 that is not true since I was 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.909
 recording myself spinning around like 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.950
 idiot and telling the time if it was the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.569
 same was not the same and it was not 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.950
 Apart from that it will not be the same too 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.909
 he's here with the rule people of three 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.789
 mathematical areas if one equals 100 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.700
 I wave and I say yes 4 is equal to 100 in the 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.700
 sensitivity 5 how much will it be a 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.289
 race of 3 very cabrona not very pinches 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.340
 and x equal to and square in the 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.259
 square is worth 4 but good here showed 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.929
 first what would be the table is here 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.920
 As shown in the table as it is not is not 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.290
 the same 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.810
 hyde the black ops of black ops 1 al 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.660
 black ops 2 for example in the black ops 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.819
 in the black ops 1-4 in the black ops is 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.319
 sensitivity in 5 if you do not believe me 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.680
 do the lap test as 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.350
 stupid 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.720
 good 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.930
 carlos or interiors sensitivity in 1 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.170
 black ops 11 with the previous tools 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.460
 sensitivity in 12 in one equal all 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.060
 the previous days and sensitivity in 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.960
 two dishes in three with the previous day 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.780
 identity in three black ops in 4 when 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:57.030
 of the previous day in 4 blackham two in 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:03:01.410
 five with superior to 4 5 5 7 and 6 and 8 7 and 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.590
 10 8 and 11 9 13 and 10 14 as she what 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.780
 last can already upload 302 numbers yes 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.050
 because by pure chance that you 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.120
 they use a sensitivity between 8 and 9 in the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.760
 Carlos in the black ops is fine I 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.800
 people and the one he used in those who liked 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.800
 the black ops 1 comes bad war 3 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.850
 he liked between five and six the 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.190
 braille varied between 6 and 7 around 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.040
 9-year- olds because 9's because it's 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.100
 in 317 that he always used like that between 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.200
 that limit no and pos went very well 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.330
 that there was 14 sensitivity on the island 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.490
 with which I decompose the 9 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.620
 just the average is a sensitivity 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.590
 I recommend it a lot, I was not even 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.750
 very work or very low you get tired 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.490
 the shifts and all this roll no but 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.610
 well now let's move on to what would be the 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.530
 second the second cosma as per exists 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.200
 the second table that I bring to you here that 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.720
 would be from whites 2 to what would be 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.750
 bring witnesses closer 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.380
 well this would be more or less logical 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.050
 not that you are still playing 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.840
 modern warfare 3 or something like that if you 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.580
 play sensitivity in 6 in 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.930
 modern warfare has the call of duty 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.310
 black ops' I think it's in 8 and 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.859
 possibly looking for him here here he has it 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.950
 the 8th and they pass it for the other good side 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.800
 of the numbers on the left side that 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.990
 it would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.110
 16 and identify them well by columns 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.510
 the numbers are on the left are the 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.060
 of white 2 and those on the right 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.340
 are those of the states that returns to what 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.260
 same not the actress cameron again and 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.100
 now it's up to 20 and sensitivities 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.100
 next 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.110
 2 albans be guardian of this prick 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.510
 adult and will have 50 of the 6 say 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.740
 sensibilities and nothing are going to fight to 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.530
 through but good 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.110
 here as you will see on the screen if you 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.900
 I use it as sensibility in 8 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.699
 I was playing him 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.860
 applying the same as applying held 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.440
 with soto if they leave hi 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.080
 in 2 he also looked for haji him as equal 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.770
 which is not true because I have just 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.630
 do the test and it changes too much in the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.960
 that is playing density 7 in the 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.380
 card punishments and now the game in eleven 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.720
 because they seem in 11 but good 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.550
 I hope you liked the video see 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.530
 Although the tables identify tion 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.050
 you feel your sensitivity I 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.630
 I recommend that in black ops 2 use 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.659
 an approximate sensitivity between 8 and 10 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.759
 because you do not want more in those 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:42.130
 best sensitive that can be 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.810
 control and more and it's just starting or 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.150
 You've been getting used to that 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.919
 sensitivity because the truth that the 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.669
 brown output 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.840
 I threw in sensitivity 14 and that 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.919
 very try card 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.300
 then I was changing him I went 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.620
 changing it changed until it arrived 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.930
 to this sensitivity that I have right now 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.580
 What is it 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:05.100
 to 9 in a gulag of 211 in the past 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.710
 six or seven or five morhua tailors and 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.020
 black ops 1 but good I was with the 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.600
 video until I got here I take 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.600
 me and see you in the next video bye bye
