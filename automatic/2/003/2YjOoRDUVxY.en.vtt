 vaticano a catholic puntocom I continue with 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.769

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.530
 that the joy of power is special 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.700

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:33.829
 it was benefited and it's one is a 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.649
 bliss reading the bible and 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.350
 it's a sign that God gives the 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.629
 opportunity to find and to know the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.210
 I really hope that the people who 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:48.030
 can hear these audios 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.730
 can become Catholics and go to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.710
 heaven that is my intention and hopefully this 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.970
 can help for such purpose as 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.520
 as I suppose 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.730
 I will continue with the gospel of our 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.680
 Lord Jesus Christ according to Saint John 'seems 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.480
 excellent and wonderful of this 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.610
 gospel 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.130
 personally it is my favorite 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.750
 issues that contains many 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.050
 discourses of jesús and very very overturned 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.260
 towards love towards the way that 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.380
 God perceives love as he loves us 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.380
 as he forgives sinners like him 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.460
 apply his mercy and how is it possible 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.400
 that we do not really deserve it 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.310
 we can deserve for participation the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.920
 heaven through our goodwill 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.100
 that we can demonstrate and our our 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.600
 repentance of sins I will 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.630
 start then with the note 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.690
 introduction of a Mr. straubinger 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.050
 This one seems worth mentioning because 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.510
 explains historical and exegetical things 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.130
 Which are important 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.840
 gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.390
 according to san juan 'introductory note 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.640
 sanjuán natural of betsaida de galilea 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.220
 he was brother of santiago el mayor 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.370
 sons -both of Zebedee and Salome 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.140
 sister of the most holy virgin being 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.540
 First disciple of San Juan 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.780
 Baptist and searching with all my heart for 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.460
 Kingdom of God followed after Jesus and 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.610
 he soon became his disciple 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.100
 favorite from the cross the Lord 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.040
 entrusted his most holy mother of whom 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.129
 Juan onwards cared as of his own 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.650
 John was the disciple to whom Jesus 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.739
 loved and that in the last scene was 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.989
 lying on Jesus' chest like 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.840
 friend of his heart and intimate witness of 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.819
 his love and his sorrows after the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.239
 john resurrection remained in Jerusalem 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.459
 as one of the columns of the church and 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.829
 later he moved to Ephesus of the CIA 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.129
 minor banished by the emperor 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.829
 domiciano to the island of patmos wrote 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.530
 there the apocalypse to the death of 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.069
 tyrant could return to Ephesus by ignoring 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.189
 to date and every detail of his death 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.840
 besides the apocalypse and 13 pistols 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.030
 composed at the end of the first century is 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.849
 say about 30 years after the 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.859
 synoptics and the fall of the temple east 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.049
 gospel that has as its object 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.230
 strengthen the faith in Messianicity and 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.599
 divinity of Jesus Christ at the same time 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.359
 it serves to complete the gospels 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.689
 previous mainly from the point 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.710
 of spiritual sight because it has been called 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.110
 the evangelist of love 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.450
 his language is the highest that has 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.030
 legacy to sacred writing as I already 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.520
 shows the prologue that by sublimity 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.440
 supernatural of your matter does not have 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.890
 similar in the literature of the 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.890
 humanity
