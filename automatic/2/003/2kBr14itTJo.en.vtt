have to wait until like another week to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
have to wait until like another week to
have<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> base<00:01:01.800> model

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
have you and like this is the base model

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.549 
have you and like this is the base model
so<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.910> will<00:01:03.180> assume<00:01:03.480> they<00:01:03.750> will<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.920 
so I will assume they will have it in
stock<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.549> guess<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.720> time
