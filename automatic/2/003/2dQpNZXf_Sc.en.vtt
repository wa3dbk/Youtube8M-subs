indeed<00:03:13.590> virgin<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.250> not<00:03:14.400> some<00:03:14.670> color<00:03:15.019> but

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
indeed virgin and not some color but

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.860 
indeed virgin and not some color but
there<00:03:17.250> are<00:03:17.310> multiple<00:03:17.430> textures<00:03:18.030> there<00:03:18.599> are<00:03:18.840> a

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
there are multiple textures there are a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.369 
there are multiple textures there are a
few<00:03:19.379> I<00:03:19.859> noticed<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.640> few<00:03:20.670> Gray's<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:22.049> one<00:03:22.260> of

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
few I noticed a few Gray's and one of

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.069 
few I noticed a few Gray's and one of
the<00:03:22.760> bundles<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:24.060> believe<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.569> looks<00:03:24.780> like<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
the bundles I believe it looks like the

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:37.699 
the bundles I believe it looks like the
webs<00:03:25.319> are<00:03:25.560> pretty<00:03:25.829> thick<00:03:33.650> but<00:03:35.239> yeah<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:37.019> don't

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
webs are pretty thick but yeah I don't

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.589 
webs are pretty thick but yeah I don't
think<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.099> wasn't<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.519> front<00:03:38.790> or<00:03:38.970> maybe<00:03:39.329> was

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
think it wasn't this front or maybe was

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.330 
think it wasn't this front or maybe was
the<00:03:39.629> bottle<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.200> was<00:03:40.379> viewing<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:40.950> store

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the bottle that was viewing in the store

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.450 
the bottle that was viewing in the store
but<00:03:42.650> there<00:03:43.650> were<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.859> few<00:03:43.950> like<00:03:44.459> there

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.540 

inside<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:48.700> bundles<00:03:49.770> but<00:03:50.770> I<00:03:51.070> think<00:03:51.370> this

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
inside the bundles but I think this

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.340 
inside the bundles but I think this
would<00:03:51.760> be<00:03:51.790> adequate<00:03:52.210> or<00:03:52.510> not<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.840> be<00:03:52.960> a<00:03:52.990> pretty

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
would be adequate or not to be a pretty

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.600 
would be adequate or not to be a pretty
big<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:56.200> I'm<00:03:56.350> going<00:03:56.620> for<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:56.950> don't<00:03:57.100> want<00:03:57.430> it

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
big that I'm going for I don't want it

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:07.770 
big that I'm going for I don't want it
extra<00:03:58.710> too<00:03:59.710> much

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.300 

but

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
but

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.250 
but
of<00:04:10.880> it

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.300 

pretty<00:04:15.920> good<00:04:16.790> condition<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:18.199> like<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.829> texture

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
pretty good condition I like to texture

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.420 
pretty good condition I like to texture
the<00:04:19.459> way<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.880> curl<00:04:20.150> of<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:21.560> think<00:04:21.919> we<00:04:22.130> want

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
the way the curl of it I think we want

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.070 
the way the curl of it I think we want
to<00:04:22.460> see<00:04:22.639> if<00:04:22.760> that<00:04:22.940> will<00:04:23.060> change<00:04:23.389> after<00:04:23.810> it's

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
to see if that will change after it's

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.550 
to see if that will change after it's
been<00:04:24.229> washed<00:04:24.440> conditioned<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.460> treated<00:04:25.940> and
