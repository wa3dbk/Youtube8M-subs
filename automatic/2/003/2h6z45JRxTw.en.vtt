00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
for instance Paul McCartney was

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.770 
for instance Paul McCartney was
published<00:03:17.799> behind<00:03:18.010> them<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.390> then<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.420> decided

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
published behind them and then I decided

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.690 
published behind them and then I decided
to<00:03:19.870> launch<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.170> record<00:03:20.500> label<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.310> we<00:03:21.459> just

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
to launch a record label and we just

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.599 
to launch a record label and we just
thought<00:03:21.940> maybe<00:03:22.239> our<00:03:22.930> contact<00:03:23.440> with

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
thought maybe our contact with

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.099 
thought maybe our contact with
Parlophone<00:03:24.609> was<00:03:25.299> coming<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.660> an<00:03:25.780> end<00:03:25.870> although

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
Parlophone was coming to an end although

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.740 
Parlophone was coming to an end although
they<00:03:26.319> we<00:03:26.890> could<00:03:27.100> have<00:03:27.190> carried<00:03:27.459> on<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:28.540> we

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
they we could have carried on and we

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.420 
they we could have carried on and we
thought<00:03:28.930> maybe<00:03:29.109> this<00:03:29.319> was<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.560> time<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:29.980> go

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
thought maybe this was the time to go

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.050 
thought maybe this was the time to go
for<00:03:30.819> a<00:03:30.850> new<00:03:31.030> approach<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:31.870> just<00:03:31.930> see<00:03:32.970> what<00:03:33.970> it

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
for a new approach and just see what it

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.090 
for a new approach and just see what it
was<00:03:34.150> like<00:03:34.209> with<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.630> new<00:03:34.810> company<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.980> do

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
was like with the new company and to do

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.259 
was like with the new company and to do
that<00:03:36.250> we<00:03:36.340> had<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.519> have<00:03:36.700> our<00:03:36.760> own<00:03:36.940> record<00:03:37.239> label

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
that we had to have our own record label

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.430 
that we had to have our own record label
but<00:03:38.220> it's<00:03:39.220> actually<00:03:39.579> signed<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.389> cobalt<00:03:40.870> and

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.650 
but it's actually signed to cobalt and
your<00:03:42.040> new<00:03:42.250> album<00:03:42.430> we've<00:03:42.730> also<00:03:42.940> noticed<00:03:43.450> that

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
that you also included a young sound

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.229 
that you also included a young sound
from<00:03:46.690> Bruce<00:03:46.959> Springsteen<00:03:47.829> so<00:03:48.519> with<00:03:48.700> boosting

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
from Bruce Springsteen so with boosting

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.819 
from Bruce Springsteen so with boosting
we<00:03:49.359> heard<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.660> song<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.139> we<00:03:50.230> thought<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.709> we

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
we heard the song and we thought that we

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.110 
we heard the song and we thought that we
could<00:03:50.859> give<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.489> a<00:03:51.519> sort<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.730> Pet<00:03:51.910> Shop<00:03:52.090> Boys

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
could give it a sort of Pet Shop Boys

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.300 
could give it a sort of Pet Shop Boys
treatments<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.079> make<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.560> more<00:03:53.680> electronic

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
treatments and make it more electronic

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.949 
treatments and make it more electronic
put<00:03:54.579> more<00:03:54.819> fall<00:03:55.090> on<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.329> floor<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:57.959> we

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
put more fall on the floor and and we

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.390 
put more fall on the floor and and we
particularly<00:03:59.260> liked<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.500> guitar<00:03:59.980> riff<00:04:00.190> I

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
particularly liked the guitar riff I

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.710 
particularly liked the guitar riff I
think<00:04:00.579> there's<00:04:00.730> no<00:04:00.880> point<00:04:01.180> in<00:04:01.269> doing<00:04:01.389> a<00:04:01.510> cover

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
think there's no point in doing a cover

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.809 
think there's no point in doing a cover
version<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.290> song<00:04:02.319> unless<00:04:02.799> you<00:04:03.250> can<00:04:03.430> make<00:04:03.639> it

version of a song unless you can make it

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.000 
version of a song unless you can make it
sound<00:04:04.150> like<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.109> wrote<00:04:05.319> it<00:04:05.470> yourself

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010

thing and you know you we kept up to

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.770 
thing and you know you we kept up to
date<00:04:51.320> with<00:04:51.470> sounds<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:52.190> technology<00:04:52.850> but<00:04:53.630> we

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
date with sounds and technology but we

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.210

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
we have a very strong identity we do

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.800 
we have a very strong identity we do
something<00:05:01.520> really<00:05:01.730> that<00:05:01.910> no<00:05:02.120> one<00:05:02.300> else<00:05:02.480> does

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
something really that no one else does

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.010 
something really that no one else does
and<00:05:03.430> in<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.700> sense<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.300> can<00:05:05.510> be<00:05:05.630> over<00:05:05.810> the

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
and in that sense it can be over the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.050 
and in that sense it can be over the
moment<00:05:06.650> but<00:05:07.010> it<00:05:07.100> can<00:05:07.220> also<00:05:07.340> be<00:05:07.460> timeless<00:05:07.940> at

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
moment but it can also be timeless at

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.430 
moment but it can also be timeless at
the<00:05:08.120> same<00:05:08.330> time<00:05:08.510> how<00:05:08.900> would<00:05:08.960> you<00:05:09.200> describe

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
was great when the band came off and

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.870 
was great when the band came off and
then<00:06:01.760> it<00:06:01.880> got<00:06:02.000> a<00:06:02.030> bit<00:06:02.270> boring<00:06:02.539> because<00:06:03.640> and<00:06:04.640> so

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
then it got a bit boring because and so

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.940
