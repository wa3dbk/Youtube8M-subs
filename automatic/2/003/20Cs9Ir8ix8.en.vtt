 I'm not alone today but I have 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.500
 the dear jessica ready 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.000
 just for you lifestyle and us 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.280
 baked cookies today together 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.070
 and indeed we have vegan lead tina 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.500
 they look very good 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.779
 become delicious and want it today 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 we show you the recipe for it and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.050
 if you just want it easy 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.699
 And those are the ingredients 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.789
 we need for the fiorentina and that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.099
 we need 150 grams of almonds 130 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.489
 millimeter havag like you 120 grams raw 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.660
 cane sugar 100 grams uran riad 40 grams 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.059
 so some vanilla 40 grams dark 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.770
 Let's go to the couverture and 30 baku 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.350
 by putting the sugar in one 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.640
 coated pan and give them 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.390
 medium heat bright caramelize 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.390
 to let 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.739
 now you can already see that there 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.789
 what happens is he finds sugar 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.789
 slowly caramelize 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.720
 we now add the hv sun 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.560
 then even the small cut 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.560
 his 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.899
 and a little bit of vanilla 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.720
 You should cook all this now 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.320
 bring and all that for so long 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.110
 continue to cook until the mass of one 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.550
 viscous consistency has that looks 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.140
 then you have to go about this way 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.390
 still watch that the pieces continue 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.680
 dissolve 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.000
 but that just happens if you 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.930
 the masses just stop long enough 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.930
 can continue cooking 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.120
 then we go the small cut 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.750
 add orangeat and then already the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.750
 planed almonds 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.209
 then distribute virbac wafers on one 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.969
 baking sheet and try the mass 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.079
 reasonably well to distribute what 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.219
 this time is not so good 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.010
 I did not know why that worked 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.569
 usually the mass has lain 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.219
 extremely sticky and super good 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.989
 Distribute wafer on the bug 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.189
 it would just have to look that way 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.780
 it may be a little bit with you 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.090
 it works better with us is worked out 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.799
 Just have a good time when the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.569
 baked florentine then that is 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.069
 Massive on it again very hard so 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.750
 You do not have to worry about that 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.290
 These must now be preheated 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.389
 Oven at 200 degrees for about 12 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.220
 be baked for a few minutes until you 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.220
 just slightly brownish 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.370
 So we see after baking 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.100
 now we heat up a bit 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.140
 chocolate in a water bath and then set 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.020
 the florentine from the bottom of 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.810
 dive in the bug wafers below 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.490
 short in chocolate and then set 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.560
 Hold back on a baking paper with it 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.460
 they can dry well 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.460
 that's it for now 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.170
 so the whole look then finished off her 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.170

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.680
