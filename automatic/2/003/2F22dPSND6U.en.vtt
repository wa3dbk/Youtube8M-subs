00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
the on/off and try me switch underneath

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.460 
the on/off and try me switch underneath
so<00:02:20.579> I'm<00:02:21.360> going<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.510> switch<00:02:21.689> this<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:22.019> we'll

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so I'm going to switch this on we'll

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.780 
so I'm going to switch this on we'll
give<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.709> whirl<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.159> see<00:02:23.340> what<00:02:23.489> we<00:02:23.579> can<00:02:23.700> get

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
give it a whirl and see what we can get

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.890 
give it a whirl and see what we can get
it<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:24.030> do<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.360> obviously<00:02:24.599> there<00:02:24.720> are<00:02:24.780> going

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900

going to be 30 new bird calls and in
comparison<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.510> live<00:02:30.659> pets<00:02:30.900> I've

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
comparison to the the live pets I've

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
reviewed before so we'll just give this

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.860 
reviewed before so we'll just give this
a<00:02:32.549> switch<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.299> can<00:02:33.420> get<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:35.870> so

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
a switch and see we can get it to do so

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.240 
a switch and see we can get it to do so
that<00:02:36.989> one<00:02:37.140> sounds<00:02:37.440> familiar

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
believe he speaks as well on its own a

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.869 
believe he speaks as well on its own a
card<00:02:58.739> now<00:02:58.920> where's<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.250> other<00:02:59.430> live<00:02:59.579> pets

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
card now where's the other live pets

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.119 
believe this as that does actually say
phrases<00:03:05.310> as<00:03:05.430> well<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.470> if<00:03:07.530> we<00:03:07.620> get<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.859> to<00:03:07.950> say

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
phrases as well so if we get it to say

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:21.379 
phrases as well so if we get it to say
anything<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:19.549> just<00:03:20.549> like<00:03:20.849> before<00:03:20.879> good
