 to best extract all the aromas 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.070
 of the different types of teas and herbal teas you have 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.839

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.750
 true for the first time true good must 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.080
 stand on a dry and away from 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.450
 heat sources connect the plug do 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.420
 be careful and make sure that the taking of 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.729
 your home is grounded 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.640
 as you well know the electronic products are 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.110
 sensitive to electrical changes made 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.610
 ok now place the kettle on the base 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.890
 before use we recommend 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.729
 keep the kettle on charge for at least 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.280
 12 hours 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.759
 to favor the complete charge of the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.729
 battery 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.829
 as you see once connected to the socket 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.439
 of current the base is positioned on 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.659
 kettle on the base itself lights up 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.240
 the display on the handle 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.579
 the figures represent the watch while 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.460
 the horizontal bar milliliters min 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.600
 flashes and indicates that the kettle must 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.380
 to be filled with water 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.909
 first we set the clock 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.910
 press the button for four seconds 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.100
 fashion until the digits of the hour do not 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.829
 start flashing press the button 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.700
 with the triangle until you select 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.070
 time 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.380
 now press mode to select i 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.170
 minutes and proceed in the same way for 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.150
 set the perfect minutes 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.200
 now to confirm press the key 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.209

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.700
 by pressing on the rubber button opens 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.550
 just don't worry if it doesn't open 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.260
 completely bugatti has thought of the 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.900
 your safety to prevent any 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.110
 drops of hot water can come out e 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.570
 accidentally burn yourself remember 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.220
 remove the kettle from the base all 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.170
 the times you want to fill it 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.420
 I recommend if you exceed the level 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.940
 maximum fill the red light 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.130
 flashes and the security systems of 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.350
 true wo n't allow it to work 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.500
 until the water level does not 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.540
 will be correct with real you can see the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.050

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.190
 lights placed on the handle of the kettle 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.920
 remember to always fill the 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.080
