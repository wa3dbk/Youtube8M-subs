it's a good idea to cast men pet at all

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.650 
it's a good idea to cast men pet at all
times<00:03:08.340> because<00:03:10.760> araya<00:03:11.760> does<00:03:12.150> pretty<00:03:12.420> heavy

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
times because araya does pretty heavy

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.430 
times because araya does pretty heavy
damage<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.500> pests<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.129> this<00:03:14.459> fight

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.740 

now<00:03:19.950> when<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.280> Pharaoh<00:03:20.550> defender<00:03:21.090> dies<00:03:21.330> it'll

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
now when the Pharaoh defender dies it'll

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.140 
now when the Pharaoh defender dies it'll
create<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.200> void<00:03:22.560> zone<00:03:22.890> at<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.550> location<00:03:24.120> where

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
create a void zone at the location where

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.410 
create a void zone at the location where
he<00:03:24.510> dies<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:26.160> void<00:03:26.370> zone<00:03:26.700> does<00:03:27.060> pretty

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
he dies and the void zone does pretty

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.110 
he dies and the void zone does pretty
heavy<00:03:27.660> damage<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.530> all<00:03:29.010> your<00:03:29.460> raid<00:03:29.670> members

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
heavy damage so all your raid members

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.600 
heavy damage so all your raid members
want<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.960> move<00:03:31.170> away<00:03:31.350> from<00:03:31.560> where<00:03:31.980> he<00:03:32.070> dies<00:03:32.280> and

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
want to move away from where he dies and

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.170 
want to move away from where he dies and
it's<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:34.230> good<00:03:34.620> idea<00:03:34.740> to<00:03:34.950> call<00:03:35.400> out<00:03:35.580> when<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
it's a good idea to call out when the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.480 
it's a good idea to call out when the
Pharaoh<00:03:36.420> defender<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:37.020> going<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.410> die<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.800> so

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
Pharaoh defender is going to die and so

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.020 
Pharaoh defender is going to die and so
we've<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:39.690> shifted<00:03:40.620> our<00:03:40.740> raid<00:03:41.010> over<00:03:41.310> so

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
we've just just shifted our raid over so

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.110 
we've just just shifted our raid over so
that<00:03:42.210> no<00:03:42.420> one<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.930> within<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.620> void<00:03:43.800> zones

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
that no one is within the void zones

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.560 
that no one is within the void zones
once<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.390> Pharaoh<00:03:45.600> defender<00:03:46.080> dies<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:47.310> will

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
once the Pharaoh defender dies it will

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.450 
once the Pharaoh defender dies it will
revive<00:03:48.570> after<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.170> few<00:03:49.470> seconds<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:52.160> what<00:03:53.160> we<00:03:53.280> do

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
revive after a few seconds so what we do

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.160 
revive after a few seconds so what we do
then<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:54.000> just<00:03:54.030> heal<00:03:54.540> through<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.840> damage

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
then is just heal through the damage

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:15.520 
then is just heal through the damage
again<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:56.990> continue<00:03:57.990> on<00:03:58.110> dpsing<00:03:58.620> araya

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
to stay together it's a very simple

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.220 
to stay together it's a very simple
strategy<00:06:34.919> the<00:06:35.520> only<00:06:35.700> thing<00:06:35.880> is<00:06:36.060> getting<00:06:36.660> 25

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
strategy the only thing is getting 25

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.470

people<00:06:37.680> together<00:06:37.889> to<00:06:38.190> do<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.700> strategy<00:06:39.240> is

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 
people together to do the strategy is

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.379
