00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
over the place they have pictures of

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.260

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
even some of the mainstream books I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.330 
even some of the mainstream books I
found<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.530> inaccurate<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.220> they're

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
found to be inaccurate when they're

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.080 
found to be inaccurate when they're
trying<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.580> cover<00:01:20.820> every<00:01:21.810> possible<00:01:21.840> angle<00:01:23.090> so

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
trying to cover every possible angle so

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.969 
trying to cover every possible angle so
I<00:01:24.119> recommend<00:01:24.570> getting<00:01:24.869> something<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.710> can

as easy but once you know what you know

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.659 
as easy but once you know what you know
the<00:05:01.539> wild<00:05:01.840> clover<00:05:02.260> looks<00:05:02.440> like<00:05:02.650> it'll<00:05:03.400> give

possible ways to turn it into tinctures

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.879 
possible ways to turn it into tinctures
and<00:05:10.539> you<00:05:10.900> know<00:05:11.020> all<00:05:11.199> sorts<00:05:11.380> of<00:05:11.590> stuff<00:05:11.650> for

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.390 
and you know all sorts of stuff for
medicinal<00:05:12.130> purposes<00:05:12.900> because<00:05:13.900> no<00:05:14.860> one<00:05:15.130> book

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400
