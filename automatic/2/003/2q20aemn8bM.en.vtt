00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.410
 hello my name is julie virviescas 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.449
 representatives laboratories and visibilice 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 search in this video to show you the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.410
 correct way to take a sample of 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.430
 water and ice for analysis in the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.529
 laboratory 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.900
 The first thing that I will show in the articles 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.189
 that are included in the kit and which 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.789
 it will be sent to you by elvis 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.789
 research 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.300
 this is an ice kit and contains 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.640
 2 formulate the first one is a guide and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.080
 shows how to fill the second 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.370
 form also comes with a guide 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.370
 photographic of how to take the samples 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.630
 They have two containers for ice 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.030
 a black bag 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.760
 and two gel packs which must 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.760
 be frozen the night before use the 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.550
 next is a water kit is very 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.370
 similar to ice contains a 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.590
 Guide and sample form how 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.920
 Fill out the following form with your 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.140
 personal information and company name 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.290
 also has a photo guide of 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.820
 how recently taking samples 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.210
 adequately 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.750
 the recipients and we will only need one 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.030
 for each sample the difference of this 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.540
 is that it contains some white flakes in 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.540
 the bottom 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.229
 a black bag 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.229
 and the g packages 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.020
 before taking your sample of water and 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.090
 ice it is necessary to take precautions 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.570
 the first is to clearly mark the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.750
 containers 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.720
 here I have set the date the time and the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.729
 machine in this case the machine with a 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.950
 very important recommendation is to take 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.289
 your samples as late as possible in the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.060
 day and this will ensure us to be able to do 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.520
 the analysis within 24 hours 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.380
 following and finally we recommend 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.720
 wash hands with soap and water 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.240
 antibacterial until approximately 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.950
 forearm for better results and now 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.950
 let's take the ice samples 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.430
 how can this row have a 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.830
 spoon in your fridge has no spoon or 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.000
 has an automatic dispenser 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.860
 simply put the container 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.200
 directly the after under the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.870
 dispenser and arrived to the line 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.730
 meter to if you are taking samples of 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.459
 ice from a bag 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.620
 just shake the bag on top of the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.209
 container without touching the container 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.209
 let's take ours 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.450
 and remember that at least we should 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.260
 fill up the indicator line 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.040
 we close 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.319
 we take the next container and what 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.209
 we fill remember remember to take your samples 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.209
 as late as possible during the day 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.820
 and up to the indicator line 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.000
 as we saw if we can put more would be 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.570
 much better 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.570
 we close 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.400
 We will pack the samples for 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.260
 send them to the laboratory first 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.750
 Let's make sure the sample is 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.090
 completely closed and we can put a 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.129
 some tape around 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.959
 to prevent the lid from going to 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.710
 open during the course of 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.170
 transport 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.480
 We also recommend using this paper 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.090
 bubbles to make sure that the 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.650
 sample is completely protected and 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.650
 We are going to pack it in this way 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.690
 We have some tape to ensure 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.680
 and the algae 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.750
 we use the first ice pack and what 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.340
 we put in the background 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.340
 we put the samples 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.970
 the second gel pack 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.900
 and here it is very important to fill your 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.640
 information we should put the name of 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.790
 the company the name of the person 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.180
 taking the sample the time and we will 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.380
 put a detailed description of the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.970
 sample 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.970
 we put the form 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.520
 within the cycle bag that we have 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.770
 delivered and this ensures that the bag 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.009
 protect the form and do not go to 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.009
 wet 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.699
 we put it in the fridge 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.620
 and we ship it with immediate delivery by 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.389
 half of fedex feet to the offices that 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.330
 appear on screen 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.010
 now let's take the water samples 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.960
 this is the container for water and 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.200
 let's make sure that these tickets 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.510
 Safety is completely sealed 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.560
 here I already wrote my name 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.630
 and the time 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.610
 they also contain white flakes 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.440
 I mentioned at the beginning which are 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.810
 a chemical indicator to preserve the 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.000
 Water 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.330
 when we open the key let's make sure 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.190
 that the pressure is a little low so that 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.780
 Do not go splashing when we fill the 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.540
 container 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.920
 to open the lid we should do it towards 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:44.320
 An angle so as not to contaminate 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.849
 in containers we open it in this way 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.629
 Y 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.629
 you are welcome 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.930
 we must fill up the indicator line 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.930
 that I will show you 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.210
 this indicator 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.499
 in the minimum we need if we can 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.909
 fill more would be ideal 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:08.580
 Now we are going to ready the samples for 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:10.080
 send them to the laboratory first we 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.659
 we make sure it is completely 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.879
 closed and we can put some ribbon 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.650
 around the lid to avoid that 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:19.090
 will be opened during the course of 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.900
 transport 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:25.750
 we are going to wrap him in this role of 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.490
 air bubbles 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.840
 in this way 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.840
 we put some ribbon 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.689
 and this protect our teachers 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.789
 remember that unlike the 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:47.480
 ice samples we just need a 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:51.569
 container for each water sample 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:54.589
 we put the gel previously frozen 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:54.589
 the samples 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:00.130
 the other gel pack 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.620
 we make sure the form is 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:06.180
 completely full and have the name of 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.340
 the telephone company information 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.600
 a detailed description of the sample 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:14.960
 the time and date and where you want it to be 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.960
 send you the results 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.740
 we doubled this and put it in our 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.740
 century sachet 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.920
 this bag will protect so that it does not 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.160
 the document is going to get wet when 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.160
 send 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:35.740
 we put him on top of everything 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.500
 and closing 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.000
 and we send it by fedex or yupi is from 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.400
 immediate delivery the next day 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.319
