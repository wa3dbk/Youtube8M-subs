 good androids how are you in the day 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.410
 today I'm going to teach you how to root the 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.990
 samsung galaxy s 5 and a very easy way 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.180
 fast and safe first of all I want 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.860
 clarify that I do not have a galaxy s 5 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.900
 but I know that a lot of people are interested 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.640
 in surrounding it so I'm going to try 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.090
 explain this video with the maximum 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.860
 possible details 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.600
 first let's have a look at what 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.580
 that we need all the links are 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.530
 in the description you have to download the 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.600
 samsung kies 3 installation file 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.690
 which contains the necessary drivers for 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.830
 connect the phone to our pc 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.080
 simply when the download finishes 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.690
 we open the file and follow the steps 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.910
 for the installation the second thing is that 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.190
 download this end called cc auto root 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.790
 and unzip all your files in 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.830
 some folder of our computer 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.860
 the next thing would be to prepare our 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.930
 phone we go to adjustments to information 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.850
 of the phone and we have to activate the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.890
 developer options for that the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.360
 compilation number we click seven 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.940
 times until we get a message 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.470
 we are already issuing developer 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.260
 I get another message because I already 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.180
 I have the options unlocked 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.560
 if we go back to adjustments we see that it has 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.310
 appeared the options menu of 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.040
 development if we activate it will ask us 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.870
 that we accept accept and we have to 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.260
 check the debug box of usb 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.180
 we accept one more time and the next thing that 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.550
 we have to do is once again in 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.760
 Settings and storage options 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.340
 usb connection to the computer and make sure 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.370
 that instead of the pp is marked the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.740
 mtpe box 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.680
 we go back to the pce to make sure that the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.180
 figures are correctly installed 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.400
 we connect the galaxy s 5 by the micro 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.770
 usb and we hope that the computer still its 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.300
 work until you connect it is possible 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.340
 that the first time we connect 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.620
 mistake if it's like that we would have to open and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.970
 that connect the phone and try the 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.479
 which is open if it is capable of 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.429
 recognize it 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.080
 Now we have to put the phone in 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.239
 download mode by pressing the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.610
 volume down home and power at the same time 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.870
 should appear a screen like the one 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.239
 you have to the left asking us 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.040
 confirmation we give the volume button to 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.460
 above to confirm that we will enter 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.170
 a screen similar to the one on the right 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.640
 meanwhile in the folder that 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.870
 unzip you have to go to this file 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.840
 called or of interest we say yes 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.400
 and you have to go to fight and once again in the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.299
 previous folder you have to select 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.099
 this md5 file called cf auto root it 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.930
 we select and we have to make sure 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.959
 that only the box is checked 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.909
 auto robot and reset tile now 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.549
 we connect the phone in download mode 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.129
 and the box below and of gone should 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.230
 become of some color usually 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.329
 yellow or blue as you are seeing we give 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.700
 to start and we wait for Odin to make his 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.769
 work later we will see the screen of 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.599
 galaxy s 5 that I have started to install 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.340
 automatically the root files in the 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.379
 recovery mode 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.269
 when everything ends and the phone more 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.680
 we will see in our drawer 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.780
 applications that we have an application 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.370
 like this so-called supersur is the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.650
 responsible for managing the permissions 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.510
 router our android 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.220
 the next thing we're going to do is go to 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.439
 play store and download this application 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.629
 call some check to check 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.040
 definitely that we are root the 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.409
 the first time we work we will leave this 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.980
 message we simply give the bid ok 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.349
 we give to america we wait a little bit 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.800
 we allow this message that has come from 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.780
 your torso 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.180
 and this message should appear 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.170
 green that indicates that definitely 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.730
 we are root 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.840
