the small schools well I couldn't go to
a<00:02:06.869> private<00:02:07.109> school<00:02:07.319> because<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.889> didn't<00:02:08.130> have

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
a private school because I didn't have

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.160 
a private school because I didn't have
enough<00:02:08.490> money<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.509> private<00:02:09.869> school
