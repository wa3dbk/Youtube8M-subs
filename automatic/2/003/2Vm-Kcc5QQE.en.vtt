 Hello friends 

00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:06.120
 I am carlo designer of tattoos and today I want to talk about some of the types of 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.510
 Tattoos 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.050
 but first a recommendation if you want to get a tattoo 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.109
 You can carry your own design or ask the tattoo artist to draw a picture 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.960
 your pleasure 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.529
 these are the different types of tattoos with which you can find 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.289
 biomechanical tattoo movies and science stories are based 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.429
 fiction 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.909
 are drawings that usually represent tears in the skin that show 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.310
 Mechanical parts or electronic components are usually 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.980
 make large and black and white 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.810
 Celtic tattoos 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.120
 It is a variant of tribal style 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.420
 they use geometric designs based on no2 and ties that cross each other 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.580
 although they can also include precious stones or animals 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.110
 tattoos with colÃ³n 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.280
 currently you can get practically all the colors though 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.980
 Over time they may lose intensity brightness 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.980
 here the main thing is not the outline but the shadows and the blurred lights 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.800
 colour 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.820
 They are usually medium-large sized tattoos 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.010
 traditional tattoos 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.090
 they are the tattoos of the whole life grouping the religious sailor themes 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.420
 eagles tigers or devils to say some 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.190
 Demand has fallen in recent times 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.160
 tribal tattoos 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.120
 The vast majority are made in black Bossi with few colors 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.289
 they are inspired by different cultures African Indian tribes 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:33.390
 Aboriginal 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.960
 the designs are very varied 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.820
 shadows and blurred 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 In these tattoos, the shadow game takes center stage 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.530
 We tend to be large designs usually inspired by fantastic themes 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.669
