00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
Shawnee County has with waste management

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.590 
Shawnee County has with waste management
so<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:23.070> doing<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.550> positive<00:02:24.060> both<00:02:24.240> understand

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
so it's doing a positive both understand

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.030 
so it's doing a positive both understand
of<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.810> economic<00:02:24.930> standpoint<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:25.920> also

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
of the economic standpoint but also

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.950 
of the economic standpoint but also
environmentally<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.120> think<00:02:27.330> that's<00:02:27.630> a

environmentally and I think that's a

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.350 
environmentally and I think that's a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
win-win for everyone in our opinion this

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.700 
win-win for everyone in our opinion this
is<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.840> facility<00:02:31.290> really<00:02:31.410> should<00:02:31.590> be<00:02:31.650> a

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
is this facility really should be a

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.280 
is this facility really should be a
model<00:02:31.830> facility<00:02:32.450> you've<00:02:33.450> you've<00:02:33.870> got<00:02:34.110> the

model facility you've you've got the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.710 
model facility you've you've got the

three components that are dealing with

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.060 
three components that are dealing with
really<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.230> toothsome<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.680> two<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
really the toothsome of the two to the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.370 
really the toothsome of the two to the
biggest<00:02:38.310> issues<00:02:38.550> facing<00:02:38.580> landfills<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:40.260> got

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
biggest issues facing landfills you got

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.190 
biggest issues facing landfills you got
this<00:02:40.560> taking<00:02:41.010> taking<00:02:41.430> mass<00:02:42.000> away<00:02:42.330> from<00:02:43.110> the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
this taking taking mass away from the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.990 
this taking taking mass away from the
landfill<00:02:43.500> you've<00:02:43.710> got<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.980> gas<00:02:44.430> plant<00:02:44.760> that's

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
landfill you've got the gas plant that's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.820 
landfill you've got the gas plant that's
kept<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.510> know<00:02:45.630> capturing<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.140> waste<00:02:46.620> gas

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
kept you know capturing the waste gas

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.740 
kept you know capturing the waste gas
and<00:02:47.280> using<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.670> an<00:02:47.790> equal<00:02:48.120> way<00:02:48.210> suppose<00:02:48.510> just

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
and using it an equal way suppose just

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.620 
and using it an equal way suppose just
flaring<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.650> off<00:02:49.740> like<00:02:50.010> we<00:02:50.220> used<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.970> we<00:02:51.420> can

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
flaring it off like we used to we can

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.230 
flaring it off like we used to we can
recycle<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.620> front<00:02:52.860> end<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.670> can<00:02:53.850> dispose

recycle on the front end we can dispose

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.640 
recycle on the front end we can dispose
on<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.630> back<00:02:54.780> end<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.320> we<00:02:56.010> can<00:02:56.190> use<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.670> gas

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
on the back end and we can use the gas
