00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
I'm going to show you how to program a

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.010 
I'm going to show you how to program a
GU<00:00:04.170> ball<00:00:04.380> um<00:00:04.980> it<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.819> gonna<00:00:06.120> require<00:00:06.330> that

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
GU ball um it is gonna require that

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.070 
GU ball um it is gonna require that
advocate<00:00:07.919> Ted<00:00:08.160> bit<00:00:08.309> coding<00:00:09.059> well<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.690> try<00:00:10.050> to

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
advocate Ted bit coding well I try to

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.049 
advocate Ted bit coding well I try to
avoid<00:00:10.349> using<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:11.010> because<00:00:11.160> dragons<00:00:11.610> office

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
avoid using it because dragons office

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.369 
avoid using it because dragons office
has<00:00:12.210> promote<00:00:12.450> easier<00:00:12.860> and<00:00:14.480> it'll<00:00:15.480> require<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
has promote easier and it'll require the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.920 
has promote easier and it'll require the
pro<00:00:16.650> edition<00:00:17.010> if<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:18.060> want<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.420> have<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.690> look

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
we're going to need the goo balls or

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.460 
we're going to need the goo balls or
jelly<00:00:26.609> anything<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.390> want<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.840> want<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.380> to

jelly anything you want you want it to
sprite<00:00:29.060> this<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.240> mine<00:00:30.449> right<00:00:30.480> here<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
sprite this is mine right here and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.560 
sprite this is mine right here and
you're<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> want<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.550> add<00:00:32.820> animation<00:00:33.450> of

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you're going to want to add animation of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.670 
you're going to want to add animation of
it<00:00:33.690> being<00:00:34.350> like<00:00:34.680> squished<00:00:35.160> really<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:40.440> then

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
it being like squished really and then

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
it being like squished really and then
growing<00:00:41.160> back<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> look<00:00:42.480> like

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
growing back so it's going to look like

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.100 
growing back so it's going to look like
that<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:46.250> then<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.640> we're<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.510> want<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
that and then it's we're gonna want the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.080 
that and then it's we're gonna want the
ground<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.649> course<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:50.730> we're<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
ground of course because we're going to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.220 
ground of course because we're going to
want<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.449> gravity<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.899> it's<00:00:54.899> create

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
want to have gravity so it's create

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.580 
want to have gravity so it's create
event<00:00:55.940> well<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.210> could<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.570> solid<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.140> we

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
event well we could have it solid and we

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.189 
event well we could have it solid and we
want<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.370> sucks<00:00:59.670> when<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.850> put

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
want it's all in really sucks when I put

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.319 
want it's all in really sucks when I put
the<00:01:01.199> gravity<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.710> pretty<00:01:02.070> simple<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.609> 70<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the gravity is pretty simple to 70 and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.119 
the gravity is pretty simple to 70 and
since<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.840> GU<00:01:04.049> ball<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:04.890> anything

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
since it's a GU ball or really anything

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.420 
since it's a GU ball or really anything
we're<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> want<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.420> lower<00:01:06.659> than<00:01:06.869> one

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
we're going to want it lower than one

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.370 
we're going to want it lower than one
and<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.670> these<00:01:08.909> codes<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.020> sprite

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and I have these codes in here so sprite

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
and I have these codes in here so sprite
index<00:01:10.740> shoes<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:11.970> something<00:01:12.180> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
index shoes this is just something that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850 
index shoes this is just something that
I<00:01:12.450> added<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> gives<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
I added so it gives a little bit of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.060 
I added so it gives a little bit of
color<00:01:14.689> adept<00:01:15.689> equals<00:01:16.110> random<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
color adept equals random this is a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.359 
color adept equals random this is a
range<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.909> range<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.780> an<00:01:19.049> image<00:01:19.920> alpha

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
range a range of it an image alpha

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.090 
range a range of it an image alpha
equals<00:01:20.729> random<00:01:21.150> arranged<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.890> if

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
equals random arranged so if you can if

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.830 
equals random arranged so if you can if
you<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.640> I'm<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.909> too<00:01:27.119> fast<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.689> can

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you if I'm going too fast you you can

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
you if I'm going too fast you you can
just<00:01:27.990> pause<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> video<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.860> really<00:01:29.640> anything

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
just pause the video or really anything

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.020 
just pause the video or really anything
because<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.720> know<00:01:30.840> how<00:01:30.930> goes<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:32.549> sub<00:01:32.850> but

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
because you know how goes the sub but

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
because you know how goes the sub but
we're<00:01:33.180> gonna<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.570> whole<00:01:33.900> lot<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.560> drag<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
we're gonna have a whole lot of drag and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.130 
we're gonna have a whole lot of drag and
drop<00:01:35.130> actions<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.820> see<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.750> where<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.960> Pro

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
drop actions I see this is where the Pro

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.289 
drop actions I see this is where the Pro
Edition<00:01:37.350> comes<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.119> you're<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.240> to

Edition comes in because you're going to
want<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.860> transform<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.040> right<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> make<00:01:41.610> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
want to transform this right to make it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.050 
want to transform this right to make it
look<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:41.970> good<00:01:43.250> see<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> option<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:44.850> there

look all good see the option right there

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.590 
look all good see the option right there
so

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.179

we're<00:01:47.840> going<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.049> want<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.350> angle<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:49.070> be

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
we're going to want the angle to be

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.880 
we're going to want the angle to be
direction<00:01:50.090> oh<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:53.150> forgot<00:01:53.299> to<00:01:53.479> mention

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
direction oh and I forgot to mention

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.160 
direction oh and I forgot to mention
make<00:01:54.890> sure<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.310> it's<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.869> origin<00:01:56.869> is<00:01:56.960> in<00:01:57.080> the

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
make sure that it's the origin is in the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.330 
make sure that it's the origin is in the
center<00:01:59.110> and<00:02:01.000> if<00:02:02.000> there<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.020> no<00:02:03.560> if<00:02:03.950> there<00:02:04.190> is

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.359 
center and if there is no if there is
not<00:02:04.909> a<00:02:04.970> collision<00:02:05.509> under<00:02:05.869> it's<00:02:06.049> in<00:02:06.350> y0<00:02:06.680> we<00:02:07.159> want

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
not a collision under it's in y0 we want

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.719 
not a collision under it's in y0 we want
relative<00:02:08.140> then<00:02:09.140> transform<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.830> sprite<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.550> x

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.270 
relative then transform to sprite the x
scale<00:02:11.120> not<00:02:11.989> Y<00:02:12.230> scale<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:12.770> might<00:02:12.920> think<00:02:13.069> it<00:02:13.190> was

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
scale not Y scale you might think it was

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.430 
scale not Y scale you might think it was
wise<00:02:13.400> scale<00:02:13.730> but<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.180> got<00:02:14.780> confusing<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.319> for

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
wise scale but I got confusing that for

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.229 
wise scale but I got confusing that for
a<00:02:15.470> little<00:02:15.560> bit<00:02:15.709> too<00:02:15.860> it's<00:02:16.130> because<00:02:16.250> since<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
a little bit too it's because since the

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.090 
a little bit too it's because since the
angle<00:02:17.600> rotates<00:02:18.050> when<00:02:18.319> it's<00:02:18.440> going<00:02:18.530> downwards

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
angle rotates when it's going downwards

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.790 
angle rotates when it's going downwards
the<00:02:19.819> Y<00:02:20.150> scale<00:02:20.480> becomes<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.900> X<00:02:21.080> scale<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
the Y scale becomes the X scale and the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.320 
the Y scale becomes the X scale and the
exhale<00:02:22.130> becomes<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.489> wide<00:02:22.640> scale<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.120> want

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
exhale becomes a wide scale so you want

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.320 
exhale becomes a wide scale so you want
why<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.690> want<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> X<00:02:24.410> scale<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:25.100> be<00:02:25.220> 1.3<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.239> it

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
why you want the X scale to be 1.3 so it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.380 
why you want the X scale to be 1.3 so it
stretches<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> little<00:02:26.959> bit<00:02:27.610> if<00:02:28.610> there's<00:02:29.239> a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
stretches it a little bit if there's a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.410 
stretches it a little bit if there's a
jelly<00:02:29.720> below<00:02:30.140> its<00:02:30.380> well<00:02:31.220> if<00:02:31.880> there's<00:02:32.180> jelly

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
jelly below its well if there's jelly

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.400 
jelly below its well if there's jelly
inside<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.959> then<00:02:33.220> go<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.370> random<00:02:34.670> position

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
inside it then go to a random position

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.979 
inside it then go to a random position
at<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.470> random<00:02:36.709> speed<00:02:37.450> that's<00:02:38.450> why<00:02:38.630> we<00:02:38.840> want

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
at a random speed that's why we want

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.870 
at a random speed that's why we want
solid<00:02:39.319> because<00:02:40.160> right<00:02:41.090> here<00:02:41.739> if<00:02:42.739> Y<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.250> larger

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
solid because right here if Y is larger

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.280 
solid because right here if Y is larger
than<00:02:44.000> room<00:02:44.180> height<00:02:44.390> oh<00:02:44.600> these<00:02:45.019> are<00:02:45.200> just

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
than room height oh these are just

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.809 
than room height oh these are just
things<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.680> added<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.040> if<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.340> falls<00:02:46.549> off

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
things that I added so if it falls off

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.830 
things that I added so if it falls off
the<00:02:47.030> screen<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:48.380> can<00:02:48.560> go<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:49.760> can<00:02:49.940> move<00:02:50.450> back<00:02:50.600> on

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
the screen it can go it can move back on

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.620 
the screen it can go it can move back on
the<00:02:50.959> screen<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.790> collides<00:02:53.120> with<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.390> jelly

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
the screen if it collides with a jelly

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.500 
the screen if it collides with a jelly
or<00:02:54.380> another<00:02:54.590> goob<00:02:54.829> all<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.459> same<00:02:56.090> thing<00:02:56.299> and

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
or another goob all the same thing and

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.190 
or another goob all the same thing and
if<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.560> collides<00:02:57.799> with<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:57.980> ground<00:02:58.900> well<00:02:59.900> I

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
if it collides with the ground well I

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800 
if it collides with the ground well I
wanted<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.130> act<00:03:01.280> like<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.459> Google<00:03:01.820> so<00:03:02.150> if<00:03:02.630> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
wanted it to act like a Google so if the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.390 
wanted it to act like a Google so if the
vertical<00:03:03.140> speech<00:03:03.320> is<00:03:03.470> larger<00:03:03.680> than<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:03.980> bounce

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
vertical speech is larger than to bounce

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.930 
vertical speech is larger than to bounce
a<00:03:04.579> little<00:03:04.700> bit<00:03:05.410> but<00:03:06.410> no<00:03:06.560> matter<00:03:06.739> what<00:03:07.040> you

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
a little bit but no matter what you

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.640 
a little bit but no matter what you
always<00:03:08.090> want<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.660> move<00:03:08.810> free<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.350> random

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
always want it to move free in a random

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.030 
always want it to move free in a random
direction<00:03:09.739> random<00:03:10.400> speed<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:12.200> set<00:03:12.950> the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
direction random speed and set the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.590 
direction random speed and set the
vertical<00:03:13.340> speed<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.609> zero<00:03:15.579> so<00:03:16.579> you<00:03:17.390> want<00:03:17.540> to

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
vertical speed to zero so you want to

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.809 
vertical speed to zero so you want to
make<00:03:17.630> sure<00:03:17.750> ok

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.910 

wait

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.080 

you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.830 

you

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.550 

can<00:03:33.840> load<00:03:34.140> this<00:03:34.319> into<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.900> I'm<00:03:37.200> going<00:03:37.470> to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
can load this into the so I'm going to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:47.140 
can load this into the so I'm going to
draw<00:03:37.740> some<00:03:37.770> ground<00:03:39.680> I'm<00:03:40.680> placing<00:03:41.010> goo<00:03:41.310> balls

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.470 

so<00:03:48.150> now<00:03:48.330> they<00:03:48.690> look<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.200> act<00:03:49.739> like<00:03:50.069> goo<00:03:50.250> balls

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
so now they look and act like goo balls

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.990 
so now they look and act like goo balls
and<00:03:51.920> now<00:03:52.920> it's<00:03:53.130> probably<00:03:53.459> going<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.700> get<00:03:53.940> a

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
and now it's probably going to get a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.250 
and now it's probably going to get a
little<00:03:54.120> bit<00:03:54.330> crazy<00:03:54.600> because<00:03:54.810> some<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.110> them

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
little bit crazy because some of them

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.080 
little bit crazy because some of them
are<00:03:55.380> flying<00:03:55.650> off<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:56.010> screen<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.430> jumping

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
are flying off the screen and jumping

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.880 
are flying off the screen and jumping
back<00:03:57.239> on<00:03:57.270> they're<00:03:57.780> getting<00:03:58.290> all<00:03:58.410> fast<00:03:58.709> and

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
back on they're getting all fast and

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.570 
back on they're getting all fast and
everything<00:03:59.250> so<00:04:00.380> now<00:04:01.380> some<00:04:01.860> people<00:04:02.010> might<00:04:02.220> not

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
everything so now some people might not

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.330 
everything so now some people might not
want<00:04:02.910> them<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.510> collide<00:04:03.780> with<00:04:03.840> them<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.890> that's

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
want them to collide with them so that's

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.400 
want them to collide with them so that's
really<00:04:05.550> simple<00:04:05.790> just<00:04:06.060> take<00:04:06.300> off<00:04:06.450> take<00:04:07.200> this

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
really simple just take off take this

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.380 
really simple just take off take this
out<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.570> take<00:04:09.570> these<00:04:10.230> codes<00:04:10.560> out<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:12.239> that's

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
out and take these codes out so that's

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.330 
out and take these codes out so that's
pretty<00:04:12.540> simple<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:15.859> you<00:04:16.859> might<00:04:17.010> want<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.250> play

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
pretty simple and you might want to play

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.770 
pretty simple and you might want to play
was<00:04:17.489> in<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.640> bit<00:04:17.790> more<00:04:17.880> like<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.239> did<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.540> change

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
was in a bit more like I did and change

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.990 
was in a bit more like I did and change
it<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:18.959> like<00:04:19.200> sprite<00:04:19.470> index<00:04:19.829> equals<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.489> you

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
it to like sprite index equals and you

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.170 
it to like sprite index equals and you
can<00:04:21.150> have<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.419> random<00:04:21.870> like<00:04:22.410> I<00:04:22.530> did<00:04:23.180> because

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
can have a random like I did because

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.940 
can have a random like I did because
that<00:04:24.300> makes<00:04:24.510> it<00:04:24.630> really<00:04:24.720> cool<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.620> actually

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
that makes it really cool so I actually

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.860 
that makes it really cool so I actually
got<00:04:29.310> inspired<00:04:29.760> for<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:30.090> video<00:04:30.479> because<00:04:30.660> i

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
got inspired for this video because i
