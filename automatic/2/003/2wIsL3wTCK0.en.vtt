[MUSIC]

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.430
As we get closer to putting
a liner in the pond,

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.216
I decided to land some of our
materials that we would be using for

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:23.730
the coping stone in the waterfall.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.800
I know this rock is gonna
spark some questions.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.430
The bad news is I don't
have many answers for you.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.010
I don't have a name for the rock.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.080
It came out of the hills of Redlands
but it's pretty much unavailable.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.690
I've been in Redlands for nearly 20
years, never seen this rock before.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.650
I had an excavator up there doing
some work on the side of a hill

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.690
for a house.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.670
And they uncovered
some of this rock.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.450
So I grabbed it for this project and
I'm really excited about it.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.158
It's really angular,
it's really rich dark tones, and

00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:54.320
it's multi-colored, so
you see some rust colors,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.370
some browns,
even some edges of gray and blue.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.290
When it get's wet,
it's really beautiful, so

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.110
it's gonna be a really
nice piece in a waterfall.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.360
It's got nice ripples in it.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.150
When you are looking for a coping
stone or, when I am looking for

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.610
a coping stone on this particular
project, I want some flat top

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.700
stones that we can walk on, we can
sit on, dangle our feet in the pond.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.200
That is always a nice interactive
point for me when I am looking for

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.410
stones that can be on
the edge of the pond.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.080
When we work our way around
the backside of the pond towards

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.690
the waterfall,
then we'll start using some

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.570
stone that has maybe a little
more character across the top and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.730
we'll pop that stuff
up in the back end.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.990
So notice the size of these stones.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.470
They're pretty big.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.010
And I would encourage you to use
rocks that are big as you guys can

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.940
handle.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.770
If you can get a machine
into your backyard and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.800
you are comfortable using machines
get some bigger rock back there.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.500
If you're doing it all
by hand be careful and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.870
get stuff as big as you
can put in a wheelbarrow.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.390
Or maybe you can get a big dolly,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.820
but when you use big rocks like
this that's why the bonding is so

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.940
important because this
rock is very heavy.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.640
So when we put this rock out there,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.160
almost cantilevered into the water,
the bonding will support it.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.370
And if the earth
ever gets saturated,

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.320
the shelf won't start to collapse,
because we're using these big rocks.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.760
Now, we've integrated some
other sized stones in here.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.670
They're not all the same size.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.170
So we have some one footers, and 18
inchers, and some three footers and

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.660
we'll be intermixing them
around the edge of the pond.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.660
If you use all the same size stone,
like say, all two footers,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.110
you put all two footers
around the pod,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.940
it starts to look a little contrived
and it doesn't look as natural.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.050
So I'm gonna ask you to mix
up the sizes a little bit.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.340
It'll make your pond
look really interesting.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:50.340
