most<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.369> other<00:01:56.520> ones<00:01:56.670> will<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.090> come

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
most of the other ones will just come

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.300 
most of the other ones will just come
naturally<00:01:57.750> as<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.530> these<00:01:58.649> main<00:01:58.920> three

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310

for me to get was the chain killer here

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.330 
for me to get was the chain killer here
is<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.869> clip<00:02:07.049> where<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.320> got<00:02:07.590> my<00:02:07.710> first<00:02:07.979> chain

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
it is pretty vague on how much time you

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.230 
it is pretty vague on how much time you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
some people think it is as long as you

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.560 
some people think it is as long as you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
a tactical insertion I would also

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.790 
a tactical insertion I would also
suggest<00:02:36.420> putting<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.170> quick-draw<00:02:37.620> and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
suggest putting on quick-draw and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.740 
suggest putting on quick-draw and
dexterity<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.210> start<00:02:39.510> shooting

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
the enemies as fast as possible when

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.300 
the enemies as fast as possible when
they<00:02:42.210> start<00:02:42.480> spawning<00:02:42.750> both<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.860> planting

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
they start spawning both the planting

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.040 
they start spawning both the planting
and<00:02:44.550> defending<00:02:44.970> side<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.390> decent<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.020> I

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
and defending side are decent but I

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.080 
and defending side are decent but I
prefer<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.950> defending<00:02:47.370> side<00:02:47.520> personally

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
prefer the defending side personally

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.640 
prefer the defending side personally
because<00:02:48.330> it's<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.780> little<00:02:49.110> bit<00:02:49.230> better<00:02:49.380> of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
because it's just a little bit better of

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.040 
because it's just a little bit better of
a<00:02:50.340> spawn<00:02:50.670> trap<00:02:50.970> where<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.270> can<00:02:51.360> get<00:02:51.450> those

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
a spawn trap where you can get those
