00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.260
 good for this recipe that is the potatoes 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.110
 with cream and green chile this what 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:17.369
 let's use roasted green chile potatoes 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.080
 like this one I already bought it so roasted 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.730
 I think they call it good here 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.270
 parties call it green chile as in 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.930
 sound elsewhere here in the USA 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.160
 they call chile anaheim or chile california 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:35.190
 we are also going to use chicken broth 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.950
 cream pepper creams to your liking 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.230
 they are zero they are cream also in mexico 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.090
 I think they use what sour cream is 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.090
 in this case I am using 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.150
 this type of Central American cream I'm going to 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.280
 use half of this and half of 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.520
 this one of this other cream that is like 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.780
 creams or cream that good because we will 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.780
 chop the potatoes in cubes 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.950
 Well, here we have our potatoes 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.170
 I put them in a saucepan with 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.090
 dita look at this is the size of the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.290
 potatoes 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.440
 I do not know if you have an idea 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.910
 do not cut them too small, try to 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.210
 all are the same so they kidnap 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:26.920
 all at the same time that we're going to 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:30.090
 add water nothing more than birds do not 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 put more water 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.799
 so nothing else here are going to put a 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.450
 spoonful of salt and we're going to put them 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.860
 cook until the potatoes are tender 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.710
 but do not get upset that they are 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.969
 Cooked at your point do not give them much 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.140
 time because the potatoes have to 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.140
 be in strips ok 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.800
 Well let's put the cook 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.320
 covered please I had forgotten 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.190
 tell you to plug them and we're going to put them 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.900
 cook with a medium-low heat 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.540
 do not put them too high because it can be 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.740
 that they will be disrupted if they are 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.140
 they are boiling too much 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.690
 Well, here we have already chopped 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:36.140
 our green chile roasted in pieces 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.210
 if they have any or some of these chilies 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.190
 that have roasted and that is spicy 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.580
 put some milestone peaks so that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.320
 know that peak cited rich will ask 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.770
 why I do not give them many measures in 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.890
 the recipes I barely cook with 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.800
 simply I'm going to try the 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.530
 food that I like if I do not like it 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.200
 Well, I'm adding it 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.650
 ingredients whether it's consomme salt pepper 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.930
 garlic what I need then I have always 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.060
 fact that our palate is the one that 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.690
 is going to say if the food is good or 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.310
 something that is false we have to learn to 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.920
 season using our palate 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.950
 testing things and I think that's how it goes 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.370
 be much easier to learn to cook 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.400
 okay 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.530
 well then we go back with the others 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.079
 our parents were already ready 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.380
 the drains have to remain as well as 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:34.150
 in strips 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.709
 now we are going to add 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.709
 I'm going to add half of the cream this 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.709
 Central American 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.310
 and I'm going to add 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.220
 half of the cream has been just 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.240
 let's also add chili and 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.240
 we had chopped 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.330
 let's put some hair control 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.060
 this is what we are going to do 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.020
 it gets a little 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.259
 we are also going to put a little bit of 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.259
 Pepper 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.020
 and we will learn again the fire very 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.620
 short so that it is not going to take off 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.620
 the straws 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.420
 well then it was an interruption 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:57.310
 we follow since we have this yes we are going to 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.310
 stir very carefully 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.370
 so more open 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.630
 and we're going to bounce if they think it's missing 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.630
 more cream add more cream 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.300
 4 that will be to our liking should not 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.250
 of being very dry potatoes 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.320
 because afterwards if they are left over and in the 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:28.110
 reheated that's going to dry up a lot 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.110
 ok I'm going to put a little more cream 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:40.210
 I put more than is the Central American 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.210
 and well I understood 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.449
 you are going to try and go see if you 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:56.500
 you need more salt if you need more salt then 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.500
 they are going to add a little more to consume 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.749
 I'm missing one, not very little 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.770
 have less hours 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.270
 stir this is a very easy new and 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.270
 after accompanying or I 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.190
 any kind of meat is meat from 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.390
 pork and good look 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.390
 This was already 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.050
 and that's how a Mexican is 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.480
 until next time I hope they do it and 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.810
 to tell me how it went and if they 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.810
 taste
