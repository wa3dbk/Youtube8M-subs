software that we are going to be looking
at<00:01:37.910> today<00:01:38.240> well<00:01:39.050> so<00:01:39.440> let's<00:01:39.590> not<00:01:39.740> waste<00:01:39.920> any

at today well so let's not waste any

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.900 
at today well so let's not waste any
time<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:40.340> let's<00:01:40.640> get<00:01:40.790> started<00:01:41.180> with<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:42.140> sl4

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
time and let's get started with the sl4

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.590 
time and let's get started with the sl4
according<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.000> me<00:01:44.120> I<00:01:44.150> think<00:01:44.300> a<00:01:44.510> very

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
according to me I think a very

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.390 
according to me I think a very
interesting<00:01:44.720> thing<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.590> person<00:01:46.100> needs<00:01:46.280> to

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
interesting thing and a person needs to

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.890 
interesting thing and a person needs to
know<00:01:46.490> all<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:46.820> DJ<00:01:47.150> needs<00:01:47.330> to<00:01:47.450> know<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.690> how<00:01:47.870> to

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
know all the DJ needs to know is how to

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.470 
know all the DJ needs to know is how to
wire<00:01:48.260> his<00:01:48.470> equipment<00:01:49.010> so<00:01:49.520> I<00:01:49.790> think<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.360> it's

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
wire his equipment so I think that it's

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.000 
wire his equipment so I think that it's
very<00:01:50.660> necessary<00:01:50.810> that<00:01:51.170> though<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.530> sound<00:01:51.800> guy

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
very necessary that though the sound guy

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.530 
very necessary that though the sound guy
at<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.220> production<00:01:52.640> people<00:01:52.910> will<00:01:53.030> always<00:01:53.180> why

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
people think wiring is very difficult

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.560 
people think wiring is very difficult
anywhere<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.489> can<00:02:52.580> get<00:02:52.700> really<00:02:52.880> confusing<00:02:53.060> but

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
anywhere it can get really confusing but

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.110 
anywhere it can get really confusing but
really<00:02:54.140> it's<00:02:54.500> very<00:02:54.590> simple<00:02:55.160> what<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.850> need<00:02:56.000> to

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
really it's very simple what you need to

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.759 
really it's very simple what you need to
just<00:02:56.300> remember<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:56.959> whatever<00:02:57.170> goes<00:02:57.530> out

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
just remember is that whatever goes out

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.590 
just remember is that whatever goes out
comes<00:02:58.400> in<00:02:58.550> on<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.760> other<00:02:58.880> side<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.269> whichever

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
comes in on the other side and whichever

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.240 
comes in on the other side and whichever
is<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.720> inner<00:02:59.959> one<00:03:00.260> side<00:03:00.500> goes<00:03:00.709> on<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.920> output

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
is the inner one side goes on the output

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.310 
is the inner one side goes on the output
on<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.400> other<00:03:01.550> side<00:03:01.790> so<00:03:02.330> let<00:03:02.810> me<00:03:02.930> just<00:03:03.110> explain

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
on the other side so let me just explain

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.890 
on the other side so let me just explain
this<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:03.830> with<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.370> wiring<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.660> CD

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
this to you with the wiring the CD

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.960 
this to you with the wiring the CD
players<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.440> an<00:03:06.920> output<00:03:07.250> because<00:03:07.519> them<00:03:07.670> CDs

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
players is an output because them CDs

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.550 
players is an output because them CDs
are<00:03:08.120> inside<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.570> music<00:03:08.870> comes<00:03:09.019> out<00:03:09.200> from

are inside and the music comes out from

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.900 
are inside and the music comes out from
there<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:09.950> then<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.430> goes<00:03:10.610> into<00:03:10.760> the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
there and then it goes into the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.520 
there and then it goes into the
interface<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:11.720> if<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.959> CD<00:03:12.200> player<00:03:12.380> is<00:03:12.440> an

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
interface so if the CD player is an

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.990 
interface so if the CD player is an
output<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.280> simple<00:03:13.640> thing<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:13.850> need<00:03:13.970> to

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
output the simple thing you need to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.520 
output the simple thing you need to
remember<00:03:14.120> then<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.870> goes<00:03:15.050> into<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.380> input

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
remember then it goes into the input

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.949 
remember then it goes into the input
when<00:03:16.400> I'm<00:03:16.519> standing<00:03:16.850> behind<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.330> decks<00:03:17.510> that

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
when I'm standing behind the decks that

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.570 
when I'm standing behind the decks that
CD<00:03:18.260> player<00:03:18.290> becomes<00:03:18.650> my<00:03:18.860> right<00:03:19.070> side<00:03:19.310> CD

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
CD player becomes my right side CD

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.039 
CD player becomes my right side CD
player<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:19.880> this<00:03:20.269> one<00:03:20.480> becomes<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.810> left

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
player and this one becomes the left

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.170 
player and this one becomes the left
side<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.739> if<00:03:22.040> it's<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.370> right<00:03:22.549> side<00:03:22.760> CD<00:03:23.000> player

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
side so if it's a right side CD player

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.539 
side so if it's a right side CD player
I'm<00:03:23.329> gonna<00:03:23.720> put<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.019> an<00:03:24.110> input<00:03:24.350> two<00:03:25.010> over<00:03:25.310> here

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
I'm gonna put it an input two over here

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.250 
I'm gonna put it an input two over here
that's<00:03:26.060> right<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.570> what<00:03:26.690> I'm<00:03:26.780> just<00:03:26.810> gonna<00:03:27.019> do

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
that's right so what I'm just gonna do

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.410 
that's right so what I'm just gonna do
is<00:03:27.380> take<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.370> red<00:03:28.549> goes<00:03:28.760> in<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.970> red<00:03:29.150> the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
is take it the red goes in the red the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.840 
is take it the red goes in the red the
white<00:03:29.630> goes<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.079> white<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.489> we<00:03:31.489> plug<00:03:31.730> it

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
white goes in the white and we plug it

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.289 
white goes in the white and we plug it
in<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.989> input<00:03:33.709> two<00:03:33.980> because<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.730> CD<00:03:34.970> player<00:03:35.000> is

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
in in input two because the CD player is

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.840 
in in input two because the CD player is
the<00:03:35.480> output<00:03:35.660> just<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:36.860> way<00:03:37.040> once<00:03:37.549> we<00:03:37.640> take

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
the output just that way once we take

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.970 
the output just that way once we take
the<00:03:37.940> second<00:03:38.269> CD<00:03:38.510> player<00:03:38.720> which<00:03:39.049> is<00:03:39.079> my<00:03:39.380> left

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
the second CD player which is my left

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.979 
the second CD player which is my left
side<00:03:40.280> CD<00:03:40.579> player<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.940> goes<00:03:41.269> in<00:03:41.420> input<00:03:41.780> one

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
side CD player it goes in input one

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.780 
side CD player it goes in input one
there<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.070> go<00:03:43.250> again<00:03:43.489> it's<00:03:44.000> just<00:03:44.329> white<00:03:44.959> and

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
there you go again it's just white and

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.509 
there you go again it's just white and
red<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.480> both<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.260> inputs<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.829> both<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.310> CD

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
red so both the inputs and both the CD

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.340 
red so both the inputs and both the CD
players<00:03:49.730> are<00:03:49.910> now<00:03:50.120> connected<00:03:50.570> to<00:03:50.810> your<00:03:50.989> SL

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
players are now connected to your SL

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.229 
players are now connected to your SL
phone<00:03:51.590> well<00:03:52.070> you<00:03:52.100> need<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.579> connect<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:52.940> mixer

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
phone well you need to connect the mixer

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.610 
phone well you need to connect the mixer
as<00:03:53.360> well<00:03:53.570> right<00:03:53.780> because<00:03:54.170> otherwise<00:03:54.320> how<00:03:54.560> you

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
as well right because otherwise how you

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.740 
as well right because otherwise how you
going<00:03:54.829> to<00:03:54.890> mix<00:03:55.070> your<00:03:55.160> music<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:56.000> mixer<00:03:56.390> always

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
going to mix your music the mixer always

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.509 
going to mix your music the mixer always
becomes<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.140> input<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:57.980> sound<00:03:58.250> from<00:03:58.400> the

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
becomes the input so the sound from the

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.130 
becomes the input so the sound from the
CD<00:03:58.760> players<00:03:59.000> has<00:03:59.150> gone<00:03:59.390> into<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.720> interface

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
CD players has gone into the interface

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.750 
CD players has gone into the interface
and<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.410> needs<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.709> output<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.250> get<00:04:01.430> into<00:04:01.640> the

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
and it needs it output to get into the

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.370 
and it needs it output to get into the
input<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:02.540> just<00:04:02.810> like<00:04:02.930> why<00:04:03.049> I<00:04:03.079> told<00:04:03.260> you

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
input so just like why I told you

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.080 
input so just like why I told you
whatever<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.130> in<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.340> input<00:04:04.610> on<00:04:04.730> one<00:04:04.880> side

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
whatever is in the input on one side

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.520 
whatever is in the input on one side
goes<00:04:05.329> on<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:05.540> output<00:04:05.840> on<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.019> other<00:04:06.110> side

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
goes on the output on the other side

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.190 
goes on the output on the other side
therefore<00:04:07.370> what<00:04:07.910> I'm<00:04:08.030> going<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.269> do<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.600> my

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
therefore what I'm going to do is my

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.690 
therefore what I'm going to do is my
right<00:04:09.470> side<00:04:09.709> CD<00:04:09.950> player<00:04:10.130> of<00:04:10.250> course<00:04:10.280> will<00:04:10.549> come

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
right side CD player of course will come

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.039 
right side CD player of course will come
on<00:04:10.820> my<00:04:10.910> right<00:04:11.150> channel<00:04:11.450> in<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.600> mixer<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:11.930> the

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
on my right channel in the mixer and the

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.509 
on my right channel in the mixer and the
left<00:04:12.260> side<00:04:12.440> CD<00:04:12.680> player<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.160> left<00:04:13.340> channel

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
left side CD player on the left channel

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.390 
left side CD player on the left channel
of<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.820> mixer<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.750> this<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:15.470> my<00:04:15.650> right<00:04:16.130> side

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
of the mixer so this is my right side

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.039 
of the mixer so this is my right side
channel<00:04:16.729> which<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:17.120> on<00:04:17.359> channel<00:04:17.630> 2<00:04:17.780> over<00:04:18.019> here

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
channel which is on channel 2 over here

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.740 
channel which is on channel 2 over here
and<00:04:18.410> because<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.340> right<00:04:19.519> CD<00:04:19.820> player<00:04:20.030> was<00:04:20.539> on

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
and because the right CD player was on

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.460 
and because the right CD player was on
the<00:04:20.870> input<00:04:21.320> 2<00:04:21.769> I'm<00:04:21.979> going<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.520> put<00:04:22.729> this<00:04:23.470> just

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
the input 2 I'm going to put this just

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.070 
the input 2 I'm going to put this just
like<00:04:24.710> this<00:04:24.860> over<00:04:25.039> here<00:04:25.190> in<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.950> output<00:04:28.400> -<00:04:29.080> so

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
like this over here in the output - so

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.850 
like this over here in the output - so
the

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860
