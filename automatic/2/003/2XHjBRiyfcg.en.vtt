00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.510 
make the smaller circle around that
small<00:00:50.700> circle<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.420> smaller<00:00:51.780> circle<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
small circle the smaller circle and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.260 
small circle the smaller circle and
through<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:55.400> circle<00:00:56.400> that<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.700> made<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
through the circle that you made that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.539 
through the circle that you made that
went<00:00:57.630> around<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.990> smaller<00:00:58.230> circle<00:01:01.640> okay<00:01:04.549> then

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
went around the smaller circle okay then

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.609 
went around the smaller circle okay then
you<00:01:05.700> want<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> put<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> back<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:07.079> your<00:01:07.350> horse

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.719 

and<00:01:11.359> then<00:01:12.359> measure<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.590> where<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.070> throat<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and then measure to where the throat is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.160 
and then measure to where the throat is
from<00:01:15.509> there<00:01:15.749> and<00:01:16.340> do<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:18.149> both<00:01:18.420> strands

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
from there and do with both strands

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.109 
from there and do with both strands
you're<00:01:19.289> just<00:01:19.499> gonna<00:01:19.679> do<00:01:19.859> a<00:01:19.890> basic<00:01:20.310> granny<00:01:20.820> knot

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
you're just gonna do a basic granny knot

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.109 
you're just gonna do a basic granny knot
here<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:22.399> think<00:01:23.399> that's<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.030> called

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
here I think that's what that's called

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.429 
here I think that's what that's called
anyway<00:01:28.609> and<00:01:29.609> then<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.789> want<00:01:30.149> to<00:01:30.329> measure<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
anyway and then you want to measure to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.270 
anyway and then you want to measure to
your<00:01:31.560> horse<00:01:31.799> again<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.890> looks<00:01:35.069> like<00:01:35.249> I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
your horse again and it looks like I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.760 
your horse again and it looks like I
made<00:01:35.609> the<00:01:36.420> space<00:01:36.749> between<00:01:37.049> there<00:01:37.469> and<00:01:37.499> they're

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
made the space between there and they're

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.200 
made the space between there and they're
a<00:01:37.799> little<00:01:37.979> bit<00:01:38.219> too<00:01:38.369> big<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.579> I'm<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.149> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
a little bit too big so I'm going to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.319 
a little bit too big so I'm going to
tighten<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:40.280> see<00:01:41.280> if<00:01:41.399> that<00:01:41.640> works<00:01:41.909> yeah

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
tighten it see if that works yeah

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.800 
tighten it see if that works yeah
that'll<00:01:42.630> work<00:01:42.859> so<00:01:43.859> then<00:01:44.039> from<00:01:44.490> there<00:01:44.850> you're

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
that'll work so then from there you're

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.950 
that'll work so then from there you're
going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.229> separate<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.920> two<00:01:46.950> pieces<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.969> yarn

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
going to separate the two pieces of yarn

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.700 
going to separate the two pieces of yarn
and<00:01:49.549> with<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.789> piece<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.170> make

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and with one piece you're going to make

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.609 
and with one piece you're going to make
another<00:01:52.979> round<00:01:53.700> part<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.329> you're<00:01:55.229> gonna<00:01:55.319> take

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
another round part and you're gonna take

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.120 
another round part and you're gonna take
that<00:01:55.649> off<00:01:55.979> your<00:01:56.159> horse<00:01:56.810> bring<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.170> piece<00:01:58.679> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that off your horse bring this piece the

that off your horse bring this piece the
same<00:01:59.399> piece<00:01:59.700> around<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:01.310> through<00:02:02.310> there

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
same piece around and through there

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.770 
same piece around and through there
through<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.520> bigger<00:02:05.880> circle<00:02:06.389> that<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.600> just

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
through that bigger circle that you just

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.979 
through that bigger circle that you just
made

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.849 

and<00:02:11.989> I'm<00:02:12.260> going<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:13.870> I'm<00:02:14.870> going<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.349> try<00:02:15.620> and

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
and I'm going to I'm going to try and

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.559 
and I'm going to I'm going to try and
make<00:02:16.129> this<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.340> little<00:02:16.459> bit<00:02:16.790> smaller<00:02:17.060> because<00:02:17.299> I

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
make this a little bit smaller because I

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.140 
make this a little bit smaller because I
think<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.900> made<00:02:18.079> it<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.319> little<00:02:18.469> bit<00:02:18.680> too<00:02:18.859> big

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
think I made it a little bit too big

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:29.309 
think I made it a little bit too big
there<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:20.209> go<00:02:20.890> I'm<00:02:21.890> going<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.280> pull<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.489> tight

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.990 

okay

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.690 

so<00:02:35.000> then<00:02:35.560> I'm<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.920> put<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.189> back<00:02:37.310> on<00:02:37.549> my

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
so then I'm going to put it back on my

so then I'm going to put it back on my
horse<00:02:37.939> here<00:02:38.329> I'm<00:02:39.129> going<00:02:40.129> to<00:02:41.049> measure<00:02:42.049> that<00:02:42.470> up

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
horse here I'm going to measure that up

long I'm going to cut it even smaller
because<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.560> don't<00:05:29.770> want<00:05:29.920> it<00:05:30.010> to<00:05:30.130> be<00:05:30.250> too<00:05:31.050> bulky

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
because I don't want it to be too bulky

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.640 
because I don't want it to be too bulky
okay<00:05:34.980> so<00:05:35.980> now<00:05:36.160> I'm<00:05:36.340> going<00:05:36.580> to<00:05:36.730> flip<00:05:37.350> that<00:05:38.350> over

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
okay so now I'm going to flip that over

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.880 
okay so now I'm going to flip that over
again<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:40.800> then<00:05:41.800> I'm<00:05:41.950> going<00:05:42.280> to<00:05:42.310> thread<00:05:43.890> this

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
again and then I'm going to thread this

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.850 
again and then I'm going to thread this
piece<00:05:45.220> of<00:05:45.430> yarn<00:05:45.580> through<00:05:46.000> that<00:05:46.120> hole<00:05:46.510> that<00:05:46.930> we

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
piece of yarn through that hole that we

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.960 
piece of yarn through that hole that we
once<00:05:48.070> made<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:53.130> a<00:05:54.130> lot<00:05:54.340> of<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:54.550> times<00:05:54.760> I'll

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
once made and a lot of the times I'll

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.550 
once made and a lot of the times I'll
glue<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.300> end<00:05:55.480> of<00:05:55.630> this<00:05:55.720> because<00:05:56.320> it<00:05:56.470> will

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
glue the end of this because it will

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.000 
glue the end of this because it will
free<00:05:58.170> but<00:05:59.170> just<00:05:59.560> to<00:05:59.710> show<00:05:59.920> you<00:05:59.980> right<00:06:00.220> now<00:06:00.280> I

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
free but just to show you right now I

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.720 
free but just to show you right now I
won't<00:06:04.080> because<00:06:05.080> it's<00:06:05.110> quick<00:06:05.530> and<00:06:06.520> I'm<00:06:06.610> gonna

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
won't because it's quick and I'm gonna

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.210 
won't because it's quick and I'm gonna
bring<00:06:07.000> that<00:06:07.060> under<00:06:10.710> tighten<00:06:11.710> that<00:06:11.830> a<00:06:11.890> little

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
bring that under tighten that a little

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.430 
bring that under tighten that a little
bit<00:06:12.370> so<00:06:12.640> I<00:06:12.940> get<00:06:13.180> a<00:06:13.390> little<00:06:13.690> bit<00:06:13.840> more<00:06:14.050> of<00:06:14.140> a<00:06:14.230> loop

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
bit so I get a little bit more of a loop

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.920 
bit so I get a little bit more of a loop
there<00:06:14.710> so<00:06:14.950> I<00:06:15.010> can<00:06:15.630> thread<00:06:16.630> it<00:06:16.690> back<00:06:16.780> through

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
there so I can thread it back through

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.760 
there so I can thread it back through
and<00:06:17.410> then<00:06:17.500> I<00:06:17.970> thread<00:06:18.970> it<00:06:19.090> back<00:06:19.120> through<00:06:22.770> except

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
and then I thread it back through except

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:38.460 
and then I thread it back through except
