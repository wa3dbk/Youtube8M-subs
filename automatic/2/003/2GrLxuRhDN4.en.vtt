are<00:02:11.170> super<00:02:11.650> super<00:02:11.890> tight

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
are super super tight

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.069 
are super super tight
and<00:02:13.030> some<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.269> them<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.420> can't<00:02:13.629> even<00:02:13.689> get<00:02:13.840> into

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
and some of them I can't even get into

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.170 
and some of them I can't even get into
so<00:02:17.079> I<00:02:17.500> know<00:02:17.799> that<00:02:18.010> muscle<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.790> smaller<00:02:19.030> than

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
so I know that muscle is smaller than

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.520 
so I know that muscle is smaller than
fats<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.569> pound<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.810> muscle<00:02:19.930> smaller<00:02:20.290> than

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
fats a pound of muscle smaller than

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.789 
fats a pound of muscle smaller than
pound<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.859> fat<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.909> I<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:23.260> know<00:02:23.349> I<00:02:23.379> don't<00:02:23.469> think

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
pound of fat so I you know I don't think

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.990 
pound of fat so I you know I don't think
it's<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.069> mean<00:02:24.219> I'm<00:02:24.310> sure<00:02:24.549> I've<00:02:24.670> gained<00:02:24.849> muscle

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
it's I mean I'm sure I've gained muscle

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000 
it's I mean I'm sure I've gained muscle
too<00:02:25.299> but<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.510> don't<00:02:25.599> think<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:26.590> that's<00:02:26.829> I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
too but I don't think that that's I

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.399 
too but I don't think that that's I
think<00:02:27.069> it<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.430> because<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.200> said<00:02:29.260> my

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
think it is that because like I said my

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.599 
think it is that because like I said my
genes<00:02:29.680> are<00:02:29.799> smaller<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.579> a<00:02:30.909> tiger<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.189> and<00:02:33.189> I'm

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
genes are smaller so a tiger so and I'm

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:34.830

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.289 
know I think pretty red I don't know if
it's<00:03:20.109> gonna<00:03:20.229> fade<00:03:20.470> like<00:03:20.799> like<00:03:21.430> my<00:03:21.579> I<00:03:21.819> had<00:03:22.180> my

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
it's gonna fade like like my I had my

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.610 
it's gonna fade like like my I had my
breast<00:03:22.479> reduction<00:03:22.870> my<00:03:22.959> scars<00:03:23.199> were<00:03:23.319> red<00:03:23.470> like

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
breast reduction my scars were red like

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.589 
breast reduction my scars were red like
this<00:03:23.769> but<00:03:23.949> then<00:03:24.129> I<00:03:24.220> was<00:03:24.340> big<00:03:24.549> but<00:03:24.579> they're<00:03:25.359> red

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
this but then I was big but they're red

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.879 
this but then I was big but they're red
like<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.139> then<00:03:26.229> they<00:03:26.349> took<00:03:26.500> sigh<00:03:26.709> didn't

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
like this and then they took sigh didn't

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.080 
like this and then they took sigh didn't
really<00:03:27.069> pay<00:03:27.220> attention<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.579> how<00:03:27.669> long<00:03:27.909> they

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
really pay attention to how long they

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.740 
really pay attention to how long they
took<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.569> fade<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:30.010> now<00:03:30.370> they're<00:03:30.579> faded<00:03:30.970> but<00:03:31.269> um

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
took to fade so now they're faded but um

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.589 
took to fade so now they're faded but um
you<00:03:32.590> know<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.979> guess<00:03:33.970> only<00:03:34.090> time<00:03:34.239> will<00:03:34.449> tell

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
you know I guess only time will tell

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.740 
you know I guess only time will tell
with<00:03:35.169> that<00:03:36.030> there's<00:03:37.030> your<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:37.299> side<00:03:37.569> is

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750

with that there's your this side is
still<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:38.319> mean<00:03:38.500> I've<00:03:38.709> left<00:03:38.979> it<00:03:39.129> alone<00:03:39.220> it's

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
still I mean I've left it alone it's

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.990 
still I mean I've left it alone it's
still<00:03:39.879> just<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.510> don't<00:03:40.900> know<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.260> bigger<00:03:41.979> it<00:03:42.879> was

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
still just I don't know a bigger it was

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.909 
still just I don't know a bigger it was
a<00:03:43.060> big<00:03:43.269> scab<00:03:43.599> there<00:03:43.930> after<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.440> dog<00:03:44.680> ear

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.780 
a big scab there after the dog ear
correction<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:46.199> you<00:03:47.199> know<00:03:47.340> maybe<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:48.579> from

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
correction so you know maybe it's from

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.860 
correction so you know maybe it's from
that<00:03:48.849> I<00:03:49.060> don't<00:03:49.359> know<00:03:52.379> there's<00:03:53.379> your<00:03:53.739> scar<00:03:54.040> and

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
that I don't know there's your scar and

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.089 
that I don't know there's your scar and
the<00:03:55.870> belly<00:03:56.109> button<00:03:56.439> I<00:03:58.709> don't<00:03:59.709> know<00:03:59.859> if<00:03:59.979> it's

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
the belly button I don't know if it's

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.490 
the belly button I don't know if it's
focusing<00:04:00.699> it's<00:04:00.849> probably<00:04:01.150> not<00:04:01.269> but<00:04:02.639> you<00:04:03.639> know

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
focusing it's probably not but you know

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.039 
focusing it's probably not but you know
there<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.560> go<00:04:05.739> so<00:04:05.979> there's<00:04:06.129> my<00:04:06.340> stomach<00:04:07.049> you

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
there you go so there's my stomach you

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.249 
there you go so there's my stomach you
know<00:04:08.729> not<00:04:09.729> much<00:04:09.970> has<00:04:10.150> changed<00:04:10.180> you<00:04:10.930> know<00:04:11.049> from

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:11.259 
know not much has changed you know from

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.009 
know not much has changed you know from
the<00:04:11.379> last<00:04:11.590> month's<00:04:12.009> video<00:04:12.419> but<00:04:13.419> at<00:04:13.659> least<00:04:13.840> I

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
the last month's video but at least I

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.310 
the last month's video but at least I
can<00:04:14.079> see<00:04:14.409> like<00:04:14.709> some<00:04:14.949> of<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.129> AB<00:04:15.519> definition

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
