00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.850
 I'm Jose Luis Paganini 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.710
 one of the members of the transport 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.130
 together with my brother july and I'm going to 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.019
 pabla and we are here with the people of 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.010
 kobryn 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.010
 standing 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.840
 all device more like blue two 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:33.690
 blankets following good result that 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:36.719
 we had with the device which 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.149
 we notice a decrease in the consumption of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.760
 gas oil pretty important that in 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.949
 our case for our satisfaction 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.949
 walked about 10% 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.900
 of the reduction of consumption happening in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.600
 an absorbent 35 of about 39 or 40 liters 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.900
 from average to 34 35 liters and up to 33 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.510
 liters 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.730
 now let's put the other star 2035 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.070
 I think I have back 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.360
 that although it is cheaper to manufacture 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.000
 two 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.070
 it was more economical let's see now what 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.960
 results give us always having the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.020
 expectation we also place it in a 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.320
 seat 113 who was here to my 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.300
 backs 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.190
 what is a truck that goes more or less in 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:31.050
 37 liters of consumption and also looking 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:35.100
 reduce it by 5 to 10 percent 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.660
 that is not an electronic truck 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.259
 like the others so let's see how 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:46.050
 It is carried with a pump injection 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.770
 conventional linear then surely 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.970
 As expected, they are going well 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.539
 treated without convened then a whole 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.910
 floats the drop of about 20 trucks in the 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.490
 property there are some more threads are 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.430
 working we are making trips 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.880
 permanent to san juan 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.980
 to several places in the country they cover all the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.840
 country josÃ© did the whole country 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.450
 international we are also 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 processing if what is changed 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.110
 international 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.410
 and we hope to have it in about three months 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.190
 more or less since they are paperwork 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.620
 there is a little more dull but good 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.020
 transportation idea to keep growing and 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.130
 due to the high costs of diesel 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.740
 that as any company is the let's say the 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.070
 most expensive input that we have 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:40.170
 we are trying to lower the costs of 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.210
 kobryn is a more important tool 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.970
 mentally 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.610
 good luis we appreciate your words and 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.350
 we hope to have the same success with these 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.340
 units that we have had with the other 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.390
 think I do not rule out but good 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.390
 thank you very much
