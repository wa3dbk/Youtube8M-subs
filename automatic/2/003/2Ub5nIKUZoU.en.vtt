caller<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.789> team<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.420> there's<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.200> much

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
caller for this team so there's so much

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.860 
caller for this team so there's so much
variance<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.160> can<00:02:11.340> happen<00:02:11.540> with<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> start

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
Charlie and guys like scar already have

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.170 
Charlie and guys like scar already have
a<00:05:18.950> head<00:05:19.190> start<00:05:19.400> on<00:05:19.520> that<00:05:19.669> they've<00:05:20.000> established

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
a head start on that they've established

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.820 
a head start on that they've established
these<00:05:20.600> relationships<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.440> it'll<00:05:21.560> be<00:05:21.620> much

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
these relationships and it'll be much

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.680 
these relationships and it'll be much
easier<00:05:22.010> for<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.550> teams<00:05:22.790> to<00:05:22.880> trust<00:05:23.270> them<00:05:23.479> I

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
easier for the teams to trust them I

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.120 
easier for the teams to trust them I
think<00:05:24.020> it's<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.139> two<00:05:24.440> teams<00:05:24.620> as<00:05:24.800> well<00:05:24.830> that

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
think it's the two teams as well that

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.250
