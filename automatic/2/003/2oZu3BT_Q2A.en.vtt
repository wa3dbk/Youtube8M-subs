splits<00:00:17.190> again<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.580> love<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.180> fact<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.510> as

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
splits again I love the fact that as

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.240 
splits again I love the fact that as
soon<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:18.990> those<00:00:19.140> doors<00:00:19.410> open<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.890> they<00:00:20.039> get

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
soon as those doors open that they get

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.490 
soon as those doors open that they get
mobile<00:00:20.670> they<00:00:21.240> go<00:00:21.420> very<00:00:21.449> quick<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.199> different

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
mobile they go very quick to different

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.950 
mobile they go very quick to different
capture<00:00:22.859> points<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.880> I'm<00:00:24.000> guessing<00:00:24.930> that

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
capture points and I'm guessing that

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.140 
capture points and I'm guessing that
Isaiah<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.010> Tirzah<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.699> going<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> try<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
Isaiah and Tirzah are going to try and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.230 
Isaiah and Tirzah are going to try and
hold<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> center<00:00:28.400> but<00:00:29.400> they<00:00:29.490> normally<00:00:30.029> don't

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
hold the center but they normally don't

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.389 
hold the center but they normally don't
bring<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.689> lot<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.900> damage<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> party<00:00:31.890> but

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
bring a lot of damage to the party but

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.040 
bring a lot of damage to the party but
since<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> warrior<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.390> guardian<00:00:33.870> they

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
since it's a warrior and a guardian they

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.220 
since it's a warrior and a guardian they
bring<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.350> lot<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.680> defense<00:00:35.750> right<00:00:36.750> which<00:00:36.960> makes

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
bring a lot of defense right which makes

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
bring a lot of defense right which makes
it<00:00:37.350> obviously<00:00:37.829> very<00:00:38.129> very<00:00:38.340> difficult<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> kill

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
it obviously very very difficult to kill

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.940 
it obviously very very difficult to kill
that<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> trebuchet<00:00:40.500> from<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
that we do see the trebuchet from the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.400 
that we do see the trebuchet from the
ArenaNet<00:00:41.460> team<00:00:41.700> they're<00:00:42.540> continuing<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> fire

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
ArenaNet team they're continuing to fire

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.860 
ArenaNet team they're continuing to fire
now<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.160> assume<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.789> there's<00:00:45.120> friendly<00:00:45.570> fire

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
now I assume that there's friendly fire

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.319 
now I assume that there's friendly fire
as<00:00:46.110> well<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> trebuchet<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.059> not

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
as well with the trebuchet there is not

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.170 
as well with the trebuchet there is not
actually<00:00:48.660> oh<00:00:49.219> okay<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.550> makes<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> huge

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
actually oh okay it makes it a huge

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.900 
actually oh okay it makes it a huge
advantage<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.989> huge<00:00:52.230> hang<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:53.879> only

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
advantage for a huge hang on so not only

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.000 
advantage for a huge hang on so not only
are<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.539> characters<00:00:55.079> doing<00:00:55.350> damage<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:55.920> if

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
are the characters doing damage but if

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.229 
are the characters doing damage but if
you<00:00:56.100> could<00:00:56.219> supplement<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you could supplement that with a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.970 
you could supplement that with a
trebuchet<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.350> don't<00:00:58.530> hurt<00:00:58.800> your

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
trebuchet because you don't hurt your

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.000 
trebuchet because you don't hurt your
teammates<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> huge<00:01:00.449> huge

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
teammates and that is a huge huge

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.229 
teammates and that is a huge huge
opportunity<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.219> control<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.670> point<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
opportunity to control that point and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
opportunity to control that point and
one<00:01:03.480> thing<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> remember<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.229> especially<00:01:04.769> in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
one thing to remember is especially in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.010 
one thing to remember is especially in
the<00:01:04.949> center<00:01:05.369> area<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.150> very<00:01:06.570> close

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the center area it's very very close

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.530 
the center area it's very very close
area<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.280> good<00:01:08.490> shot<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> knock

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
area so one good shot is going to knock

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
area so one good shot is going to knock
everybody's<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> interrupt<00:01:10.770> all<00:01:11.159> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310

for the spawn back in and that means

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.350 
for the spawn back in and that means
that<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.130> mean<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> out<00:01:20.520> right<00:01:20.670> now<00:01:20.850> controlling

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
on blue is now getting neutralized as

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.910 
on blue is now getting neutralized as
well<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:30.659> looks<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.590> looks<00:01:31.650> like

though is you gotta you gotta figure

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420 
though is you gotta you gotta figure
that<00:01:45.390> he's<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:45.990> coming<00:01:46.290> back<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
that he's going to be coming back and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.670 
that he's going to be coming back and
not<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> 11<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> reading<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.960> lost<00:01:49.320> both

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
not going to 11 the reading is lost both

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.490 
not going to 11 the reading is lost both
their<00:01:49.710> points<00:01:50.340> though<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:52.049> blue<00:01:52.320> team

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
their points though now so blue team

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.370 
their points though now so blue team
looks<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.280> they're<00:01:53.430> able<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.759> get

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
looks like that they're able to get

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.870 
looks like that they're able to get
hopefully<00:01:55.380> two<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> three<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> board

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
hopefully two of the three on the board

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
hopefully two of the three on the board
maybe<00:01:57.360> three<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.960> three<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> center<00:01:58.649> is

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
maybe three of three the center is

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
maybe three of three the center is
normally<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.460> hard<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.969> take<00:02:00.240> they<00:02:00.600> took

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
normally really hard to take they took

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.289 
normally really hard to take they took
it<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.530> go<00:02:01.710> get<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.250> whoa<00:02:02.549> Nelly<00:02:03.030> who

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
it there we go get one whoa Nelly who

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.719 
it there we go get one whoa Nelly who
points<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> board<00:02:04.140> now<00:02:04.640> they'll<00:02:05.640> be

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
points on the board now they'll be

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.880 
points on the board now they'll be
getting<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.969> lot<00:02:06.149> more<00:02:06.180> points<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.680> looks

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
getting a lot more points here it looks

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.040 
getting a lot more points here it looks
like<00:02:08.099> also<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.789> wit<00:02:09.000> meal<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.869> attention

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
like also the wit meal is a attention

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.620 
like also the wit meal is a attention
now<00:02:11.440> at<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:11.770> point<00:02:12.040> we<00:02:12.760> still<00:02:13.000> have<00:02:13.180> John<00:02:13.510> on

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
now at this point we still have John on

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.240 
now at this point we still have John on
the<00:02:13.660> trebuchet<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.290> looks<00:02:14.620> like<00:02:14.830> bringing

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the trebuchet it looks like bringing

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.880 
the trebuchet it looks like bringing
rain<00:02:15.490> but<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.270> they've<00:02:16.900> got<00:02:17.140> two<00:02:17.380> points<00:02:17.770> on

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
rain but it they've got two points on

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.010 
rain but it they've got two points on
the<00:02:18.040> board<00:02:18.250> which<00:02:19.150> means<00:02:19.390> all<00:02:19.570> they<00:02:19.810> really

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
the board which means all they really

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.100 
the board which means all they really
need<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.470> do<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.620> just<00:02:20.980> hold<00:02:21.220> out<00:02:21.460> but<00:02:22.110> they

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
need to do is just hold out but they

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.500 
need to do is just hold out but they
lack<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.440> lot<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:23.920> defensive<00:02:24.370> character<00:02:24.850> they

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
lack a lot of defensive character they

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.150 
lack a lot of defensive character they
don't<00:02:25.750> have<00:02:25.960> anything<00:02:26.290> that's<00:02:26.650> really<00:02:27.010> able

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
don't have anything that's really able

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.000 
don't have anything that's really able
to<00:02:27.370> hold<00:02:27.550> strong<00:02:27.910> maybe<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.870> engineer<00:02:29.470> but

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
to hold strong maybe the engineer but

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.590 
to hold strong maybe the engineer but
when<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.220> got<00:02:30.370> an<00:02:30.520> Ellie<00:02:30.760> you've<00:02:31.090> got<00:02:31.240> a<00:02:31.270> thief

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
when you got an Ellie you've got a thief

when you got an Ellie you've got a thief
those<00:02:31.840> guys<00:02:32.020> are<00:02:32.200> very<00:02:32.350> squishy<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:32.950> they

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
those guys are very squishy and they

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.000 
those guys are very squishy and they
need<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.400> stay<00:02:34.150> mobile<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:35.200> almost<00:02:35.440> seems<00:02:35.830> that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
need to stay mobile it almost seems that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.440 
need to stay mobile it almost seems that
in<00:02:36.130> this<00:02:36.250> situation<00:02:36.640> if<00:02:37.090> they're<00:02:37.240> going<00:02:37.390> to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
in this situation if they're going to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.300 
in this situation if they're going to
put<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> lot<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.870> focus<00:02:38.170> there<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.920> center

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
put a lot of focus there on the center

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.410 
put a lot of focus there on the center
even<00:02:39.610> though<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.820> can<00:02:40.030> be<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.210> very

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
even though it can be a very

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.990 
even though it can be a very
advantageous<00:02:40.870> point<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:42.370> maybe<00:02:42.640> they<00:02:42.820> need

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
advantageous point that maybe they need

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.080 
advantageous point that maybe they need
to<00:02:43.030> focus<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> points<00:02:44.140> on<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.290> outside

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
to focus on the points on the outside

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.670 
to focus on the points on the outside
right<00:02:46.090> now<00:02:46.120> Red<00:02:46.600> Team<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.050> arena<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.440> team

clock tower is only being it's only
contention<00:02:54.580> with<00:02:54.760> one<00:02:55.090> elementalist<00:02:56.460> from

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
contention with one elementalist from

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.070 
contention with one elementalist from
the<00:02:57.580> blue<00:02:57.760> team<00:02:58.000> yeah<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.540> does<00:02:58.720> look<00:02:58.750> like<00:02:59.020> a

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
the blue team yeah it does look like a

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.900 
the blue team yeah it does look like a
Rena<00:02:59.380> net<00:02:59.590> regroup<00:03:00.130> they<00:03:00.370> were<00:03:00.460> able<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.700> take

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
Rena net regroup they were able to take

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.820 
Rena net regroup they were able to take
their<00:03:01.060> two<00:03:01.300> points<00:03:01.660> back<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.110> center's<00:03:02.560> is

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
their two points back the center's is

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.480 
their two points back the center's is
definitely<00:03:03.640> under<00:03:03.910> attack<00:03:04.240> again<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:06.370> it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
definitely under attack again but it

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.920 
definitely under attack again but it
looks<00:03:06.670> like<00:03:06.850> John<00:03:07.090> Peters<00:03:07.480> who's<00:03:07.630> giving

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
looks like John Peters who's giving

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.660 
looks like John Peters who's giving
support<00:03:08.110> at<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> windmill<00:03:09.010> he's<00:03:09.220> sending<00:03:09.580> in

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
some treb shots as we could probably see

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.580 
some treb shots as we could probably see
here<00:03:11.770> boom<00:03:12.520> there's<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.090> huge<00:03:13.600> explosion<00:03:14.050> looks

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.660 
is kind of backed out a little bit out
of<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.630> area<00:03:22.810> which<00:03:23.230> is<00:03:23.410> it's<00:03:24.160> good<00:03:24.489> because

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
of the area which is it's good because

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.070 
of the area which is it's good because
you<00:03:24.910> don't<00:03:25.090> want<00:03:25.300> to<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:25.630> don't<00:03:25.780> want<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.959> die

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
you don't want to you don't want to die

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.720 
you don't want to you don't want to die
obviously<00:03:26.470> but<00:03:26.920> it's<00:03:27.040> really<00:03:27.250> bad<00:03:27.400> because

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
obviously but it's really bad because

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.630 
obviously but it's really bad because
now<00:03:27.940> you're<00:03:28.120> not<00:03:28.270> taking<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.660> capture<00:03:29.170> point

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
now you're not taking that capture point

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.110 
now you're not taking that capture point
it's<00:03:30.640> right<00:03:31.209> now<00:03:31.360> 185<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.620> 119<00:03:33.340> still<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.730> fairly

towards<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:12.910> windmill<00:04:13.420> they've<00:04:13.630> got<00:04:13.810> an<00:04:13.959> L

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
towards the windmill they've got an L

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.009 
towards the windmill they've got an L
alone<00:04:14.650> elementalist<00:04:15.400> there<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:15.940> there<00:04:16.480> is<00:04:16.630> no

opposition<00:04:17.590> at<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.760> windmill<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.390> it<00:04:19.450> looks

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
opposition at the windmill so it looks

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.710 
opposition at the windmill so it looks
like<00:04:20.049> arenanet<00:04:20.710> could<00:04:20.919> be<00:04:21.070> taking<00:04:21.489> a

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
like arenanet could be taking a

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.420 
like arenanet could be taking a
three-point<00:04:22.720> advantage<00:04:22.930> with<00:04:23.560> all<00:04:23.800> points

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
three-point advantage with all points

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.420 
three-point advantage with all points
under<00:04:25.240> their<00:04:25.479> control<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:26.620> windmill<00:04:27.009> is<00:04:27.220> just

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
under their control the windmill is just

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.240 
under their control the windmill is just
moments<00:04:27.639> away<00:04:28.000> from<00:04:28.180> getting<00:04:29.050> captured<00:04:29.830> by

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
moments away from getting captured by

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.150 
moments away from getting captured by
ArenaNet<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.509> is<00:04:31.780> all<00:04:32.050> three<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.979> we

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
ArenaNet and that is all three and we

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.340 
ArenaNet and that is all three and we
will<00:04:33.280> see<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.759> point<00:04:34.090> all<00:04:34.570> three<00:04:35.199> those

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
will see the point all three those

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.930 
will see the point all three those
points<00:04:35.650> are<00:04:35.710> going<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:35.889> start<00:04:36.070> skyrocketing

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
points are going to start skyrocketing

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.969 
points are going to start skyrocketing
now<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.300> blue<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:37.600> able<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.470> looks<00:04:38.620> like<00:04:38.680> blue

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
now that blue is able it looks like blue

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.560 
now that blue is able it looks like blue
is<00:04:39.009> going<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.280> try<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.490> neutralize<00:04:40.030> both<00:04:40.360> of

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
is going to try and neutralize both of

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.070 
is going to try and neutralize both of
them<00:04:42.030> but<00:04:43.030> again<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.570> looks<00:04:43.600> like<00:04:43.900> they're

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
them but again it looks like they're

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.810 
them but again it looks like they're
trying<00:04:44.259> to<00:04:44.500> go<00:04:44.620> for<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:44.949> center<00:04:45.250> point<00:04:45.550> and

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
trying to go for that center point and

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.180 
trying to go for that center point and
it's<00:04:46.090> just<00:04:46.509> even<00:04:47.110> if<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:47.560> get<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.889> you<00:04:47.919> gotta

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
it's just even if you get it you gotta

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.310 
it's just even if you get it you gotta
you<00:04:48.639> got<00:04:48.789> to<00:04:48.910> realize<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.630> he<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:49.990> Tirzah

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
you got to realize that is he and Tirzah

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.659 
you got to realize that is he and Tirzah
they're<00:04:50.590> just<00:04:50.800> going<00:04:50.889> to<00:04:50.979> be<00:04:51.100> right<00:04:51.430> back

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
they're just going to be right back

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.870 
they're just going to be right back
there<00:04:51.970> again<00:04:52.740> once<00:04:53.740> again<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.340> blue<00:04:54.610> team

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
there again once again the blue team

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.719 
there again once again the blue team
trying<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.270> take<00:04:55.509> out<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:56.430> necromancer<00:04:57.430> who

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
trying to take out the necromancer who

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:58.860 
trying to take out the necromancer who
is<00:04:57.789> controlling<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.300> trebuchet

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
is controlling the trebuchet

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.010 
is controlling the trebuchet
unfortunately<00:04:59.910> not<00:05:00.910> able<00:05:01.210> to<00:05:01.449> take<00:05:01.690> him<00:05:01.900> out

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
unfortunately not able to take him out

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.629 
unfortunately not able to take him out
and<00:05:02.259> so<00:05:02.380> they<00:05:02.410> will<00:05:02.620> have<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.949> continue<00:05:03.340> to

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
and so they will have to continue to

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.330 
and so they will have to continue to
deal<00:05:03.880> with<00:05:04.120> that<00:05:04.320> certainly<00:05:05.320> for<00:05:05.979> those<00:05:06.190> of

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
the point makes a lot of sense

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.689 
the point makes a lot of sense
strategically<00:06:28.630> and<00:06:29.409> it<00:06:29.889> did<00:06:30.070> allow<00:06:30.190> them<00:06:30.520> to

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
strategically and it did allow them to

going to be really hard for you to get
back<00:06:52.750> on<00:06:52.930> the<00:06:52.960> board<00:06:53.260> it<00:06:54.250> looks<00:06:54.430> like<00:06:54.490> three

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
back on the board it looks like three

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.230 
back on the board it looks like three
points<00:06:55.300> realized<00:06:56.400> letter<00:06:57.400> being<00:06:57.700> one<00:06:57.970> of<00:06:58.000> them

points realized letter being one of them

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.420 
points realized letter being one of them
but<00:06:58.420> center<00:06:58.810> is<00:06:58.930> also<00:06:59.320> they<00:06:59.590> got<00:06:59.770> trapped

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
but center is also they got trapped

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.520 
but center is also they got trapped
pretty<00:07:00.820> bad<00:07:01.030> there<00:07:01.300> so<00:07:01.480> I'm<00:07:01.570> goes<00:07:01.780> to<00:07:01.810> arenanet
