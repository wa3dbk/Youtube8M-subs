00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
motion just try just snapping see if

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.620 
motion just try just snapping see if
that<00:01:45.550> works<00:01:46.080> pretty<00:01:47.080> well<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:48.330> show<00:01:49.330> it<00:01:49.360> to

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
that works pretty well so show it to

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.940 
that works pretty well so show it to
your<00:01:49.720> in<00:01:49.840> slow<00:01:50.050> motion<00:01:50.259> so<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.619> can<00:01:50.710> see<00:01:50.860> out

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
your in slow motion so you can see out

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:01.330 
your in slow motion so you can see out
stuff

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.219 

the<00:02:01.880> only<00:02:02.060> reason<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.359> see<00:02:02.479> some<00:02:02.659> people<00:02:02.780> snap

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
the only reason you see some people snap

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.749 
the only reason you see some people snap
when<00:02:03.770> they<00:02:03.890> perform<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.310> trick<00:02:04.429> is<00:02:04.520> to

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
when they perform this trick is to

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.580 
when they perform this trick is to
either<00:02:05.240> hide<00:02:05.359> the<00:02:05.750> noise<00:02:05.899> because<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.320> sounds

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
either hide the noise because it sounds

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.740 
either hide the noise because it sounds
sort<00:02:06.679> of<00:02:06.829> strange<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:08.149> know<00:02:08.420> something's

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
sort of strange you know something's

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.140 
sort of strange you know something's
going<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:09.080> or<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:10.009> just<00:02:10.220> distract<00:02:10.640> them<00:02:10.879> you

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
going on or to just distract them you

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.190
