and<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.730> printing<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.239> I'm<00:00:48.329> pretty<00:00:48.570> sure

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
and like printing but I'm pretty sure

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.110 
and like printing but I'm pretty sure
that<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.680> pretty<00:00:49.950> common<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> new

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that is pretty common to get in the new

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.810 
that is pretty common to get in the new
police<00:00:51.420> sets<00:00:52.230> from<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.530> year<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.670> comes

police sets from this year and it comes
with<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.059> very<00:00:54.300> basic<00:00:54.690> helmet<00:00:55.350> which<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.680> not

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
with a very basic helmet which is not

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.069 
with a very basic helmet which is not
the<00:00:56.340> old<00:00:56.520> helmet<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.930> need

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the old helmet but I think that you need

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.580 
the old helmet but I think that you need
was<00:00:58.800> 90<00:00:59.280> something<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.260> he<00:01:01.260> does<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.559> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
was 90 something and he does have a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.959 
was 90 something and he does have a
little<00:01:01.829> bit<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.070> back<00:01:02.219> printing<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> torso

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
little bit of back printing on the torso

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.759 
little bit of back printing on the torso
which<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.300> pretty<00:01:03.449> cool<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.530> face

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
which is pretty cool and this face

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
which is pretty cool and this face
printing<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.760> little<00:01:05.970> normal<00:01:06.420> smirk

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
printing is just a little normal smirk

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.080 
printing is just a little normal smirk
face<00:01:07.260> which<00:01:07.500> used<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.860> cool<00:01:08.040> back<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.280> 2007

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
face which used to be cool back in 2007

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.160 
face which used to be cool back in 2007
but<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.270> getting<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.659> bit<00:01:09.869> repetitive

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
but it's getting a little bit repetitive

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.010 
but it's getting a little bit repetitive
and<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> figure<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.540> so

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and so that's it for the figure and so

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.270 
and so that's it for the figure and so
here's<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> main<00:01:13.470> part<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> set<00:01:13.979> which<00:01:14.130> is

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
here's the main part of the set which is

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.730 
here's the main part of the set which is
a<00:01:14.400> mini<00:01:14.580> helicopter<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:16.080> love<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.500> window

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
a mini helicopter and I love this window

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.200 
a mini helicopter and I love this window
right<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.310> know<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> pretty<00:01:17.970> new

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
right here I know it's a pretty new

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
right here I know it's a pretty new
piece<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.020> did<00:01:19.170> come<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.470> two<00:01:19.680> other<00:01:20.009> sets

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
piece and it did come in two other sets

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.210 
piece and it did come in two other sets
from<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.700> year<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.270> they're<00:01:21.570> both<00:01:21.750> over<00:01:22.220> $60

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
from this year and they're both over $60

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.450 
from this year and they're both over $60
just<00:01:23.430> kind<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.350> weird<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
just kind of weird so this is the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.830 
just kind of weird so this is the
cheapest<00:01:26.820> way<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.939> get<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.330> which<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.570> just

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
cheapest way to get it which is just

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840 
cheapest way to get it which is just
makes<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> set<00:01:28.590> way<00:01:28.890> better<00:01:29.369> than<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> would

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
makes it set way better than it would

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
makes it set way better than it would
without<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.470> here's<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.070> first

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
without that and so here's the first

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.910 
without that and so here's the first
side<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> other<00:01:33.240> side<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.920> then

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
side and then the other side and then

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.069 
side and then the other side and then
here's<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> back<00:01:35.970> look<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.659> there's<00:01:36.840> really

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
here's the back look and there's really

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.590 
here's the back look and there's really
not<00:01:37.259> much<00:01:37.439> detail<00:01:37.650> down<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:39.509> you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049

nothing much there and on the top
there's<00:01:43.290> nothing<00:01:43.560> much<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.130> course

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
there's nothing much here and of course

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.219 
there's nothing much here and of course
it<00:01:44.399> does<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.700> soul<00:01:44.939> rotor

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
it does have a soul rotor

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.440 
it does have a soul rotor
about<00:01:47.229> dirt<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:48.369> minifigure<00:01:48.789> it<00:01:48.880> does<00:01:49.030> fit

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
about dirt and a minifigure it does fit

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.179 
about dirt and a minifigure it does fit
in<00:01:49.659> there<00:01:49.960> pretty<00:01:50.200> well<00:01:50.439> all<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:50.859> have<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.100> do

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
in there pretty well all you have to do

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.099 
in there pretty well all you have to do
even<00:01:51.729> though<00:01:51.819> there's<00:01:51.999> no<00:01:52.119> seat<00:01:52.390> was<00:01:52.539> a<00:01:52.840> little

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
even though there's no seat was a little

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.319 
even though there's no seat was a little
bit<00:01:53.200> disappointing<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:54.520> stick<00:01:54.850> him<00:01:54.939> on<00:01:55.090> and

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
bit disappointing you stick him on and

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.859 
bit disappointing you stick him on and
right<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.630> there<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.829> there<00:01:57.159> you<00:01:57.189> go

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
right in there and there you go

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.240 
right in there and there you go
so<00:01:58.869> this<00:01:58.990> is<00:01:59.049> pretty<00:01:59.170> cool<00:01:59.439> you<00:01:59.770> know<00:02:00.159> it's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
so this is pretty cool you know it's

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.649 
so this is pretty cool you know it's
very<00:02:00.280> squishable<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.119> guess<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.359> could<00:02:01.479> say

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
very squishable I guess you could say

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.660 
very squishable I guess you could say
because<00:02:01.719> this<00:02:02.530> tail<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:03.069> could<00:02:03.219> hold<00:02:03.399> it<00:02:03.549> by

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
because this tail you could hold it by

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.760 
because this tail you could hold it by
there<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.240> then<00:02:04.359> that's<00:02:04.539> it<00:02:04.719> sounds<00:02:05.409> father

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
there and then that's it sounds father

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.550 
there and then that's it sounds father
it<00:02:06.149> overall<00:02:07.149> I'm<00:02:07.420> kind<00:02:07.659> of<00:02:07.719> conflicted<00:02:08.080> with

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
it overall I'm kind of conflicted with

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.259 
it overall I'm kind of conflicted with
this<00:02:08.769> um<00:02:09.039> with<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.399> rating<00:02:09.700> for<00:02:09.910> this<00:02:10.000> set

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
this um with the rating for this set

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.690 
this um with the rating for this set
because<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.500> minifigure<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> little<00:02:12.580> bit

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
because the minifigure is a little bit

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.520 
because the minifigure is a little bit
boring<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.450> gotta<00:02:13.629> admit<00:02:13.780> because<00:02:14.140> there's<00:02:14.440> not

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
boring I gotta admit because there's not

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.440 
boring I gotta admit because there's not
really<00:02:14.709> much<00:02:14.890> new<00:02:15.099> pieces<00:02:15.519> I<00:02:15.640> guess<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.940> torso

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
really much new pieces I guess the torso

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.229 
really much new pieces I guess the torso
is<00:02:16.660> pretty<00:02:17.470> cool<00:02:17.739> but<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.459> do<00:02:18.579> really<00:02:18.970> love<00:02:19.180> that

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
is pretty cool but I do really love that

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.960 
is pretty cool but I do really love that
piece<00:02:19.720> on<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.650> helicopter<00:02:21.220> itself<00:02:21.549> which<00:02:21.849> is

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
piece on the helicopter itself which is

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.460 
piece on the helicopter itself which is
the<00:02:22.120> window<00:02:22.450> because<00:02:22.810> that's<00:02:23.019> kind<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.230> hard

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
the window because that's kind of hard

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.559 
the window because that's kind of hard
to<00:02:23.560> get<00:02:23.799> the<00:02:24.370> tube<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.269> cheapest

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
to get the tube is this is the cheapest

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.660 
to get the tube is this is the cheapest
way<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.780> can<00:02:25.959> get<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.530> only<00:02:27.280> two<00:02:27.489> other

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
way you can get it and only two other

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.520 
way you can get it and only two other
ways<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:28.000> can<00:02:28.120> get<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> fire<00:02:28.930> station

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
ways you can get it is a fire station

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.089 
ways you can get it is a fire station
which<00:02:29.890> cost<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.430> think<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.700> hundred<00:02:30.970> dollars<00:02:31.299> and

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
which cost I think a hundred dollars and

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.520 
which cost I think a hundred dollars and
the<00:02:33.099> museum<00:02:33.700> breakout<00:02:34.060> set<00:02:34.299> which<00:02:34.450> cost<00:02:34.690> $60

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
the museum breakout set which cost $60

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.970 
the museum breakout set which cost $60
in<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.430> u.s.<00:02:36.700> at<00:02:36.879> least<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.900> do<00:02:38.170> rate<00:02:38.769> this

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
in the u.s. at least so I do rate this

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.550 
in the u.s. at least so I do rate this
set<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.459> 7<00:02:40.150> out<00:02:40.269> of<00:02:40.299> 10<00:02:40.390> because<00:02:40.629> I<00:02:40.810> love<00:02:41.079> that<00:02:41.290> um

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
set a 7 out of 10 because I love that um

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.099 
set a 7 out of 10 because I love that um
I<00:02:41.950> love<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.430> window<00:02:42.879> piece<00:02:43.090> it's<00:02:43.390> very<00:02:43.480> usable
