00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
you just how the product works and give

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.130 
you just how the product works and give
you<00:00:33.559> a<00:00:33.590> couple<00:00:33.829> of<00:00:33.860> examples<00:00:33.949> of<00:00:34.840> where<00:00:35.840> it<00:00:35.989> can

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
you a couple of examples of where it can

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.779 
you a couple of examples of where it can
be<00:00:36.230> used<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:36.680> if<00:00:36.739> we're<00:00:36.860> using<00:00:36.890> this<00:00:37.340> tape<00:00:37.579> for

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
be used so if we're using this tape for

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.569 
be used so if we're using this tape for
example<00:00:38.329> to<00:00:38.899> inspect<00:00:39.410> an<00:00:39.620> IV<00:00:39.920> cannula<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:40.489> is

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
example to inspect an IV cannula this is

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.000 
example to inspect an IV cannula this is
a<00:00:40.609> waterproof<00:00:40.910> tape<00:00:41.300> this<00:00:41.539> is<00:00:41.660> milk<00:00:42.010> legislate

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
a waterproof tape this is milk legislate

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.709 
a waterproof tape this is milk legislate
so<00:00:43.699> this<00:00:43.820> is<00:00:43.940> actually<00:00:44.270> one<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.449> the<00:00:44.570> most

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
so this is actually one of the most

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.319 
so this is actually one of the most
difficult<00:00:45.250> materials<00:00:46.250> why<00:00:46.670> we're<00:00:46.850> using<00:00:47.059> this

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
difficult materials why we're using this

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.759 
difficult materials why we're using this
tape<00:00:47.539> to<00:00:47.629> demonstrate<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:48.559> actually

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
tape to demonstrate to actually

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.419 
tape to demonstrate to actually
penetrate<00:00:48.859> through<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:50.510> what<00:00:50.660> you'll<00:00:50.780> see<00:00:50.840> is

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
penetrate through and what you'll see is

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.220 
penetrate through and what you'll see is
the<00:00:52.429> the<00:00:53.030> material<00:00:53.179> actually<00:00:53.719> creep

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
the the material actually creep

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.340 
the the material actually creep
underneath<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:55.219> product<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.390> as<00:00:57.019> much<00:00:57.199> as<00:00:57.230> you

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
underneath the product so as much as you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.419 
underneath the product so as much as you
can<00:00:57.530> use<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:57.859> on<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.449> more<00:00:59.449> user-friendly

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
can use it on the more user-friendly

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.040 
can use it on the more user-friendly
porous<00:01:01.429> products<00:01:01.940> like<00:01:02.120> elastin<00:01:03.109> for<00:01:03.410> example

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
porous products like elastin for example

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.570 
porous products like elastin for example
what<00:01:06.050> we<00:01:06.170> can<00:01:06.320> also<00:01:06.440> use<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.100> show<00:01:07.370> it<00:01:07.490> to

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
what we can also use and show it to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.980 
what we can also use and show it to
demonstrate<00:01:07.700> is<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.240> more<00:01:08.570> stubborn

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
demonstrate is the more stubborn

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.650 
demonstrate is the more stubborn
products<00:01:09.920> such<00:01:10.040> as<00:01:10.070> a<00:01:10.190> waterproof<00:01:10.610> tape<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.570> we

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
products such as a waterproof tape so we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.550 
products such as a waterproof tape so we
give<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.930> quick<00:01:12.080> spray<00:01:14.350> you're<00:01:15.350> going<00:01:15.500> to

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
give it a quick spray you're going to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.190 
give it a quick spray you're going to
get<00:01:15.850> for<00:01:16.850> an<00:01:16.910> inspection<00:01:17.240> of<00:01:17.390> an<00:01:17.480> IV<00:01:17.750> cannula

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
get for an inspection of an IV cannula

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.630 
get for an inspection of an IV cannula
from<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:18.530> can<00:01:18.800> you're<00:01:18.980> going<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.190> get<00:01:19.280> fifty

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
from this can you're going to get fifty

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.450 
from this can you're going to get fifty
to<00:01:19.760> sixty<00:01:19.880> users<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.740> we<00:01:21.770> can<00:01:22.010> see<00:01:22.190> there<00:01:22.370> it

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
to sixty users so we can see there it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.190 
to sixty users so we can see there it
creeps<00:01:22.730> our<00:01:23.000> underneath<00:01:23.660> so<00:01:23.780> literally<00:01:24.080> we

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
creeps our underneath so literally we

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
creeps our underneath so literally we
sprayed<00:01:24.470> onto<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.770> surface<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:26.770> we<00:01:27.770> wait<00:01:28.010> a

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
sprayed onto the surface and we wait a

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.830 
sprayed onto the surface and we wait a
few<00:01:28.280> seconds<00:01:28.850> for<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.180> creep<00:01:29.450> underneath

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
few seconds for it to creep underneath

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.710 
few seconds for it to creep underneath
and<00:01:30.250> work<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.550> there's<00:01:32.180> no<00:01:32.360> odor

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
and work and there's no odor

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.210 
and work and there's no odor
there's<00:01:33.080> no<00:01:33.290> sting<00:01:33.910> and<00:01:35.620> then<00:01:36.620> we<00:01:36.770> just<00:01:36.950> peel

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
there's no sting and then we just peel

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.820 
there's no sting and then we just peel
that<00:01:37.370> off<00:01:38.050> really<00:01:39.050> easy<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.410> actually<00:01:39.530> almost

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
that off really easy it actually almost

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.190 
that off really easy it actually almost
falls<00:01:40.220> off<00:01:40.400> now<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.300> material<00:01:41.840> hasn't<00:01:42.110> left

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
falls off now that material hasn't left

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.380 
falls off now that material hasn't left
any<00:01:42.350> residue<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.580> we<00:01:43.730> can<00:01:43.910> stick<00:01:44.180> any

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
any residue so we can stick any

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.780 
any residue so we can stick any
appliance<00:01:44.930> or<00:01:45.290> a<00:01:45.350> device<00:01:46.040> back<00:01:46.340> down<00:01:46.580> onto

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
here and with it not stinging you don't

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.040 
here and with it not stinging you don't
get<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.610> problems<00:01:52.610> associated<00:01:52.880> for<00:01:53.570> example

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
get the problems associated for example

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.270 
get the problems associated for example

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.979 
occurring now the longer we leave this
to<00:02:07.400> evaporate<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:07.940> material<00:02:08.509> not<00:02:08.689> only<00:02:08.719> does

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
to evaporate this material not only does

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:09.800 
to evaporate this material not only does
it<00:02:09.019> not<00:02:09.140> leave<00:02:09.379> a<00:02:09.409> residue

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
it not leave a residue

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.400 
it not leave a residue
but<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.080> allows<00:02:10.289> us<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.619> use<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:12.140> bandage<00:02:13.140> or

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
but it allows us to use this bandage or

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.260 
but it allows us to use this bandage or
this<00:02:13.590> tape<00:02:13.860> again<00:02:14.280> because<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.880> material

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
this tape again because the material

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.370 
this tape again because the material
will<00:02:15.360> actually<00:02:15.690> evaporate<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.290> only

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
will actually evaporate so it only

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.979 
will actually evaporate so it only
temporarily<00:02:17.540> destabilizes<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> nature<00:02:18.959> of

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
temporarily destabilizes the nature of

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.650 
temporarily destabilizes the nature of
the<00:02:19.170> glue<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.030> actually<00:02:21.150> reapply

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
the glue and we can actually reapply

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.760 
the glue and we can actually reapply
that<00:02:21.900> within<00:02:22.590> good<00:02:22.860> time<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.770> that

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
that within good time and that is that

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.810 
that within good time and that is that
is<00:02:25.890> ease<00:02:26.040> off<00:02:26.390> terrific<00:02:27.390> thanks<00:02:27.660> Nathan
