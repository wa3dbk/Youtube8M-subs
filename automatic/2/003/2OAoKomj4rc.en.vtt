00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.910
 hello to everyone so today we get 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.280
 found for a tutorial it's a 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.630
 little week that I have not done but 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.680
 I found something nice enough so 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.650
 he will be able to allow us to install 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.610
 we're going to say that to the gameboy emulator 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.770
 something like that 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.900
 finally gameboy gameboy color game boy 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.370
 advance I do not think they have yet 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 the ds but I believe that the updates 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.120
 will not be long in arriving 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.280
 so I want to show how to succeed 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.530
 to play pokemon games for me who 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.320
 remains a game of one will say a game of 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.050
 legend that is a little cradled youth 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.280
 of a lot of people I think and who 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.870
 rest what are you 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.630
 a game really play again 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.690
 today even with the news 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.390
 versions so then first of all he goes 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:01.149
 have to meet on rhÃ´ne station 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.610
 en station point en here I will put the 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.689
 link anyway in the description 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.920
 you must just at the top of the page 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:11.260
 install your phone 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.820
 that's it then it's 152 and so good word 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.890
 I had about ten minutes not even 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.940
 To download 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.680
 so suddenly I'm going to cut the video and 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.180
 of excess installed and indie who the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.630
 download and I'm coming back for 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.650
 the installation has immediately 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.299
 so this is once the file has been 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.530
 downloaded you will be able 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.810
 run it directly from the page 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.520
 internet me i'm going to run it 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.080
 since the downloads it comes back 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.869
 absolutely even that's where we go 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.540
 execute it we will start the installation 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.680
 so there's nothing changed here you 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.869
 asks if you want to create a folder 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.520
 or not in the business of starting here 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.460
 an icon on the hangman where one 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.869
 do not kiss enough then I specify 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.950
 still so that there will not be that 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:55.300
 the game boy games that are playable 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.180
 also some ps2 gamecube games 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.690
 of saturn of a lot of consonants in 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.550
 made of old consoles every game 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.600
 which allow that can be playable 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.970
 on a keyboard we will say in fact 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.289
 finally so here it is then you 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.240
 arrive here recommend the room 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.209
 directx and visual so it's me they 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.470
 are already installed at the base on the pc 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.680
 so I'm not going to do it I'm just going 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.160
 executed in station so here is once 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.510
 that's done you open this page 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.310
 then the nep 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.360
 so yes there so you and guests 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.700
 after you can create an account 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.739
 and connect it's just going to serve 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.930
 especially for that will serve especially for 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.560
 become prenium in fact and she warns 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.390
 but it will just serve to speed up the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.620
 downloading games so the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.290
 most games they had on game 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.510
 boy are very very small so I do not see 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.060
 really not worth paying for it 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.970
 what then I'm going to look for pokemon 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.340
 m road because I have never tried 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.750
 so here I specify that you are doing well 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.890
 be careful so you choose the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.670
 version you want to do well 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.840
 pay attention to what they are in 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.579
 French all the games are not 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.260
 available in french you are going to have 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.739
 Spanish Italian versions 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.030
 English Japanese so I 'm told 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.519
 it's the version in the language that 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.910
 so you want to once got there 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.930
 you arrive on emerald pokemon and 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.019
 you just have to click on 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.519
 download download launches 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.640
 so as I say here it's really 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.810
 small so if these words it'll put 30 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.980
 So download it is useless and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.260
 premium times to go faster 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.450
 what is there just for the minute 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.459
 I wanted to come back just as soon as 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.239
 I downloaded 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.760
 so here's once I'm going 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.180
 so download here this is his page 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.040
 opened 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.450
 you will be able to click on play 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.000
 be here this weekend it will change 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.920
 absolutely nothing then once all 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.519
 played right now so download you when 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.220
 you launched the installation it's you 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.090
 created a folder in the program file 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.410
 moors elsewhere in the local disk 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.410
 directly in the local disk 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.860
 who goes all the way to a salary game 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.840
 puts in and so they have to 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.739
 were loaded every time you 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.849
 look for the game you will not have 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.099
 as pressing play will not need 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.830
 to download each time so that's it 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.239
 so there this game he puts is compatible 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.200
 in multiplayer a request if I want 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.900
 join a game online 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.250
 so there I'm not interested here so 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.139
 the game is available on several 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.700
 emulators so the game boy advance and 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.000
 this one so I do not know at all 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.230
 that we are going to stay on the gba 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.690
 and so has it to all the games and will you 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.400
 ask the same thing it's if you 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.830
 want to make a video capture at the same 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.720
 time you play your party what 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.400
 that's just like I see 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.180
 not so much interest 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.450
 so here it is once it's slow 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.919
 so it's here to grow up here that will make you 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.660
 a little screen like that 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.190
 so the better actually if you want 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.850
 to play bigger is to draw the 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.320
 window would not be in full screen 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.870
 but it will still be a lot 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.210
 bigger and much more fun I 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.370
 think that I was dull at the sound of 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.910
 blender so there then the keys of 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.229
 base are ass and so is that it's 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:06.260
 the no key and s is the b key or 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:09.710
 that's it, yes, so that's it 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.390
 the twostar fletcher come in there so I 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.350
 will not create a new part if I 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.669
 will create a new part but 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.460
 it's the same I'm going to cut all 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:20.660
 cinematics and where we buy 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.830
 do not care what and I'll show you 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.289
 also so there during the cutscenes 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.310
 how finally for a cinematic I 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.810
 may not pass them at the same time 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.060
 but I already showed you how 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.050
 change the keys so there you go on 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.400
 aisne at the gba option control set up and 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.520
 there you see so here here it's for 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.110
 change the keys of if you play 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.240
 with a briefcase is there it's for 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.190
 change the keys on the keyboard 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.750
 you see that the button did that at the 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:50.120
 base button bcs select cmaj uppercase 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.289
 right between &amp; start and so has them 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.240
 buttons l and rx and y sees the zdf us 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.669
 admit the exchanged but it's up to your 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.530
 convenience as you want so there I 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.210
 going through all the cutscenes and I 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.590
 come back 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.350
 as soon as it's done to explain to you 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.370
 how to get lost 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.280
 here is once all the cutscenes 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.380
 gone so we get there and so has it for 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.720
 save you will bring me in 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.630
 so to make start and you go 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.900
 will go down rescued effect with the 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:26.380
 button cu chi so the button has so for 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:28.520
 it works like that so for them 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.050
 but for this game there its backup as 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.410
 that for pokemon the problem is that 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.890
 so I do not know all the games 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.850
 pan games just about every game you 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.910
 you can save by doing 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.260
 start back up after that remains like 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.420
 if you played on your game boy 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.150
 if for example in the game it was necessary 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.680
 go to a certain point to keep 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.570
 I think it will be exactly the same 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.030
 thing you're always going to go to this 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.840
 Point there to safeguard the 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.960
 after there is one tool to another 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.050
 solution if you really do not find 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:03.680
 is that you do 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:06.380
 save state tests in den hole of this lot 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.450
 to his widow to keep himself when you go 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.180
 leave after you come back do you do 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.640
 queues the aude state the aude beyond the 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.530
 float test the savor it's going you 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.550
 put the game back as it is and that 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.160
 it's really only last 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.490
 remedy i think otherwise save and 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.660
 normally it's pretty simple 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.780
 so that's all for this tutorial 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.950
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.020
