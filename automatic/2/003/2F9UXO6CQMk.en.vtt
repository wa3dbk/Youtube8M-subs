00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
make you can also use that as a

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.770 
make you can also use that as a
substitute<00:03:12.040> for<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.909> then<00:03:13.450> we're<00:03:13.629> going

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
substitute for this and then we're going

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:23.309 
substitute for this and then we're going
to<00:03:13.900> add<00:03:14.139> in<00:03:14.530> our<00:03:15.090> hot<00:03:16.090> sauce<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.109> don't

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
to add in our hot sauce if you don't

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.110 
to add in our hot sauce if you don't
want<00:03:23.530> this<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.859> be<00:03:23.980> super<00:03:24.220> zippy<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.939> could

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
want this to be super zippy you could

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.750 
want this to be super zippy you could
always<00:03:25.299> cut<00:03:25.900> back<00:03:26.079> on<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.379> hot<00:03:26.409> sauce<00:03:26.760> and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
always cut back on the hot sauce and

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.300 
always cut back on the hot sauce and
then<00:03:27.909> we'll<00:03:28.060> add<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.239> little<00:03:28.569> bit<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:29.049> our

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
then we'll add a little bit of our

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.420 
then we'll add a little bit of our
kosher<00:03:30.310> salt<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.799> then<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.069> can<00:03:33.220> either<00:03:33.310> use

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
kosher salt and then you can either use

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.940 
kosher salt and then you can either use
a<00:03:33.609> spoon<00:03:34.150> or<00:03:34.419> one<00:03:35.260> other<00:03:35.470> thing<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:35.799> I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
a spoon or one other thing that I

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.970 
a spoon or one other thing that I
actually<00:03:36.189> sometimes<00:03:36.609> use<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.269> use<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.900> one<00:03:38.859> of

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
actually sometimes use I use a one of

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.159 
actually sometimes use I use a one of
the<00:03:39.040> egg<00:03:39.189> beaters<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:39.879> just<00:03:40.449> use<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:40.870> it's

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
the egg beaters and just use this it's

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.390 
the egg beaters and just use this it's
not<00:03:41.379> obviously<00:03:42.159> as<00:03:43.229> finely<00:03:44.229> I<00:03:44.709> don't<00:03:45.310> even

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
not obviously as finely I don't even

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.610 
not obviously as finely I don't even
know<00:03:45.549> what<00:03:45.669> you<00:03:45.760> would<00:03:45.879> call<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.470> not<00:03:47.470> as

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
know what you would call that not as

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.399 
know what you would call that not as
finely<00:03:48.159> woven<00:03:49.150> together<00:03:49.599> as<00:03:49.930> like<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.079> whisk

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
finely woven together as like a whisk

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.770 
finely woven together as like a whisk
but<00:03:51.280> it's<00:03:51.459> still<00:03:51.819> going<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.150> allow<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.599> to

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
but it's still going to allow you to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.839 
but it's still going to allow you to
break<00:03:53.049> up<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.379> chicken<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.769> little<00:03:53.889> bit<00:03:54.159> so<00:03:54.760> you

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
break up the chicken a little bit so you

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.640 
break up the chicken a little bit so you
can<00:03:54.909> certainly<00:03:55.180> use<00:03:55.359> a<00:03:55.510> spoon<00:03:55.870> or<00:03:56.079> you<00:03:56.290> can<00:03:56.500> use

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
can certainly use a spoon or you can use

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.289 
can certainly use a spoon or you can use
this<00:03:56.859> it<00:03:57.129> usually<00:03:57.489> trade<00:03:57.699> off<00:03:57.819> between<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
this it usually trade off between the

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.460 
this it usually trade off between the
two<00:03:58.500> but<00:03:59.500> I'll<00:03:59.590> start<00:03:59.829> with<00:03:59.889> the<00:04:00.129> spoon<00:04:00.400> first

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
two but I'll start with the spoon first

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.770 
two but I'll start with the spoon first
it<00:04:02.470> definitely<00:04:02.889> just<00:04:03.040> makes<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.459> lot<00:04:03.609> easier

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
it definitely just makes it a lot easier

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.990 
it definitely just makes it a lot easier
and<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:05.139> don't<00:04:05.319> want<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.709> have<00:04:05.859> giant<00:04:06.549> chunks

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
and you don't want to have giant chunks

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.430 
and you don't want to have giant chunks
of<00:04:07.120> chicken<00:04:07.299> you<00:04:07.479> want<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.870> chicken<00:04:08.049> to<00:04:08.229> kind

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
of chicken you want the chicken to kind

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:17.339 
of chicken you want the chicken to kind
of<00:04:08.500> be<00:04:08.650> evenly<00:04:09.489> spread<00:04:09.849> throughout<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.989> then

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
of be evenly spread throughout and then

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.089 
of be evenly spread throughout and then
once<00:04:17.590> it's<00:04:17.799> almost<00:04:18.130> all<00:04:18.430> combined<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:20.859> can

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
once it's almost all combined you can

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.490 
once it's almost all combined you can
add<00:04:21.310> in<00:04:21.609> your<00:04:21.639> bell<00:04:22.150> pepper<00:04:22.539> and<00:04:22.780> your<00:04:23.139> green

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
add in your bell pepper and your green

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.010 
add in your bell pepper and your green
onions<00:04:23.889> you're<00:04:24.460> just<00:04:24.639> gonna<00:04:24.760> dump<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.599> on<00:04:25.810> to

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
onions you're just gonna dump that on to

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.399 
onions you're just gonna dump that on to
the<00:04:26.139> top<00:04:27.659> one<00:04:28.659> of<00:04:28.750> my<00:04:28.810> favorite<00:04:29.139> parts<00:04:29.260> about
