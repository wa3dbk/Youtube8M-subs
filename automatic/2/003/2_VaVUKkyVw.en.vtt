00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.649
 and staff in this class is teaching 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.860
 essential components of a computer 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:15.170
 What I would give to the campaign is poorly dedicated. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.330
 so let's start here we have one 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:24.660
 computer cabinet with a result 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:28.800
 we can already see the hd here ô ô ô ô ô cd e 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.300
 dvd on a motherboard memory doodles 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.730
 a video card and place the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.420
 processor and power source 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.969
 Then let's start in detail source 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.620
 power supply of the motherboard this here ó 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.329
 advisor in making 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.879
 here if you want to connect a monitor 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.629
 when the computer is connected to a 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.890
 monitor also connects and this cable 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.660
 connects to the motherboard here and that's what 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:08.189
 the computer works right here 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:11.340
 a motherboard with lots of memory 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.869
 depends on how the person speaks 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.520
 and here other slots pci-e here place of the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.900
 processor that there is no processor 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.310
 here is the integrated video card 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.470
 from the computer 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.960
 and here the places of the Cape Sata that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.680
 another also only that one with more lots 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.079
 here and more here 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.990
 here is already one with the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.560
 processor and thinker that we can 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.869
 say behind the computer and the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.799
 cooler here so there's no more that your 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.329
 processor the content road memory 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:57.570
 ram randow access memory 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:00.420
 then it is this one is the ram of 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.790
 a desktop computer and here's a 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.370
 notebook notebook is that half of these 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.630
 years 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.530
 are they fit here from the computer 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.550
 normal 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:21.170
 so box here you can put it there 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:24.080
 to memory ranking without any problem and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.820
 the computers of today already 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.710
 supports one is more days ram up to 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:35.360
 now we're going to have hit the love is 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.160
 so super powerful radar to honor said 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.710
 Look you carry the professional system 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.840
 and place your files is essential but the 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.410
 staff does not yet know how to 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.580
 then there is no longer a given instruction that 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.720
 It's easier to attack them, it's where they go. 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.720
 turn on the hd 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.690
 the motherboard for the processing of 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:11.660
 I dice that red cable here 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:15.550
 This is his bag and then the 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:19.700
 processor is simply a small 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:23.150
 computer that causes your computer to 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.989
 have agility that he has here 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.340
 public for when the processor is 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:34.430
 Warming up he goes according to it 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:38.020
 release your wind to the general ilfc 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:43.010
 processor according to the need 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:47.510
 here we have what to talk about pc lots 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.670
 and now also has a motherboard that is is 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:58.160
 the processor here 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:04:04.550
 the processor and the kurek here already the dvd and 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:09.680
 a cd and dvd of them to rotate record 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.110
 so it's good, it 's almost everyone 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.069
 who - cannon notebooks 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.340
 here we have the lots 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:21.400
 i O's that these votes're Here 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.009
 seeing this motherboard only has 6.511 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.500
 computer that only 22 have 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:30.370
 computers have that they have no 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.910
 because the compact the network card is this 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:38.919
 here she will be connected here the place 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.620
 from here and you connect it to 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.699
 the internet all over the computer as well as 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.479
 network card 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:49.900
 the video card also connected by there 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:55.120
 has a mini-course of it and here where you 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:58.570
 connects monitor wireless card one board 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:03.310
 iphae for you to search the net and 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:05.759
 and connect here is without antenna because 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.789
 I just wanted to show the card anyway 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.840
 I will not show the battery of the 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.240
 system 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.300
 You see on your computer because 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.280
 has a battery so the battery one 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.940
 small battery used to store the 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.050
 given the time and date of your 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.490
 computer there 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:34.960
 and for friends it's for bios it 's for me 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.860
 do not miss any here go to when 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:42.340
 boot in law has a card reader 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:46.690
 who have the micro sd if multiple cards is 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:50.590
 that exists in usb that integrated in the 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:54.599
 input devices that the mouse and 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.880
 keyboard microphone scanner has several 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:00.130
 output devices can be the 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:07.330
 speakers that they will 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:10.750
 out with anything just liked it 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.270
 liked a liquid video if they had 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.349
 doubt 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:20.259
 comment if it was useful and if 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:21.470
 subscribe to the channel that in protein 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.870
 exchange novelty 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.920
 are the new videos learn about the 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:32.200
 binary number which is a fair language 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:35.240
 on the computer you 're good to know and 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.940
 Short facebook page learning 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.150
 that is useful and always has 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.640
 what's new for you is accessing and 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.270
 day here so this is what folks I see 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.270
 in the next
