stock fans one on top or in the back and
two<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.820> front<00:00:48.950> this<00:00:55.579> this<00:00:56.579> is

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.350 

this<00:01:01.360> is<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.750> first<00:01:01.989> computer<00:01:02.700> ever<00:01:04.320> building

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
this is the first computer ever building

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.200 
this is the first computer ever building
so<00:01:07.360> first<00:01:08.350> ring<00:01:08.530> take<00:01:08.740> off<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.010> two<00:01:09.220> side

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210

side<00:01:45.640> panels<00:01:46.060> pretty<00:01:46.420> much<00:01:46.600> so<00:01:47.080> you<00:01:47.140> can<00:01:48.450> hide

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
side panels pretty much so you can hide

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.490 
side panels pretty much so you can hide
your<00:01:49.570> wires<00:01:50.520> comes<00:01:51.520> with<00:01:52.830> this<00:01:53.830> paper<00:01:54.220> which

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
your wires comes with this paper which

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.960 
your wires comes with this paper which
I'm<00:01:56.500> pretty<00:01:56.830> sure<00:01:57.070> is<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.770> make<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:00.789> to<00:02:00.910> where

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
I'm pretty sure is to make it to where

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.760 
I'm pretty sure is to make it to where
the<00:02:01.210> wires<00:02:01.450> don't<00:02:01.780> short<00:02:02.050> out<00:02:02.170> on<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.560> metal

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770

let's take a look at the front this is

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.170 
let's take a look at the front this is
this<00:03:11.300> is<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.750> front<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.050> it<00:03:12.170> right<00:03:12.350> here

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
this is the front of it right here

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.940 
this is the front of it right here
pretty<00:03:14.180> much<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:16.090> tagged<00:03:17.090> big<00:03:17.990> big

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
screens that you have a lot of airflow

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.160 
screens that you have a lot of airflow
you<00:03:21.650> got<00:03:21.800> your<00:03:21.950> power<00:03:22.280> button<00:03:22.460> and<00:03:22.840> your<00:03:23.840> reset

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
have these are plastic doors so you can

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.060 
have these are plastic doors so you can
put<00:03:37.820> in<00:03:38.000> different<00:03:38.180> drives<00:03:38.660> like<00:03:38.960> your<00:03:39.200> CD

it like this a lot because of a call the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.260 
it like this a lot because of a call the
airflow<00:03:53.660> can<00:03:53.930> go<00:03:54.020> through<00:03:54.200> here<00:03:55.060> compared<00:03:56.060> to

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
airflow can go through here compared to

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:03.699 
airflow can go through here compared to
the<00:03:56.750> old<00:03:56.960> computer<00:03:57.640> which<00:03:58.640> has<00:03:59.320> nothing<00:04:02.709> give

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
the old computer which has nothing give

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.690 
the old computer which has nothing give
to<00:04:05.170> two<00:04:06.170> fans<00:04:06.560> in<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:06.860> front<00:04:07.130> right<00:04:07.310> here<00:04:07.370> and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
to two fans in the front right here and

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.930 
to two fans in the front right here and
they<00:04:07.760> got<00:04:07.940> sunny<00:04:08.180> before<00:04:09.220> just<00:04:10.220> check<00:04:10.820> out

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
they got sunny before just check out

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:26.159 
they got sunny before just check out
