a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:46.860> tricky<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.760> not

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
a little tricky for this but it's not

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.940 
a little tricky for this but it's not
once<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.840> used<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.350> both<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:49.800> do

once you get used to you both which do
it<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.100> command<00:00:50.219> simple<00:00:51.090> jump<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> good<00:00:51.510> way

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it on command simple jump is a good way

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.090 
it on command simple jump is a good way
to<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:51.750> distance<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> best

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
to get distance but it's not the best

up the item but your hands will be up
this<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.450> game<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.899> sort<00:01:43.140> of

this is because of the game just sort of

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380 
this is because of the game just sort of
puts<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.439> fake<00:01:43.680> item<00:01:43.920> over<00:01:44.189> your<00:01:44.310> head<00:01:44.490> so

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
pretty much it's not really there you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.740 
pretty much it's not really there you
can't<00:01:46.979> use<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.850> pick<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.180> other<00:01:48.329> items

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
go on a door this is used to do toad or

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.109 
go on a door this is used to do toad or
Mario<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.310> they<00:01:56.520> pick<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> item<00:01:57.000> up

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
Mario because they pick the item up

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.749 
Mario because they pick the item up
faster<00:01:57.659> than<00:01:57.689> Luigi<00:01:58.140> or<00:01:58.320> princess<00:01:58.770> would<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
faster than Luigi or princess would you

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.920 
faster than Luigi or princess would you
take<00:01:59.969> advantage<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.630> taking<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
take advantage of this but taking a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.990 
take advantage of this but taking a
potion<00:02:01.140> where<00:02:01.409> you're<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:01.649> post<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
potion where you're not post to the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.340 
potion where you're not post to the
events<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.719> every<00:02:03.930> single<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.229> those

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
events this is every single on those

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.840 
events this is every single on those
vases<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.950> actually<00:02:05.280> can't<00:02:05.460> duck<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
vases that you actually can't duck and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.850 
vases that you actually can't duck and
go<00:02:06.030> down<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.450> are<00:02:06.600> actually<00:02:07.110> another<00:02:07.560> warp

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
go down in are actually another warp

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.339 
go down in are actually another warp
point<00:02:08.479> usually<00:02:09.479> they'll<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.840> take<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.140> back

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
point usually they'll just take you back

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.809 
point usually they'll just take you back
to<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.619> beginning<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.069> stage<00:02:11.310> already<00:02:11.640> N

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
to the beginning of the stage already N

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.710 
to the beginning of the stage already N
so<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> advantage<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.319> is

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
so the advantage this is

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.630 
so the advantage this is
getting<00:02:14.020> more<00:02:14.140> coins<00:02:14.440> than<00:02:14.560> slots<00:02:14.950> or

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
getting more coins than slots or

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.830 
getting more coins than slots or
collecting<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.060> 1up<00:02:16.270> mushrooms<00:02:16.630> in<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
collecting the 1up mushrooms in the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.390 
collecting the 1up mushrooms in the
level

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.940 

to<00:02:20.329> mess<00:02:20.510> up<00:02:20.659> your<00:02:20.720> diamonds<00:02:21.230> or<00:02:21.379> hearts

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
to mess up your diamonds or hearts

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
go to the dying animation so you

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.800 
go to the dying animation so you
continue<00:02:37.250> as<00:02:37.489> normal<00:02:37.519> once<00:02:38.510> could<00:02:38.659> to<00:02:38.750> the

recommend<00:03:12.110> doing<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.440> Princess<00:03:12.830> Peach

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
recommend doing this a Princess Peach

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.800 
recommend doing this a Princess Peach
mainly<00:03:13.580> because<00:03:13.850> she<00:03:13.970> floats<00:03:14.360> once<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.690> get

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
mainly because she floats once you get

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.240 
mainly because she floats once you get

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
enemy away you build a climb down the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.030 
enemy away you build a climb down the
ladder<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:54.170> that<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:54.410> get<00:03:54.530> stuck<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:54.830> wall

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
ladder so that you get stuck on a wall

ladder so that you get stuck on a wall
when<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.250> head<00:03:55.370> up<00:03:55.520> or<00:03:55.670> down<00:03:55.820> a<00:03:55.850> ladder<00:03:56.090> the

when you head up or down a ladder the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.449 
when you head up or down a ladder the
only<00:03:57.260> way<00:03:57.350> it's<00:03:57.590> going<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.770> be<00:03:57.830> a<00:03:57.860> suicide<00:03:58.070> good

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
only way it's going to be a suicide good

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.229 
only way it's going to be a suicide good
way<00:03:59.300> to<00:03:59.360> avoid<00:03:59.660> let's<00:03:59.870> just<00:04:00.170> hold<00:04:00.380> up<00:04:00.620> or<00:04:00.860> down

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
way to avoid let's just hold up or down

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.280 
way to avoid let's just hold up or down
so<00:04:02.239> when<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.450> go<00:04:02.600> for<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.810> wall<00:04:02.989> you're<00:04:03.110> still

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
so when you go for the wall you're still

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.570 
so when you go for the wall you're still
climbing<00:04:03.530> you'll<00:04:03.860> be<00:04:03.950> able<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.130> move<00:04:04.250> left<00:04:04.430> and

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
climbing you'll be able to move left and

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.310 
climbing you'll be able to move left and
right<00:04:04.670> look<00:04:05.030> you're<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.360> ladder<00:04:05.570> doing

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
right look you're on the ladder doing

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.720 
right look you're on the ladder doing
this<00:04:06.380> to<00:04:06.500> let<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:06.709> travel<00:04:06.920> different<00:04:07.459> levels

suicide code as a conjugated I'd
normally<00:04:44.020> as<00:04:44.140> if<00:04:44.290> you<00:04:44.410> double<00:04:44.680> suicide<00:04:44.830> code

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
normally as if you double suicide code

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.720 
normally as if you double suicide code
after<00:04:46.330> you<00:04:46.420> go<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.540> the<00:04:46.660> door<00:04:47.400> after<00:04:48.400> that

after you go to the door after that
you'll<00:04:48.910> respawn<00:04:49.270> there<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:50.260> you'll<00:04:50.410> fall

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
again there's no way to stop this what

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.730 
again there's no way to stop this what
you<00:04:54.880> do<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.450> I<00:04:55.480> don't<00:04:55.990> recommend<00:04:56.140> it<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.620> like

you do it so I don't recommend it I like
to<00:04:56.770> actually<00:04:57.190> I'll<00:04:57.280> get<00:04:57.400> game<00:04:57.550> over<00:04:57.820> it's

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
to actually I'll get game over it's

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.660 
to actually I'll get game over it's
quite<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:58.750> few<00:04:58.900> minor<00:04:59.140> glitches<00:04:59.520> similar<00:05:00.520> to

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
quite a few minor glitches similar to

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.670 
quite a few minor glitches similar to
the<00:05:00.790> first<00:05:01.120> Super<00:05:01.660> Mario<00:05:01.840> Brothers<00:05:02.170> wall<00:05:02.380> jump

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
the first Super Mario Brothers wall jump

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.620 
the first Super Mario Brothers wall jump
you<00:05:03.460> can<00:05:03.520> lid<00:05:03.730> on<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:03.970> blocks<00:05:04.240> will<00:05:04.480> fit<00:05:04.600> a

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
you can lid on the blocks will fit a

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.170 
you can lid on the blocks will fit a
wall<00:05:04.900> but<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.770> only<00:05:06.160> really<00:05:06.520> can<00:05:06.640> land<00:05:06.850> on<00:05:07.030> them

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
wall but I only really can land on them

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.200 
wall but I only really can land on them
at<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.990> top<00:05:08.290> of<00:05:08.320> wall<00:05:08.970> there's<00:05:09.970> some<00:05:10.090> other

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
at the top of wall there's some other

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.520 
at the top of wall there's some other
minor<00:05:10.450> glitches<00:05:10.780> like<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.110> fish<00:05:11.260> could<00:05:11.440> go

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
minor glitches like the fish could go

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.140 
minor glitches like the fish could go
for<00:05:11.800> you<00:05:11.830> when<00:05:12.100> you're<00:05:12.220> going<00:05:12.460> up<00:05:12.700> at<00:05:12.820> a<00:05:12.910> jump

for you when you're going up at a jump
even<00:05:13.900> though<00:05:14.080> there<00:05:14.230> must<00:05:14.410> be<00:05:14.500> platforms

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
even though there must be platforms

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.070 
even though there must be platforms
where<00:05:15.130> you<00:05:15.190> land<00:05:15.430> on<00:05:15.550> or<00:05:15.760> really<00:05:16.450> pokey<00:05:16.840> up<00:05:16.960> an

where you land on or really pokey up an
edge<00:05:17.290> as<00:05:17.980> you'll<00:05:18.280> just<00:05:18.400> float<00:05:18.730> as<00:05:18.940> he<00:05:19.090> just<00:05:19.300> has

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
edge as you'll just float as he just has

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.080 
edge as you'll just float as he just has
a<00:05:19.570> set<00:05:19.810> path<00:05:20.400> also<00:05:21.400> note<00:05:21.550> that<00:05:21.700> most<00:05:21.880> these

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
a set path also note that most these

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.180 
a set path also note that most these
glitches<00:05:22.480> were<00:05:22.630> removed<00:05:23.050> or<00:05:23.230> fixed<00:05:23.680> with
