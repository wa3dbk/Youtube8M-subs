is just put these two parts here at
normal<00:03:37.630> speed<00:03:37.960> and<00:03:38.170> then<00:03:38.260> just<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.100> fit<00:03:39.340> out<00:03:39.520> at

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
normal speed and then just to fit out at

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.330 
normal speed and then just to fit out at
the<00:03:39.700> end<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:41.260> that's<00:03:41.440> how<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.620> do<00:03:41.800> that<00:03:41.950> effect
