00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
fire you get a fire of inflammation so

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.280 
fire you get a fire of inflammation so
explain<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.670> people<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.119> refined<00:01:21.570> carbohydrate

explain to people a refined carbohydrate

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.679 
explain to people a refined carbohydrate

yet<00:01:31.920> by<00:01:32.100> themselves<00:01:32.490> they're<00:01:32.700> okay<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.060> when

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
yet by themselves they're okay but when

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
yet by themselves they're okay but when
you<00:01:33.479> combine<00:01:33.869> them<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.170> mega<00:01:34.320> 6<00:01:34.590> fatty<00:01:34.799> acids

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
you combine them for mega 6 fatty acids

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.999 
you combine them for mega 6 fatty acids
which<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.229> olive<00:01:37.229> oil<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.650> olive<00:01:37.890> oil

which is like olive oil not olive oil

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.700 
which is like olive oil not olive oil
but<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.189> mean<00:01:38.340> things<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.610> soybean<00:01:39.180> oil<00:01:39.360> of

basically make a deadly combination and
so<00:01:49.049> you're<00:01:49.229> saying<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> fat<00:01:49.920> cells<00:01:50.159> get

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
so you're saying then the fat cells get

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
so you're saying then the fat cells get
in<00:01:50.490> flames<00:01:50.820> exactly<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.720> sort<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.020> stick

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
in flames exactly and they sort of stick

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.749 
in flames exactly and they sort of stick
to<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.439> glue<00:01:52.619> basically<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:53.640> they

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
to you like glue basically what they

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.190 
to you like glue basically what they
turn<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.090> turn<00:01:54.329> into<00:01:54.479> basically<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:54.960> fat

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
turn they turn into basically have fat

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.410 
turn they turn into basically have fat
trap<00:01:55.470> now<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.100> calories<00:01:56.729> you're<00:01:56.909> consuming

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
trap now the calories you're consuming

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.139 
trap now the calories you're consuming

turned<00:02:11.799> on<00:02:11.980> by<00:02:12.159> this<00:02:12.220> inflammation<00:02:12.640> now<00:02:13.060> you

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
turned on by this inflammation now you

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.630 
turned on by this inflammation now you
sent<00:02:13.900> us<00:02:13.959> some<00:02:14.170> great<00:02:14.379> statistics<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.489> i

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
sent us some great statistics and and i

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.600 
sent us some great statistics and and i
think<00:02:16.140> one<00:02:17.140> match<00:02:17.409> to<00:02:17.440> blow<00:02:17.920> people<00:02:18.069> away<00:02:18.280> is

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
think one match to blow people away is

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.490 
think one match to blow people away is
that<00:02:18.640> seventeen<00:02:19.269> percent<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.750> medical<00:02:20.110> costs

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
that seventeen percent of medical costs

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.890 
that seventeen percent of medical costs
can<00:02:20.739> be<00:02:20.769> blamed<00:02:21.040> on<00:02:21.280> obesity<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.599> you're

of more of their population is

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.740 
of more of their population is

percent<00:03:01.989> are<00:03:02.260> more<00:03:02.409> interestingly<00:03:02.739> though<00:03:03.280> to

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
percent are more interestingly though to

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.190 
percent are more interestingly though to
your<00:03:03.700> point<00:03:03.970> they<00:03:04.239> are<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.480> poorer<00:03:04.780> states

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
your point they are the poorer states

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.140 
your point they are the poorer states
exactly<00:03:05.859> because<00:03:05.980> there's<00:03:06.489> an<00:03:06.609> economic<00:03:06.730> law

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
exactly because there's an economic law

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.030 
exactly because there's an economic law
called<00:03:07.450> ingalls<00:03:07.870> law<00:03:08.049> that<00:03:08.650> people<00:03:08.950> will

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
called ingalls law that people will

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.399 
called ingalls law that people will
basically<00:03:09.310> as<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:10.150> know<00:03:10.239> consume<00:03:11.140> more

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
basically as you know consume more

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.170 
basically as you know consume more
though<00:03:11.650> disposable<00:03:12.220> income<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.700> lower<00:03:12.879> their

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
though disposable income the lower their

though disposable income the lower their
overall<00:03:14.049> income<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:14.500> he's<00:03:14.650> finding<00:03:14.950> states

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
overall income so he's finding states

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.280 
overall income so he's finding states

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.860 
found this is a program that's easy to
follow<00:05:16.099> as<00:05:16.400> long<00:05:16.849> as<00:05:16.880> we<00:05:17.030> have<00:05:17.150> one<00:05:17.360> hand<00:05:17.690> and

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
follow as long as we have one hand and

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.839 
follow as long as we have one hand and
one<00:05:18.139> eye<00:05:18.169> and<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:19.190> health<00:05:19.430> allows<00:05:19.580> you<00:05:19.759> to

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
one eye and the health allows you to

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.339 
one eye and the health allows you to
keep<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.180> weight<00:05:20.300> off<00:05:20.330> because<00:05:20.930> you<00:05:21.050> turn

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
keep the weight off because you turn

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.499 
keep the weight off because you turn
down<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.710> inflammation<00:05:22.009> and<00:05:22.520> that's<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.300> key

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
down the inflammation and that's the key

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.779 
down the inflammation and that's the key
toward<00:05:24.169> reduction<00:05:24.710> of<00:05:24.800> body<00:05:24.979> fat<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:25.520> what<00:05:25.699> do

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
toward reduction of body fat so what do

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.149 
toward reduction of body fat so what do
we<00:05:25.849> do<00:05:26.120> we<00:05:26.389> have<00:05:26.630> an<00:05:26.750> obesity<00:05:27.050> epidemic<00:05:27.259> as<00:05:27.949> you

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
we do we have an obesity epidemic as you

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.610 
we do we have an obesity epidemic as you
said<00:05:28.400> what<00:05:29.090> what<00:05:29.389> is<00:05:29.509> the<00:05:29.690> solution<00:05:29.870> is<00:05:30.289> it

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
said what what is the solution is it

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.980 
said what what is the solution is it
just<00:05:30.860> education<00:05:31.610> I<00:05:31.789> mean<00:05:32.030> or<00:05:32.210> is<00:05:32.479> it<00:05:32.509> shutting

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
just education I mean or is it shutting

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.080 
just education I mean or is it shutting
down<00:05:33.229> all<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.650> fast<00:05:33.860> food<00:05:34.099> places<00:05:34.159> no<00:05:34.789> on<00:05:34.970> the

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
contrary basically it you know we

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.249 
contrary basically it you know we
basically<00:05:37.280> subsidize<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.780> various

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:39.259 
basically subsidize the various

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
ingredients are making a spatter to the

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.060 
ingredients are making a spatter to the
tune<00:05:41.000> of<00:05:41.120> 20<00:05:41.479> billion<00:05:41.690> dollars<00:05:42.050> a<00:05:42.139> year<00:05:42.320> so

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
tune of 20 billion dollars a year so

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.550 
tune of 20 billion dollars a year so
what<00:05:43.400> you<00:05:43.520> do<00:05:43.669> you<00:05:43.940> stop<00:05:44.360> subsidies<00:05:45.139> first

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
what you do you stop subsidies first
