00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.090
 brian hello hello hello you 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.960
 found in the Strasbourg team in 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.880
 big on all the end last 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.320
 from the last season that led to the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.720
 climb and since the beginning of the season you 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.810
 as a whole while waiting for more 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.750
 earned his holder stripes 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.090
 in this team 15 months ago yet 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.820
 you thought about stopping football 1 it's 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.160
 true that I wanted to stop the football will be 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.010
 because I went through the fc sion 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.780
 and it went very badly where I did not 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.339
 could play 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.580
 that's why the decision to leave 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:46.640
 of the club and I did several tests at 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.690
 foreigners in France and that the addition 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.730
 was always names and that's forcing 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.489
 to have bad answers that I have 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.470
 wanted to stop you go nrel in a 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.240
 career 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.370
 two footballers abroad and 16 years old 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.350
 which did not materialize because of 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.120
 problems of clubs and you come back in 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.820
 France and you are a little lost anyway 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.000
 yeah that's it actually it's a 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.100
 accumulation of bad choices and after 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.040
 I actually received we will say I received 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.320
 a slap I went from dream to 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.870
 nightmare as we say we know the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.820
 unemployment could be his club for 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.040
 have workout and that's why 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.400
 that here I wanted to really stop the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.050
 soccer 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.300
 I was tired region held 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.060
 yet you are only 20 years old 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.580
 at that moment it's a bit young for 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.240
 thinking about stopping already had to really 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.050
 that it was very bad 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.760
 it's true I was young and I wanted 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.460
 really really stop a decision 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:47.110
 I never had to my family my friends 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:50.860
 my agent to everyone and that's ready 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.530
 in half I call France in Cairo 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.759
 I was going to tell you as long as there is 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.729
 it's true I called franÃ§ois keller 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.619
 to say that I stop football and 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.230
 it is he who proposed me to play in 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:06.640
 reserve for prat not to find alive 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.780
 of hard plays football and it is rather not 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.640
 badly spent 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.140
 we can say today that it is 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.000
 a beautiful porsche who has been who has 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.000
 been tense at that time it's 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.709
 true a spa study is for you the dh 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.080
 what was it just for 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.060
 give a little fat otherwise I had grown 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.160
 I had ten extra pounds and that makes it 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.930
 too much is much squirt too low 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.120
 I worked during the holidays I wear 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.489
 on vacation I was running alone in the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.720
 forest thing to this path what is it 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.690
 ate and so the season starts in dh 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.760
 but it's 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.040
 it's a season or once again 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.530
 will not be easy for you to be his 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.260
 injuries that's right I had a lot of 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.470
 physical glitches which unfortunately 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.740
 braked up but in my head 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.510
 I have I have not let go I wanted I 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.300
 wanted to prove that even if I want 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.720
 stop football that I'm going to show that 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.340
 I was still there and so you arrived 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.540
 in the team after mill after this 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.740
 catastrophic match of mills where 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.800
 a lot of people thought it was 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.360
 that it was fucked up for the climb 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.910
 what is your state of mind at 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.510
 that moment when you come back 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.060
 the team my state of mind it was 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.180
 that I wanted I wanted to show with 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.070
 the other youngsters we were there 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.590
 that we work in training and that we 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.600
 could prove that we could 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.540
 also apply for a place 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.540
 holder in the team and it was a 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.170
 way also of you for you from no 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.840
 revenge but two 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.670
 of rossi of revenge that weighs on life 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.010
 and the setbacks that you had it 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.450
 true I 've traveled a lot I 've had 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.330
 a lot of highs a lot of bad 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.300
 bad thing his arrival is really 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.040
 I'm happy to play you right now 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.180
 do you say at that moment that there is 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.280
 will have at the national end some accounts 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.709
 national it would continue for you 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.190
 laughed because that even though the 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.200
 results 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.420
 collectively are not the ones we 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.950
 can hope are waiting for you to succeed 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.870
 little by little place in the sun there 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.080
 it's true at first I did not think of 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.959
 everything we were going next is at 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.310
 match 10 hours but that's new 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.220
 season that starts and I wanted 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.639
 really started on a good foundation 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.060
 with a good weight without no glitches 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.919
 physical 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.610
 to start the season well and 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.750
 point now it starts again and there 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.160
 it starts and the goods go with 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.770
 results that are well at home 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.479
 they are 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.740
 not good outside we expect the 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.750
 first goal outside you failed 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.300
 put ss who is that to two teams 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.590
 that of those from outside or that of 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.740
 the one at home or it's just a 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.889
 lack of success or luck it is a 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.500
 lack of success and luck because 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.590
 if for example against past marc 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.289
 lulin everywhere it can be that match on 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.810
 case we ensure the draw but I 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.180
 know that by persevering because they 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.069
 are hit because globally 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.169
 around the ajaccio mast you are like 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.340
 miss the other three games 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.520
 whether it is 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.930
 the rest thought about the paris fc you 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.260
 were like in the match with a 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.720
 real presence inserted will be a hard match 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.550
 and it would be fair and seem enough 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.139
 had opportunities we had in 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.470
 possession of ball also on his hunger 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:25.190
 otherwise some fear is a 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.250
 little bad luck field we'll say he 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.490
 have to expect a little in our favor 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.290
 we will have to repair again 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.060
 a little bit at home that has been ruined 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.919
 outside anyway it's true but 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.800
 even without reading and outside only 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.750
 home we have the obligation to win not 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.960
 earns more than 30 more points to 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.960
 home 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.330
 do you place yourself in these circles 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.400
 middle defensive middle recoverer 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.650
 attacks and were attracted anyway 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.139
 especially by this rival stopped and envy 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:01.260
 of you have scored an important goal to 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:02.460
 epinal contrant that no one has forgotten 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.810
 you want to go there a little while 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.000
 time still you very much brakes a little 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.230
 or really want to go a little more I 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.210
 removed under the set pieces and 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.740
 smoking one morning that's why I 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.530
 climbs on corners corners stopped 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.660
 and I have to say a good head game 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.980
 that's why on all my shots 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.980
 sure all the set pieces I 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.980
 goes up and I want to mark what I 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.400
 not many goals per season 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:28.050
 but when you check the bars but 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.340
 good we also saw as over 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.790
 matches since since last season 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.190
 of either progress or revelation 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.140
 also in the game I say in everything 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.910
 which is balloon transmission 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.120
 recovery we knew but also 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:45.240
 forward play and transmission 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.390
 go because since I was without a club 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.550
 we will say that it cut my legs 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.800
 and on interested players it can 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.280
 come back empty where some players that 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.960
 takes time 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.700
 and I think it took a long time 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.760
 to find all the sensations 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.260
 it would be interesting the weather yes 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.810
 still a bryant thing was a real 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:07.350
 stage hello my thunes and in what 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:11.070
 quarters at the big 09 nov I 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:14.910
 played here starts I started to see 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:17.160
 with the mates and the friends and after I 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.440
 took a license at cs nov 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.240
 so I'm thinking of a sporting club of 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.420
 schiltigheim I arrived at the center 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.150
 so if like 221 real tattoo to 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.210
 indret baby racing anyway is it 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.650
 that it changes something 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.860
 art douala been elevated like that to 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.870
 bottle of racing when you are big 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.190
 still young but great and we end up 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.099
 in front of this audience 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.139
 it's nice because in being 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.590
 young one dreams of all the young people of 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:47.419
 strasbourg dreams of playing in this club and 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:50.389
 surely ridiculous one day the other played 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:53.900
 meinau stadium in front of a lot of 

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:56.539
 world I would not have thought maybe your 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:59.360
 first goal Friday that between products 

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:01.990
