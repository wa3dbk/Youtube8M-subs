00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.120 
to be full episodes of actually us doing
something<00:05:08.180> like<00:05:08.419> something<00:05:08.720> that<00:05:08.810> might<00:05:08.930> be

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
something like something that might be

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.279 
something like something that might be
but<00:05:10.130> mostly<00:05:10.580> would<00:05:10.729> just<00:05:10.880> be<00:05:11.030> me<00:05:11.289> commentating

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
but mostly would just be me commentating

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.340 
but mostly would just be me commentating
and<00:05:12.500> telling<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:12.890> what<00:05:13.070> we've<00:05:13.160> been<00:05:13.280> doing<00:05:14.350> so

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
and telling you what we've been doing so

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.020 
and telling you what we've been doing so
it's<00:05:15.830> easiest<00:05:16.130> way<00:05:16.310> of<00:05:16.340> actually<00:05:16.580> doing<00:05:16.850> it

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
it's easiest way of actually doing it

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.030 
it's easiest way of actually doing it
and<00:05:17.680> James<00:05:18.680> is<00:05:18.860> quite<00:05:19.070> camera<00:05:19.580> shy<00:05:19.910> and

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
and James is quite camera shy and

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.730 
and James is quite camera shy and
so<00:05:22.760> I<00:05:23.120> think<00:05:23.540> that<00:05:23.690> what<00:05:23.870> we'll<00:05:24.080> be<00:05:24.260> doing<00:05:24.440> and

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
so I think that what we'll be doing and

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:46.550 
so I think that what we'll be doing and
so<00:05:25.670> thank<00:05:25.940> you<00:05:26.030> guys<00:05:26.090> for<00:05:26.240> watching
