00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
okay and the day's build I'm gonna make

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.730 
okay and the day's build I'm gonna make
a<00:00:05.000> little<00:00:06.000> wheelbarrow<00:00:06.299> planner<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.560> is

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
a little wheelbarrow planner this is

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.610 
a little wheelbarrow planner this is
going<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:07.980> be<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.550> shape<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.179> rhombus<00:00:10.170> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
going to be in the shape of a rhombus I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.530 
going to be in the shape of a rhombus I
guess<00:00:10.800> you'd<00:00:11.010> say<00:00:11.090> somewhat<00:00:12.090> triangular

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
guess you'd say somewhat triangular

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.570 
guess you'd say somewhat triangular
first<00:00:13.410> I'm<00:00:13.620> gonna<00:00:13.799> do<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.009> make<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.370> wheel

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
first I'm gonna do is make the wheel

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.790 
first I'm gonna do is make the wheel
this<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.509> piece<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.900> scrap<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.590> ten

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
this is just piece of scrap to the ten

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.429 
this is just piece of scrap to the ten
to<00:00:17.640> twelve<00:00:19.070> fifteen<00:00:20.070> anyways<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.840> did<00:00:22.199> was

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
to twelve fifteen anyways and I did was

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.000 
to twelve fifteen anyways and I did was
just<00:00:22.470> trace<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:24.590> paint<00:00:25.590> bucket<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.720> uh

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
just trace a paint bucket and it uh

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.320 
just trace a paint bucket and it uh
usually<00:00:29.010> about<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> six<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.789> half<00:00:29.820> inch

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
usually about a six and a half inch

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.849 
usually about a six and a half inch
circle<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:30.990> gonna<00:00:31.140> cut<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.590> with

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
circle and I'm gonna cut that out with

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.950 
circle and I'm gonna cut that out with
the<00:00:31.949> jigsaw<00:00:33.620> yeah<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.160> see<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> wheel<00:00:35.960> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the jigsaw yeah you can see the wheel it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.560 
the jigsaw yeah you can see the wheel it
doesn't<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.590> exact<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.280> close

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
doesn't have to be exact it's close

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.290 
doesn't have to be exact it's close
alright<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.710> bottom<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.340> will

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
alright this is the bottom of will

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
alright this is the bottom of will
borrow<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.590> found<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.370> need

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
borrow and I'm going on I found I need

at least about a five and a half inch
space<00:00:47.030> put<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> wheel<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.600> comfortably<00:00:49.260> so

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
space put the wheel in comfortably so

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.160 
space put the wheel in comfortably so
we're<00:00:51.059> just<00:00:51.090> going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> kind<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.660> lay<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.899> off

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
we're just going to kind of lay that off

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.619 
we're just going to kind of lay that off
using<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.770> straightedge<00:00:55.670> alright<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:57.480> I've

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
using a straightedge alright what I've

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.349 
using a straightedge alright what I've
done<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.949> found<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.430> midpoint<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
done here is I found the midpoint and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.740 
done here is I found the midpoint and
then<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.649> laid<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.820> rule<00:01:06.090> down<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
then I just laid the rule down here and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.240 
then I just laid the rule down here and
I<00:01:06.810> measured<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.229> six<00:01:07.560> inches<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.189> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
I measured out six inches and this is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.179 
I measured out six inches and this is
going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.640> be<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.210> outside<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> front<00:01:10.619> of

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
going to be the outside of the front of

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.810 
going to be the outside of the front of
the<00:01:12.500> wheel<00:01:13.500> bar<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> I'm<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.520> pick

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the wheel bar and I'm just going to pick

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.200 
the wheel bar and I'm just going to pick
a<00:01:14.850> point<00:01:14.939> back<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> back<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:17.210> Mark

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
a point back here in the back and Mark

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.440 
a point back here in the back and Mark
this<00:01:18.360> off

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.050 

alright<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> made<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.159> nine<00:01:26.159> inches<00:01:26.700> back

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
alright I made this nine inches back

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.390 
alright I made this nine inches back
here<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> back<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.979> four<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> half

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
here in the back so it's four and a half

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.780 
here in the back so it's four and a half
from<00:01:29.880> each<00:01:30.570> side<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.320> I'm<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.310> gonna<00:01:32.490> trace

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
from each side and I'm just gonna trace

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.249 
from each side and I'm just gonna trace
that<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> straightedge<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.780> I'll<00:01:34.020> show

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
that with the straightedge and I'll show

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.469 
that with the straightedge and I'll show
you<00:01:37.280> okay<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.310> that's<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.090> kind<00:01:39.390> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you okay and that's going to be kind of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.060 
you okay and that's going to be kind of
the<00:01:39.659> outline<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.500> wheel<00:01:40.710> bar<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:43.070> there

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the outline of the wheel bar and there

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.749 
the outline of the wheel bar and there
from<00:01:44.220> there<00:01:45.890> there's<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.220> revision

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
from there there's a little revision

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.999 
from there there's a little revision
after<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.060> looked<00:01:48.329> at<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.720> outside<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> make<00:01:49.920> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
after I looked at it outside to make it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.030 
after I looked at it outside to make it
a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.189> bigger<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.000> went<00:01:51.210> out<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> 12

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
a little bigger so I went out to 12

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.859 
a little bigger so I went out to 12
which<00:01:53.040> gives<00:01:53.070> me<00:01:53.490> six<00:01:53.850> inches<00:01:54.180> from<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
which gives me six inches from the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
which gives me six inches from the
outside<00:01:55.229> line<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.649> we'll<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:55.920> kind<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.310> work

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
outside line and we'll just kind of work

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.440 
outside line and we'll just kind of work
this<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.509> out<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:59.189> I'm<00:01:59.340> gonna<00:01:59.490> cut<00:01:59.790> these<00:02:00.090> on

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
this one out and I'm gonna cut these on

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.530 
this one out and I'm gonna cut these on
this<00:02:00.600> angle<00:02:01.729> whatever<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.450> I'll

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
this angle whatever that is and I'll

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.840 
this angle whatever that is and I'll
show<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> looks<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.850> alright

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
show you what it looks like alright

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.719 
show you what it looks like alright
that's<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.689> got<00:02:06.869> when<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.290> get<00:02:07.770> all<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that's what you got when you get all the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.890 
that's what you got when you get all the
bottom<00:02:09.660> pieces<00:02:09.840> cut<00:02:10.259> now<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:12.090> tricky<00:02:12.360> part<00:02:12.690> is

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
bottom pieces cut now the tricky part is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.550 
bottom pieces cut now the tricky part is
make

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
make

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.729 
make
in<00:02:13.620> these<00:02:13.830> sides<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.730> sides<00:02:15.030> run

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
in these sides and the sides run

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.930 
in these sides and the sides run
whatever<00:02:16.739> your<00:02:16.890> angle<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.550> bottom

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
whatever your angle is on the bottom

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.780 
whatever your angle is on the bottom
like<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.660> one<00:02:18.840> was<00:02:18.959> 11<00:02:19.410> degrees<00:02:19.790> your

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
like so this one was 11 degrees your

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.630 
like so this one was 11 degrees your
side<00:02:21.360> pieces<00:02:21.720> will<00:02:22.080> be<00:02:22.110> 11<00:02:22.650> degrees<00:02:23.010> from<00:02:23.370> long

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
side pieces will be 11 degrees from long

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.460 
side pieces will be 11 degrees from long
with<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.020> angle<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.900> mark<00:02:28.260> and

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
with on the angle and I just mark and

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.610 
with on the angle and I just mark and
cut<00:02:28.770> my<00:02:29.400> long<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.849> short<00:02:30.060> points<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.410> just

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
cut my long and short points and I just

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.910 
cut my long and short points and I just
turned<00:02:31.830> my<00:02:31.890> mitre<00:02:32.310> saw<00:02:32.580> down<00:02:32.880> on<00:02:33.120> 11<00:02:33.510> degree

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
turned my mitre saw down on 11 degree

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.180 
turned my mitre saw down on 11 degree
bevel<00:02:34.920> cut<00:02:36.290> alright<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.590> see<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:37.950> back

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
bevel cut alright you can see that back

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.839 
bevel cut alright you can see that back
angle<00:02:38.489> starting<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.330> take<00:02:39.540> place<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:41.130> right

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
angle starting to take place and right

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.309 
angle starting to take place and right
here<00:02:42.380> all<00:02:43.380> I've<00:02:43.709> done<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.720> laid<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.930> down<00:02:45.959> there

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
here all I've done is laid it down there

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.809 
here all I've done is laid it down there
and<00:02:46.500> Mark<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.130> I'm<00:02:47.220> gonna<00:02:47.340> go<00:02:47.489> cut<00:02:47.790> that

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
and Mark that and I'm gonna go cut that

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.250 
and Mark that and I'm gonna go cut that
where<00:02:48.299> there's<00:02:48.510> angles<00:02:48.900> running<00:02:49.110> parallel

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
where there's angles running parallel

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.570 
where there's angles running parallel
all<00:02:52.260> right<00:02:52.440> there's<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.739> first<00:02:52.950> side<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.280> just

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
all right there's the first side I just

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.320 
all right there's the first side I just
put<00:02:53.880> three<00:02:54.150> screws<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.690> bottom<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:56.330> and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
put three screws in the bottom of it and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.270 
put three screws in the bottom of it and
I'm<00:02:57.420> gonna<00:02:57.600> do<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> same<00:02:58.110> thing<00:02:58.739> on<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.190> other

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
I'm gonna do the same thing on the other

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.770 
I'm gonna do the same thing on the other
side<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.670> think<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.180> worked<00:03:00.360> out<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.599> be<00:03:00.720> about

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
side I think it worked out to be about

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.589 
side I think it worked out to be about
17<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.650> half<00:03:01.799> inches<00:03:02.099> long<00:03:02.269> so<00:03:03.269> that's<00:03:03.390> what

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
17 and a half inches long so that's what

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.110 
17 and a half inches long so that's what
it<00:03:03.690> looks<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:04.310> see<00:03:05.310> how<00:03:05.519> I'm<00:03:05.640> gonna<00:03:05.819> cross

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
it looks like see how I'm gonna cross

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.880 
it looks like see how I'm gonna cross
that<00:03:06.150> angle<00:03:06.630> in<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.780> front<00:03:06.900> okay<00:03:09.890> everybody's

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
that angle in the front okay everybody's

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.170 
that angle in the front okay everybody's
sides<00:03:11.099> got<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.340> little<00:03:11.549> crack<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.000> back

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
sides got a little crack in the back

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.520 
sides got a little crack in the back
which<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.540> actually<00:03:12.840> good<00:03:13.019> that'll<00:03:13.319> let<00:03:13.440> it

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
which is actually good that'll let it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.800 
which is actually good that'll let it
drain<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.130> as<00:03:14.340> he's<00:03:14.519> board<00:03:14.790> dry<00:03:15.090> out<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.569> drain

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
drain and as he's board dry out of drain

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.590 
drain and as he's board dry out of drain
a<00:03:15.840> little<00:03:15.900> better<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:17.180> I'm<00:03:18.180> gonna<00:03:18.359> put<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
a little better so I'm gonna put the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.720 
a little better so I'm gonna put the
front<00:03:18.840> piece<00:03:19.019> on<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.829> same<00:03:20.070> thing

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
front piece on this just the same thing

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.009 
front piece on this just the same thing
laughing<00:03:21.090> agreeing<00:03:21.600> GLE<00:03:21.780> cutting<00:03:22.290> fit<00:03:24.019> okay

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
laughing agreeing GLE cutting fit okay

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.530 
laughing agreeing GLE cutting fit okay
this<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.590> front<00:03:25.859> piece<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.940> if<00:03:27.390> you'll

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
this is the front piece and if you'll

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.520 
this is the front piece and if you'll
notice<00:03:28.760> these<00:03:30.380> angles<00:03:31.380> do<00:03:31.560> not<00:03:31.829> room<00:03:32.160> parallel

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
notice these angles do not room parallel

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.380 
notice these angles do not room parallel
so<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.859> just<00:03:35.069> fits<00:03:35.370> under<00:03:35.700> lock<00:03:35.910> out<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.239> put<00:03:36.359> a

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
so it just fits under lock out and put a

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.020 
so it just fits under lock out and put a
couple<00:03:36.569> screws<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.200> front<00:03:37.670> it<00:03:38.670> worked<00:03:38.850> out

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
couple screws in the front it worked out

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.309 
couple screws in the front it worked out
to<00:03:39.090> be<00:03:39.299> about<00:03:39.359> eight<00:03:39.660> inches<00:03:39.989> wide<00:03:41.810> okay<00:03:42.810> this

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
to be about eight inches wide okay this

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.430 
to be about eight inches wide okay this
is<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> back<00:03:43.859> piece<00:03:44.220> it's<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.060> same<00:03:45.440> idea

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
is the back piece it's the same idea

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.800 
is the back piece it's the same idea
just<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.370> little<00:03:47.549> bit<00:03:47.639> longer<00:03:47.880> I'm<00:03:48.389> just<00:03:48.600> gonna

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
all right you can see I flipped it over

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.840 
all right you can see I flipped it over
and<00:03:56.569> these<00:03:56.930> are<00:03:57.319> going<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.530> be<00:03:57.650> my<00:03:57.860> handles<00:03:58.340> and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
and these are going to be my handles and

and these are going to be my handles and
you<00:03:58.970> can<00:03:59.120> make<00:03:59.300> these<00:03:59.510> over<00:03:59.750> how<00:03:59.959> long<00:04:00.230> you

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
you can make these over how long you

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
want I put a line at five and a half

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.140 
want I put a line at five and a half
inches<00:04:06.130> what<00:04:07.130> I'm<00:04:07.220> going<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.459> do<00:04:07.640> is<00:04:07.700> just

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
the line meets the front on the inside

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.800 
the line meets the front on the inside
corner<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.610> I'm<00:04:14.120> just<00:04:14.300> gonna<00:04:14.480> do<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.660> same

corner and I'm just gonna do the same

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.090 
corner and I'm just gonna do the same
thing<00:04:14.870> on<00:04:15.170> both<00:04:15.260> sides<00:04:15.650> and<00:04:15.860> I'll<00:04:15.920> show<00:04:16.040> you

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
thing on both sides and I'll show you
