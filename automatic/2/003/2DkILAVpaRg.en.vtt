00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.850
 all right 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.850
 ah 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.959
 hello everyone and welcome to distrihogar 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.349
 Today we will teach you how to lay a bed 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.449
 With hotel style the first step is 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.430
 put a mattress protector that we 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.169
 help to avoid the generation of mites 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.289
 that occur when the mattress 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.449
 absorbs any type of fluid 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.519
 after having the mattress protector 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.649
 well understood we move to place the 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.600
 Fitted Sheet 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.399
 this is the sheet that is in contact 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.399
 direct with our body when we 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.829
 we sleep for such a reason it is important 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.070
 that is of very good quality to have 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.470
 a more pleasant night 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.290
 the quality of some sheets is determined 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.630
 by the fabric composition percentage 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.420
 of cotton and other fibers and the number of 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.550
 threads the higher the percentage of 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.579
 cotton on the largest fabric will be the 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.650
 pressure that it offers among 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.780
 the number of threads will be greater 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.360
 perceived softness 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.080
 the next step to spread the sheet 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.580
 flat also known as on sheet 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.770
 this is the sheet on which we put 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.440
 the blanket and is the one that goes over 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.840
 our body remember to keep in mind 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.210
 the quality of the sheets that you buy from 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.430
 it depends on the comfort freshness and 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.430
 softness that you will receive while you sleep 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.540
 then we dress the pillows with the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.600
 covers that match the sheets 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.510
