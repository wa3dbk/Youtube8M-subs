00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.180 
so usually I get this thing rolling with
just<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.270> track<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.689> let<00:00:03.840> it<00:00:03.929> play<00:00:04.049> out<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.470> let

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
just a track and let it play out and let

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.559 
just a track and let it play out and let
you<00:00:05.310> guys<00:00:05.460> just<00:00:05.730> kind<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.000> sit<00:00:06.180> back<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.450> watch

you guys just kind of sit back and watch
but<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:06.839> thought<00:00:06.960> I'd<00:00:07.109> kind<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.379> set<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.680> stage

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
but I thought I'd kind of set the stage

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.530 
but I thought I'd kind of set the stage
on<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.220> one<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> little<00:00:08.519> bit<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.360> a

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
on this one a little bit so this is a

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.169 
on this one a little bit so this is a
work<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.230> progress<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.370> like<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.700> do<00:00:11.910> is

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
work in progress what I like to do is

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.879 
work in progress what I like to do is
when<00:00:12.360> I'm<00:00:12.480> trying<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.809> figure<00:00:13.019> out<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> final

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
when I'm trying to figure out a final

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.720 
when I'm trying to figure out a final
version<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> graphic<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.630> I'm<00:00:16.410> not<00:00:16.949> too

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
version of a graphic that I'm not too

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.429 
version of a graphic that I'm not too
sure<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.060> how<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.630> going<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> turn<00:00:19.020> out<00:00:19.230> yet

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
sure of how it's going to turn out yet

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.359 
sure of how it's going to turn out yet
I'd<00:00:19.529> like<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> lot<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.070> different

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
I'd like to do a lot of different

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.189 
I'd like to do a lot of different
versions<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.600> them<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.960> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
versions this is just one of them and a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.720 
versions this is just one of them and a
lot<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> times<00:00:22.769> I'll<00:00:23.070> take<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> version

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
lot of the times I'll take the version

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.259 
lot of the times I'll take the version
all<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> way<00:00:24.060> down<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.420> final<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.529> see

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
all the way down to final just to see

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.550 
all the way down to final just to see
what<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.420> could<00:00:27.570> potentially<00:00:27.689> look<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.349> but

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
what it could potentially look like but

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.380 
what it could potentially look like but
it<00:00:28.650> may<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.310> actual<00:00:29.609> final<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
it may not be the actual final so I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.999 
it may not be the actual final so I
thought<00:00:30.929> I'd<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.199> throw<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.740> here

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
thought I'd just throw this one up here

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.950 
thought I'd just throw this one up here
this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.279> actually<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> third<00:00:32.969> redraw<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.750> I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
this is actually the third redraw that I

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.549 
this is actually the third redraw that I
have<00:00:34.260> done<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.309> kind<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.290> layout<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
have done of this kind of layout and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.639 
have done of this kind of layout and
idea<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> aren't<00:00:39.149> aware<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.870> die

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
idea so if you aren't aware of what die

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.290 
idea so if you aren't aware of what die
Knight<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.879> characters<00:00:42.270> of

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
Knight is it's one of the characters of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.279 
Knight is it's one of the characters of
Tom's<00:00:42.800> Maya<00:00:43.800> Knight<00:00:44.010> server<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.780> this<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
Tom's Maya Knight server and this is a

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.610 
Tom's Maya Knight server and this is a
potential<00:00:47.129> t-shirt<00:00:47.489> style<00:00:47.879> graphic<00:00:48.469> for<00:00:49.469> M

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
potential t-shirt style graphic for M

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.319 
potential t-shirt style graphic for M
but<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> final<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.149> one

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
but it is not the final it is just one

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.000 
but it is not the final it is just one
of<00:00:51.510> many<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.230> thought<00:00:52.500> I'd<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.739> kind<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
of many so I thought I'd just kind of

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.290 
of many so I thought I'd just kind of
throw<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:53.489> there<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.760> show<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.180> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
throw this up there and show you one of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.790 
throw this up there and show you one of
the<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.719> versioning<00:00:55.050> process<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.710> how<00:00:55.770> I

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
the the versioning process and how I

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.799 
the the versioning process and how I
like<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.309> kind<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.610> drag<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.690> way

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
like to just kind of drag it all the way

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.389 
like to just kind of drag it all the way
out<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> even<00:00:58.620> helps<00:00:58.859> me<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.039> upload<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
out and it even helps me to upload to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.029 
out and it even helps me to upload to
YouTube<00:00:59.520> to<00:01:00.059> watch<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.590> sit<00:01:01.590> back<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> watch

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
YouTube to watch it sit back and watch

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.619 
YouTube to watch it sit back and watch
it<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> different<00:01:02.670> form<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.270> helps<00:01:03.510> me

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
it in a different form and that helps me

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.359 
it in a different form and that helps me
identify<00:01:03.719> stuff<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.559> need<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.799> work<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
identify stuff I need to work on and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.359 
identify stuff I need to work on and
things<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.729> should<00:01:05.970> switch<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.220> this<00:01:08.220> is

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
things I should switch up so this is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.710 
things I should switch up so this is
very<00:01:08.520> much<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> work<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.060> progress<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.630> I'll

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
very much a work in progress and I'll

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.030 
very much a work in progress and I'll
leave<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> at<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.080> hope<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.500> enjoy<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.920> and
