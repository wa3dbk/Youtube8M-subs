00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.539
 hello welcome to the black market the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.279
 advertising program the campaign 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.900
 advertising to xining as objective 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.180
 achieve positioning in the mind 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.220
 of the consumer and these messages are 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.810
 transmit in different media but 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.699
 what are the criteria for selecting 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.009
 these or how long a campaign lasts 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.019
 advertising of this subject to us to the amari 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.439
 dryer director lighting manager 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.439
 his macanas 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.010
 hello black market friends welcome 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.930
 to media area my name is marisa 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.989
 Cabero director manager of help in 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.850
 Peru and today I will talk with 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.610
 you on five basic criteria 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.890
 for the selection of children the first 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.190
 criteria that we use to be able 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.800
 choose the means that we go to where 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.850
 let's invest for a campaign 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.129
 basically it's related to what 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.440
 is the coverage the coverage has to 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.540
 see with the susceptible target audience 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 of being reached by a certain 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.979
 means ie how many people are going 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.930
 to be able to get through this campaign through 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.180
 of that means 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.310
 for example the open television that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.800
 usually has reaches most of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.290
 homes have a lot coverage 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.260
 more massive than closed television or 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.750
 cable that normally in homes 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.020
 they are by subscription other criteria 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.990
 also important is stability is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.600
 say the permanence of that coverage in 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.090
 the time that the determined medium has 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.500
 for example one thing is that of 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.130
 stability of a magazine that can 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.229
 have we bought at home and where 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.369
 obviously the frequency of that magazine 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.670
 it's monthly 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.649
 then it is very likely that the magazine 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.149
 stay at home and can be read 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.690
 by different members of the household 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.710
 throughout that month unlike a 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.750
 magazine that is weekly 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.240
 normally a magazine that weekly to the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.330
 next week is already replaced by 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.429
 the one of the new edition not also a 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.560
 magazine that's why the newspaper is a diary 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.420
 It is usually characterized because 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.950
 submit your name says it or proceed 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.720
 what is given day 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.720
 that is to say the day of the next one ends in 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.489
 the garbage then enter the person 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.010
 which actually collects newspapers 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.739
 then between them for stability 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.930
 we also choose then the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.060
 stay of the notice because then and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.069
 a notice in a magazine can be read 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.200
 several times throughout the month while 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.690
 that in a diary is only seen once 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.150
 the moment another was read too 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.680
 criterion is repetition repetition 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.319
 has to do with the possibility for 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.049
 allow more than one impact and this is 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.239
 very related to the frequency that 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.160
 we want to have in a 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.340
 certain campaign is to say how many 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.260
 Sometimes we want the target audience 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.230
 listen to our message and there 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.790
 obviously we have all over the radio 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.000
 those means that help us a lot 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.940
 to generate this frequency not because 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.030
 normally one listens to music is not 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.890
 certain gender and we listen 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.209
 normally a station to determined 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.069
 period of time however also 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.580
 we used to follow a 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.500
 Same route to work 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.870
 then we are also exposed to 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.230
 many thousand shofar palettes that we 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.290
 allow that repetition throughout 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.570
 we create the way to our work 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.010
 another criterion is the selectivity the 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.860
 selectivity has to do with the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.320
 sociodemographic penetration by consumption 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.600
 or lifestyle today is a 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.790
 very used criterion for overcoat 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.240
 niche campaigns not when we have 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.510
 a certain product that is not 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.690
 directed to make massive and then 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.090
 We need to choose a certain 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.340
 of means that will make us more read 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.890
 or more related to um to that certain 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.140
 public in this case we usually have 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.450
 the specialized magazines we do not have 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.730
 the magazines are executive or those that 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.890
 they are specialized clean women 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.550
 or those that have wings on issues of 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.130
 home about real estate etc and the 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.650
 fifth criterion is the rate the rate 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.390
 is that we use it as a criterion of 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.910
 way across the four 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.810
 mentioned above are very 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.919
 related to him 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.990
 of a certain commercial or notice 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.870
 advertising because we what 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.090
 we seek is to impact the audience and 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.020
 then and that cost of each impact is 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.060
 the same and in an audiovisual medium that 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.910
 in a graphic medium if we count 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.700
 the impact for every time in a 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.169
 person listens to the message 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.730
 It's definitely not the same to be 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.840
 exposed to an audiovisual medium where 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.760
 we can listen and see let's say where the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.860
 message may be clearer to a 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.560
 half plane where normally at no 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.960
 have an audio suddenly this is not going 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.510
 to be able to have more information no more 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.340
 creativity in the notice however 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.190
 we can also have much more detail 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.430
 of the warning and that is the advantage of the 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.620
 graphic videos 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.000
 each of these criteria obviously 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.820
 have 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.100
 a series of variables and measurements that 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.380
 we take into account each one 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.780
 of the suppliers of our market and 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.940
 let's go deeper into the following 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.270
 many media zone systems 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.270
 Thank you 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:00.920
 today we decided on twitter 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.920
 see you until next time
