00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello to everyone back for 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.930
 rather show you a little hairstyle 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.460
 I felt like he actually made 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.020
 often very simple hairstyles 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.789
 you will have noticed it on my pictures on 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.079
 instagram and everything but we ask 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.250
 always where and how do you do your rating 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.150
 I can not do my hull 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.550
 yet not something very 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.900
 complicated but it's true that some 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.800
 this is not easy and 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.259
 it's true when you have short hair 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.910
 Well, we think we can do nothing 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.600
 with his hair and yet if it's 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.489
 we can do something 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.900
 when we have motivation when we have a 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.280
 little time we can a little when 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.780
 even succeed in doing the little hairstyle to 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.100
 his hair good I do not hide that 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.229
 like everyone when I'm in a hurry 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.089
 throw a little like this on the top and 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.460
 then and then it fits very well 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.930
 but so we go to the hairstyle so I 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 will show you this famous this 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.500
 famous shell that still has a 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.909
 crepe technique I think I have 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.830
 certainly had to talk about it in my 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.420
 previous videos but that's it 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.330
 goes back and all so I'm going up a 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.000
 little bit this tutorial you left for this 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.379
 little tokyo then i'm going to need 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.030
 of many things including a brush 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.250
 flat that will allow me to smooth my 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.390
 hair and help my books i'm going 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.830
 also need a good eye to tail 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.829
 to be able to make separations and 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.810
 made a pretty crepe a few pliers 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.799
 so flat or tongs a little bit to 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.289
 bun that you can find 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.090
 easily at h &amp; m for example of course 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.780
 our indispensable lake to set the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:31.659
 turn is finally so some claws of 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.729
 separation we start right away 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.960
 so by doing a separation for 8 and 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.569
 to get tangled with the brushes we will come 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.439
 isolated the top of the head to think 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:43.060
 to do our our cock afterwards 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.069
 to get that separation for you 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.950
 spot just simply to 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.079
 actually take there your concern is the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.999
 above and for a re like this 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:56.619
 on both sides at this level there then he 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:58.270
 just wrap your wick and the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.230
 fix with pliers you will see 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.640
 it's inevitable you'll look 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.080
 we will start with creping on 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.760
 the back of the head so to achieve 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.979
 a good crepe so you need a 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.540
 tooth comb 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.650
 so just hold your wick to 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.900
 these fairs it really takes a good 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.880
 voltage for before creping and so 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.250
 started from the root by leading you 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.080
 so towards the tip with a succession 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.300
 of movements it is not enough to go there 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.970
 with the pressure you have to go when 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.950
 very smooth and therefore as it supported 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.950
 with the teeth of your sentence 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.030
 I will add that a page feature and well 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.220
 realized when the wick stands alone 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.900
 up here I continue my 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.590
 ascent and so I pancake the second 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.590
 wick with the same technique all bling 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.560
 here to not be bothered with wicks 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.850
 aside not what I'm doing is that I 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.010
 do a separation so at the level of 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:59.110
 their duo of the ear and I 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:00.370
 so keep up with pliers for 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.860
 the back of the head so what am I going 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.250
 to do is that I understand me my 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.750
 frozen separation of the beautiful and frozen I 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.690
 do a spin in fact for it to be 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.560
 really well kept tight enough 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.910
 short hair cornal or will notice 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.890
 that his back is very difficult to 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.750
 do something else and so we 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.680
 maintained with one or even two gripper 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.680
 even three 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.770
 we do not forget the little lacquer 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.060
 always to fix all that then here 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.560
 so I'm taking care of the ribs and so I 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.520
 also go the crepes already because 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.200
 me they are a little bit more 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.340
 sparse this level there so it gives 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.680
 really an impression that are a 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.950
 little more provided and especially it brings some 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.950
 volume 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.480
 so with this separation I'm going all 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.830
 just the traits so that's when 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.060
 you want to make a braid like that 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.920
 and that you feel like the task is 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.410
 rather backwards start to 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.520
 braid by directing 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.530
 where you want to take him 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.030
 do that it will avoid false movement at 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.959
 root level will be easier to 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.959
 the task and then 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.500
 here it's something that I do everything 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.940
 the time when I'm getting a braid and 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.349
 I give it to you one by one 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.540
 like that to avoid it being rhône 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.650
 to be too tidy I like that this 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.430
 a braid a little bit of 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.430
 structures is like that 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.600
 here so I'll just 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.130
 fasten with a pliers while tidying up makes the 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.390
 end of me addresses inside 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.380
 lavery that I did just now to 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.520
 avoid having small locks like 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.650
 they come out everywhere 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.520
 if we can hide them why not 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.830
 so me here I'm going to do the same thing 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.600
 on the other side so I'm also going 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.240
 TRESemmé why not give a result 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.760
 also asymmetrical by realizing that 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.220
 a sad one side 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.220
 the result is just as pretty 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.500
 here so I'm busy overhead so 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.360
 I'll repeat a little put a 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.730
 little shot of lacquer for really good 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.470
 secure and once we can 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.780
 crepe and well realized just enough 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.890
 to pass a little brushstroke just 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.480
 to smooth the little ones a little 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.490
 hair from above but especially we go back 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.930
 not inside the crepe with his 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.280
 brush for really just slipped the 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.630
 above is fixed and that's it for what 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.280
 is about wicks like that of 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.550
 recovery laugh no need to do 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.550
 more 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.879
 so I'm going to take care of the 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.860
 last bit and so for that I'm going 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.599
 also here crepe so I resume 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.039
 my loincloth that I take a first 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.009
 separation so rather we start more 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:41.169
 early with the wick we move from the back 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.659
 forward and so always with the 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.610
 same technique of creping I abstain 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.729
 hold in the air so make a leap 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.620
 creping have it left in the air and 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.000
 then we move like that to the front 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.110
 so those who want can 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.759
 also leave a small lick on 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:03.710
 the front of me here I do it completely 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:09.700
 cleared my face from m 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.700
 because she wanted 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.639
 Yes, but 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.169
 although I slipped a little long 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.479
 kesh the high level of the last mass 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.430
 I place them like that with my fingers and 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.530
 what I do is that I fix in 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.030
 general with a small flat place so 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.500
 that's what I do when I do you 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.810
 saw with a shell in my videos 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.190
 in my photos at the crepe of the 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.840
 above it is in any case what I 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.289
 know what I'm doing to have a pretty 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.289
 bombay
