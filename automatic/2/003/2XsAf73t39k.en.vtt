he was a pick of the bowlers along with
both<00:01:18.540> Nashua<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.950> he<00:01:20.100> took<00:01:20.280> three<00:01:20.610> really

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
both Nashua but so he took three really

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.140

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
but also Harbhajan Singh I think he

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.469 
but also Harbhajan Singh I think he
bowled<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.070> lot<00:01:29.220> better<00:01:29.430> than<00:01:29.729> than<00:01:30.210> what<00:01:30.360> we

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479

some<00:01:32.880> former<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.780> confidence<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.130> he<00:01:35.400> he<00:01:36.119> took

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
hypothetical question I think if you

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.230 
hypothetical question I think if you
were<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.470> Indian<00:02:37.830> think<00:02:38.100> tank<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.520> think<00:02:38.880> the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
were the Indian think tank I think the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.490 
were the Indian think tank I think the
team<00:02:39.450> they've<00:02:39.630> selected<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:40.170> think<00:02:40.380> they've

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
team they've selected I think they've

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.710 
team they've selected I think they've
been<00:02:40.680> vindicated<00:02:40.890> simply<00:02:41.670> because<00:02:42.000> you've

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
been vindicated simply because you've

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.950 
been vindicated simply because you've
had<00:02:42.960> straily<00:02:43.650> win<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> toss<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.600> an<00:02:45.600> India

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
had straily win the toss and an India

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.980 
had straily win the toss and an India
reduced<00:02:46.470> them<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.710> lessen<00:02:47.490> 250<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.810> whether

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
reduced them to lessen 250 so whether

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.840 
reduced them to lessen 250 so whether
fergie<00:02:49.410> enojo<00:02:49.920> could<00:02:50.100> have<00:02:50.190> done<00:02:50.340> better<00:02:50.490> who

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
fergie enojo could have done better who

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.170 
fergie enojo could have done better who
knows<00:02:51.060> he<00:02:51.780> certainly<00:02:52.020> wasn't<00:02:52.320> lucky<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:53.490> be<00:02:53.640> to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
knows he certainly wasn't lucky to be to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.000 
knows he certainly wasn't lucky to be to
be<00:02:54.270> left<00:02:54.480> out<00:02:54.660> once<00:02:54.930> again<00:02:55.110> remember<00:02:55.680> he<00:02:55.830> was

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
be left out once again remember he was

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.240 
be left out once again remember he was
the<00:02:56.040> most<00:02:56.340> impressive<00:02:56.700> indian<00:02:57.690> bowler

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
the most impressive indian bowler

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.590 
the most impressive indian bowler
against<00:02:59.250> their<00:02:59.430> england<00:02:59.850> in<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.300> series

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
against their england in that series

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.170 
against their england in that series
defeat<00:03:01.140> he<00:03:01.290> was<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.470> top<00:03:01.710> wicket-taker<00:03:02.180> but

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
defeat he was a top wicket-taker but

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.640 
defeat he was a top wicket-taker but
really<00:03:04.170> ever<00:03:04.590> all<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.010> bowlers<00:03:05.420> perhaps

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
really ever all the bowlers perhaps

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.920 
really ever all the bowlers perhaps
obviously<00:03:07.650> shad<00:03:07.980> didn't<00:03:08.310> ball<00:03:08.490> well<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.060> there

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
obviously shad didn't ball well so there

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.020 
obviously shad didn't ball well so there
may<00:03:10.140> have<00:03:10.440> been<00:03:10.500> an<00:03:10.770> argument<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.310> pick<00:03:11.880> only

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
may have been an argument to pick only

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.660 
may have been an argument to pick only
one<00:03:12.180> pacer<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.110> load<00:03:13.830> your<00:03:13.860> team<00:03:14.250> with<00:03:14.460> four

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
one pacer and load your team with four

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.970 
one pacer and load your team with four
spinners<00:03:15.150> but<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.870> think<00:03:16.080> all<00:03:16.200> in<00:03:16.350> all<00:03:16.470> you

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
spinners but I think all in all you

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.710 
spinners but I think all in all you
can't<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.430> too<00:03:17.670> critical<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.390> Indian

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720

total of in excess of perhaps 350 400

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.340 
total of in excess of perhaps 350 400
but<00:04:46.950> even<00:04:47.250> with<00:04:47.400> Clark's<00:04:47.760> 91<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.510> Wade's

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
but even with Clark's 91 and Wade's

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.010 
but even with Clark's 91 and Wade's
half-century<00:04:50.250> they've<00:04:50.460> only<00:04:50.640> scored<00:04:51.000> 237<00:04:51.810> and

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
half-century they've only scored 237 and

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.580 
half-century they've only scored 237 and
interestingly<00:04:52.610> this<00:04:53.610> pitch<00:04:53.910> looks<00:04:54.690> looks

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
interestingly this pitch looks looks

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.110 
interestingly this pitch looks looks

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
probably better to Baton then shall I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.940 
probably better to Baton then shall I
