00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.229 
collects - there's only one server at
the<00:00:43.890> moment<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.489> tell<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:45.120> the

first<00:00:45.420> time<00:00:45.539> that's<00:00:45.719> happening<00:00:45.989> -<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
first time that's happening - like the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.600 
first time that's happening - like the
texture<00:00:46.800> outs<00:00:46.890> there<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> don't<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.430> they

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
texture outs there I don't think they

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.540 
texture outs there I don't think they
were<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.730> in-game<00:00:48.329> though<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:49.399> this<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
were in in-game though like this the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.709 
were in in-game though like this the
first<00:00:50.670> time<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> train<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.329> -<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.629> is

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
first time you train it out - which is

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.020 
first time you train it out - which is
quite<00:00:51.930> weird<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.940> but<00:00:53.940> yeah

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
quite weird so there you go and but yeah

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.979 
quite weird so there you go and but yeah
so<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.360> said<00:00:54.480> there's<00:00:54.660> only<00:00:54.690> one

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
so like I said there's only one

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.240 
so like I said there's only one
dedicated<00:00:55.170> server<00:00:55.590> at<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> moment<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.160> this

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
dedicated server at the moment and this

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
dedicated server at the moment and this
kind<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.670> idea<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.030> what<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.360> mod<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.750> it's

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
kind of idea of what this mod is it's

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.090 
kind of idea of what this mod is it's
the<00:00:58.140> fact<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:58.890> we're

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
gonna have our own dedicated servers

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
gonna have our own dedicated servers
rather<00:01:00.840> than<00:01:01.050> using<00:01:01.340> rockstars<00:01:02.340> peer-to-peer

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699

and but another now I should say is the
fact<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.090> also<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.659> tell

by it flashing around the screen this is
pre<00:01:29.670> dev<00:01:29.970> which<00:01:30.210> means<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.740> literally<00:01:31.740> just

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
pre dev which means it's literally just

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.440 
pre dev which means it's literally just
came<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> people<00:01:33.150> saying

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
came out and as a lot of people saying

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
came out and as a lot of people saying
it<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.930> bare<00:01:34.140> bones<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> month<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.159> far

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340

the work they are working on it at the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.870 
the work they are working on it at the
time<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.560> kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.189> proof

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
time this is kind of just like a proof

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.010 
time this is kind of just like a proof
of<00:01:39.030> concept<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> fact<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.930> know

of concept that the fact like you know
they're<00:01:40.229> doing<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.920> how<00:01:41.130> they've<00:01:41.310> got

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
they're doing it this is how they've got

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.340

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
guessing I don't know like top my head I

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.050 
guessing I don't know like top my head I
don't<00:02:43.350> feel<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:43.710> it<00:02:43.860> would<00:02:44.040> not<00:02:44.670> stop<00:02:44.970> you

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
don't feel like it would not stop you

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.700 
don't feel like it would not stop you
from<00:02:45.090> getting<00:02:45.330> banned<00:02:45.630> but<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.260> can't<00:02:46.650> say

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
from getting banned but like I can't say

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.410 
from getting banned but like I can't say
for<00:02:46.830> sure<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.460> obviously<00:02:47.970> use<00:02:48.120> at<00:02:48.270> your<00:02:48.300> own

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
for sure and obviously use at your own

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.860 
for sure and obviously use at your own
risk

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
risk

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.840 
risk
so<00:02:49.320> there<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.530> go<00:02:49.680> but<00:02:50.370> anyway<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.700> way<00:02:50.790> to

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
so there you go but anyway the way to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.580 
so there you go but anyway the way to
install<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.330> really<00:02:51.630> simple<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.140> easy<00:02:52.230> I

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
install is really simple and easy I

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.560 
install is really simple and easy I
think<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.280> can<00:02:53.400> do<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.640> I've<00:02:53.880> done<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
think you can do this I've done it the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.090 
think you can do this I've done it the
normal<00:02:54.840> way<00:02:54.900> which<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.680> drag<00:02:55.950> and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
normal way which is you just drag and

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.560 
normal way which is you just drag and
drop<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.340> all<00:02:56.490> into<00:02:56.790> your<00:02:56.940> Rockstar<00:02:57.270> root

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
drop it all into your Rockstar root

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.040 
drop it all into your Rockstar root
server<00:02:58.400> root<00:02:59.400> server<00:02:59.670> root<00:02:59.970> folder<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.630> what

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
server root server root folder and what

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.270 
server root server root folder and what
that'll<00:03:01.200> do<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.410> that'll<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.890> know<00:03:02.010> put<00:03:02.190> all

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
that'll do is that'll you know put all

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.950 
that'll do is that'll you know put all
your<00:03:02.370> folders<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.850> there<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.750> know<00:03:03.840> it

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
your folders in there and you know it

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.720 
your folders in there and you know it
also<00:03:04.080> obviously<00:03:04.470> replaces<00:03:05.040> script<00:03:05.370> took<00:03:05.520> two

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
also obviously replaces script took two

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.570 
also obviously replaces script took two
I<00:03:05.760> thinks<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.240> got<00:03:06.360> its<00:03:06.450> own<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.750> there<00:03:06.900> and

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
I thinks it's got its own in there and

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.660 
I thinks it's got its own in there and
it<00:03:08.580> also<00:03:08.730> has<00:03:08.970> its<00:03:09.000> own<00:03:09.270> citizen<00:03:10.230> IV<00:03:10.710> exe<00:03:11.640> I

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
it also has its own citizen IV exe I

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.400 
it also has its own citizen IV exe I
think<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.030> called<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.870> what<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.260> is

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
think it's called and what that is is

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.690 
think it's called and what that is is
you<00:03:13.500> actually<00:03:13.740> use<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.280> actually<00:03:14.520> run

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
you actually use that to actually run

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.090 
you actually use that to actually run
this<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.660> if<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.930> load<00:03:16.110> up<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.380> game<00:03:16.500> normally

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
this so if you load up the game normally

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.160 
this so if you load up the game normally
it's<00:03:17.370> not<00:03:17.459> gonna<00:03:17.790> work<00:03:18.030> whereas<00:03:18.720> if<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:18.930> load

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
it's not gonna work whereas if you load

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.620 
it's not gonna work whereas if you load
up<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.410> game<00:03:19.590> using<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.160> citizen<00:03:20.640> IV<00:03:20.940> exe

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
up the game using that citizen IV exe

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.140 
up the game using that citizen IV exe
what's<00:03:22.230> gonna<00:03:22.350> happen<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.830> it'll<00:03:23.430> load<00:03:23.670> up<00:03:23.880> and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
what's gonna happen is it'll load up and

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.699 
what's gonna happen is it'll load up and
it'll<00:03:24.450> also<00:03:24.660> obviously<00:03:25.080> selling<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.500> into

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
it'll also obviously selling you into

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.290 
it'll also obviously selling you into
social<00:03:25.980> club<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.580> know<00:03:26.700> that'll<00:03:26.910> come<00:03:27.030> on

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
social club you know that'll come on

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.480 
social club you know that'll come on
and<00:03:27.560> if<00:03:28.560> you'll<00:03:28.709> know<00:03:28.860> if<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.070> worked<00:03:29.370> is

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
and if you'll know if it's worked is

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.490 
and if you'll know if it's worked is
because<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.510> interface<00:03:30.720> will<00:03:30.959> be<00:03:31.080> white<00:03:31.290> so

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
because the interface will be white so

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.930 
because the interface will be white so
if<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.650> press<00:03:31.800> escape<00:03:31.920> or<00:03:32.220> show<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.550> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
if I press escape or show you the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.460 
if I press escape or show you the
interface<00:03:33.240> is<00:03:33.390> kind<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.690> wiped<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.110> blinding

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
interface is kind of wiped and blinding

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.870 
interface is kind of wiped and blinding
all<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.650> math<00:03:34.920> obviously<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.310> book<00:03:35.640> I'm

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
all this math obviously a book I'm

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.120 
all this math obviously a book I'm
guessing<00:03:36.720> or<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.140> intentional<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:37.860> don't

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
guessing or it's intentional I don't

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.920 
guessing or it's intentional I don't
know<00:03:38.280> might<00:03:38.760> be<00:03:38.790> intentional<00:03:39.420> my<00:03:39.570> not<00:03:39.720> being

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
know might be intentional my not being

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.480 
know might be intentional my not being
will<00:03:40.350> know<00:03:40.530> if<00:03:40.620> it's<00:03:40.740> worked<00:03:40.980> if<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:41.310> white

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
will know if it's worked if it's white

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.060 
will know if it's worked if it's white
