of<00:00:56.300> like<00:00:59.500> it<00:01:00.500> might<00:01:00.710> be<00:01:00.739> able<00:01:00.920> maybe<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.760> little

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
of like it might be able maybe a little

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.190 
of like it might be able maybe a little
thicker<00:01:02.329> than<00:01:02.600> olive<00:01:03.050> oil<00:01:03.309> is<00:01:04.309> pretty<00:01:04.610> thick

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.200 
thicker than olive oil is pretty thick

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:15.310 
thicker than olive oil is pretty thick
and<00:01:06.200> what<00:01:06.560> I<00:01:06.590> did<00:01:06.920> was<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:08.450> hold<00:01:08.750> on<00:01:13.899> what<00:01:14.899> I<00:01:15.110> did

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
and what I did was a hold on what I did

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.219 
and what I did was a hold on what I did
was<00:01:15.619> I<00:01:16.070> put<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:17.020> into<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.259> applicator<00:01:19.009> bottle

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
was I put it into this applicator bottle

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.600 
was I put it into this applicator bottle
just<00:01:21.229> like<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.470> random<00:01:21.710> one<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:22.009> I<00:01:22.070> had<00:01:22.280> so

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
just like a random one that I had so

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.870 
just like a random one that I had so
it'd<00:01:22.729> be<00:01:22.850> easier<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.180> apply<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:23.600> my<00:01:23.990> scalp<00:01:24.289> and

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
it'd be easier to apply to my scalp and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.910 
it'd be easier to apply to my scalp and
but<00:01:25.880> it's<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.270> thick<00:01:26.539> that<00:01:26.780> I<00:01:27.229> had<00:01:27.440> to<00:01:27.649> thin<00:01:27.890> it

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
but it's so thick that I had to thin it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.090 
but it's so thick that I had to thin it
out<00:01:28.100> with<00:01:28.429> some<00:01:28.520> other<00:01:28.700> oils<00:01:29.289> so<00:01:30.289> I<00:01:30.319> put<00:01:30.830> some

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
out with some other oils so I put some

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.669 
out with some other oils so I put some
oil<00:01:31.909> in<00:01:32.330> there<00:01:32.569> and<00:01:33.190> I<00:01:34.190> put<00:01:35.200> some<00:01:36.200> grapeseed

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
oil in there and I put some grapeseed

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.330 
oil in there and I put some grapeseed
oil<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.399> there<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:39.380> then<00:01:39.679> i<00:01:39.710> put<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.039> little<00:01:40.100> bit

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
oil in there and then i put a little bit

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.990 
oil in there and then i put a little bit
of<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:40.520> tea<00:01:40.759> tree<00:01:41.000> oil<00:01:41.030> in<00:01:41.840> there<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.009> then<00:01:43.880> i

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
of a tea tree oil in there and then i

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.090 
of a tea tree oil in there and then i
put<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.569> little<00:01:44.630> bit<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.229> coconut<00:01:45.740> oil<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.590> that

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
put a little bit of coconut oil so that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.919 
put a little bit of coconut oil so that
thinned<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:49.880> out<00:01:50.000> a<00:01:50.060> little<00:01:50.299> bit<00:01:50.450> enough<00:01:50.780> so

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
thinned it out a little bit enough so

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.469 
thinned it out a little bit enough so
that<00:01:50.959> it<00:01:51.319> could<00:01:51.500> come<00:01:51.709> out<00:01:52.069> of<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.970> applicator

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
that it could come out of the applicator

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.699 
that it could come out of the applicator
tip<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:55.360> i've<00:01:56.360> just<00:01:56.509> been<00:01:56.659> like<00:01:56.869> putting<00:01:57.530> it

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
tip and i've just been like putting it

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.490 
tip and i've just been like putting it
especially<00:01:58.550> on<00:01:58.640> my<00:01:58.729> edges<00:01:59.119> with<00:01:59.899> my<00:02:00.020> edges

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
especially on my edges with my edges

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.270 
especially on my edges with my edges
like<00:02:00.739> that<00:02:01.009> I'm<00:02:01.789> like<00:02:02.000> rubbing<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.509> in<00:02:03.280> like

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
like that I'm like rubbing it in like

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.919 
like that I'm like rubbing it in like
that<00:02:04.330> and<00:02:05.330> then<00:02:06.289> I<00:02:06.410> usually<00:02:07.539> do<00:02:08.539> my<00:02:08.720> whole

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
that and then I usually do my whole

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.529 
that and then I usually do my whole
scalp<00:02:09.229> like<00:02:09.560> that

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
scalp like that

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.830 
scalp like that
so<00:02:12.000> I'm<00:02:13.000> going<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.239> probably<00:02:13.510> do<00:02:13.719> that<00:02:13.930> for<00:02:14.409> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so I'm going to probably do that for a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.869 
so I'm going to probably do that for a
couple<00:02:16.840> months<00:02:17.170> maybe<00:02:17.769> I'll<00:02:18.129> do<00:02:18.310> like<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.519> six

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
couple months maybe I'll do like a six

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.750 
couple months maybe I'll do like a six
month<00:02:19.299> or<00:02:19.510> four<00:02:19.750> months<00:02:19.900> thing<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.709> see<00:02:21.370> if

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
month or four months thing and see if

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.039 
month or four months thing and see if
there's<00:02:22.359> any<00:02:22.599> difference<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:26.700> yeah<00:02:27.720> I'm<00:02:28.720> kind

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
there's any difference so yeah I'm kind

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.259 
there's any difference so yeah I'm kind
of<00:02:29.109> hoping<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:30.099> it'll<00:02:30.340> actually<00:02:30.489> work<00:02:30.760> cuz

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
of hoping that it'll actually work cuz

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.539 
of hoping that it'll actually work cuz
you<00:02:31.390> know<00:02:31.510> trying<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.530> thicken<00:02:32.769> out<00:02:33.010> my<00:02:33.189> edges

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
you know trying to thicken out my edges

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.770 
you know trying to thicken out my edges
