00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
in with that but because of our current

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.990 
in with that but because of our current
labeling<00:00:10.620> laws<00:00:10.830> manufacturers<00:00:11.759> can

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
labeling laws manufacturers can

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.810 
labeling laws manufacturers can
perfectly<00:00:12.690> legally<00:00:13.230> present<00:00:13.860> foods<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.670> way

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
perfectly legally present foods in a way

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.430 
perfectly legally present foods in a way
that<00:00:15.059> suggests<00:00:15.240> they<00:00:15.599> might<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.900> better<00:00:16.139> for

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
that suggests they might be better for

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.870 
that suggests they might be better for
us<00:00:16.500> than<00:00:16.859> they<00:00:17.010> really<00:00:17.340> are

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
us than they really are

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.050 
us than they really are
take<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.140> example<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:19.949> an<00:00:20.279> officially

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
take this for example it's an officially

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.140 
take this for example it's an officially
low-fat<00:00:21.660> biscuit<00:00:22.250> personally<00:00:23.250> I'd<00:00:23.490> imagine

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
low-fat biscuit personally I'd imagine

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.120 
low-fat biscuit personally I'd imagine
that<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.630> bought<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.140> I'd<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.560> eating<00:00:25.740> less

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
that if I bought this I'd be eating less

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.890 
that if I bought this I'd be eating less
calories<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> front<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
calories but what the front of the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.240 
calories but what the front of the
packet<00:00:28.199> doesn't<00:00:28.500> tell<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.010> these

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
packet doesn't tell you is that these

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.040 
packet doesn't tell you is that these
biscuits<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.880> very<00:00:30.119> high<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.390> sugar

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
biscuits are very high in sugar

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.500 
biscuits are very high in sugar
so<00:00:31.590> these<00:00:31.740> officially<00:00:32.369> low-fat<00:00:32.940> biscuits

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
so these officially low-fat biscuits

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.950 
so these officially low-fat biscuits
contain<00:00:34.020> more<00:00:34.290> calories<00:00:34.350> than<00:00:35.130> these<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
contain more calories than these and

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.490 
contain more calories than these and
these<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.559> these<00:00:38.570> none<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.719> which<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.050> dream<00:00:40.379> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
these and these none of which I dream of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.229 
these and these none of which I dream of
buying<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.250> watching<00:00:41.610> my<00:00:41.760> weight

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.119

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
if they're just me or are the people

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.740 
if they're just me or are the people
confused<00:00:47.579> by<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> labels<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> front<00:00:48.600> of

confused by the labels on the front of

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.360 
confused by the labels on the front of

the front of the packet only tells half

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.300 
the front of the packet only tells half
the<00:01:14.430> story<00:01:14.869> when<00:01:15.869> manufacturers<00:01:16.560> reduced<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the story when manufacturers reduced the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.940 
the story when manufacturers reduced the
fat<00:01:17.550> often<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.479> lose<00:01:18.690> flavor<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.440> they<00:01:19.740> may

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
fat often you lose flavor and they may

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.800 
fat often you lose flavor and they may
add<00:01:20.100> sugar<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.670> order<00:01:20.910> to<00:01:21.030> give<00:01:21.149> you<00:01:21.270> back<00:01:21.539> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
add sugar in order to give you back that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
add sugar in order to give you back that
flavor<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.679> the<00:01:22.800> claim<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.100> they're<00:01:23.429> making

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
flavor but the claim that they're making

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.810 
flavor but the claim that they're making
is<00:01:23.940> only<00:01:24.390> about<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.990> specific<00:01:25.830> nutrient<00:01:26.460> if

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
is only about that specific nutrient if

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.029 
is only about that specific nutrient if
it's<00:01:27.450> low<00:01:27.690> in<00:01:27.869> fat<00:01:27.899> that's<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.740> they're

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
it's low in fat that's all they're

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.160 
it's low in fat that's all they're
claiming<00:01:29.340> what's<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.539> important<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
claiming what's really important is that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.380 
claiming what's really important is that
you<00:01:31.530> look<00:01:31.649> at<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:31.950> whole<00:01:32.160> food<00:01:32.550> look<00:01:33.149> at<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
you look at the whole food look at the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.730 
you look at the whole food look at the
back<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.899> pack<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.560> think

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
back of the pack and I think

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
back of the pack and I think
manufacturers<00:01:35.429> could<00:01:35.610> make<00:01:35.789> that<00:01:35.970> labeling

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
manufacturers could make that labeling

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.020 
manufacturers could make that labeling
much<00:01:36.630> clearer<00:01:37.100> it's<00:01:38.100> amazing<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
much clearer it's amazing what the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.359 
much clearer it's amazing what the
labeling<00:01:39.420> laws<00:01:39.659> allow<00:01:40.020> look<00:01:40.380> at<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:41.310> is

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
labeling laws allow look at this this is

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.020 
labeling laws allow look at this this is
a<00:01:41.490> plain<00:01:41.880> yogurt<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.869> 3.7<00:01:43.740> grams<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.460> fat<00:01:44.759> per

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
a plain yogurt with 3.7 grams of fat per
