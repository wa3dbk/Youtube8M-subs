00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.919
 are there people here by chance 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.370

 casaque rule it does not matter how 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.669
 trip 1 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.079
 so to situate yourself a little tunisia 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:28.310
 is completely 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:33.160
 we still have africa see it is there 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.160
 exactly good you take the a-40 is 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.230
 you know what 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.699
 because I'm not black sometimes 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.930
 are there people who do not believe me when I 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.290
 say i live in africa 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.370
 and well believe me in peach blanket 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.410
 come from africa 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.070
 how can be thin and come from 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.070
 United States 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.790
 I go 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.240
 if you did not go to tunisia you 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.150
 have heard about it I hope a son 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.370
 country that triggered the Arab Spring 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.420
 who was going to inspire a spring is here 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.420
 for Quebec students 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.560
 I was watching TV here how she 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.569
 is graceful there are some who say she 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.130
 looks like a changing siren 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:28.860
 doors the Mediterranean ever sailors 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.530
 not your good port in any case it works 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.399
 with tourists 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.920
 and I think it looks like 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:40.619
 rather to a sea horse and fair is 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.810
 a step listened it is true that the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.979
 current situation in tunisia is more 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.689
 or at least one of the temples for 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.619
 tourists but I'm not very worried 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.840
 a they will come back 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.030
 let's say we had a small problem of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.079
 corruption but it was not as bad 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.079
 to mascouche laval 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.420
 according to the moderate Islamists who in 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.310
 premium why you can always 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.009
 drink alcohol 1 and bathe in 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.680
 stung neither girls even topless 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.880
 the only thing that will change is that 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:23.570
 the service will be done by blind people 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:27.960
 and moderate Islamists mont-houy 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.760
 moderate as senator woodvenu and 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.590
 for the first time in history 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.150
 Tunisia we vote in elections 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.610

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.760

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.239

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.689
 commissions of inquiry into crimes 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.159
 organized 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:58.860
 especially in Tunisia the crime was 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:03:01.170
 the only thing organized father I 'm going 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.890

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.489
 Fridays even god taxes too

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.120
 this Tunisian revolution that has 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.590
 inspired many peoples in the world 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.500
 but Quebecers between 1.1 and even 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.639
 Americans followed with the movement 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.239
 occupy and they manifested singing 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:52.190
 the Tunisian slogan in Arabic cats there 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:55.650
