00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.940 

and<00:03:02.810> I'm<00:03:03.810> attaching<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> tab<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:07.170> when<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
and I'm attaching the tab so when the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.789 
and I'm attaching the tab so when the
zipper<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.459> closed

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
zipper is closed

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.009 
zipper is closed
the<00:03:10.799> tab<00:03:11.069> is<00:03:11.310> going<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.489> be<00:03:11.639> on<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.600> side<00:03:12.780> where

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
the tab is going to be on the side where

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.890 
the tab is going to be on the side where
the<00:03:13.049> zipper<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:16.220> fold<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.430> half

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
the zipper is so fold it in half

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.360 
the zipper is so fold it in half
attach<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.290> tab<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.069> center<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:22.250> put<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
attach the tab to the center and put the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:32.940 
attach the tab to the center and put the
fabric<00:03:23.549> here<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.859> pin<00:03:25.859> in<00:03:25.980> place<00:03:28.850> like<00:03:29.850> so

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.640 

it's<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:34.060> half<00:03:34.240> inch<00:03:34.450> seam<00:03:34.780> line<00:03:35.020> so<00:03:35.290> just<00:03:35.319> so

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
it's a half inch seam line so just so

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.400 
it's a half inch seam line so just so
half<00:03:35.950> an<00:03:36.130> inch<00:03:36.280> from<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.580> edge<00:03:36.870> trim<00:03:37.870> down<00:03:38.140> to

half an inch from the edge trim down to
a<00:03:38.440> quarter<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.950> an<00:03:39.040> inch<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.520> attach<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.690> bias

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
a quarter of an inch and attach the bias

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.650 
a quarter of an inch and attach the bias
tape<00:03:41.489> after<00:03:42.489> you<00:03:42.580> attach<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.090> bias<00:03:43.300> tape

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
tape after you attach the bias tape

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.059 
tape after you attach the bias tape
you're<00:03:43.989> going<00:03:44.020> to<00:03:44.170> wrap<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.590> bias<00:03:44.800> tape

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
you're going to wrap the bias tape

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.970 
you're going to wrap the bias tape
around<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.819> top<00:03:46.390> stitch<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.590> here's<00:03:50.800> one

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
around and top stitch so here's one

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.690

time the bias tape on both ends I'm

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.310 
time the bias tape on both ends I'm
going<00:04:16.269> to<00:04:16.450> fold<00:04:16.750> under<00:04:17.169> half<00:04:17.470> an<00:04:17.650> inch<00:04:18.060> and

that<00:04:28.389> to<00:04:28.510> all<00:04:28.630> four<00:04:28.660> sides<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:31.800> I'll<00:04:32.800> show<00:04:33.130> you

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
that to all four sides so I'll show you

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:41.190 
that to all four sides so I'll show you
what<00:04:33.430> it<00:04:33.520> looks<00:04:33.729> like<00:04:33.880> on<00:04:34.330> this<00:04:35.020> one<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.960> really

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
what it looks like on this one it really

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.830 
what it looks like on this one it really
makes<00:04:41.440> for<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.770> clean<00:04:42.070> edge<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:43.690> won't

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
makes for a clean edge and you won't

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.640 
makes for a clean edge and you won't
have<00:04:43.990> any<00:04:44.169> raw<00:04:44.350> edges<00:04:44.590> or<00:04:45.130> anything<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:46.650> this

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
have any raw edges or anything and this

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.700 
have any raw edges or anything and this
should<00:04:47.830> be<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.979> I<00:04:48.810> guess<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:50.110> really<00:04:50.560> good

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
should be a I guess a really good

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.670 
should be a I guess a really good
project<00:04:51.220> for<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.520> beginner<00:04:51.900> intermediate<00:04:52.900> so

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
project for a beginner intermediate so

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.020 
project for a beginner intermediate so
err<00:04:55.800> again<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:56.950> can<00:04:57.070> make<00:04:57.160> these<00:04:57.310> patches<00:04:57.550> for

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
err again you can make these patches for

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:05.340 
err again you can make these patches for
anything<00:04:58.600> any<00:04:58.990> size<00:05:01.440> so<00:05:02.700> hopefully<00:05:03.700> um<00:05:04.350> I'll

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
anything any size so hopefully um I'll

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.050 
anything any size so hopefully um I'll
have<00:05:05.410> another<00:05:05.919> episode<00:05:06.070> for<00:05:06.580> you<00:05:06.669> next<00:05:06.880> week

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
have another episode for you next week

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.490 
have another episode for you next week
and<00:05:08.550> probably<00:05:09.550> another<00:05:09.970> craft<00:05:10.330> project<00:05:10.960> but

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
and probably another craft project but

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.820 
and probably another craft project but
after<00:05:11.710> that<00:05:12.010> I'm<00:05:12.340> I'm<00:05:13.000> hoping<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.630> create<00:05:14.470> a

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
after that I'm I'm hoping to create a

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.080 
after that I'm I'm hoping to create a
whole<00:05:15.310> bunch<00:05:15.550> of<00:05:15.820> episodes<00:05:16.740> that<00:05:17.970> that<00:05:18.970> are

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
whole bunch of episodes that that are

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.159 
whole bunch of episodes that that are
for<00:05:19.240> like<00:05:19.600> Garmin's

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
for like Garmin's

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.370 
for like Garmin's
things<00:05:20.440> that<00:05:20.590> you<00:05:20.680> can<00:05:20.800> wear<00:05:21.039> and<00:05:22.380> so

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
things that you can wear and so

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.440 
things that you can wear and so
hopefully<00:05:23.530> this<00:05:23.830> will<00:05:23.979> get<00:05:24.729> you<00:05:24.850> inspired<00:05:25.030> to

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
hopefully this will get you inspired to
