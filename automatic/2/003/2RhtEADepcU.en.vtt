00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.319
 Andrei and you are watching the designer review 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.150
 and today in our review will be here 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.030
 not known constructor called 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.220
 division this series is done it seems to me 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.279
 based on the game world of tanks is a tank 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.310
 t49 now on the tanks I do not really rummage but 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.410
 nevertheless this constructor to me was 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.269
 very interesting like this when I saw 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.130
 on the shelves and my own I bought it 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.650
 to show you to my dear viewers 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.480
 well let's take a closer look 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.399
 Well, let's now consider the box 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 there is nothing closer in principle 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.420
 such a remarkable number here 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.440
 details age name that is all in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.270
 principle usually 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.850
 the only thing I really like is 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.829
 This picture is such a diorama 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.110
 as if the tanks are driving on a snowy such 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.170
 terrain in the mountains well here is the city 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.449
 gita it looks very cool and perhaps 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.620
 i really like it and so in 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.140
 basically everything is usually 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.870
 let's consider now from the reverse 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.120
 parties here as you can notice 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 we already have a slightly different tank 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.310
 view rather than on the front of the box 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.520
 eat on the face was beautifully show 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.880
 how could I see here I repeat the video 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.020
 in such a cool design and here we have 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.150
 shown correctly 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.610
 such as we’ll actually have 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.100
 assembled and before your eyes I want 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.240
 the first time to open the designer or 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.310
 I never bought one like this 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.299
 just so we can see what 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.939
 manufacturers want to give us 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.759
 This designer is such a very 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.829
 good upakovochka ie this box 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.350
 maybe you have to choose 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.430
 here everything is packaged in bags 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.439
 such instruction 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 she reminds me of something you know how 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:51.810
 keenly watch it really like 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.479
 pastor about what's here lego here 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.509
 all tanks of this series two are depicted 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.219
 constructor sense 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.229
 cool cool it really 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.950
 cool looks like this 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.900
 cry and we have instructions 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.090
 honestly it's not very good like that 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.400
 move because well where will you be her 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.990
 put such a big instruction for now 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.470
 you will collect it on my floor 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.890
 has become 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.750
 it's not very cool but okay so no 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.160
 less 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.610
 let's collect this tank let's see what it is from 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.030
 present yourself and already show you it in 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.220
 assembled and here it is a light tank t49 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.880
 assembled know guys i 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.310
 expected something worse and it turned out more 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.870
 than normal he is very cool made 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.690
 very strong construction 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.240
 Well, of course it was not without Kosyachkov 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.670
 pigtails here as always there is the same 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.940
 China and perhaps even Russia 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.650
 the designer however is not lego and 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.990
 there is always a constructor 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.230
 Some such cons this here 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.480
 Circuits they periodically unhook well 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.100
 You see, they even hang out but very 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.650
 easy movement can be unhooked 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.670
 and even periodically they unhook themselves 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:10.250
 Well, something like this Well, well, so in my opinion 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.350
 I have no such minuses and not knowing what 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.380
 the caterpillar moves hard that is 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.040
 need to make any effort so she 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.090
 was moving 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.580
 and so, in principle, there is very 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.459
 cool done but should n't land here 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.660
 minifigure nothing he just sort of 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.940
 such a collection and that is not 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.739
 I know he is not even playable 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.440
 how many just really put it on 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.380
 shelf or use some of your 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.930
 there are cartoons like strait someone 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.400
 such a functionality she has of course 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.880
 very small 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.360
 this will fix your own turns the tower 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.049
 tank you see it spinning also 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.120
 the abalone moves up and down also in the set 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.340
 there was such a box with ammunition 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.140
 here we have 4 rackets he is not really 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.959
 noteworthy simple drawer such as 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.430
 any constructor 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.750
 besides the oval box here is the same 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.490
 construction I do not know why they are from 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.010
 or new instructions told us directly 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.440
 that it needs to be collected just like that 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.359
 a little different it is me from myself 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.030
 here all the remaining parts attached 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.330
 I do not know why she is well, just like that for 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.980
 the scenery probably I don’t know and 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.950
 last thing i want to show you from 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:34.300
 This set is a minifigure 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.060
 minifigurki in my opinion this is something 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.670
 incomprehensible say so well that is here 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.820
 such here is absolutely not for printed 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.120
 minifigures which are here on the face 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.000
 written type kill me something in 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.950
 Generally I did not even open I do not know 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.690
 where will i go 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.490
 but nonetheless just like that 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.580
 the figurines have penetrated nothing to do with 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.340
 It proved there was no but they told me not to eat here 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.110
 is it worth buying this set then i think 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.290
 if you are a military series fan 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.169
 you like brick for example military lego 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.760
 brick arm well or whatever it is called 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.190
 or do you just love some 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.460
 tanks in your collection or play 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.430
 world of tanks it is required to model 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.350
 should you have well I think so well or 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.690
 what others but precisely from this 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.740
 designer you will love 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.410
 but 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.600
 and if you are just a fan of games like me 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.690
 that is, you don't like the military series well 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.870
 how I don't like it 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.710
 then I think you should not buy this tank 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.740
 since it's just useless to me 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.270
 that's all but today it's all me 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.729
 I hope you enjoyed this review. 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.530
 an unfamiliar series for me and I hope 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.210
 you somehow also dedicated this 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.430
 designer get to know this 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.710
 Designer and I would appreciate it 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.120
 your likes of course and what you 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.729
 subscribe to the channel if you haven't 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.960
 signed well come to me on your 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.540
 channel and group 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.660
 all can credit in the description of everything there 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.010
 guys, go to the description 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.430
 but my name is andrew you watched the review 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:12.070
 designer yet and see you soon 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.350
 Hello dear friends and finally 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:18.370
 then as I promised the military series 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:21.010
 and part-time tank active 823 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.040
 number of parts 466 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:26.530
 and bought this tank about within 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.110
 500 600 rubles like this because 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.110
 varies on brick here 5 minifigures 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.890
 on the back of the box 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.550
 Well, here are the modifications that 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.550
 can collect
