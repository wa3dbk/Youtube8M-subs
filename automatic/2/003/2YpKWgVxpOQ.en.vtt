00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello little readers I am I read in 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.000
 the blog reading in 1994 and today I bring you 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.160
 the review of after 4a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.160
 Anato's infinite love 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.540
 good little readers this has been my 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.489
 first reading of the month of April and the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.820
 truth is that I read the three 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.579
 first books and there has been a slight 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.160
 decline for my taste in the book the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.909
 book has 512 pages like all 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.739
 other books of after and for my taste has 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.239
 lost a bit in the function just like 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.890
 third the first the second me 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.769
 they enchanted, they made me super fast 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.510
 from reading them I read in a day but the third 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.820
 and the fourth have cost me more about 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.610
 the whole room I have read it in 34 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.890
 days this holy week and the truth is 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 I do not know why he has lost all 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.240
 function as we already know we start from 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.540
 the third book that you size garden is 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.870
 they have learned who is the real 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.760
 garden father the garden life has 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.820
 been a lie during this 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.910
 time and this affects him or it is already if he 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.810
 is already a little bit accelerated by everything 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.210
 this we already imagine good the thing is that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.310
 he is going away from tessa and he is going to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.010
 do in a way that for me is 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.080
 too strong for my taste either 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.300
 strong for him or so to say that I do not 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.340
 I expected him to do that if 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.509
 enamored is of tessa because he sends 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.270
 back to the usa if you think you're dumb 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.700
 besides, you have to have very 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.440
 tells the characters of love and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.810
 father of texas when you go to read the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.619
 you will remember from me that I told you the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.240
 father of that you remember him 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.009
 good the payroll surprised a lot because 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.780
 towards the middle of the book does one thing 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.710
 that I did not think it was to do 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.200
 he will also go out there 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.820
 or how are you going to also get out there and 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.350
 you will discover the first one that all 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:25.300
 we already knew that he painted badly 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:28.210
 good garden is going to have a breakthrough one 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.770
 change in your character and think 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.440
 it's also not going to change us 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.990
 well the novelty of this book is that 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.890
 towards the end there are temporary breaks in 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.760
 plan of months spend 5 months spend 10 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.560
 years 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.730
 did not exaggerate spend 10 years 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.060
 as in the four books as they can 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.459
 have jumps follow is that I do not understand or 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.950
 either the author has picked up this book and in 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.420
 this book has gotten everything that could 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.880
 have got into the first three books 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.110
 and make it more spaced because it has 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.599
 got everything and suddenly stuffed no longer 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.510
 It makes sense to do what you have done with 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.430
 the story in just 512 pages 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.380
 because in truth with what he has done 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.150
 I should have written two or three 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.450
 more books 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.459
 well in the end this book has been 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.200
 the one that I liked the least of the four 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.689
 and the truth is that I do not know the saga as 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.019
 that learns a little bit of importance in 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:34.079
 in my books so if you liked it 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.540
 the handyman designed above and remember 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.310

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.670

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.099
 explained and much rises much earlier 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.670
 that the rest so we'll see each other in the 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.670
