00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.500
 small small company I have 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.010
 certainly made in this period 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.650
 you have already seen them around for facebook 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.320
 or in my previous videos on 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.690
 youtube but I wanted to show them to you in 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.530
 detail and explain a little how 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:46.110
 they are made from this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.710
 here is the last pendant he has 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.510
 made in collaboration with beads 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.280
 jewels find the tutorial is on mine 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.829
 channel which is the previous video a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.899
 this one or I'll put it in the box 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.480
 information 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:07.020
 this is the bronze and turquoise version 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.619
 gold that I made with delle 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:17.039
 super duo a 18 mm swarovski rivoli 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:24.359
 in the color christ at b of the 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:27.630
 local golden and two golden hobbies 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:29.869
 colors of super duo, one that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.319
 it's the turk wise picasso if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:38.099
 bronze is another pasta should 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:42.749
 be roughly yes as a pendant or 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:44.909
 used this cute twist I have to 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:48.630
 say that I really like the effect it gives 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.139
 this sedan with the pendant is in fact 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.539
 this is the sahara sunset I have it 

00:01:52.139 --> 00:02:00.359
 realized also in another color 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:02.520
 which is this here therefore white and bronze 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.020
 here too most of the materials 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.479
 were purchased from beads 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.630
 jewels and the super two are the shimmers 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.990
 the hobbits are not bronze ones 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.400
 now I always remember the super code 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.739
 two bronzes beads 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:27.040
 the bronze is here I finally used 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:30.329
 a daga here it is also in this one 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.709
 coloring I must say that I like it so much 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.930
 and I see it 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.200
 I don't know why it's a very summer pendant 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.170
 according to me playing with the colors of both 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.290
 rivoli that of the super two the hobbits yes 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.640
 manage to get gods 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.640
 very nice combinations 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.829
 these are my only two creations 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.400
 with beads that I made in this 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.970
 period 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.540
 I wanted to show you these too, though 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.620
 which are aluminum plates 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:08.920
 that I made with the big shot or in 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:15.430
 just passed with the big shot then or 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.560
 coated and I have to finish since the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.989
 reason I really like it I like it 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:26.500
 also the double page that I believe yes 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.989
 make the motif stand out much more 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.650
 central 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:36.730
 I was wondering if you think so 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:40.269
 in short I can assemble them simply seen 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.319
 which are already quite large 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:47.829
 or if you would add something 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.780
 to the processing 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:53.440
 I have this doubt here I am 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.530
 practically 5 cm in length therefore a 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.849
 quite a bit and even the width is no joke 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:04.690
 because we are about four centimeters e 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:08.530
 half therefore is almost a square for 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.349
 understand and are quite large 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.090
 but I must say that they are very light 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.419
 because I made them anyway in 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.430
 aluminum is a sheet of 0 3 then 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:22.870
 really very very very light 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.460
 I am waiting for your advice 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.030
 maybe of themes 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:35.970
 if you would add something or if 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.970
 in short, you would leave them as they are 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.569
 maybe with a drop or a sphere 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.940
 I don't know give me some 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.669
 indication I don't really know 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.270
 I had even thought of doing two 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.479
 pendants, however, the idea of ​​creating two 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:00.070
 like pendants, I don't like it then 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:03.729
 so much so waiting for your advice 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.479
 finally I want to show you a creation 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:12.520
 sim sail a little way monster 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:17.889
 particular here we see enough 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.139
 well i believe and this is pretty much a 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.380
 candle holder that I made a nice one 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.169
 some time ago for the pearl contest 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.139
 and cinco if I am not mistaken it was the 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:34.560
 Christmas contest and I'll show it to you 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:38.500
 this cute revolving display stand 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:43.449
 that I bought on ebay 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.789
 a few weeks ago he arrived and I have to 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.580
 to say that I really like it a lot is one 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.940
 fancy thing you can use either 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.070
 when the markets are done 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:58.000
 when they do precisely for exhibitions 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.979
 various or even just to keep at home 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.500
 I don't know with a bracelet in plain sight 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.389
 under a lamp 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.880
 I don't know, I wanted to take it because 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:10.330
 I liked the idea is not that I do many 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.789
 exposures lately so I have it 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.249
 caught at the moment because I liked it 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:21.099
 the idea of 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:23.639
 to be able to put something in short and maybe 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:26.409
 why not make videos and edit them and 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.599
 also upload them to the channel 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:32.019
 actually I had seen the idea long ago 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:35.439
 from a girl if I'm not mistaken Julia 

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:39.339
 and used precisely this type 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:42.429
 of exhibitor I have inquired a 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:44.979
 pole searched for some time and the 

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:48.249
 end I found it and so here it is vi 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:50.909
 I leave the link to buy it in the box 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:54.819
 information below the video is 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:07:01.269
 in short, I think it's an idea 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:07:05.519
 pretty nice then made especially 

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:07.959
 we say that it is useful to present 

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:12.669
 creations that develop in height 

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:19.139
 obviously or maybe you can even put it 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:22.389
 a pendant like this one here 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:26.699
 however the effect is totally different 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:29.529
 in my opinion therefore me and my few 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:33.009
 creations and my revolving display stand 

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:35.559
 we salute you I send you a kiss and we 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:38.379
 as always see you very soon with 

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:41.739
 a new video to the next bye bye 

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:44.559
 then as you know in this period it is me 

00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:49.619
 came to the whim mania and ho 

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:49.619
 made this bracelet here
