depending<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:05.039> service<00:01:05.460> provider

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
depending on your service provider

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.249 
depending on your service provider
settings<00:01:06.950> next<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.249> have<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.429> soft<00:01:08.759> keys<00:01:09.259> they

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
settings next we have the soft keys they

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.080 
settings next we have the soft keys they
perform<00:01:10.950> functions<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.549> appear<00:01:11.850> directly

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
above them on the LCD screen so these

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.609 
above them on the LCD screen so these

functions are content sensitive which

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.809 
functions are content sensitive which
means<00:01:16.859> they're<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.219> change<00:01:17.429> depending
