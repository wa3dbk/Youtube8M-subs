00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
so we were very very careful as we

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.250 
so we were very very careful as we
introduced<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:37.539> world<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:37.870> we<00:04:37.930> introduced

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
introduced the world and we introduced

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.500 
introduced the world and we introduced
the<00:04:38.409> characters<00:04:38.860> we<00:04:39.430> do<00:04:39.610> so<00:04:39.789> in<00:04:39.909> a<00:04:39.970> manner<00:04:40.000> that

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
the characters we do so in a manner that

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.170 
the characters we do so in a manner that
allows<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.409> neophyte<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:42.400> pick<00:04:42.789> up<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.000> book

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
allows the neophyte to pick up the book

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.420 
allows the neophyte to pick up the book
and<00:04:43.210> not<00:04:43.690> be<00:04:44.139> completely<00:04:44.560> lost<00:04:44.830> but<00:04:45.130> have<00:04:45.400> it

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
and not be completely lost but have it

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.419 
and not be completely lost but have it
complete<00:04:45.909> immersion<00:04:46.180> experience
