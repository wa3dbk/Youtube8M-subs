 Explanation mile filled words 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.660

 flexible and easy to prepare 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.440
 so if you want to see how he made 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.780
 Accompanying the ingredients are the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.469
 following one and a half kilograms of flour 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.180
 wheat 675 grams of butter 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.239
 this time using the brand 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.719
 spring 3 tablespoons of rolla let's go to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.870
 need 6 tablespoons of cornstarch 7 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.280
 Eggs would be sugars half cup 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.469
 do not be surprised that he only used 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.390
 half a cup what happens is that this 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.979
 Sugar is truly sweet 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.320
 even though it is a natural sweetener 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.600
 and without calories and that can also be 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.080
 use up people with diabetes 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.030
 let's use two big pineapples very 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.979
 well let's start the films 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.090
 we leave we install perfectly 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.090
 our two pineapples 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.950
 then the pineapple and we are going to nibble on 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.950
 squares to make the sweet 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.670
 very well then here I already have two 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.950
 girls chopped in squares 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.619
 inside this pot and let's put what 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.619
 than a quarter of lukewarm sugar 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.270
 so let's spread around the 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.929
 little squares that we have chopped and we are going to 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.149
 put a liter of water very well 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.609
 to stir all we will solve what 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.390
 are the squares with the sugar and the 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.159
 Water 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.489
 with this we are going to form what is the 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.590
 pineapple jam for our empanada 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:11.739
 while this is sewn we are going to do what 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.200
 what is the mass for our paladin 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.930
 and so we will catch for a few minutes 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:23.739
 while we make our mass of assets 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:29.200
 is what we are going to do here almost everything 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:32.349
 back we have here what is the brand new 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.379

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.090
 sugar is if we have what is a 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:03.140
 quarter cup and we warned the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:12.500
 creamy butter and we return it to 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:15.579
 bhatti we introduce 6 of the 7 eggs and 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.579

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.280
 Jam type consistency to be made 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.560

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.870
 uncovered by all the steam coming out and 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.040

 here we will warn what is the most 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.040
 caramelized to put it in cold and 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.900
 can put it to our bells 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.490
