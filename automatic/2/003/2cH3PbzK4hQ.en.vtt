clean edge that the cream has come all

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.319 
clean edge that the cream has come all
the<00:00:54.190> way<00:00:54.219> out<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:54.609> the<00:00:54.699> edge<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.059> there's<00:00:55.210> no

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
the way out to the edge so there's no

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.170 
the way out to the edge so there's no
gaping<00:00:55.840> holes<00:00:56.079> or<00:00:56.289> anything<00:00:56.440> or<00:00:57.180> aggregates

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
gaping holes or anything or aggregates

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.689 
gaping holes or anything or aggregates
showing<00:00:58.600> through<00:00:58.930> our<00:00:59.590> rebar<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.250> doing<00:01:00.519> very

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
showing through our rebar is doing very

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.920 
showing through our rebar is doing very
very<00:01:00.789> nicely<00:01:01.180> we<00:01:01.780> have<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.230> styrofoam<00:01:03.129> blocks

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
very nicely we have the styrofoam blocks

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.080 
very nicely we have the styrofoam blocks
attached<00:01:04.930> at<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.170> top<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.650> them<00:01:05.830> for<00:01:06.700> safety

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
attached at the top of them for safety

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.380 
attached at the top of them for safety
so<00:01:07.360> nobody<00:01:07.660> impales<00:01:08.110> themselves<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:10.180> at<00:01:10.240> least

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
so nobody impales themselves or at least

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.870 
so nobody impales themselves or at least
reduces<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.870> chance

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
reduces the chance

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.770 
reduces the chance
so<00:01:13.450> yeah<00:01:13.950> hopefully<00:01:14.950> by<00:01:15.400> next<00:01:16.299> season<00:01:16.450> we'll

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
so yeah hopefully by next season we'll

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.690 
so yeah hopefully by next season we'll
have<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:16.990> wall<00:01:17.200> built<00:01:17.439> here<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.250> wall<00:01:18.460> will

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
have a wall built here and the wall will

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.550 
have a wall built here and the wall will
start<00:01:19.180> to<00:01:19.270> protect<00:01:19.659> our<00:01:19.869> equipment<00:01:20.320> from

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
start to protect our equipment from

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.789 
start to protect our equipment from
failure<00:01:20.979> due<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.220> UV<00:01:21.850> exposure<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.380> previous

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799
