00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
otherwise would look a little weird so I

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
otherwise would look a little weird so I
just<00:01:06.390> number<00:01:06.659> them<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> that's

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
just number them like that and that's

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
just number them like that and that's
the<00:01:08.010> way<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> find<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.909> where<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:10.260> if

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the way I find out where they go now if

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.830 
the way I find out where they go now if
you<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:10.979> get<00:01:11.189> from<00:01:11.430> its<00:01:11.610> tub<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.540> always

numbers this is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.770 
numbers this is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 so
go<00:01:34.290> ahead<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> take<00:01:34.799> piece<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.030> two<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
go ahead and take piece one and two and

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
go ahead and take piece one and two and
you're<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> sell<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.310> right

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
there so the best way to do that is just

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.069 
there so the best way to do that is just
flip<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.860> over<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.840> throw<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
flip one over and then just throw it

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.510 
flip one over and then just throw it
right<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.799> then<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.130> should<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.460> able

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
right here and then you should be able

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.370 
right here and then you should be able
to<00:01:47.700> flip<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:48.149> anyways<00:01:48.960> let<00:01:49.140> me<00:01:49.229> show<00:01:49.350> you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to flip it back anyways let me show you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.800 
to flip it back anyways let me show you
I<00:01:49.560> shall<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:50.009> when<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.659> what

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
little designs on the leaf so I'm

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.009 
little designs on the leaf so I'm
probably<00:03:18.819> gonna<00:03:19.030> do<00:03:19.329> that<00:03:19.510> real<00:03:19.660> quick<00:03:19.690> and

how<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:05.830> looks<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.909> this<00:04:07.239> is<00:04:07.269> how<00:04:07.420> mine<00:04:07.720> looks

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
how that looks so this is how mine looks

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.410 
how that looks so this is how mine looks
like<00:04:08.230> once<00:04:08.440> is<00:04:08.620> pinned<00:04:08.890> all<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.159> round<00:04:09.340> now<00:04:10.150> at

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
like once is pinned all the round now at

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.809 
like once is pinned all the round now at
first<00:04:10.660> they<00:04:10.930> may<00:04:11.080> seem<00:04:11.440> like<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:12.340> two<00:04:12.580> pieces

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
first they may seem like the two pieces

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.820 
first they may seem like the two pieces
aren't<00:04:13.269> fitting<00:04:13.599> into<00:04:13.959> each<00:04:14.049> other<00:04:14.319> and<00:04:14.620> that

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
aren't fitting into each other and that

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.099 
aren't fitting into each other and that
they're<00:04:14.980> not<00:04:15.129> lining<00:04:15.489> this<00:04:16.120> only<00:04:16.479> because

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
they're not lining this only because

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.099 
they're not lining this only because
this<00:04:17.680> piece<00:04:17.949> is<00:04:18.220> popping<00:04:19.090> out<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.239> little<00:04:19.479> so<00:04:20.019> as

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
this piece is popping out a little so as

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.200 
this piece is popping out a little so as
you<00:04:20.229> can<00:04:20.320> see<00:04:20.530> right<00:04:20.560> here<00:04:20.979> just<00:04:21.910> string<00:04:22.180> them

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
you can see right here just string them

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.270 
you can see right here just string them
out<00:04:22.510> pin<00:04:22.870> them<00:04:23.080> down<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:23.530> now<00:04:23.650> helped<00:04:23.949> a<00:04:24.070> lot

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
out pin them down and now helped a lot

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.550 
out pin them down and now helped a lot
it<00:04:24.850> does<00:04:25.150> I<00:04:25.449> know<00:04:25.630> at<00:04:25.900> first<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.229> thought<00:04:26.380> it

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
it does I know at first I thought it

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.980 
it does I know at first I thought it
wasn't<00:04:26.710> fitting<00:04:27.100> but<00:04:27.250> reality<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:28.060> does<00:04:28.270> so

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
wasn't fitting but reality it does so

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.320 
wasn't fitting but reality it does so
