 very eager to eat is included 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.559
 us at night as a sweet the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.230
 everyone in turkey knew about it 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:39.280
 New Year's Eve so is a New Year's Eve 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.300

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.120
 dessert 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.460
 that knows what the family needs here 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.429
 We have here I have a kilo first 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.980
 pumpkin that's not a hokkaido 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:55.420
 you in the turkish shop buy that 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:59.399
 is little different from the meat ago 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.489
 a little bit fixed then we need about 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.570
 400 grams of sugar and walnuts for 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.840
 sprinkle 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.180
 so the pumpkin I have sent that 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.340
 inner neatly cleaned the cores 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.120
 taken out and in small pieces 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.430
 sliced 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.360
 so now i will do that in my pot 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:27.950
 rhein give so that the exterior after 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:30.080
 the bottom comes so that's just one 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.990
 layers and then I give hope 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.570
 just that and will all because 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.690
 with closed lid about 15 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.030
 minutes first so I have mine 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.300
 Body about 15 minutes with 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.190
 Cooked lid and cooked now 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.259
 I open the lid and leave that 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.320
 whole then again to buy ignite 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.899
 cook without a lid 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.640
 I have not added any water that is 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:04.039
 the own juice of the pumpkin makes about 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.729
 then half an hour sees it like that 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.460
 out 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.440
 you can touch was trying elton 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.630
 and cake from the pumpkin also soft 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.690
 if I can then you can 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.170
 let another five cook and 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.700
 then simply takes the pumpkin pieces of 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.700
 and served partying 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.200
 and 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.090
 says what you got out of that 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.580
 I would not throw away I 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.290
 give also a tip to that can 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.420
 Let her take a little what 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.290
 a little bit will become liquid then 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.330
 you can just put it in a glass 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.850
 Fill and then when their pies fits 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.630
 just your cake bottom with it 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.630
 spread 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.010
 you 're out of that now you can do that 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.550
 just chill and then I will 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.220
 just roughly ground a bug over it 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.440
 if you do not give walnuts then 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.970
 you can also grate coconut 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.160
 scattering over it makes about one 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.069
 half an hour then I have ground 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.410
 walked over to trembling my 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.500
 body from so much on the subject 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.629
 Body scanner turkish cuisine 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.340

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.260
