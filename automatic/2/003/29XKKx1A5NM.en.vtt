00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 sohail people i wanted to be short today 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.030
 take a stand on the topic of sarah wiener 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.679
 and vegan is not a solution because 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.630
 sarah wiener has indeed noticed 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.700
 that the food industry always 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.529
 put more emphasis on processed products 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.570
 for vegans because it does not matter 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.430
 is currently booming and vegan is too 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.980
 No solution to the federal problem writes 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.080
 you in the report from the enormous magazine so 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.760
 some vegans just build this 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.080
 a parallel world he too does indeed 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.059
 Do not shred any animals 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.860
 slaughter but that waives 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.820
 did not improve on the bad either 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.489
 conditions in the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.920
 food production because vegan too 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.809
 life neither supports demand 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 products from a decent 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.870
 livestock still after natural 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.530
 ecologically produced foods 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.219
 of the own region in the opposite vegan 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.649
 Industrial products cause soil erosion 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.660
 supply the climate and poison that 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.329
 water perfectly right woman dwina 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.850
 I see exactly the same and I am too 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.630
 do not think that this vegan 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.150
 industrial products healthy I mean 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.299
 propagate like not 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.310
 I always say people look here 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.680
 grows in the nature rice grows in the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.250
 Nature potatoes grow in nature 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.390
 is so well equipped with perfect 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.570
 food in their own 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.290
 Packaging also come on additional 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.520
 unbelievable what nature does it can do 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.659
 simply no sense just the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 taste and want to keep 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.399
 to buy a replacement product because you 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.619
 for it only one element turns off and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.560
 Although the livestock woman wiener 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.390
 writes that promotes vegan living here 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.640
 neither the demand for products 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.710
 a decent animal husbandry mina 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.909
 I do not know if 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.390
 not quite understood yet yes 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.720
 But vegans do not want decent food 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.970
 livestock we would like to no 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.670
 livestock vega do not want any 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.619
 decent livestock vegan want 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.440
 no slavery neither 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.540
 decent slavery Wigan would like 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.550
 not that anyone killed properly 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.130
 because he had a good life 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.850
 yes, if you do not want decent 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.580
 Rape with it mothers the milk 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.040
 get ripped off so we drink them 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.540
 wiegand do not want to drink the milk 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.430
 vegans do not want me either 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.310
 Drink when the cow is constantly on 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.900
 has been raped and who has not 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.850
 I know what I mean by who can 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.330
 just do not talk about life 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.450
 people I'm here once their country wirtin 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.830
 I 'll only know, yes, the woman 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.450
 again could achieve so much the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.360
 you can make people fitter and 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.430
 make you happier and healthier 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.350
 but she does not why not because she 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.400
 has sought an excuse and this 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.180
 she found excuse by saying that 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.620
 vegan food industry at the pranger 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.239
 I go just assume that the woman 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.700
 wiener not really informed 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.239
 has vegan wholesome nutrition 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.370
 out of whole plants, otherwise she would 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.170
 know that you are dealing with common diseases 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.720
 Otherwise , they would know 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.430
 that they are watching your audience 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.670
 apparently in mass because she is yes 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.280
 star cook that you one 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.030
 could enable a healthier life if 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.980
 they are only full-fledged herbal 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.500
 Recipes represents vegan 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:40.280
 Industrial products should be an option 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.140
 its not for people who are not 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.480
 are quite sure or just on the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.820
 But there is nothing permanent 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.510
 we do not want to switch to 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.310
 industrial products he still wants 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.040
 not away from the animal to indus 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.380
 to change the products that makes it 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.730
 no sense sour wiener inform you 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:06.989
 but please about the full-fledged 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.069
 holhut plan based nutrition like me 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.940
 they perform here on my channel 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.870
 I do not think we need that either 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.010
 to discuss more 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.010
 All the best
