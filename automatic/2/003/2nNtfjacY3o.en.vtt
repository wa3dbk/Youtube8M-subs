00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
game for the very first time I didn't

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.080 
game for the very first time I didn't
like<00:01:09.690> it<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.310> my<00:01:11.310> brother<00:01:11.580> bought<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
like it because I my brother bought the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.160 
like it because I my brother bought the
we<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:12.300> here<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.630> zone

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
we do here for zone

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.490 
we do here for zone
I<00:01:13.200> bet<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.160> do<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.490> attitude<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
I bet the we do we have attitude and

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
I bet the we do we have attitude and
then<00:01:16.500> friend<00:01:17.310> attitude<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.240> dos<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.899> was<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:20.060> big

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
then friend attitude to dos it was a big

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.889 
then friend attitude to dos it was a big
step<00:01:21.360> because<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.259> was<00:01:22.440> more<00:01:22.950> arcadey<00:01:23.899> may

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
step because it was more arcadey may

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.969 
step because it was more arcadey may
beat<00:01:25.680> them<00:01:25.710> off<00:01:26.060> just<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.330> fighting<00:01:28.259> game<00:01:28.470> fast

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
beat them off just a fighting game fast

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.880 
beat them off just a fighting game fast
paced<00:01:29.340> by<00:01:29.580> in<00:01:29.759> game<00:01:29.940> really<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.500> didn't<00:01:31.800> like

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
paced by in game really so I didn't like

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.150 
paced by in game really so I didn't like
it<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.130> first<00:01:32.160> because<00:01:32.550> it<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:32.910> Arcadia<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.720> I

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
it at first because it was Arcadia but I

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.280 
it at first because it was Arcadia but I
eventually<00:01:35.479> grew<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.509> love<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:39.290> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
eventually grew to love it and the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.790 
eventually grew to love it and the
comment<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:40.979> button<00:01:41.250> system<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.530> amazing<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
comment the button system was amazing it

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.630 
comment the button system was amazing it
was<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.979> big<00:01:44.250> step<00:01:44.550> from<00:01:46.039> most<00:01:47.039> wrestling<00:01:47.460> games

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
was a big step from most wrestling games

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.390 
was a big step from most wrestling games
that<00:01:47.820> without<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.180> time<00:01:48.450> together<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:50.250> get

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
that without at the time together to get

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.350 
that without at the time together to get
the<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:51.750> wasn't<00:01:51.930> combos<00:01:52.500> anymore<00:01:53.190> it<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.119> just

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the it wasn't combos anymore it was just

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.620 
the it wasn't combos anymore it was just
that<00:01:54.570> actually<00:01:54.900> none<00:01:55.080> surface<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> move

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
that actually none surface to do a move

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.960 
that actually none surface to do a move
so<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:58.140> I'm<00:01:58.619> getting<00:01:59.340> piece<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.760> hook

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
so that really I'm getting piece in hook

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.550 
so that really I'm getting piece in hook
by<00:02:00.600> triple<00:02:01.049> heat<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.619> am<00:02:02.310> strong<00:02:02.580> closely<00:02:02.880> Buffy
