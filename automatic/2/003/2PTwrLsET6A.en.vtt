00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.170
 land of peace was born from the initiative of 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.360
 five people that we wanted to work 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.760
 for the peace that we wanted to make a 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.710
 consciousness transformation through 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.800
 of art music I think that 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.450
 we the musicians are lucky 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.010
 because in a world full of violence to 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.350

 climb of a stage and give love is the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.730

 so urgent is as important as the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.850
 peace I think that now we have to be 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.550
 also united as we are united 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.229
