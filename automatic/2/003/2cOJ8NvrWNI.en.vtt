00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.610
 no no no you are ready to hear 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.189
 beautiful 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.960
 today we will discover together how simple it is 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:23.400
 make this total cat look 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.110
 after making the base with 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:32.059
 powder foundation and a pink blush 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.829
 I apply the matt eye primer 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.719
 using fourth finger the most finger 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.719
 delicate over the entire eyelid 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.949
 to make agate eyes 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.930
 we should be very specific about this 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.449
 I recommend using an eyeliner 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.030
 first step up we will go to 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.570
 draw a triangle in the corner 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.570
 eye 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.990
 now with a black pencil with the tip not 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.280
 soft we're going to surround everything 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.280
 the eye in the lower part 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.740
 with the same pencil we go to 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.740
 make the codeine upwards 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.070
 with the same pencil the coloring should be colored 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.070
 mobile eyelid 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.960
 now let us look again 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.000
 more intense with a house in black 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.620
 inside the eye and the rhyme 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.620
 upper and lower interior 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.670
 we will not apply mascara in the usual way 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.250
 so we're going to comb our eyelashes 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.980
 from the inside to the outside to give 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.459
 precisely this own elongated shape 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.459
 from cat 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.030
 and now the fun part with the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.190
 same black pencil we're going to draw 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.430
 the cat's nose 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.799
 starting from the nose the bow of cupid the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:55.790
 upper lip and and the nooks 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:59.599
 upwards to be a perfect cat 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.700
 we need a mustache with it 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:05.590
 black pencil 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.590
 we are going to make dots 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.980
 and then the mustache 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.420
 no 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.610
 to finish our makeup with a 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.530
 liquid concealer 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.530
 let's cover the lower lip 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.130
 you have seen how simple to realize the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.160
 makeup is paid for processing 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.120
 complete only the hairstyle is missing and 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.120
 of small ears
