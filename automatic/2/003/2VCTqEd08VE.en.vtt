00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
you've got features like protein glues

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.900 
you've got features like protein glues
that<00:00:38.210> are<00:00:38.360> used<00:00:38.660> in<00:00:38.930> spots<00:00:39.500> that<00:00:39.710> are<00:00:39.910> to

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
enhance the tone of the guitar you've

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.010 
enhance the tone of the guitar you've

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
wood move and breathe you've got shapes

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.820 
wood move and breathe you've got shapes
specific<00:00:49.880> bracing<00:00:50.330> on<00:00:50.570> each<00:00:50.750> guitar<00:00:50.930> as<00:00:51.320> far

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
specific bracing on each guitar as far

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.710 
specific bracing on each guitar as far
as<00:00:52.040> well<00:00:52.460> as<00:00:52.610> different<00:00:52.970> wood<00:00:53.150> thicknesses

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
as well as different wood thicknesses

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.800 
as well as different wood thicknesses
for<00:00:54.380> each<00:00:54.530> shape<00:00:54.830> so<00:00:55.580> for<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.850> first<00:00:56.000> time<00:00:56.270> I

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
for each shape so for the first time I

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.480 
for each shape so for the first time I
think<00:00:57.080> we're<00:00:57.350> treating<00:00:57.710> maple<00:00:58.040> a<00:00:58.100> different

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
think we're treating maple a different

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.810 
think we're treating maple a different
way

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
way

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.870 
way
and<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:59.060> comes<00:00:59.300> alive<00:00:59.570> with<00:00:59.840> these<00:01:00.020> changes

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
and it comes alive with these changes

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.700 
and it comes alive with these changes
and<00:01:01.880> I<00:01:02.120> would<00:01:02.720> suggest<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:03.380> go<00:01:03.470> check

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710
