like the question and the reason I like

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.900 
like the question and the reason I like
the<00:00:31.500> question<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.859> because<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.189> goes<00:00:32.340> towards

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the question is because it goes towards

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.850 
the question is because it goes towards
what<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.930> always<00:00:34.290> has<00:00:34.440> my<00:00:34.649> biggest

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
what I have always has my biggest

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.290

criticism<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.610> Warner<00:00:35.850> Brothers<00:00:35.970> and<00:00:36.270> their

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
criticism for Warner Brothers and their

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
criticism for Warner Brothers and their
DC<00:00:36.630> properties<00:00:37.110> versus<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:37.890> them

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
DC properties versus what I see them

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.830 
DC properties versus what I see them
improving<00:00:38.460> upon<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.000> I've<00:00:39.300> always<00:00:39.570> felt

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
improving upon out but I've always felt

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.120 
improving upon out but I've always felt
that<00:00:39.930> their<00:00:40.140> main<00:00:40.290> problem<00:00:40.500> was<00:00:40.739> they<00:00:40.890> never

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
that their main problem was they never

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.030 
that their main problem was they never
had<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> plan<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.809> let's<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.440> next

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
had a plan it's like let's do this next

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.950 
had a plan it's like let's do this next
and<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:44.550> figure<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.300> where<00:00:45.510> we're<00:00:45.629> gonna<00:00:45.719> go

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
and then figure out where we're gonna go

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.850 
and then figure out where we're gonna go
and<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.170> let's<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.469> this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and then let's do this

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.740 
and then let's do this
and<00:00:47.040> you're<00:00:47.550> right<00:00:47.700> Green<00:00:48.120> Lantern<00:00:48.480> should

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and you're right Green Lantern should

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.869 
and you're right Green Lantern should
have<00:00:48.870> been<00:00:49.050> made<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.530> such<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> way<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.219> opens

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
have been made in such a way that opens

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.389 
have been made in such a way that opens
doors<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> cinematic<00:00:52.710> universe<00:00:53.039> or<00:00:53.280> they

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
doors for a cinematic universe or they

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.700 
doors for a cinematic universe or they
should<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.670> waited<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.170> unlike

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
should have waited and look unlike

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.350 
should have waited and look unlike
everybody<00:00:55.950> else<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.489> fully<00:00:56.789> acknowledge<00:00:56.940> all

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
everybody else I fully acknowledge all

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
everybody else I fully acknowledge all
the<00:00:57.600> problems<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.770> Green<00:00:58.949> Lantern<00:00:59.280> movie

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the problems of the Green Lantern movie

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.029 
the problems of the Green Lantern movie
I<00:00:59.550> still<00:01:00.030> contend<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:01.230> Ryan<00:01:01.559> Reynolds<00:01:01.710> was

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
I still contend that Ryan Reynolds was

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
I still contend that Ryan Reynolds was
not<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.520> those<00:01:02.670> problems<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.360> think<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
not one of those problems I think the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.660 
not one of those problems I think the
problems<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:04.679> start<00:01:04.949> from<00:01:05.039> the<00:01:05.189> script<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
problems all start from the script and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.889 
problems all start from the script and
then<00:01:05.789> it's<00:01:06.029> hard<00:01:06.209> to<00:01:06.299> make<00:01:06.420> anything<00:01:06.749> good

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
then it's hard to make anything good

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.719 
then it's hard to make anything good
once<00:01:07.109> the<00:01:07.229> script<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:07.679> bad<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.579> that

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
once the script is really bad but that

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.069 
once the script is really bad but that
being<00:01:08.880> said<00:01:08.939> no<00:01:09.179> I<00:01:09.209> agree<00:01:09.329> with<00:01:09.509> it<00:01:09.779> I<00:01:09.869> think

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
being said no I agree with it I think

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.769 
being said no I agree with it I think
they<00:01:10.439> moved<00:01:10.679> too<00:01:11.429> fast<00:01:11.639> I<00:01:11.969> believe<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.719> is

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:12.779 
they moved too fast I believe this is

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:15.199 
they moved too fast I believe this is
this<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> symptom<00:01:13.889> of<00:01:14.009> what<00:01:14.549> used<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.029> be<00:01:15.179> a

00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:15.209 
this is a symptom of what used to be a

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.669 
this is a symptom of what used to be a
big<00:01:15.389> problem<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:15.959> Warner<00:01:16.259> Brothers<00:01:16.499> with

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
big problem at Warner Brothers with

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.349 
big problem at Warner Brothers with
their<00:01:16.829> DC<00:01:17.069> properties<00:01:17.459> of<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.729> having<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.149> plan

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
their DC properties of not having a plan

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.139 
their DC properties of not having a plan
just<00:01:18.929> being<00:01:19.200> very<00:01:19.279> reactionary<00:01:20.279> instead<00:01:21.029> of

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
just being very reactionary instead of

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.699 
just being very reactionary instead of
being<00:01:21.329> deliberate<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.929> planning<00:01:22.319> things<00:01:22.529> out

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:22.709 
being deliberate and planning things out

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:25.129 
being deliberate and planning things out
now<00:01:23.429> it<00:01:23.969> looks<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.599> they're<00:01:24.749> trying<00:01:24.959> to

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:25.139 
now it looks like they're trying to

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:26.839 
now it looks like they're trying to
chart<00:01:25.439> things<00:01:25.679> out<00:01:25.859> and<00:01:26.069> plan<00:01:26.369> them<00:01:26.579> before

00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:26.849 
chart things out and plan them before

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:28.249 
chart things out and plan them before
they<00:01:26.999> go<00:01:27.119> step<00:01:27.389> by<00:01:27.420> step<00:01:27.539> which<00:01:27.899> is<00:01:27.929> a<00:01:28.049> big

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
they go step by step which is a big

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.989 
they go step by step which is a big
improvement<00:01:28.560> we'll<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.459> it<00:01:29.609> works<00:01:29.639> or<00:01:29.939> not

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
improvement we'll see if it works or not

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:32.029 
improvement we'll see if it works or not
but<00:01:30.569> yeah<00:01:30.719> I<00:01:30.749> absolutely<00:01:31.109> agree<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.529> it<00:01:31.829> with

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
but yeah I absolutely agree with it with

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.899 
but yeah I absolutely agree with it with
what<00:01:32.189> you're<00:01:32.310> saying<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.609> what<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.819> guys

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
what you're saying so what do you guys

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.849 
what you're saying so what do you guys
think<00:01:33.149> I<00:01:33.359> think<00:01:33.599> this<00:01:33.899> happened<00:01:34.229> before<00:01:34.380> they

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
think I think this happened before they

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.559 
think I think this happened before they
started<00:01:35.219> planning<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:36.240> they<00:01:36.359> were<00:01:36.450> actually

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
started planning what they were actually

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.080 
started planning what they were actually
going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.899> do<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.349> universe<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.069> it<00:01:38.669> did

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
going to do with the universe and it did

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.569 
going to do with the universe and it did
taint<00:01:39.389> the<00:01:39.539> character<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.200> me<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.649> like<00:01:41.310> Ryan

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
taint the character for me I like Ryan

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.969 
taint the character for me I like Ryan
Reynolds<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.329> he's<00:01:42.539> fantastic<00:01:43.079> did<00:01:43.679> as

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
Reynolds I think he's fantastic did as

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.190 
Reynolds I think he's fantastic did as
good<00:01:44.489> a<00:01:44.549> job<00:01:44.609> as<00:01:44.789> he<00:01:45.029> could<00:01:45.270> yeah<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.959> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
good a job as he could yeah with that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.559 
good a job as he could yeah with that
script<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.340> world<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.969> so<00:01:48.149> hard<00:01:48.389> to

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
script but that world is so hard to

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.779 
script but that world is so hard to
explain<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.259> was<00:01:49.380> such<00:01:49.619> an<00:01:49.739> alien<00:01:49.919> world<00:01:50.459> and

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
explain it was such an alien world and

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.159 
explain it was such an alien world and
they<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.090> rushed<00:01:51.359> through<00:01:51.569> it<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:52.049> was

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:52.169 
they just rushed through it it was

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:54.260 
they just rushed through it it was
really<00:01:52.469> mediocre<00:01:52.759> special<00:01:53.759> effects<00:01:54.029> weren't

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
really mediocre special effects weren't

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
really mediocre special effects weren't
that<00:01:54.419> great<00:01:54.569> so<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:55.709> they<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.039> to<00:01:56.159> work

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that great so I think they have to work

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.760 
that great so I think they have to work
hard<00:01:56.579> now<00:01:56.819> to<00:01:57.029> get<00:01:57.569> him<00:01:57.749> to<00:01:58.109> be<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> likable

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
hard now to get him to be a likable

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.039 
hard now to get him to be a likable
character<00:01:59.130> again<00:01:59.399> yeah<00:01:59.789> true<00:02:00.059> heroes<00:02:00.299> yeah<00:02:01.020> I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
character again yeah true heroes yeah I

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.809 
character again yeah true heroes yeah I
feel<00:02:01.499> like<00:02:01.679> it<00:02:01.889> wasn't<00:02:02.249> necessarily<00:02:02.729> a

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
feel like it wasn't necessarily a

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.339 
feel like it wasn't necessarily a
mistake<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.239> release<00:02:03.539> you<00:02:03.719> know<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> standalone

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
mistake to release you know a standalone

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:05.749 
mistake to release you know a standalone
film<00:02:04.709> before<00:02:05.039> but<00:02:05.219> before<00:02:05.489> they<00:02:05.579> had<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
film before but before they had the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.609 
film before but before they had the
plans<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.149> talked<00:02:06.239> of<00:02:06.389> course<00:02:06.599> yes<00:02:06.899> okay<00:02:07.559> as

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
plans and talked of course yes okay as

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.959 
plans and talked of course yes okay as
they<00:02:07.829> did<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.189> an<00:02:08.310> end<00:02:08.429> credits<00:02:08.729> scene<00:02:08.849> that

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:08.969 
they did have an end credits scene that

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.149 
they did have an end credits scene that
teased<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.420> big<00:02:09.659> baddie<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.409> could<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.739> led

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
teased a big baddie that could have led

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.770 
teased a big baddie that could have led
to<00:02:11.219> other<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.030> know<00:02:12.180> film

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
to other you know film

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.449 
to other you know film
within<00:02:12.990> their<00:02:13.110> universe<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:13.590> then<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:14.160> didn't

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
within their universe but then it didn't

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.190 
within their universe but then it didn't
go<00:02:14.520> as<00:02:14.640> planned<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.240> also<00:02:15.450> agree<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> really

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
go as planned and I also agree I really

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.290 
go as planned and I also agree I really
like<00:02:16.350> Ryan<00:02:16.560> Reynolds<00:02:16.620> as<00:02:16.980> an<00:02:17.100> actor<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.640> think

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
like Ryan Reynolds as an actor I think

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.880 
like Ryan Reynolds as an actor I think
he<00:02:18.420> also<00:02:18.600> just<00:02:18.930> keeps<00:02:19.080> improving<00:02:19.319> improving

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
he also just keeps improving improving

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.140 
he also just keeps improving improving
and<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.069> think<00:02:20.310> he<00:02:20.430> could<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:20.640> done<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:21.060> know

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
and I think he could have done you know

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.570 
and I think he could have done you know
how<00:02:21.270> Jordan<00:02:21.569> justice<00:02:21.930> but<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.860> can<00:02:23.069> only<00:02:23.310> be<00:02:23.550> a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
how Jordan justice but you can only be a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.820 
how Jordan justice but you can only be a
good<00:02:23.790> product<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.360> really<00:02:24.690> bad<00:02:24.870> film<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
good product in a really bad film and it

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.170 
good product in a really bad film and it
just<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.130> mean<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.520> not<00:02:26.640> going<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.850> do<00:02:26.970> that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
just I mean it's not going to do that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.390 
just I mean it's not going to do that
much<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.050> end<00:02:28.200> because<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.740> bad<00:02:29.130> movie

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
much for in the end because a bad movie

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.890 
much for in the end because a bad movie
is<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.580> bad<00:02:29.819> movie<00:02:30.120> even<00:02:30.300> if<00:02:30.420> you're<00:02:30.569> fantastic

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
is a bad movie even if you're fantastic

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.350 
is a bad movie even if you're fantastic
in<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.739> am<00:02:32.160> disappointed<00:02:32.730> because<00:02:33.090> he's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
in it so I am disappointed because he's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.580 
in it so I am disappointed because he's
a<00:02:33.450> great<00:02:33.569> character<00:02:33.690> we<00:02:33.959> obviously<00:02:34.110> are<00:02:34.440> gonna

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
a great character we obviously are gonna

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.960 
a great character we obviously are gonna
get<00:02:34.739> him<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.890> Justice<00:02:35.220> League<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:35.580> we've<00:02:35.730> seen

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
get him a Justice League but we've seen

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.300 
get him a Justice League but we've seen
so<00:02:36.360> many<00:02:36.510> standalone<00:02:37.050> films<00:02:37.530> in<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.890> Marvel

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
so many standalone films in the Marvel

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.740 
so many standalone films in the Marvel
you<00:02:38.580> know<00:02:38.700> Cinematic<00:02:39.180> Universe<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.510> have

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
you know Cinematic Universe that have

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.570 
you know Cinematic Universe that have
worked<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.050> well<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.560> lead<00:02:40.770> into<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.250> Avengers

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
worked so well to lead into the Avengers

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.640 
worked so well to lead into the Avengers
so<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.760> would<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.270> preferred<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.660> because

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
so I would have preferred that because

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.259 
so I would have preferred that because
I'd<00:02:43.770> rather<00:02:43.920> see<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.489> origin<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.850> backstory

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
I'd rather see the origin and backstory

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.240 
I'd rather see the origin and backstory
and<00:02:45.450> then<00:02:45.600> all<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.780> them<00:02:46.019> team-up<00:02:46.410> but<00:02:46.920> they

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and then all of them team-up but they

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.650 
and then all of them team-up but they
kind<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.519> blew<00:02:47.610> their<00:02:47.790> chance<00:02:47.820> there<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.480> now

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
kind of blew their chance there so now

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.729 
kind of blew their chance there so now
they<00:02:48.870> have<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.019> do<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.380> other<00:02:49.410> way<00:02:49.620> and

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
they have to do it the other way and

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.290 
they have to do it the other way and
introduce<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.489> characters<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:50.940> way<00:02:51.090> some

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
introduce the characters that way some

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.400 
introduce the characters that way some
I'm<00:02:51.570> okay<00:02:51.870> with<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.050> now<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.200> we<00:02:52.380> actually

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
I'm okay with it now that we actually

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.440 
I'm okay with it now that we actually
have<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.769> plan<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.850> do<00:02:53.970> think<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.330> was<00:02:54.420> a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
have a plan but I do think it was a

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.090 
have a plan but I do think it was a
wasted<00:02:54.720> opportunity<00:02:54.810> see<00:02:55.530> I've<00:02:55.860> always

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
wasted opportunity see I've always

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.680 
wasted opportunity see I've always
thought<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.670> DC<00:02:57.000> should<00:02:57.150> do<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.420> reverse

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
thought the DC should do the reverse

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.050 
thought the DC should do the reverse
well<00:02:58.080> now<00:02:58.230> start<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.280> distinguish<00:02:59.730> themselves

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
well now start to distinguish themselves

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.479 
well now start to distinguish themselves
from<00:03:00.330> even<00:03:01.290> then<00:03:01.440> see<00:03:01.590> I'm<00:03:01.739> like<00:03:01.920> how<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
from even then see I'm like how like the

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.309 
from even then see I'm like how like the
MCU<00:03:02.850> I've<00:03:03.180> always<00:03:03.720> kind<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:03.930> felt<00:03:04.019> like<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
MCU I've always kind of felt like the

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.960 
MCU I've always kind of felt like the
MCU

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
MCU

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.640 
MCU
the<00:03:05.970> DC<00:03:06.360> Universe<00:03:06.750> has<00:03:06.989> characters<00:03:07.530> that

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
the DC Universe has characters that

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.890 
the DC Universe has characters that
really<00:03:07.830> nobody<00:03:08.160> knows<00:03:08.489> or<00:03:08.670> cares<00:03:08.790> about<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.630> I

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
really nobody knows or cares about and I

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.509 
really nobody knows or cares about and I
think<00:03:09.959> what<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.470> do<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:10.890> need<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.100> launch

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
think what you do is you need to launch

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.490 
think what you do is you need to launch
them<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.209> movie<00:03:12.360> with<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.840> big<00:03:13.050> characters

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
them in a movie with the big characters

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500 
them in a movie with the big characters
that<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.769> do<00:03:13.950> know<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.280> care<00:03:14.489> about<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:15.300> get

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
that we do know and care about to get

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.330 
that we do know and care about to get
them<00:03:15.660> some<00:03:15.840> popularity<00:03:16.200> notoriety<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.130> then

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
them some popularity notoriety and then

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.979 
them some popularity notoriety and then
you<00:03:17.459> launch<00:03:17.640> them<00:03:17.790> out<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.180> different<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
you launch them out on different it

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.330 
you launch them out on different it
could<00:03:19.170> have<00:03:19.260> worked<00:03:19.410> your<00:03:19.500> way<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.829> mean<00:03:20.040> who

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.560 
could have worked your way to I mean who
knows<00:03:20.519> we're<00:03:20.760> never<00:03:20.850> going<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.060> find<00:03:21.180> out<00:03:21.360> now

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
Ryan Reynolds was miscast as Green

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.850 
Ryan Reynolds was miscast as Green
Lantern<00:03:27.239> after<00:03:27.840> especially<00:03:27.989> after<00:03:28.320> seeing<00:03:28.650> it
