00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.840

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.120

 Butter 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 true and normally this would have to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.760
 make with an onion dressing 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.399

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.440
 pasta like the one that just saw that pasta 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.810

 we are mixing all the flavors and this 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.230

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.520
 reality is the bold shellfish of the house 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.190

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.320

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.600
 valentine long ago then let's go 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.510
 doing something like a little 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.910
 or pita and where will the 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.250
 flavors in this tree we add the 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.580
 swimming pool 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.580
 we added the paprika 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.090
 to taste what you like sir for 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.250
 our white tool and so on here 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.440
 we will make it are the years we are going to make a 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.480
 small boil now at this moment you 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.340
 we make the income to the seafood 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.840
 that seafood we have a garden now 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.830
 we create green demos blamed octopus to the sea 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.510
 prawns and shrimp 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:40.220
 at the exact same time only the squid 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:42.020
 paul octopus work more than chicano 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.350
 and now we are going to increase a little bit the 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.350
 fire 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.450
 and here you can add pisco or wine 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.440
 White 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.200
 good gives a unique flavor 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.920
 now we are adding your little piquito the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.920
 pisco came white and there we move 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.140
 there we want all seafood 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.540
 come together that throw their flavors the 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.670
 same shrimp the same point the squid 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.889
 works and one needs to feel for the smell 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.500
 that after that we're going to have to 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.630
 mix it with the same rice we are already 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.910
 here as you will see I did not delay 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.430
 a lot and the seafood is that it is a 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.260
 minute is not beyond we were going 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.440
 retiring it so that by the time of 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:41.960
 to put on what you're going to get all clear 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:41.960
 for yesterday's rice so is the idea 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.550
 i 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.360
 in the little game there is a good way 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.090
 but we recommend the nicolás sota ya 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.190

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.310
 the video 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:36.700
 if there is no love, it's no longer worth it 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.700
 insist 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.120
 not worth
