you this here and this may reflect the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.289 
you this here and this may reflect the
handmade<00:01:55.950> nature<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.399> knife<00:01:56.549> there<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
handmade nature of the knife there the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.149 
handmade nature of the knife there the
toil<00:01:57.570> he<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.840> straight<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.619> custom<00:01:59.009> one

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159

toil he is straight on the custom one
it's<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.460> little<00:01:59.939> bit<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.180> swept<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.659> the
