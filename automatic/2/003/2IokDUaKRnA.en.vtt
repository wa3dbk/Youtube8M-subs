00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.610
 Talk to me, I'm Pedro. 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.179
 first tutorial bug I'm going to 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.580
 pass a command that helped me 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.250
 solve two problems with me 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.070
 first what i was 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.060
 breaking the head was to solve a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.869
 problem with 1gb puc republic in whom 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.050
 do not know that the gm plugin is one in a 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.450
 it is her responsibility to at least 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.870
 this is what they say is responsible for 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.920
 their defenders of the obligation of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.309
 internet banking 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.010
 what it means is they protect the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.980
 time users to navigate on a bench 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.550
 and no bank site, and it's just that this 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.520
 his promise is this plugin he went wrong 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.210
 done or done poorly on purpose 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.640
 because many all users who have 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.420
 this plugin are suffering several 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.489
 problems 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.680
 My problem was that he was 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.080
 eating my my cpu 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.170
 I was always using 100% cpu 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.930
 even when the browser is open 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.680
 and with the open bank site 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.140
 so this worked for me a lot and this one 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.700
 problem are also affecting another 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.470
 The hours I ended up reading. 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.259
 it was taking a while to start 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.549
 computer was locked up in the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.170
 time to call 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.619
 many people were suffering from 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.710
 problem I was looking for the solution 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.810
 deleting this plugin that I never 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.360
 I had actually I do not remember having 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.590
 This club already had I think before 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.220
 I already had three 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.579
 computers I've always browsed in 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.860
 bank and have never seen this first plugin 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:56.729
 But finally, I can solve it. 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.340
 this problem by chance and it's me 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.890
 get a command here and that the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.030
 business is to take a command here 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.310
 this command here that I will leave in the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.860
 for another reason was with a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.330
 bug in the chrome he was initiating 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.340
 just 30 minutes 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.830
 thirty minutes after I was bouncing 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.370
 to start 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.720
 slow for 30 minutes after this there 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.390
 command that solves both problems 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.360
 by chance I do not know what the connection is 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.930
 that they have and such but prayed to 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.830
 I did not delete it for two reasons 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.930
 also because I do not know how to delete and 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.320
 I how to solve this problem that my 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.650
 I do not issue a delete exitem 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.320
 because I do not know if it even solves 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.350
 He protects me so I'm never making myself 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.530
 but very bad is this plugin so I go 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.660
 leave him there I do not know if he really 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.880
 protects mining when in banks 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.770
 but I'll leave it no longer and never 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:03.060
 but it affected me in nothing and you can see here 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:08.520
 I'm open to him 0% cpu where 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.530
 I was 94 and this generates yes percent 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.720
 here in my cpu all then I will leave 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.720
 this command here at the institution 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.670
 remembering that when you show that 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.590
 here he reserves all the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.610
 denial of service settings of the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.670
 your browsers is then going to take over 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:36.330
 salted sauer net bills saved 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:39.480
 take all history is so do 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.100
 knowing that this result here not 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.769
 is a serious consequence so only if 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.480
 You do not know everything you saved. 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.820
 our browsers 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.620
 So that's it , I want to help my 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:55.370
 family my first tutorial was worth it 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.370
 until the next video
