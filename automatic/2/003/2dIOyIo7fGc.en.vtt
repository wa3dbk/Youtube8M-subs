welcome back to my videostudio pro x6
tutorials<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:15.990> tutorial<00:00:16.049> I'm<00:00:16.770> going

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
tutorials so in this tutorial I'm going

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.790 
tutorials so in this tutorial I'm going
to<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.220> showing<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.670> ripple<00:00:18.180> editing

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
to be showing you ripple editing

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.679 
to be showing you ripple editing
basically<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:19.949> Rep<00:00:20.160> redditing<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
basically what Rep redditing is is the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.720 
basically what Rep redditing is is the
function<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.500> allow<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.039> synchronize<00:00:23.699> all

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
function to allow you to synchronize all

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.450 
function to allow you to synchronize all
of<00:00:24.210> your<00:00:24.330> tracks<00:00:24.630> together<00:00:25.189> so<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.369> example

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
of your tracks together so for example

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.779 
of your tracks together so for example
if<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.900> put<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> piece<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.590> text<00:00:29.220> I'll<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.580> drag

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
if we put a piece of text I'll just drag

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.229 
if we put a piece of text I'll just drag
in<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.470> line<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.219> piece<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.880> video

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
in here in line with this piece of video

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.910 
in here in line with this piece of video
there<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.110> self<00:00:34.380> split<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
there you can self split it in the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.280 
there you can self split it in the
middle<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.969> we've<00:00:36.360> inserted<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.050> piece<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
middle so we've inserted that piece of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.889 
middle so we've inserted that piece of
text<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.920> line<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.460> if<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:39.600> were<00:00:39.719> then

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
text in line with that if we were then

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.380 
text in line with that if we were then
to<00:00:40.110> remove<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> piece<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.309> video<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.790> front

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
to remove a piece of the video in front

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.170 
to remove a piece of the video in front
of<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.780> video<00:00:43.250> normally<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.730> text<00:00:45.090> would

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
of this video normally the text would

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.630 
of this video normally the text would
stay<00:00:45.480> where<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:47.070> video<00:00:47.370> would

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
stay where it is and the video would

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.279 
stay where it is and the video would
move<00:00:47.879> away<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.690> would<00:00:48.870> come<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
move away so it would come out of

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.010 
move away so it would come out of
synchronization<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.660> need<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> do

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
synchronization so what you need to do

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
synchronization so what you need to do
to<00:00:52.050> enable<00:00:52.379> ripple<00:00:52.860> editing<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.399> click<00:00:53.969> on

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
to enable ripple editing is click on

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.420 
to enable ripple editing is click on
this<00:00:54.270> drop-down<00:00:54.539> menu<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.199> tick<00:00:55.680> enable

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
this drop-down menu and tick enable

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.549 
this drop-down menu and tick enable
ripple<00:00:56.730> editing<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.690> then<00:00:57.899> need<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> lock<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
ripple editing you then need to lock the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.770 
ripple editing you then need to lock the
tracks<00:00:58.859> together<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> need<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> lock<00:01:00.359> that

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
tracks together so you need to lock that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.770 
tracks together so you need to lock that
one<00:01:01.020> which<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> texting<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.539> now

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
one which is one of the texting so now

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.380 
one which is one of the texting so now
when<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.170> remove<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.010> piece<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.580> video<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.330> I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
when we remove this piece of video and I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660 
when we remove this piece of video and I
press<00:01:06.630> delete<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.080> keyboard<00:01:07.430> you'll<00:01:08.430> see

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
press delete on the keyboard you'll see

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.880 
press delete on the keyboard you'll see
that<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> text<00:01:09.150> has<00:01:09.630> moved<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.530> video

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that the text has moved with the video

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.580 
that the text has moved with the video
so<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.610> stayed<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.060> synchronization<00:01:12.590> so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
so it's stayed in synchronization so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.649 
so it's stayed in synchronization so
this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.979> very<00:01:14.189> useful<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:15.000> when<00:01:15.509> you're

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
this is very useful for when you're

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.960 
this is very useful for when you're
doing<00:01:15.869> big<00:01:16.110> projects<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.580> come

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
doing big projects and then you come

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.130 
doing big projects and then you come
back<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.360> part<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> when<00:01:18.990> you're

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
back to part of it when you're

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.350 
back to part of it when you're
rewatching<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.640> think<00:01:20.820> I'll<00:01:21.030> no<00:01:21.330> I

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
rewatching it and you think I'll no I

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.060 
rewatching it and you think I'll no I
don't<00:01:21.600> want<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.840> anymore<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
don't want that anymore and then you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.969 
don't want that anymore and then you
just<00:01:23.490> remove<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> tiny<00:01:24.270> section<00:01:24.600> now<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:25.740> this

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
just remove a tiny section now if this

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.550 
just remove a tiny section now if this
wasn't<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.520> enabled<00:01:27.000> all<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.140> texts

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
wasn't then enabled all of your texts

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
wasn't then enabled all of your texts
from<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.920> point<00:01:29.159> onwards<00:01:29.640> would<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.119> out<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
from that point onwards would be out of

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.690 
from that point onwards would be out of
synchronization<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.040> perfect<00:01:32.280> for

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
synchronization so this is perfect for

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.249 
synchronization so this is perfect for
keeping<00:01:32.820> everything<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.750> synchronization

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
keeping everything in synchronization

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.370 
keeping everything in synchronization
