00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
giraffe print on fondant cakes so what

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.950 
giraffe print on fondant cakes so what
I've<00:00:16.189> got<00:00:16.220> here<00:00:16.340> is<00:00:16.520> my<00:00:16.820> home<00:00:17.000> mat<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:17.510> my<00:00:17.779> mini

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
I've got here is my home mat and my mini

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.140 
I've got here is my home mat and my mini
mat<00:00:18.200> and<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:19.310> reason<00:00:19.550> I<00:00:19.610> like<00:00:19.700> to<00:00:19.849> use<00:00:20.029> these

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
mat and the reason I like to use these

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.910 
mat and the reason I like to use these
for<00:00:20.420> animal<00:00:20.750> prints<00:00:21.080> is<00:00:21.200> because<00:00:21.529> there's<00:00:21.740> two

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
for animal prints is because there's two

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.189 
for animal prints is because there's two
pieces<00:00:22.279> involved<00:00:22.580> so<00:00:23.240> I<00:00:23.270> can<00:00:23.660> work<00:00:23.930> with<00:00:24.080> my

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
pieces involved so I can work with my

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.290 
pieces involved so I can work with my
fondant<00:00:24.680> and<00:00:24.890> my<00:00:25.070> cutouts<00:00:25.460> at<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:25.789> same<00:00:26.000> time

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
fondant and my cutouts at the same time

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.570 
fondant and my cutouts at the same time
and<00:00:26.600> keep<00:00:26.779> them<00:00:27.020> kind<00:00:27.260> of<00:00:27.380> enclosed<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.430> that

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
and keep them kind of enclosed so that

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.370 
and keep them kind of enclosed so that
they<00:00:28.670> don't<00:00:28.880> get<00:00:28.970> dried<00:00:29.270> out<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:30.050> let<00:00:30.170> me<00:00:30.260> just

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
they don't get dried out so let me just

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.450 
they don't get dried out so let me just
real<00:00:30.590> quickly<00:00:30.859> show<00:00:31.130> you<00:00:31.160> what<00:00:31.250> I've<00:00:31.430> done

real quickly show you what I've done

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.430 
real quickly show you what I've done
ahead<00:00:31.820> of<00:00:31.939> time<00:00:32.119> this<00:00:32.660> is<00:00:32.720> just<00:00:32.900> kind<00:00:33.230> of<00:00:33.290> an

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
ahead of time this is just kind of an

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.830 
ahead of time this is just kind of an
ivory<00:00:34.129> beige<00:00:34.460> type<00:00:34.940> background<00:00:35.269> if<00:00:35.750> you

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
ivory beige type background if you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.150 
ivory beige type background if you
prefer<00:00:36.199> you<00:00:36.320> could<00:00:36.470> go<00:00:36.620> with<00:00:36.830> something

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
prefer you could go with something

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.100 
prefer you could go with something
that's<00:00:37.190> a<00:00:37.370> little<00:00:37.489> bit<00:00:37.610> more<00:00:37.820> yellow<00:00:38.269> but<00:00:38.900> I'm

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
that's a little bit more yellow but I'm

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.469 
that's a little bit more yellow but I'm
doing<00:00:39.260> like<00:00:39.500> a<00:00:39.559> three<00:00:40.370> layered<00:00:40.610> animal<00:00:41.180> print

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:41.479 
doing like a three layered animal print

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:42.430 
doing like a three layered animal print
and<00:00:41.600> I<00:00:41.629> wanted<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:41.930> give<00:00:42.019> a<00:00:42.050> little<00:00:42.290> variety

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
and I wanted to give a little variety

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.200 
and I wanted to give a little variety
from<00:00:43.010> my<00:00:43.250> cheetah<00:00:43.460> print<00:00:43.610> so<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:43.850> made<00:00:44.030> that's<00:00:44.120> a

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
from my cheetah print so I made that's a

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.180 
from my cheetah print so I made that's a
little<00:00:44.360> bit<00:00:44.510> more<00:00:44.600> ivory<00:00:44.870> than<00:00:45.229> yellow<00:00:45.470> so

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
little bit more ivory than yellow so

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.160 
little bit more ivory than yellow so
over<00:00:46.430> here<00:00:46.610> I've<00:00:46.729> got<00:00:46.760> just<00:00:47.150> some<00:00:47.269> brown<00:00:47.570> and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
over here I've got just some brown and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.210 
over here I've got just some brown and
I'll<00:00:48.260> go<00:00:48.320> ahead<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:48.559> peel<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:48.739> back<00:00:49.040> and

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
I'll go ahead and peel this back and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.670 
I'll go ahead and peel this back and
show<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:49.489> how<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.699> cut<00:00:49.940> these<00:00:50.089> pieces<00:00:50.680> so

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
show you how to cut these pieces so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.229 
show you how to cut these pieces so
basically<00:00:52.250> what<00:00:52.460> I'm<00:00:52.519> doing<00:00:52.580> is<00:00:52.850> I'm<00:00:53.000> cutting

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
basically what I'm doing is I'm cutting

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.899 
basically what I'm doing is I'm cutting
rough<00:00:53.809> squares<00:00:54.229> so<00:00:54.620> what<00:00:55.280> I'm<00:00:55.339> gonna<00:00:55.430> do<00:00:55.610> is<00:00:55.760> go

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
rough squares so what I'm gonna do is go

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.850 
rough squares so what I'm gonna do is go
one<00:00:56.180> direction<00:00:56.330> and<00:00:56.960> I'm<00:00:57.019> kind<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.379> just<00:00:57.559> doing

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
one direction and I'm kind of just doing

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.250 
one direction and I'm kind of just doing
a<00:00:58.040> really<00:00:58.159> random<00:00:58.549> wave<00:00:59.030> type<00:00:59.570> pattern<00:01:00.019> and

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
a really random wave type pattern and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.899 
a really random wave type pattern and
then<00:01:00.890> I'm<00:01:00.949> going<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.129> go<00:01:01.220> back<00:01:01.400> over<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:01.699> again

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
then I'm going to go back over it again

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.229 
then I'm going to go back over it again
and<00:01:02.629> I'm<00:01:03.080> going<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:03.409> on<00:01:03.920> purpose<00:01:04.519> kind<00:01:04.790> of<00:01:05.000> miss

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
and I'm going to on purpose kind of miss

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.780 
and I'm going to on purpose kind of miss
it<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.630> kind<00:01:06.260> of<00:01:06.290> do<00:01:06.470> an<00:01:06.590> extra<00:01:07.010> wave<00:01:07.190> in<00:01:07.549> kind

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
it and kind of do an extra wave in kind

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.550 
it and kind of do an extra wave in kind
of<00:01:07.850> some<00:01:08.000> opposite<00:01:08.510> directions<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.409> what

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
of some opposite directions and what

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.099 
of some opposite directions and what
that<00:01:09.710> does<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:10.310> kind<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.610> curves<00:01:11.600> off<00:01:11.869> the

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:12.109 
that does is it kind of curves off the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:13.599 
that does is it kind of curves off the
square<00:01:12.500> that's<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.219> and<00:01:13.310> gives<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.549> a

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
square that's to it and gives it a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:15.370 
square that's to it and gives it a
little<00:01:13.640> bit<00:01:13.789> more<00:01:13.969> of<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.119> random<00:01:14.479> pattern<00:01:14.659> so

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
little bit more of a random pattern so

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.730 
little bit more of a random pattern so
just<00:01:15.619> making<00:01:16.159> those<00:01:16.369> roughly<00:01:16.969> an<00:01:17.149> inch<00:01:17.240> apart

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
just making those roughly an inch apart

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.529 
just making those roughly an inch apart
whenever<00:01:18.740> I'm<00:01:18.890> doing<00:01:19.189> an<00:01:19.280> animal<00:01:19.640> print<00:01:19.969> or

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
whenever I'm doing an animal print or

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.120 
whenever I'm doing an animal print or
any<00:01:20.750> kind<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.259> print<00:01:21.500> really<00:01:21.710> even<00:01:21.920> if<00:01:22.009> it's

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
any kind of print really even if it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.679 
any kind of print really even if it's
flowers<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.789> kind<00:01:22.939> of<00:01:23.000> want<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.149> keep<00:01:23.270> in<00:01:23.479> mind

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
flowers you kind of want to keep in mind

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.130 
flowers you kind of want to keep in mind
what<00:01:24.350> size<00:01:24.619> your<00:01:24.890> actual<00:01:25.340> cake<00:01:25.579> is<00:01:25.820> so<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:27.020> can

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
what size your actual cake is so you can

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.889 
what size your actual cake is so you can
make<00:01:27.380> your<00:01:27.890> size<00:01:28.399> cuts<00:01:28.909> appropriate<00:01:29.719> that's

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
make your size cuts appropriate that's

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.240 
make your size cuts appropriate that's
so<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.049> smaller<00:01:30.320> cake<00:01:30.590> would<00:01:30.740> have<00:01:30.890> smaller

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
so a smaller cake would have smaller

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.910 
so a smaller cake would have smaller
cuts<00:01:31.579> larger<00:01:32.240> cake<00:01:32.390> larger<00:01:32.780> cuts<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.770> you're

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
cuts larger cake larger cuts so you're

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.130 
cuts larger cake larger cuts so you're
just<00:01:34.039> going<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.189> go<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.460> same<00:01:34.700> thing<00:01:35.479> go<00:01:36.020> in

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
just going to go the same thing go in

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.380 
just going to go the same thing go in
the<00:01:36.200> opposite<00:01:36.530> direction<00:01:37.179> just<00:01:38.179> kind<00:01:38.359> of

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
the opposite direction just kind of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.020 
the opposite direction just kind of
random<00:01:38.780> squares<00:01:39.520> alright<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:40.670> think<00:01:40.759> you've

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
random squares alright so I think you've

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.190 
random squares alright so I think you've
got<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.450> don't<00:01:41.689> worry<00:01:41.810> about<00:01:41.899> these<00:01:42.079> little

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
got that don't worry about these little

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.230 
got that don't worry about these little
pieces<00:01:42.409> coming<00:01:42.710> off<00:01:42.920> those<00:01:43.070> will<00:01:43.249> clean<00:01:43.399> up<00:01:43.429> so

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
pieces coming off those will clean up so

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.219 
pieces coming off those will clean up so
over<00:01:44.420> here<00:01:44.570> I'm<00:01:44.659> just<00:01:44.719> going<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:44.960> peel<00:01:45.200> back

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
over here I'm just going to peel back

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.020 
over here I'm just going to peel back
the<00:01:45.590> section<00:01:45.979> that<00:01:46.100> I'm<00:01:46.280> going<00:01:46.609> to<00:01:46.640> be<00:01:46.820> working

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
the section that I'm going to be working

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.899 
the section that I'm going to be working
on<00:01:47.359> and<00:01:47.659> I'm<00:01:48.560> just<00:01:48.679> going<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:48.950> place<00:01:49.249> this<00:01:49.640> in

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
on and I'm just going to place this in

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.249 
on and I'm just going to place this in
place<00:01:50.270> now<00:01:50.479> one<00:01:50.689> thing<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.899> want<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.109> caution

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
place now one thing I want to caution

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.719 
place now one thing I want to caution
you<00:01:51.499> about<00:01:51.590> with<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:51.829> giraffe<00:01:52.069> print<00:01:52.579> and

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
you about with the giraffe print and

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.399 
you about with the giraffe print and
outside<00:01:53.030> always<00:01:53.179> practice<00:01:53.659> practicing<00:01:54.319> this

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
outside always practice practicing this

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.440 
outside always practice practicing this
you<00:01:54.469> realize<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:55.069> if<00:01:55.429> these<00:01:55.819> pieces<00:01:56.060> are<00:01:56.329> too

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
you realize it if these pieces are too

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.539 
you realize it if these pieces are too
close<00:01:56.749> when<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.170> roll<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.679> out<00:01:57.799> to<00:01:58.039> embed<00:01:58.340> them

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
close when you roll it out to embed them

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.550 
close when you roll it out to embed them
it<00:01:58.789> really<00:01:59.030> makes<00:01:59.359> a<00:01:59.479> mess<00:01:59.689> when<00:01:59.929> they<00:02:00.049> blend

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
it really makes a mess when they blend

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.809 
it really makes a mess when they blend
together<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:01.219> just<00:02:01.429> doesn't<00:02:01.670> have<00:02:01.789> that

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
together it just doesn't have that

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.730 
together it just doesn't have that
distinction<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:02.630> make<00:02:02.780> sure<00:02:02.929> that<00:02:03.079> you<00:02:03.229> place

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
distinction so make sure that you place

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.609 
distinction so make sure that you place
them<00:02:04.009> far<00:02:04.579> enough<00:02:04.700> apart

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
them far enough apart

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.840 
them far enough apart
you're<00:02:06.619> just<00:02:06.710> going<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:06.889> kind<00:02:07.159> of<00:02:07.280> make<00:02:07.819> a

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
you're just going to kind of make a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.100 
you're just going to kind of make a
pattern<00:02:08.210> some<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:08.600> these<00:02:08.690> are<00:02:08.810> going<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.990> be

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
pattern some of these are going to be

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.190 
pattern some of these are going to be
more<00:02:09.229> triangular<00:02:09.800> shaped<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.369> that's<00:02:10.490> fine

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
more triangular shaped and that's fine

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.500 
more triangular shaped and that's fine
you'll<00:02:12.770> notice<00:02:13.010> if<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.060> look<00:02:14.360> at

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
you'll notice if you I like to look at

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.000 
you'll notice if you I like to look at
what<00:02:14.660> I'm<00:02:14.810> trying<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.140> emulate<00:02:15.590> if<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.769> take<00:02:15.980> a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
what I'm trying to emulate if you take a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.589 
what I'm trying to emulate if you take a
picture<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.549> a<00:02:16.640> giraffe<00:02:16.819> you'll<00:02:17.299> notice<00:02:17.569> like

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
picture of a giraffe you'll notice like

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.950 
picture of a giraffe you'll notice like
around<00:02:18.019> there

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
around there

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.350 
around there
arms<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.770> legs<00:02:19.830> are<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.430> their<00:02:20.640> tail<00:02:20.850> section

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
arms and legs are on their tail section

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.510 
arms and legs are on their tail section
they'll<00:02:21.960> have<00:02:22.140> actually<00:02:22.530> smaller<00:02:22.980> squares

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
they'll have actually smaller squares

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.820 
they'll have actually smaller squares
and<00:02:23.940> kind<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.570> different<00:02:25.230> type<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.410> pattern

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
and kind of a different type of pattern

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.560 
and kind of a different type of pattern
so<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.190> take<00:02:26.340> note<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.670> if<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.360> want<00:02:27.510> to

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
so just take note of that if you want to

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.880 
so just take note of that if you want to
make<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.870> look<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.080> little<00:02:28.230> bit<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:28.590> realistic

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
make it look a little bit more realistic

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.650 
make it look a little bit more realistic
so<00:02:29.550> I'm<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.730> going<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.940> keep<00:02:30.030> placing<00:02:30.360> this

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
so I'm just going to keep placing this

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.570 
so I'm just going to keep placing this
into<00:02:30.840> place<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.410> then<00:02:31.890> we'll<00:02:32.100> come<00:02:32.310> up<00:02:32.340> and

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
into place and then we'll come up and

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.800 
into place and then we'll come up and
finish<00:02:32.880> up<00:02:33.030> when<00:02:33.150> we're<00:02:33.300> ready<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.510> roll<00:02:33.690> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
finish up when we're ready to roll it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.020 
finish up when we're ready to roll it
together<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.800> here's<00:02:35.010> my<00:02:35.130> last<00:02:35.400> two<00:02:35.670> pieces

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
together so here's my last two pieces

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.240 
together so here's my last two pieces
going<00:02:36.210> into<00:02:36.480> place<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.320> over<00:02:37.620> here<00:02:37.800> let<00:02:38.220> me

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
going into place and over here let me

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.220 
going into place and over here let me
show<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.460> an<00:02:38.580> example<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:39.210> like<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.050> might

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
show you an example of like this might

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.260 
show you an example of like this might
be<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.380> smaller<00:02:40.770> section<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.730> maybe<00:02:42.000> goes

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
be a smaller section that maybe goes

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.150 
be a smaller section that maybe goes
around<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.720> an<00:02:42.840> arm<00:02:43.050> piece<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.860> giraffe

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
around like an arm piece of the giraffe

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.890 
around like an arm piece of the giraffe
so<00:02:44.460> if<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.850> can<00:02:44.970> throw<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.300> those<00:02:45.450> every<00:02:45.750> now

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
so if you can throw in those every now

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.270 
so if you can throw in those every now
and<00:02:46.110> then<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.260> kind<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.710> adds<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.070> little<00:02:47.160> bit

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
and then that kind of adds a little bit

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.370 
and then that kind of adds a little bit
to<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.520> realism<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:49.110> I'm<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.290> gonna

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
to the realism of it so I'm just gonna

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.460 
to the realism of it so I'm just gonna
fold<00:02:49.800> my<00:02:49.950> top<00:02:50.160> piece<00:02:50.430> down<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.410> then<00:02:52.410> I'm

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
fold my top piece down and then I'm

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.680 
fold my top piece down and then I'm
gonna<00:02:52.590> grab<00:02:52.770> my<00:02:52.800> rolling<00:02:53.220> pin<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.760> I'm<00:02:54.570> always

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
gonna grab my rolling pin and I'm always

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.930 
gonna grab my rolling pin and I'm always
going<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.930> go<00:02:55.050> from<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> center<00:02:55.740> out<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.850> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
going to go from the center out just to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.250 
going to go from the center out just to
kind<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.150> help<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.540> uniformity<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
kind of help the uniformity of the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.310 
kind of help the uniformity of the
pieces<00:02:58.880> just<00:02:59.880> give<00:03:00.090> them<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.300> nice<00:03:00.480> firm<00:03:00.960> roll

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
pieces just give them a nice firm roll

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.880 
pieces just give them a nice firm roll
in<00:03:01.620> there<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:03.390> as<00:03:04.020> you're<00:03:04.320> rolling<00:03:04.590> this

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
in there and as you're rolling this

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.890 
in there and as you're rolling this
