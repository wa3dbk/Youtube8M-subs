I kind of was testing the durability of
it<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.590> hammer<00:00:40.950> thing<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.610> mean<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it and this hammer thing I mean it's a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.060 
it and this hammer thing I mean it's a
little<00:00:42.540> weights<00:00:42.899> under<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:43.710> see<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
little weights under there see that

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.979 
little weights under there see that
metal<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:45.090> hit<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.570> lower<00:00:45.780> propeller<00:00:46.350> like

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
metal it hit the lower propeller like

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
metal it hit the lower propeller like
something<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> then<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.280> snapped

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
something like that and then it snapped

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.090 
something like that and then it snapped
them<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.469> had<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.000> tape<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.329> hot<00:00:55.289> glue<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.860> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
them so I had to tape it hot glue it and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.150 
them so I had to tape it hot glue it and
put<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.760> nail<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.690> hot<00:00:57.870> glue<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
put a nail and hot glue that on so it's

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.700 
put a nail and hot glue that on so it's
stable<00:00:59.730> as<00:00:59.820> heck<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.449> mean<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.170> thing<00:01:01.469> ain't

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
stable as heck I mean this thing ain't

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.579 
stable as heck I mean this thing ain't
breaking<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.120> put<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.899> same<00:01:04.110> way<00:01:04.170> on

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
breaking and I put it up the same way on

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.649 
breaking and I put it up the same way on
the<00:01:04.650> other<00:01:04.949> side<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.549> he'd<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.850> balanced<00:01:06.360> still

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the other side so he'd be balanced still

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.899 
the other side so he'd be balanced still
yeah<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.860> has<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> little<00:01:08.490> vibration

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909
