00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
there's a low density heating element

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.620 
there's a low density heating element
what<00:00:31.830> makes<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.219> low<00:00:32.399> density<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.210> length

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
what makes it low density is the length

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.830 
what makes it low density is the length
okay<00:00:34.610> I'm<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.910> sure<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.600> buy<00:00:36.780> these

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
any case there's a homemade inline

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.499 
any case there's a homemade inline
heater<00:01:13.010> T's<00:01:14.010> couple<00:01:14.549> bucks<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.890> nipple<00:01:17.509> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
heater T's couple bucks the nipple the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.340 
heater T's couple bucks the nipple the
piping<00:01:19.049> alone<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.860> probably<00:01:20.100> 15<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.869> 20

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
piping alone is probably 15 to 20

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
heating element is probably 17 so you

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.030 
heating element is probably 17 so you
probably<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:26.659> under<00:01:27.659> $40<00:01:28.380> into<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> heating
