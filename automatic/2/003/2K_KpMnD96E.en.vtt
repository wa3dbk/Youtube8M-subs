close you can sort of see it right here
and<00:03:56.340> right<00:03:57.019> here<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.390> can<00:04:00.570> see<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.930> pretty

and right here and you can see it pretty

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.370 
and right here and you can see it pretty
good<00:04:01.260> on<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:01.860> side<00:04:02.100> as<00:04:02.310> well<00:04:02.610> but<00:04:03.360> that's<00:04:04.110> the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
good on this side as well but that's the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.210 
good on this side as well but that's the
exact<00:04:04.709> color<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.310> was<00:04:05.519> going<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:07.220> wanted

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
exact color I was going for but I wanted

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.270 
exact color I was going for but I wanted
a<00:04:08.489> whole<00:04:08.880> lot<00:04:09.150> more<00:04:09.390> than<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:11.010> know<00:04:11.130> what

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
a whole lot more than you know what

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.729 
a whole lot more than you know what
actually<00:04:11.459> took<00:04:11.850> onto<00:04:12.209> my<00:04:12.330> hair<00:04:12.600> about<00:04:13.080> a<00:04:13.380> month

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
actually took onto my hair about a month

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.210 
actually took onto my hair about a month
and<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.069> half<00:04:14.150> maybe<00:04:15.150> two<00:04:16.049> months<00:04:16.350> ago<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.769> did<00:04:17.010> do

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
and a half maybe two months ago I did do

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.729 
and a half maybe two months ago I did do
a<00:04:17.250> rinse<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.940> gave<00:04:18.150> myself<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.750> jet-black<00:04:19.049> French

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
a rinse I gave myself a jet-black French

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.940 
a rinse I gave myself a jet-black French
so<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.970> could<00:04:21.329> be<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.540> reason<00:04:21.810> why<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.830> know

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
so that could be the reason why you know

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.400 
so that could be the reason why you know
the<00:04:23.430> color<00:04:23.639> didn't<00:04:23.970> take<00:04:24.210> as<00:04:24.450> well<00:04:25.080> as<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:25.350> would

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
the color didn't take as well as I would

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.230 
the color didn't take as well as I would
like<00:04:25.800> would<00:04:26.310> have<00:04:26.490> liked<00:04:26.760> for<00:04:26.790> it<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.419> but<00:04:28.320> I

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
like would have liked for it to but I

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.010 
like would have liked for it to but I
mean<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:31.650> came<00:04:31.830> out<00:04:32.040> okay<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:33.180> mean<00:04:33.510> it's<00:04:33.780> not

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
mean it came out okay I mean it's not

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.010 
mean it came out okay I mean it's not
what<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.620> wanted<00:04:35.160> like<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.180> said<00:04:36.390> I<00:04:36.419> wanted<00:04:36.810> all

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
couple weeks ago um so yeah this was a

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.140 
couple weeks ago um so yeah this was a
fail<00:05:40.960> and<00:05:41.530> I<00:05:41.740> was<00:05:41.920> excited<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.520> wanted<00:05:42.790> my<00:05:42.910> tips

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
to be brown but whatever I guess it just

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.060 
to be brown but whatever I guess it just
wasn't<00:05:47.830> meant<00:05:48.130> to<00:05:48.250> be<00:05:48.460> now<00:05:48.670> so<00:05:49.890> until<00:05:50.890> my<00:05:50.920> next
