00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that it is also minus 12 and also I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.130 
that it is also minus 12 and also I
think<00:00:41.700> back<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.210> ones<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> movie

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
about the delay us a little earlier than

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.440 
about the delay us a little earlier than
21<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.320> kind<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.649> really<00:00:46.950> doable<00:00:47.340> really<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
21 I'm kind of really doable really the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.080 
21 I'm kind of really doable really the
label<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.440> get<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.770> free<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.640> know<00:00:50.760> down

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
home close to follow up on Connor head

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
home close to follow up on Connor head
and<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.410> believe<00:00:55.770> against<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> wall<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
alright so let's take a look at large as

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.930 
alright so let's take a look at large as
I<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.290> move<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.830> unblockable<00:01:57.190> I<00:01:59.490> am<00:02:00.490> here

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
I to move and is unblockable I am here

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
you have to equip the submachine gun as

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.310 
you have to equip the submachine gun as
you<00:02:03.130> can<00:02:03.280> see<00:02:03.400> that<00:02:03.610> just<00:02:03.910> equipped<00:02:04.240> it's<00:02:05.080> done

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
you can see that just equipped it's done

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.300 
you can see that just equipped it's done
by<00:02:05.500> pressing<00:02:06.100> 2<00:02:06.580> Plus<00:02:07.030> 3<00:02:07.060> plus<00:02:07.390> 4<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:08.160> we'll<00:02:09.160> do

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
by pressing 2 Plus 3 plus 4 and we'll do

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.650 
by pressing 2 Plus 3 plus 4 and we'll do
that<00:02:09.429> cool<00:02:09.700> little<00:02:09.910> animation<00:02:10.030> thing<00:02:10.509> right

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
that cool little animation thing right

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.860 
that cool little animation thing right
there<00:02:14.910> probably<00:02:15.910> really<00:02:16.209> linear<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.660> also

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
there probably really linear and also

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.290 
there probably really linear and also
high<00:02:19.739> because<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:21.070> high<00:02:21.220> let's<00:02:21.850> see<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.090> its

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
high because it is high let's see if its

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.630 
high because it is high let's see if its
linear<00:02:25.350> extremely<00:02:26.350> late<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:27.220> he's<00:02:27.489> only

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
linear extremely late and he's only

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.460 
linear extremely late and he's only
pulling<00:02:28.090> back<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.660> get<00:02:28.810> his<00:02:28.900> gun<00:02:29.080> oh<00:02:29.140> I'm

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
again it's extremely linear you can

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.210 
again it's extremely linear you can
sidestep<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:16.140> right<00:03:16.500> like<00:03:16.770> we've<00:03:17.010> been

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
sidestep it right like we've been

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.180 
sidestep it right like we've been
talking<00:03:17.670> about<00:03:17.790> all<00:03:18.000> night<00:03:18.710> you<00:03:19.710> know<00:03:19.770> just

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
talking about all night you know just

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.280 
talking about all night you know just
walk<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.730> all<00:03:21.030> day<00:03:21.240> I<00:03:21.540> mean<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.840> doesn't<00:03:22.170> only

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
walk it all day I mean it doesn't only

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.820 
walk it all day I mean it doesn't only
have<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.680> most<00:03:22.920> obvious<00:03:23.220> charge<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.850> another

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
have the most obvious charge of another

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.920 
have the most obvious charge of another
I'm<00:03:25.830> gonna<00:03:26.160> do<00:03:26.430> my<00:03:26.640> own<00:03:26.670> block<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.300> all<00:03:27.450> the

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
to cover today we've got elisa code we

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.520 
to cover today we've got elisa code we
got<00:03:38.820> lawrence<00:03:39.090> code<00:03:39.240> we<00:03:39.390> gave<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.960> little

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
got lawrence code we gave you a little

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.320 
got lawrence code we gave you a little
bit<00:03:40.680> more<00:03:40.800> system<00:03:41.130> mechanics<00:03:41.520> that<00:03:41.670> we<00:03:41.880> you

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
bit more system mechanics that we you

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.480 
bit more system mechanics that we you
know<00:03:42.420> didn't<00:03:42.780> cover<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.020> first<00:03:43.170> episode<00:03:43.680> but

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
know didn't cover the first episode but

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.590 
know didn't cover the first episode but
be<00:03:44.760> sure<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.910> check<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.150> one<00:03:45.360> out<00:03:45.420> if<00:03:45.540> you

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
be sure to check that one out if you

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.720 
be sure to check that one out if you
haven't<00:03:45.780> already<00:03:46.040> subscribe<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.190> our<00:03:47.280> channel

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
haven't already subscribe to our channel

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.460 
haven't already subscribe to our channel
and<00:03:47.940> we<00:03:48.690> can<00:03:48.780> get<00:03:48.900> hopefully<00:03:49.140> get<00:03:49.260> rid<00:03:49.350> of<00:03:49.380> this

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
and we can get hopefully get rid of this

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.420 
and we can get hopefully get rid of this
temperature<00:03:49.800> limit<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.100> mean<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.280> don't<00:03:50.310> even

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
temperature limit I mean I don't even
