00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.110
 Now I will show how to remove the door card on 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.340
 car E39 white Pyaterochka means 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.920
 the very first thing to consider is that 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.090
 we have two screws here 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.449
 the first plane where the doorknob and 2 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.410
 the case goes air but in order to 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:28.910
 remove the screw where the doorknob need 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.910
 such a small stub away from here 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.450
 From this you need a thin screwdriver 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:47.360
 either somehow pry like this my not 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:47.360
 plug and you can immediately unscrew 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.920
 any screwdriver that is at hand 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 cruciform 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.900
 there and unscrew here, too, Samara 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:24.780
 now we need 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.770
 preferably with some lining 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.330
 soft or just maybe a piece 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 cloth in any all but need to shoot 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.330
 a quart when you take a card with us 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 here in these places like this around the perimeter 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.860
 It means the grooves are plastic 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.170
 picnic 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.900
 they are considered disposable so if 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.210
 us broke when opening or when 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.770
 Removing or installing will have to 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.420
 either replace the card will not be tight 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.980
 to fit 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.850
 how to pry how to take it neatly 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.850
 Now I will show if you can not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.180
 grasp here is simply necessary 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.130
 a little bit to hook and start here so no 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.010
 neither update let's say electrical tape here 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.100
 In this case, on the contrary , they felt 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:20.430
 here is the plastic to their techno and here 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:25.920
 just go ahead feel what is 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:31.100
 there and like that in the whole door neatly 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.410
 so no no growing would not hurt 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.560
 on that door and because the material of each 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.790
 the doors are quite soft since 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.969
 molded cartoon 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:51.120
 and further it goes already easier then 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:57.750
 neat bitch that is and now movement 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:03.409
 a little bit already 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:07.469
 class this is this pepsico which goes on 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.870
 closing the door from the inside so now we 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.930
 I need this pen which does not give 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.489
 map move push inside 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:20.329
 make it turn to the left and push 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:24.109
 this card remains in our hands now 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:27.419
 far and do not remove means you need to remove 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:33.269
 wires for prevent us from going wire 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:35.909
 on the mean window inside 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.930
 he just pokes his head out 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.359
 on yourself like that such a connector also 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.680
 can you draw it 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.340
 if you need to remove the button 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.579
 too easily removed 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.040
 fingertips 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.669
 the inside of the map here 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.739
 our button means up it 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.909
 it turns out that's a white arrow 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:06.329
 lift these pro lifts it 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:10.510
 lower so fix now we still 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:13.599
 backlight goes to the lamp 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.810
 not for the cards in order to remove need 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:21.220
 just here again from the inside 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:25.770
 here is just a race press down and squeeze 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:29.260
 out she appears now we and 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.949
 pushes the square and here we have it 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:40.710
 remains learning hands now 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:40.710
 door card removed we can postpone it
