always had with iOS 5 is that a lot of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.600 
always had with iOS 5 is that a lot of
android<00:02:25.230> stuffs<00:02:25.500> already<00:02:25.709> done<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.160> before

android stuffs already done this before
it's<00:02:27.180> sort<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.690> catch<00:02:27.900> up<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.650> an

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800

almost<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.090> gimmick<00:04:36.389> in<00:04:36.600> one<00:04:37.259> way<00:04:37.440> but<00:04:37.710> it's

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
almost a gimmick in one way but it's

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.379 
almost a gimmick in one way but it's
also<00:04:38.100> actually<00:04:38.370> fairly<00:04:38.699> useful<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.180> it<00:04:39.240> also

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
also actually fairly useful and it also

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.810 
also actually fairly useful and it also
it<00:04:39.750> mainstream's<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.740> use<00:04:40.889> of<00:04:40.919> voice<00:04:41.460> in

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
it mainstream's the use of voice in

these interfaces voice interfaces have
always<00:04:44.070> been<00:04:44.160> around<00:04:44.400> where's<00:04:44.759> the<00:04:44.910> nearest

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
always been around where's the nearest
