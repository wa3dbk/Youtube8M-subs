00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
lining up correctly to make it turn

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.270 
lining up correctly to make it turn
properly<00:02:00.530> I<00:02:01.030> got<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.300> turn<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:04.150> bit<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:06.280> he's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.210 
properly I got it to turn a bit and he's
turning<00:02:07.550> kind<00:02:08.240> of<00:02:08.360> slow<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.709> was<00:02:09.830> stopping

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
turning kind of slow and it was stopping

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.110 
turning kind of slow and it was stopping
real<00:02:10.399> easy<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.950> screwed<00:02:13.370> up<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.670> got<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> mess

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
real easy so it screwed up I got a mess

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.390 
real easy so it screwed up I got a mess
around<00:02:14.240> with<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:15.530> was<00:02:15.860> out<00:02:18.040> just<00:02:19.040> one

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
around with it so that was out just one

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.560 
around with it so that was out just one
thing<00:02:19.640> after<00:02:19.850> another

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
thing after another

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.680 
thing after another
