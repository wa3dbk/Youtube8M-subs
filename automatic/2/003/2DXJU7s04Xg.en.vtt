00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:11.099
 hum, it is but others the Niger and fall is the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.269
 return of sonic love advent avoca 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.790
 harbor 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.870
 because it's the vector we're not going to talk about 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.590
 favor 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:24.750
 using the generic sonic as it is the same 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.010
 has been an immense disaster in the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.830
 start of the game 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.289
 only I know this guy was terrible 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.899
 so let's see how it is only now that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.790
 this work please run maybe 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.480
 loading loading and now going rate 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.760
 terrible pictures, damn it but it's 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.570
 now we're there you can move on 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:54.180
 front and we have bush 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 This game should not play this game anymore. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.190
 feature seven frames per second has the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.850
 serious pity 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.619
 remembering that this computer here may 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.180
 turn meta hear more in in 60 frames 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.780
 per second and this here is running at 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.070
 74 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.290
 think about it think about it and you 'll see 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.030
 being here is less efficient than 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.030
 that was at the beginning of the game 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:37.079
 look I think Sergio has some 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.310
 Interesting thing you can do 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.240
 on them 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.270
 at the moment because you are here to give 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.170
 forward has a sweet pad or can only 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.200
 to do some things have ample but out 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.170
 This has practically no enemy. 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.619
 Oh my God, an enemy that is not that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.110
 Default enemy what's happening 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.740
 with this world 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.230
 and I know this is only so here is 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.640
 that same confusing part that did not 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.580
 the first time you left me. 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.500
 happy is not possibly probably 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.690
 maybe honestly to speak the truth 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.330
 It may be that the problem I have 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.020
 read has so far with the frame rate 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.470
 It was because my God looked at why 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.510
 Because I called there were five but that's it. 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.959
 which has 1,000 the same problem as 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.740
 that radio 93 sound had 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.820
 regarding why and I do not try to force 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.200
 I have no idea 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.440
 but it is aa problem with the mouse breaks 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.620
 This is terrible. 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.820
 Okay, and here I am, this brings me to good 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.890
 what is absolutely what you look at 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.810
 can someone explain me? 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.680
 Please, I want to know if it's good to have one. 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.140
 ball there 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.140
 This is something I now know as 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.140
 arrive and assaults apparently 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.760
 horror pictures and tie draw olga this 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.190
 here is sink only a ladder i got 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.959
 not seeing thanks to all things 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.870
 terrible if this happens in the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.420
 this is so incredibly more optimized 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.860
 that it gets to be scary and now wants 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.709
 What do I know about my god? 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.489
 happened with one arm only then I 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.120
 I noticed more and this is basically 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.080
 playable again 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.080
 lucky you
