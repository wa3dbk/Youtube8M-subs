i swatched a couple of them on my hand
and<00:00:36.900> those<00:00:37.140> swatches<00:00:37.680> did<00:00:38.610> last<00:00:38.880> almost

and those swatches did last almost

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.590 
and those swatches did last almost
probably<00:00:40.050> 24<00:00:40.680> hours<00:00:41.120> when<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.150> woke<00:00:42.360> up<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
probably 24 hours when I woke up the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.940 
probably 24 hours when I woke up the
next<00:00:42.630> morning<00:00:42.870> they<00:00:43.200> were<00:00:43.260> still<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.530> my<00:00:43.710> hand

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
next morning they were still on my hand

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.370 
next morning they were still on my hand
they<00:00:44.160> lost<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:44.730> throughout<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:46.350> know

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
they lost it like throughout you know

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.800 
they lost it like throughout you know
multiple<00:00:46.890> hand<00:00:47.579> washing<00:00:48.090> throughout<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.630> day

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
multiple hand washing throughout the day

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.800 
multiple hand washing throughout the day
so<00:00:49.190> they<00:00:50.190> definitely<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.970> long<00:00:51.600> lasting

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.300 

since<00:00:57.810> they<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.170> long-lasting<00:00:58.650> they<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.190> be

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
since they are long-lasting they can be

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.940 
since they are long-lasting they can be
a<00:00:59.340> little<00:00:59.520> bit<00:00:59.700> drying<00:01:00.060> but<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.750> do<00:01:00.810> have<00:01:01.200> on

applicator<00:01:15.950> for<00:01:16.549> me<00:01:16.700> I<00:01:16.729> felt<00:01:17.210> like<00:01:17.270> this

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
applicator for me I felt like this

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.929 
applicator for me I felt like this
applicator<00:01:17.929> was<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.200> little<00:01:18.469> bit<00:01:18.590> too<00:01:18.829> long<00:01:19.429> I'm

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
applicator was a little bit too long I'm

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.910 
applicator was a little bit too long I'm
used<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.689> shorter<00:01:21.109> ones<00:01:21.319> that<00:01:21.590> come<00:01:21.799> with

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920

used to the shorter ones that come with
the<00:01:22.069> Nick's<00:01:22.340> glasses<00:01:22.609> or<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.299> matte<00:01:23.750> glosses

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
the Nick's glasses or the matte glosses

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200 
the Nick's glasses or the matte glosses
so<00:01:24.770> with<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.130> one<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:25.399> felt<00:01:25.670> like<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:25.850> kind<00:01:26.149> of

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
to get it right on my lips but it does

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.330 
to get it right on my lips but it does
go<00:01:31.850> on<00:01:31.880> nicely<00:01:32.209> and<00:01:32.659> once<00:01:33.200> if<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.469> do<00:01:33.530> have<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:34.159> to

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
go on nicely and once if I do have is to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.449 
go on nicely and once if I do have is to
make<00:01:34.369> sure<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:34.819> you<00:01:35.000> let<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.959> dry<00:01:36.469> like<00:01:37.069> your

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
make sure that you let it dry like your

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.459 
make sure that you let it dry like your
bottom<00:01:37.909> lip<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.240> your<00:01:38.329> top<00:01:38.600> lip<00:01:38.869> make<00:01:39.319> sure

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
bottom lip and your top lip make sure

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.800 
bottom lip and your top lip make sure

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
you let them dry before you know putting

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.289 
you let them dry before you know putting
your<00:01:41.959> lips<00:01:42.140> together<00:01:42.319> like<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:42.679> I<00:01:42.829> know

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
your lips together like that I know

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.550 
your lips together like that I know
sometimes<00:01:44.299> it's<00:01:44.630> just<00:01:44.750> habit<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.259> you<00:01:45.380> do

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
sometimes it's just habit that you do

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.029 
sometimes it's just habit that you do
that<00:01:45.709> but<00:01:45.950> that<00:01:46.579> will<00:01:47.110> avoid<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.709> getting

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
that but that will avoid you getting

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.490 
that but that will avoid you getting
like<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.189> line<00:01:49.579> right<00:01:50.420> here<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:50.929> having<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.259> dry

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500
