comes with the med kit so that's cool I
guess<00:03:35.070> on<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.670> top<00:03:36.910> there's<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:38.170> moon<00:03:38.860> roof<00:03:39.070> and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
guess on the top there's a moon roof and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.740 
guess on the top there's a moon roof and
the<00:03:40.690> moon<00:03:40.870> roof<00:03:40.989> for<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.230> passenger<00:03:42.600> we'll<00:03:43.600> go

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
the moon roof for the passenger we'll go

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.789 
the moon roof for the passenger we'll go
over<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.019> later<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.680> then<00:03:46.470> has<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.500> little

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
over that later and then has a little

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.640 
over that later and then has a little
coin<00:03:48.070> holder<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:49.690> when<00:03:50.080> if<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.380> get<00:03:50.530> the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
coin holder so when if you get the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.289 
coin holder so when if you get the
default<00:03:50.920> radio<00:03:51.310> all<00:03:51.610> right<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:51.820> think<00:03:52.120> any

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
default radio all right I think any

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.570 
default radio all right I think any
radio<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:52.840> comes<00:03:52.989> with<00:03:53.110> sound<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:54.340> get

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
radio that comes with sound you get

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.490 
radio that comes with sound you get
cables<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.600> I'll<00:03:55.810> show<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.019> guys<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.320> in<00:03:56.440> a

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
it doesn't charge it which is pretty

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.839 
it doesn't charge it which is pretty
annoying<00:04:48.039> to<00:04:48.340> be<00:04:48.430> honest<00:04:49.169> so<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:51.400> is<00:04:51.580> just<00:04:51.669> a

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
annoying to be honest so this is just a

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.249 
annoying to be honest so this is just a
bunch<00:04:52.060> of<00:04:52.210> cables<00:04:52.389> I'll<00:04:52.779> clean<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.020> up<00:04:53.199> later
