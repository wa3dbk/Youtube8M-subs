00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.789
 Interesting cool about the song. 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.309
 right in this episode number 3 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.579
 I want to talk to you about how a 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.809
 dj and should behave in a club 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.090
 there is one thing that seems obvious but they are 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.100
 tips that never hurts us to pass 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.740
 and they are things that we sometimes see 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 even big names that they too 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.729
 big ones 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.330
 err ugly in this respect the first 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.320
 people 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.049
 humility is an indispensable thing 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.630
 It's okay at the same time that you should 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:27.780
 keep the aura that it is is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.640
 and is reference to its size in the scene o 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.590
 your size in the light career you do not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.229
 may possibly be the most 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.500
 humble of the world etc. but humility and to have 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.990
 education is a major and 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.790
 indispensable for all the djs I would say 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.009
 that for everyone else like us 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.500
 is talking about specific jazz 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.030
 specifically is one thing 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.630
 essential or the first of 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.299
 all be grateful cordial and educated 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.369
 with the person who is hiring 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.520
 remember that without the contractor not 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.890
 there is a book there is no dj so yes you 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.220
 must be from the bottom of your 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.959
 Thankful heart for that guy for that. 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.239
 guy who's hiring for that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.470
 The guy you 're bringing to the club is 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.460
 over there 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.860
 an opportunity be there you doing a 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.900
 book for lots of money for little money 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.000
 because whatever is important is that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.400
 from the moment you took on a 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.980
 commitment to play in this club 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.980
 you should do it the best way 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.970
 possible and absolutely 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.490
 sensational 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.890
 come on if you 're playing for free 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.660
 I am against this but eventually to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.940
 choose from each or whether there you 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.610
 is playing for 100 thousand dollars his 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.500
 presentation must absolutely have the 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.200
 same level of excellence so first 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.820
 education and cordiality 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.220
 when I told the owner of the club that 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.110
 should first begin at the entrance of the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.709
 club costs nothing to us 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.730
 greet the club's security guards 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.820
 greet the people in the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.600
 box the club staff the promoters etc 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.730
 etc 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.740
 this generates people a current of good is 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.050
 a good thing that we should 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.690
 obligatorily to do I hit a lot 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.110
 on this key understood the power of a 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.570
 smile of you greet a person 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.000
 breaking the ice brings a whole good thing 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.310
 An important thing that this is going to 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.950
 make the image that the person 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.390
 had or are you going to change 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.930
 immediately to the image of a face 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.850
 cool 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.100
 so a lot of people do exactly the 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.000
 otherwise comes at a sullen club to 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.760
 damn it 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.670
 genet puts the bag I will tie 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.380
 enter is not so the security is there 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.910
 often it may not be the person 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.500
 most cordial in the world but this is the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.350
 first face you have to deal with 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.450
 Well, it 's the first person because it's this. 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.980
 guy that will ease the way was 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.280
 pulp within the club may present 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.970
 It will not make you tired so people in a 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.519
 good 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.760
 put the hard way has nothing to do okay 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.580
 wrong completely wrong be nice 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.560
 cool and friendly with people in the club 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.900
 This is a very important tip. 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.459
