00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
with it but extra virgin is what you're

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.580 
with it but extra virgin is what you're
looking<00:00:35.070> for<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.809> get<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> jam<00:00:37.320> jar

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
looking for what I do is get a jam jar

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.200 
looking for what I do is get a jam jar
or<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.129> could<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> bowl<00:00:38.760> if<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.030> want

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
or you could do it in a bowl if you want

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.030 
or you could do it in a bowl if you want
and<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.140> three<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.649> one

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and I do three to one

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.970 
and I do three to one
three<00:00:41.460> parts<00:00:41.879> olive<00:00:42.390> oil<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.440> part<00:00:43.469> acid

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
three parts olive oil to one part acid

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.160 
three parts olive oil to one part acid
so<00:00:44.789> if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> use<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> jam<00:00:45.510> jar<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> nice<00:00:45.989> thing

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
so if you use a jam jar the nice thing

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.100 
so if you use a jam jar the nice thing
is<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.829> see<00:00:47.100> exactly<00:00:47.850> what's<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.750> on

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
is you can see exactly what's going on

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.639 
is you can see exactly what's going on
so<00:00:49.590> if<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.980> imagine<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.340> being<00:00:50.820> three<00:00:51.180> parts

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
so if you imagine that being three parts

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
so if you imagine that being three parts
then<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.340> put<00:00:53.489> acid<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.180> acid<00:00:54.660> could

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
then we can put acid in now acid could

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.020 
then we can put acid in now acid could
be<00:00:54.930> anything<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.350> acid<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.829> lime<00:00:56.460> lemon

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
be anything that's acid a lime lemon

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.959 
be anything that's acid a lime lemon
grapefruit<00:00:57.890> balsamic<00:00:58.890> vinegar<00:00:59.280> red<00:00:59.760> wine

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
grapefruit balsamic vinegar red wine

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.790 
grapefruit balsamic vinegar red wine
vinegar<00:01:00.359> white<00:01:00.570> wine<00:01:00.600> vinegar<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.320> name<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
vinegar white wine vinegar you name it

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
vinegar white wine vinegar you name it
so<00:01:01.949> let's<00:01:02.730> say<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.120> shoes<00:01:03.300> both<00:01:03.480> summit

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
so let's say this shoes both summit

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.910 
so let's say this shoes both summit
because<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.229> what's<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.739> I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
because you can see what's going on I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.240 
because you can see what's going on I
want<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.790> put<00:01:05.909> enough<00:01:06.180> bowl<00:01:06.420> semuc<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.409> so

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
want to put enough bowl semuc in here so

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
want to put enough bowl semuc in here so
it<00:01:08.369> looks<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:09.090> part<00:01:09.680> that's<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> little

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it looks like one part that's a little

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
it looks like one part that's a little
look<00:01:12.500> there<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.590> go<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.490> basically<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:15.090> part

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
look there you go so basically one part

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.289 
look there you go so basically one part
acid<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:16.619> three<00:01:16.920> parts<00:01:17.250> oil<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
acid to three parts oil that's going to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.210 
acid to three parts oil that's going to
get<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.630> most<00:01:18.869> trouble<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.380> pinch<00:01:20.040> of
