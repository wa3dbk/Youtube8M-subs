00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.680
 fun together with others we play 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.580
 eat in potsdam like a nice city 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.020
 is yes and have a lot of fun 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.410
 The food is very good and the people 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.959
 and potsdam potsdam is very nice 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.390
 is that you live me potsdam 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:48.259
 So I understand better than I 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.289
 but can know I have two years in 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.230
 norway learned in school so i came 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.350
 a little bit 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.510
 in front of me in potsdam com 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.790
 We have a very international team 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.770
 team and we also speak many 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.510
 English collect but all have to 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:15.380
 recognize a little German as well as in am 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.690
 to communicate well in the game and so 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.360
 that's what I think is very important culturally 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.500
 is not that much different but im 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.959
 football, it is standard to large 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.420
 difference between level in 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.270
 football training and so on and it 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.060
 is a very very high level in 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.150
 Germany logically as in Norway the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.780
 tempo is very different 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:48.100
 Bundesliga you do not have that much time 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.140
 Think and you have to get your feet moving fast 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:56.000
 first has to play fast and think 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:00.799
 and we train a lot many hard yes 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.010
 as innovation and so I believe that it 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.480
 is another world in Germany and 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.910
 the german football 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:13.450
 how happy in champions league this 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:17.049
 this order 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.299
 that is a dream for me well in 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:23.720
 Champions League games and Bundesliga 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.870
 I very much hope the next season 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.260
 to the course under the team too 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.970
 so 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.970
 we had to train well
