00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.919 

I've<00:00:01.650> got<00:00:01.800> quite<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.010> bit<00:00:02.129> done<00:00:02.780> with<00:00:03.780> the

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
I've got quite a bit done with the

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.430 
I've got quite a bit done with the
framing<00:00:04.370> well<00:00:05.370> I've<00:00:06.270> done<00:00:06.420> some<00:00:06.480> anyway<00:00:07.200> I

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
framing well I've done some anyway I

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.730 
framing well I've done some anyway I
decided<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.460> go<00:00:08.580> off<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.790> brackets<00:00:09.500> it<00:00:10.500> just

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
decided to go off the brackets it just

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.060 
decided to go off the brackets it just
seemed<00:00:10.920> like<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.400> better<00:00:11.580> idea<00:00:12.830> the<00:00:13.830> pretty

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
seemed like a better idea the pretty

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.470 
seemed like a better idea the pretty
solid<00:00:14.839> this<00:00:15.839> doesn't<00:00:16.199> move<00:00:16.320> oh<00:00:17.330> well<00:00:18.330> this

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
solid this doesn't move oh well this

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.179 
solid this doesn't move oh well this
there's<00:00:19.020> not<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.350> anything<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> touch<00:00:19.949> it

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
there's not really anything to touch it

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.980 
there's not really anything to touch it
top<00:00:20.520> -<00:00:20.699> I've<00:00:20.820> just<00:00:20.970> sort<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.210> wedged<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.750> place

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
top - I've just sort of wedged in place

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.800 
top - I've just sort of wedged in place
for<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.410> extra<00:00:23.160> bit<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.550> here<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:24.240> now<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
for that extra bit just here for now and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.609 
for that extra bit just here for now and
I'm<00:00:25.769> using<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:27.119> by<00:00:27.660> screwing<00:00:28.140> into<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> other

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
I'm using so by screwing into the other

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.189 
I'm using so by screwing into the other
side<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.099> awful<00:00:29.429> -<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.730> position<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:31.080> I've

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
side it's awful - in position so I've

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.500 
side it's awful - in position so I've
got<00:00:31.349> another<00:00:31.410> bracket<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.510> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
got another bracket here the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.970 
got another bracket here the
International<00:00:34.170> planet<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> put<00:00:34.680> up<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:34.920> is

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
International planet to put up here is

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.400 
International planet to put up here is
gonna<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> hundred<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.670> fifty<00:00:36.180> male<00:00:36.410> which

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
gonna be a hundred and fifty male which

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.799 
gonna be a hundred and fifty male which
I've<00:00:37.590> measured<00:00:37.770> from<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.910> indented<00:00:39.600> bit

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
I've measured from here the indented bit

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
I've measured from here the indented bit
because<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.680> need<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.010> make<00:00:41.190> sure<00:00:41.219> I've

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
because it I need to make sure I've

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.860 
because it I need to make sure I've
actually<00:00:41.700> got<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> little<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.329> mole<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.690> that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
actually got a little this mole on that

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.910 
actually got a little this mole on that
as<00:00:42.960> well<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.230> need<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.500> make<00:00:43.649> sure<00:00:43.680> it's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
as well I need to make sure it's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.470 
as well I need to make sure it's
compressed<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.520> against<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> metal<00:00:45.180> because

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
compressed up against the metal because

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.700 
compressed up against the metal because
of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> way<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.750> defined<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.289> an<00:00:46.379> air<00:00:46.530> gap

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
of the way I defined up with an air gap

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.209 
of the way I defined up with an air gap
it's<00:00:47.520> gonna<00:00:48.110> get<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> million<00:00:49.410> condensation<00:00:50.129> in

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
it's gonna get a million condensation in

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.410 
it's gonna get a million condensation in
a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.489> gap<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:50.879> gonna<00:00:51.000> drip<00:00:51.239> down

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
a little gap and it's gonna drip down

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.170 
a little gap and it's gonna drip down
water<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:53.399> yeah<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.550> goes<00:00:53.670> across<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.090> other

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
water so yeah it goes across the other

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.689 
water so yeah it goes across the other
side<00:00:54.270> exactly<00:00:55.050> same<00:00:55.530> thing<00:00:55.739> again<00:00:55.949> same

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
side exactly same thing again same

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
side exactly same thing again same
brackets<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> floor<00:00:57.649> but<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> more<00:00:58.859> I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
brackets on the floor but the more I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.799 
brackets on the floor but the more I
look<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.160> it<00:01:01.100> I'm<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.520> looking<00:01:03.510> down<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
look at it I'm just looking down the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
look at it I'm just looking down the
container<00:01:04.110> comparing<00:01:04.860> I'm<00:01:05.100> thinking<00:01:05.519> about

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
container comparing I'm thinking about

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.130 
container comparing I'm thinking about
where<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.060> put<00:01:06.240> these<00:01:06.390> other<00:01:06.630> spaces<00:01:06.840> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
where I can put these other spaces so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.770 
where I can put these other spaces so
what<00:01:07.290> I've<00:01:07.350> done<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.619> put<00:01:07.799> them<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.040> there<00:01:08.780> go

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
what I've done it's put them in there go

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.399 
what I've done it's put them in there go
inside

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
inside

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.640 
inside
in<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.070> corrugation<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.000> they're<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
in the corrugation so they're in the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.710 
in the corrugation so they're in the
recessed<00:01:13.650> bits<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.360> now<00:01:15.360> I've<00:01:15.450> got<00:01:15.600> one

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
recessed bits like that now I've got one

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.929 
recessed bits like that now I've got one
of<00:01:15.810> these<00:01:15.900> pieces<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.549> little<00:01:17.790> bit

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
of these pieces here it's a little bit

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.920 
of these pieces here it's a little bit
less<00:01:18.810> wide<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.939> goes<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.299> over<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> roof

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
less wide and it goes all over the roof

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.950 
less wide and it goes all over the roof
I<00:01:22.229> don't<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.560> whether<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.270> think<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.659> could<00:01:24.840> be

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
I don't know whether I think it could be

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.140 
I don't know whether I think it could be
a<00:01:24.990> better<00:01:25.170> idea<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.250> put

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
a better idea to do it like this put

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.480 
a better idea to do it like this put
this<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> bits<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.930> are<00:01:28.049> sticking<00:01:28.080> out

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
this on the bits that are sticking out

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.950 
this on the bits that are sticking out
do<00:01:29.490> brackets<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> floor<00:01:30.360> again<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
do brackets on the floor again this is

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.789 
do brackets on the floor again this is
just<00:01:31.170> propped<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.619> helping<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.430> look

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
just propped up for helping a look

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.870 
just propped up for helping a look
because<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:34.950> regardless<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.490> what<00:01:35.640> dent

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
because then regardless of what dent

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
because then regardless of what dent
you've<00:01:36.119> got<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> outside<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
you've got on the on the outside of the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560 
you've got on the on the outside of the
container<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.729> put<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.000> anyway<00:01:39.270> um

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
container you can put there anyway um

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.850 
container you can put there anyway um
but<00:01:39.689> there's<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> pretty<00:01:40.049> big<00:01:40.229> dent<00:01:40.380> somewhere

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
but there's a pretty big dent somewhere

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.370 
but there's a pretty big dent somewhere
there's<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.970> big<00:01:42.180> dent<00:01:42.360> there<00:01:42.600> that's<00:01:42.840> inside

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
there's a big dent there that's inside

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.969 
there's a big dent there that's inside
all<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.700> corrugations<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> sticks<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
all the corrugations so it sticks it

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010 
all the corrugations so it sticks it
sticks<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:48.060> oh<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.360> very<00:01:48.540> hard<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> see

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
sticks it right oh it's very hard to see

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.490 
sticks it right oh it's very hard to see
actually<00:01:50.390> says<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.600> sticking<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.200> bit<00:01:52.380> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
actually says it sticking out a bit that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.020 
actually says it sticking out a bit that
has<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.740> cover<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.759> should<00:01:53.820> be

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
has to cover there this should be

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.179 
has to cover there this should be
recessed<00:01:54.479> well<00:01:54.689> there's<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> big<00:01:55.049> bump<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.860> so

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
recessed well there's a big bump here so

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.170 
recessed well there's a big bump here so
you<00:01:56.280> couldn't<00:01:56.520> fit<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> piece<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.030> wood<00:01:57.119> in

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you couldn't fit a piece of wood in

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.240 
you couldn't fit a piece of wood in
there<00:01:57.450> however<00:01:58.350> regardless<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.950> whatever

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
there however regardless of whatever

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.620 
there however regardless of whatever
dense<00:01:59.579> though<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.060> always<00:02:00.180> fit<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.570> on

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
dense though you can always fit one on

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.300 
dense though you can always fit one on
these<00:02:00.869> top<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:02.159> these<00:02:02.460> targets<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.300 

so<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.790> mean<00:02:07.420> now<00:02:07.540> I<00:02:07.570> would<00:02:08.080> like<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.259> if<00:02:09.099> I<00:02:09.250> do

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
so I mean now I would like to if I do

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.800 
so I mean now I would like to if I do
get<00:02:09.550> another<00:02:09.729> container<00:02:10.090> someday<00:02:10.569> I<00:02:10.599> have

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
get another container someday I have

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.070 
get another container someday I have
sort<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:12.270> blueprint<00:02:13.270> so<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.599> speak<00:02:13.870> for

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
sort of a a blueprint so to speak for

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.479 
sort of a a blueprint so to speak for
all<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.349> them<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.590> do<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.860> exactly<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.280> same

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
all of them to do the exactly the same

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.940 
all of them to do the exactly the same
thing<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:17.349> don't<00:02:17.410> know<00:02:17.590> what<00:02:17.709> kind<00:02:17.920> of

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
thing and I don't know what kind of

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.020 
thing and I don't know what kind of
condition<00:02:18.130> there<00:02:18.489> might<00:02:18.610> be<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.849> way<00:02:19.000> I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
condition there might be in the way I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.820 
condition there might be in the way I
might<00:02:19.239> buy<00:02:19.450> one<00:02:19.480> that's<00:02:19.810> all<00:02:20.020> dented<00:02:20.500> on<00:02:20.620> these

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
might buy one that's all dented on these

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.860 
might buy one that's all dented on these
bits<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.120> not<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.480> know<00:02:22.600> it's<00:02:22.750> not

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
bits so it's not you know it's not

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.360 
bits so it's not you know it's not
unlikely<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:25.410> don't<00:02:26.410> know<00:02:26.470> whether<00:02:26.620> to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
unlikely so I don't know whether to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.509 
unlikely so I don't know whether to
sacrifice<00:02:27.880> what<00:02:28.060> already<00:02:28.239> done<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:29.310> try<00:02:30.310> that

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
sacrifice what already done and try that

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.550 
sacrifice what already done and try that
way<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.940> just<00:02:31.600> needs<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.840> bit<00:02:31.930> more<00:02:32.110> thinking<00:02:32.290> I

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
way I just needs a bit more thinking I

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.210 
way I just needs a bit more thinking I
think<00:02:36.150> okay<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.750> had<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.170> go<00:02:38.350> at<00:02:38.380> doing<00:02:38.560> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
think okay so I had a go at doing the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.600 
think okay so I had a go at doing the
frame<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.489> different<00:02:39.910> way<00:02:41.160> these<00:02:42.160> bits<00:02:42.489> of

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
frame a different way these bits of

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.000 
frame a different way these bits of
timber<00:02:42.790> are<00:02:43.390> designed<00:02:43.780> for<00:02:43.989> soft<00:02:44.200> stood<00:02:44.769> wall

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
timber are designed for soft stood wall

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.970 
timber are designed for soft stood wall
work<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.910> figure<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.600> makes<00:02:46.780> sense<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.319> use

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
work so I figure it makes sense to use

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.509 
work so I figure it makes sense to use
them<00:02:48.130> for<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.370> kind<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.670> thing<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:50.350> yeah<00:02:51.250> just

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
them for this kind of thing so yeah just

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.059 
them for this kind of thing so yeah just
got<00:02:51.640> one<00:02:51.819> back<00:02:52.030> into<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.390> floor<00:02:52.920> all<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.040> way

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
got one back into the floor all the way

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.120 
got one back into the floor all the way
up<00:02:54.330> most<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.510> distance<00:02:55.840> from<00:02:56.170> here

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
up most of the distance from here

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.770 
up most of the distance from here
because<00:02:57.940> where<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.239> plywood<00:02:58.569> have<00:02:58.660> be

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
because where the plywood have be

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.520 
because where the plywood have be
attached<00:02:59.019> up<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.100> tallest<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.530> 150

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
attached up to the tallest that 150

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.770 
attached up to the tallest that 150
millimetres<00:03:03.459> that's<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.330> thickness<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.690> the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
millimetres that's the thickness of the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.170 
millimetres that's the thickness of the
insulation<00:03:05.430> okay<00:03:06.430> I'll<00:03:06.670> do<00:03:06.819> one<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:07.090> these

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
insulation okay I'll do one of these

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.000 
insulation okay I'll do one of these
every<00:03:07.920> sort<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:08.980> give<00:03:09.459> me<00:03:09.549> time<00:03:09.730> Sean<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:11.010> still

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
every sort of give me time Sean I still

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.099 
every sort of give me time Sean I still
have<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.340> see<00:03:12.430> one<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.730> these<00:03:12.850> skip<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:13.959> of<00:03:13.989> the

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
have to see one of these skip one of the

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.410 
have to see one of these skip one of the
bumps<00:03:14.410> do<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.280> next<00:03:15.459> corrugation<00:03:16.180> and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
bumps do on to the next corrugation and

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.780 
bumps do on to the next corrugation and
the<00:03:17.380> distance<00:03:17.739> between<00:03:17.799> there<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.250> there<00:03:18.549> is

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
the distance between there and there is

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.069 
the distance between there and there is
actually<00:03:19.060> very<00:03:19.120> similar<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.840> width<00:03:19.989> of

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
actually very similar to the width of

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.560 
actually very similar to the width of
the<00:03:20.170> insulation<00:03:20.500> I'm<00:03:20.709> buying<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.540> yeah<00:03:22.540> I

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
the insulation I'm buying so yeah I

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.819 
the insulation I'm buying so yeah I
think<00:03:22.750> this<00:03:22.989> could<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.320> think<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.620> could<00:03:23.799> be

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
think this could I think this could be

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.590 
think this could I think this could be
the<00:03:23.980> way<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.100> do<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.459> I've<00:03:25.180> done<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.480> other

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
the way to do it I've done the other

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.280 
the way to do it I've done the other
side<00:03:25.660> as<00:03:25.930> well

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
side as well

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.870 
side as well
the<00:03:26.980> ends<00:03:27.190> are<00:03:27.220> gonna<00:03:27.370> be<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.549> little<00:03:27.670> bit

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the ends are gonna be a little bit

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.479 
the ends are gonna be a little bit
tricky<00:03:28.150> because<00:03:28.650> there's<00:03:29.650> these<00:03:30.340> little

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
tricky because there's these little

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.840 
tricky because there's these little
reinforcement<00:03:30.850> pins<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:31.810> are<00:03:31.870> welded<00:03:32.049> in

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
reinforcement pins that are welded in

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.280 
reinforcement pins that are welded in
but<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:33.880> think<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.209> think<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.690> should<00:03:34.840> fail<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.140> do

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
but I think I think I should fail to do

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.740 
but I think I think I should fail to do
it<00:03:35.410> especially<00:03:35.769> if<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.370> put<00:03:37.180> Timbers<00:03:37.540> across

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
it especially if I put Timbers across

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.630 
it especially if I put Timbers across
the<00:03:37.900> top<00:03:38.079> like<00:03:38.109> it<00:03:38.410> stood<00:03:38.560> walled<00:03:38.769> off<00:03:38.950> and

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
the top like it stood walled off and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.830 
the top like it stood walled off and
screw<00:03:39.850> through<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.299> way<00:03:40.450> sore<00:03:40.690> all

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
screw through that way sore all

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.620 
screw through that way sore all
connected<00:03:41.290> along<00:03:41.970> by<00:03:42.970> doing<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.299> this<00:03:43.359> way<00:03:43.450> it

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
connected along by doing it this way it

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.690 
connected along by doing it this way it
means<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:43.840> can<00:03:43.959> have<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.170> vents<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:45.459> course

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
means I can have the vents of course

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.729 
means I can have the vents of course
because<00:03:45.970> I've<00:03:46.090> put<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.329> vent<00:03:46.540> in<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.410> middle

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
because I've put the vent in the middle

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.640 
because I've put the vent in the middle
of<00:03:47.829> two<00:03:47.980> paths<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.579> I<00:03:48.640> can<00:03:48.850> put<00:03:49.060> like<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.690> duct<00:03:50.440> or

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
of two paths so I can put like a duct or

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.110 
of two paths so I can put like a duct or
something<00:03:50.980> through<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.400> use<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.670> vent<00:03:51.850> for<00:03:52.030> a

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
something through and use the vent for a

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.960 
something through and use the vent for a
shower<00:03:52.329> vent<00:03:52.630> or<00:03:53.040> well<00:03:54.040> just<00:03:54.250> generally

floor down here which one is it this is

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.920 
floor down here which one is it this is
where<00:04:42.140> the<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:43.130> is<00:04:43.280> one<00:04:43.460> floor<00:04:44.210> board<00:04:44.450> that's

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
where the this is one floor board that's

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.590 
where the this is one floor board that's
a<00:04:45.020> lot<00:04:45.140> of<00:04:45.170> a<00:04:45.350> lot<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:45.920> they<00:04:46.040> meet<00:04:46.390> right<00:04:47.390> over

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
a lot of a lot and they meet right over

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.830 
a lot of a lot and they meet right over
the<00:04:47.720> middle<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:48.020> here<00:04:48.260> at<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.800> center<00:04:49.220> of<00:04:49.250> this

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
the middle of here at the center of this

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.580 
the middle of here at the center of this
corrugation<00:04:51.100> so<00:04:52.990> it's<00:04:53.990> got<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.140> good<00:04:54.320> job<00:04:54.470> I

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
corrugation so it's got a good job I

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.500 
corrugation so it's got a good job I
chose<00:04:54.800> these<00:04:54.980> big<00:04:55.280> wide<00:04:55.490> brackets<00:04:56.060> I<00:04:56.150> was<00:04:56.330> just

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
chose these big wide brackets I was just

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.120 
chose these big wide brackets I was just
going<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.690> choose<00:04:56.900> ones<00:04:57.560> there<00:04:57.830> were<00:04:57.950> little

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
going to choose ones there were little

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.360 
going to choose ones there were little
tiny<00:04:58.340> things<00:04:58.670> again<00:04:59.030> like<00:04:59.480> that<00:04:59.980> but<00:05:00.980> the

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
tiny things again like that but the

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.010 
tiny things again like that but the
reason<00:05:01.460> chose<00:05:01.760> leaves<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:02.330> could<00:05:02.510> avoid<00:05:02.690> the

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
reason chose leaves so I could avoid the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.110 
reason chose leaves so I could avoid the
screws<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:03.920> guess<00:05:04.070> ever<00:05:04.280> did<00:05:04.610> a<00:05:04.670> fire<00:05:04.850> to<00:05:05.030> go

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
screws and guess ever did a fire to go

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.570 
screws and guess ever did a fire to go
over<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.420> screw<00:05:05.630> but<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.710> seems<00:05:07.250> they'll<00:05:07.430> burn

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
over a screw but it seems they'll burn

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.510 
over a screw but it seems they'll burn
up<00:05:07.790> fine<00:05:08.000> here<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.419> I'm<00:05:08.600> gonna<00:05:08.690> like<00:05:09.520> join

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
up fine here and I'm gonna like join

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.300 
up fine here and I'm gonna like join
across<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.970> bottoms<00:05:11.240> there<00:05:11.540> and<00:05:12.310> definitely

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
across the bottoms there and definitely

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.190 
across the bottoms there and definitely
at<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.460> top<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:14.600> think<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:15.020> were<00:05:15.080> absolutely

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
at the top so I think it were absolutely

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.520 
at the top so I think it were absolutely
fine<00:05:16.540> yeah<00:05:18.700> you<00:05:19.700> can<00:05:19.910> don't<00:05:20.810> only<00:05:20.930> will<00:05:21.260> see<00:05:21.440> on

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
fine yeah you can don't only will see on

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.280 
fine yeah you can don't only will see on

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
the video and I can see some of the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.960 
the video and I can see some of the
effects<00:05:24.560> of<00:05:24.680> condensation<00:05:25.280> it's<00:05:25.580> quite<00:05:25.760> late

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
effects of condensation it's quite late

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.400 
effects of condensation it's quite late
now<00:05:26.000> it's<00:05:26.570> pretty<00:05:26.930> cold<00:05:27.140> in<00:05:27.350> here<00:05:29.140> come<00:05:30.140> after

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
now it's pretty cold in here come after

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.800 
now it's pretty cold in here come after
work<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.830> do<00:05:30.979> as<00:05:31.760> much<00:05:32.030> as<00:05:32.060> I<00:05:32.300> can<00:05:32.450> fit<00:05:32.660> in

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
work to do as much as I can fit in

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.260 
work to do as much as I can fit in
what's<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.710> temperature<00:05:33.950> of<00:05:34.190> it<00:05:34.340> humidity

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
what's the temperature of it humidity

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.610 
what's the temperature of it humidity
sensor<00:05:35.630> here<00:05:37.060> 81<00:05:38.060> percent<00:05:38.419> humidity<00:05:38.840> four

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.990 
sensor here 81 percent humidity four
degrees<00:05:39.979> we've<00:05:40.310> gone<00:05:40.460> up<00:05:40.610> because<00:05:40.729> three

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
degrees we've gone up because three

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.719 
degrees we've gone up because three
degrees<00:05:41.300> before<00:05:41.830> practically<00:05:42.830> tropical<00:05:45.729> so

more when I can't okay okay so this is a

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.150 
more when I can't okay okay so this is a
massive<00:05:55.700> jump<00:05:56.030> forward<00:05:56.360> in<00:05:56.479> time<00:05:56.860> and<00:05:57.860> I've

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
massive jump forward in time and I've

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.340 
massive jump forward in time and I've
been<00:05:58.310> coming<00:05:58.460> after<00:05:58.669> work<00:05:58.940> last<00:05:59.570> night<00:05:59.750> trying

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
to get as much done as possible I

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.450 
to get as much done as possible I
decided<00:06:02.900> to<00:06:03.200> change<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.919> way<00:06:03.950> I'm<00:06:04.130> doing<00:06:04.280> the

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
decided to change the way I'm doing the

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.150 
decided to change the way I'm doing the
brackets<00:06:05.320> so<00:06:06.320> now<00:06:06.470> I've<00:06:06.710> got<00:06:06.890> one<00:06:06.919> on<00:06:07.070> either

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
sort of loops done just because I figure

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.910 
sort of loops done just because I figure
once<00:06:25.450> they<00:06:25.600> get<00:06:25.720> the<00:06:25.840> plywood<00:06:26.200> or<00:06:26.590> whatever<00:06:26.800> on

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.820 
zone and Sam at the top as well I've
replaced<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.750> ones<00:06:38.140> that<00:06:38.380> came<00:06:38.530> out<00:06:38.680> these

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
replaced the ones that came out these

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.750

starting at the plywood straight on the

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.340 
starting at the plywood straight on the
booty<00:06:44.800> in<00:06:44.950> like<00:06:45.130> that<00:06:45.310> so<00:06:46.180> that<00:06:46.600> should<00:06:47.140> save

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
booty in like that so that should save

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.960 
booty in like that so that should save
me<00:06:47.500> time<00:06:47.650> in<00:06:47.830> the<00:06:47.890> long<00:06:48.040> run<00:06:48.250> I<00:06:48.430> didn't<00:06:48.730> do<00:06:48.850> this

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
me time in the long run I didn't do this

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.010 
me time in the long run I didn't do this
originally<00:06:49.390> cuz<00:06:49.510> I<00:06:49.540> don't<00:06:49.600> think<00:06:49.720> it<00:06:49.870> would<00:06:49.960> be

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
originally cuz I don't think it would be

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.590 
originally cuz I don't think it would be
strong<00:06:50.230> enough<00:06:50.440> but<00:06:50.500> I<00:06:51.060> mean<00:06:52.060> it<00:06:52.180> moves<00:06:52.390> left

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
strong enough but I mean it moves left

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.290 
strong enough but I mean it moves left
to<00:06:52.750> right<00:06:52.900> I<00:06:52.930> can<00:06:53.260> hang<00:06:53.470> off<00:06:53.590> that<00:06:53.830> so<00:06:54.190> it's<00:06:55.090> not

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
to right I can hang off that so it's not

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.170 
to right I can hang off that so it's not
going<00:06:55.510> anywhere

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
going anywhere

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.720 
going anywhere
it<00:06:58.180> should<00:06:58.390> it<00:06:58.510> should<00:06:58.540> be<00:06:58.660> absolutely<00:06:58.840> fine

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
it should it should be absolutely fine

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.200 
it should it should be absolutely fine
now<00:07:00.730> I<00:07:00.760> want<00:07:01.090> to<00:07:01.150> sort<00:07:02.140> of<00:07:02.260> join<00:07:02.650> in<00:07:03.210> sideways

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
now I want to sort of join in sideways

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.760 
now I want to sort of join in sideways
this<00:07:04.660> one's<00:07:04.840> not<00:07:04.960> screwed<00:07:05.230> in<00:07:05.350> yeah<00:07:05.470> I'm<00:07:05.560> doing

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.660 
DIY stores too so I'll bring it through
the<00:07:35.620> plywood<00:07:36.010> to<00:07:36.040> make<00:07:36.250> it<00:07:36.370> look<00:07:36.520> neat<00:07:36.730> and<00:07:38.670> so

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:39.670 
the plywood to make it look neat and so

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.520 
the plywood to make it look neat and so
yeah<00:07:39.880> that's<00:07:40.570> probably<00:07:40.720> gonna<00:07:40.930> be<00:07:41.170> the<00:07:41.230> fiddly

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.530 
yeah that's probably gonna be the fiddly

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.730 
yeah that's probably gonna be the fiddly
a<00:07:41.560> bit<00:07:41.800> yeah<00:07:42.760> seven<00:07:43.420> designs<00:07:43.810> as<00:07:43.930> well<00:07:43.960> I<00:07:44.440> think

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:44.740 
a bit yeah seven designs as well I think

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.680 
a bit yeah seven designs as well I think
it<00:07:44.950> should<00:07:45.070> be<00:07:45.100> easier<00:07:45.400> in<00:07:45.550> this<00:07:45.670> end<00:07:45.880> with<00:07:46.570> the

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:46.690 
it should be easier in this end with the

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.200 
it should be easier in this end with the
double<00:07:46.930> doors<00:07:47.370> there<00:07:48.370> would<00:07:48.460> be<00:07:48.490> a<00:07:48.640> loop<00:07:49.060> here

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.210 
double doors there would be a loop here

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.150 
double doors there would be a loop here
locally<00:07:49.660> yeah<00:07:49.870> and<00:07:50.650> then<00:07:50.770> it<00:07:50.890> would<00:07:50.980> have<00:07:51.040> to

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:51.160 
locally yeah and then it would have to

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.760 
locally yeah and then it would have to
come<00:07:51.340> up<00:07:51.370> to<00:07:51.990> left<00:07:52.990> over<00:07:53.140> piece<00:07:53.380> here<00:07:53.620> what

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:53.770 
come up to left over piece here what

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.420 
come up to left over piece here what
this<00:07:53.860> pins<00:07:54.130> in<00:07:54.370> the<00:07:54.490> way<00:07:54.870> but<00:07:55.890> think<00:07:56.890> of<00:07:57.100> I

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:57.430 
this pins in the way but think of I

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.970 
this pins in the way but think of I
figured<00:07:57.940> a<00:07:58.000> way<00:07:58.030> to<00:07:58.180> do<00:07:58.480> it<00:07:58.570> and<00:07:58.780> I'll<00:07:59.770> probably

00:07:59.970 --> 00:07:59.980 
figured a way to do it and I'll probably

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.170 
figured a way to do it and I'll probably
show<00:08:00.220> you<00:08:00.310> that<00:08:00.460> when<00:08:00.580> we<00:08:00.610> get<00:08:00.760> round<00:08:00.940> to<00:08:01.030> it

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180 
show you that when we get round to it

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.330 
show you that when we get round to it
but<00:08:02.050> yeah<00:08:02.140> I<00:08:02.320> made<00:08:02.470> fairly<00:08:02.830> decent<00:08:03.160> progress

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:03.340 
but yeah I made fairly decent progress

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.840 
but yeah I made fairly decent progress
so<00:08:03.640> far<00:08:03.790> quite<00:08:04.750> a<00:08:04.780> lot<00:08:04.960> of<00:08:05.020> these<00:08:05.250> in<00:08:06.250> take<00:08:06.820> a

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:06.850 
so far quite a lot of these in take a

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.640 
so far quite a lot of these in take a
step<00:08:07.120> back<00:08:07.330> you<00:08:07.480> can<00:08:07.660> see<00:08:07.870> it's<00:08:08.230> a<00:08:08.260> bit<00:08:08.410> dark

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:08.650 
step back you can see it's a bit dark

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.380 
step back you can see it's a bit dark
obviously<00:08:09.180> look<00:08:10.210> get<00:08:10.900> in<00:08:10.990> there<00:08:11.140> slowly
