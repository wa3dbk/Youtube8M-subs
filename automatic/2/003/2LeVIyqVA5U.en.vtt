00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.070
 faced the decisive test to achieve 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.960
 a make-up inspired by the optical theme later 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.070
 a careful evaluation and four judges

 each of you has merits that you 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.600
 they would make a perfect make up 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.820
 never designers nor are there also gods 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.610
