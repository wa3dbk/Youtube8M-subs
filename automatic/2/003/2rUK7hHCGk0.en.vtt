 video tutorial in which we are 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.309
 learning how to activate windows windows 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.469
 8.1 obviously it will be all the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.120
 versions to be able to activate it 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.860
 we just have to know if what 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.949
 we have obviously disabled if you 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.090
 you have the watermark that alak us down 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.250
 obviously it's because it's in your system 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.140
 operative is also disabled 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.640
 we can know if we have it disabled 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.680
 with this command order I 'll give you the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.060
 description of the video we copy it 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.830
 we go to the symbol and if we need you 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.239
 as administrator 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.040
 and we're going to paste it here to see if it's 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.770
 activated or not 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.690
 in this case I have windows 8 pro and I 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.460
 He says that I have activated so 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.930
 permanent I activated it with this 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.920
 small program and you are also going to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.870
 can activate 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.070
 and well, to activate it 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.570
 we 're just going to go to the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.620
 description of the video and you will find 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.780
 my Web page 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.070
 being on my website it simply 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.070
 they go to the activators section 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.030
 one click on the image is the activator 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.070
 we click and it will redirect us 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.570
 fly unit we're just going for the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.570
 one hundred seconds of advertising 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.530
 and we will give where it says jump advertising 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.509
 is going to redirect a mega 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.710
 just download the file and you're done 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.830
 it is not more it is not very difficult do not download 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.200
 and well, it's already downloaded 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.750
 download a winrar file what are we going to 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.399
 do is right click extract here they 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.619
 we bring us a folder like 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.270
 we're going to double-click on it and we're going to 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.420
 execute what would be the activator like 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.119
 administrator right click touch as 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.759
 administrator let's hope so and we 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.020
 is going to open this little program while 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.840
 in the program we simply give 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.969
 where install says 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.979
 when we have given him in install we are 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.710
 is going to open this little window I've 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.500
 taken the capture of it and it opens 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.270
 the small window and we will give in 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.990
 we just will not give anything what 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.369
 we let it run that reaches the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.840
 bar in green until the end when 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.929
 get to the bar in green until the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.370
 final but the little symbol system 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.860
 where he tells us he's going to start 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.569
 activate our operating system 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.400
 we just hope it charges there 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.650
 is loading shows us is loading 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.739
 and here this small part will come out 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.290
 a small countdown of 5 to 1 in 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.540
 which we will have to wait for what 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.940
 tells us that he is going to make accession in 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.920
 our pc to be able to activate our 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.110
 operating system we simply wait 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.629
 you close the section and now simply 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.940
 when the session has already closed 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.620
 we start our section and we will 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.930
 get out this little window of the 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.340
 windows activation and it tells us that it's going 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.849
 to be activated 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.590
 We send us this simply close 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.390
 this just leave where it says 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.420
 that the software license version 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.890
 it is activated we will accept the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.190
 which here also 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.930
 and here also and well, this would be 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.900
 all the tutorial in which already 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.420
 we would have what would be windows 8 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.880
 activated from a 28.1 full activated 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.120
 permanently and well then if 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.370
 you have activated in windows 8.1 and if you 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.130
 a little message comes out like this one was 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.820
 this little message in windows 8.1 is 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.930
 because suddenly there is a small ip 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.100
 incompatibility of the program and therefore 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.140
 good to remove that little 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.280
 incompatible and that you have your windows 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.330
 3.1 only activated and what we are going to do 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.610
 turn it off how we do that 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.000
 we just go to the configuration 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.330
 control panel we go to systems and 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.020
 center security center 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.820
 activities 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.510
 we go here to the p is to the 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.580
 left of this we do not give it where it says 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.740
 change windows settings 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.480
 marketing 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.370
 we mark the last box that says no 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.700
 do nothing disable windows in more 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.350
 believe and we accept to accept what 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.050
 cancel because obviously I do not have 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.400
 windows 8.1 and then well this would be all 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.840
 I hope you liked to give it and 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.840
