structural adaptation or poor posture
was<00:00:29.320> coming<00:00:29.650> from<00:00:29.860> the<00:00:30.130> jaw<00:00:30.310> joint<00:00:30.730> so<00:00:31.270> with

the proper titration of the alkalizer we
now<00:00:34.270> come<00:00:34.570> back<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:34.960> even<00:00:35.170> in<00:00:35.289> the<00:00:35.440> short

now come back and even in the short

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.680 
now come back and even in the short
period<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.250> time<00:00:36.460> we<00:00:36.670> can<00:00:36.700> see<00:00:36.970> some<00:00:37.180> postural

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
changes and one of the changes that we

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.840 
changes and one of the changes that we
see<00:00:39.550> is<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:40.300> hands<00:00:40.840> because<00:00:41.260> now<00:00:41.649> we<00:00:42.399> can<00:00:42.579> see

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
see is the hands because now we can see

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.750 
see is the hands because now we can see
the<00:00:43.450> thumb<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:44.230> forefinger<00:00:44.800> when<00:00:45.160> previously

the thumb and forefinger when previously
we<00:00:45.910> were<00:00:46.060> seeing<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.420> back<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.930> hand<00:00:47.290> in

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
we were seeing the back of the hand in

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.950 
we were seeing the back of the hand in
other<00:00:47.829> words<00:00:48.070> in<00:00:48.309> order<00:00:48.730> previously<00:00:49.690> she<00:00:49.870> was

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
other words in order previously she was

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.100 
other words in order previously she was
had<00:00:50.200> rolled<00:00:50.530> shoulders<00:00:51.190> but<00:00:51.790> as<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.420> jaw

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
had rolled shoulders but as the jaw

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.959 
had rolled shoulders but as the jaw
which<00:00:53.380> is<00:00:53.590> now<00:00:53.770> not<00:00:54.610> inflamed<00:00:55.290> sets<00:00:56.290> back<00:00:56.969> then

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
which is now not inflamed sets back then

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.860 
which is now not inflamed sets back then
the<00:00:58.450> arms<00:00:59.079> come<00:00:59.469> back<00:01:00.040> around<00:01:00.250> like<00:01:00.670> so<00:01:01.000> okay

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
the arms come back around like so okay

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.580 
the arms come back around like so okay
so<00:01:01.930> that<00:01:02.379> she<00:01:02.829> doesn't<00:01:03.340> have<00:01:03.460> as<00:01:03.670> much<00:01:03.969> rolled

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
so that she doesn't have as much rolled

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.719 
so that she doesn't have as much rolled
shoulders<00:01:05.590> as<00:01:05.740> she<00:01:05.890> did<00:01:06.040> previously<00:01:06.369> that's

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
shoulders as she did previously that's

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.429 
shoulders as she did previously that's
what<00:01:06.880> you're<00:01:07.000> looking<00:01:07.299> at<00:01:07.450> now<00:01:07.689> this<00:01:08.229> isn't

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
what you're looking at now this isn't

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.559 
what you're looking at now this isn't
clearing<00:01:08.979> all<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.130> responses<00:01:09.939> but<00:01:10.179> she<00:01:10.359> still

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:10.569 
clearing all the responses but she still

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:13.830 
clearing all the responses but she still
has<00:01:10.780> some<00:01:10.959> divergent<00:01:11.590> feet<00:01:11.859> but<00:01:12.549> in<00:01:13.539> such<00:01:13.810> a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
has some divergent feet but in such a

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.989 
has some divergent feet but in such a
short<00:01:14.139> period<00:01:14.289> of<00:01:14.619> time<00:01:14.709> this<00:01:15.039> is<00:01:15.189> nice<00:01:15.459> to<00:01:15.759> see

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:15.999 
short period of time this is nice to see

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:18.899 
short period of time this is nice to see
and<00:01:16.959> maybe<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.380> nice<00:01:17.740> basis<00:01:18.340> for<00:01:18.579> either

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
and maybe a nice basis for either

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.539 
and maybe a nice basis for either
chiropractic<00:01:19.899> osteopathic<00:01:20.740> therapy<00:01:21.189> who

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
chiropractic osteopathic therapy who

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.370 
chiropractic osteopathic therapy who
might<00:01:21.729> be<00:01:21.880> treating<00:01:22.270> shoulders<00:01:22.719> backs<00:01:23.020> or

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
might be treating shoulders backs or

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.889 
might be treating shoulders backs or
other<00:01:24.069> kinds<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.549> injuries<00:01:25.029> and<00:01:25.240> not

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
other kinds of injuries and not

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.230 
other kinds of injuries and not
understanding<00:01:26.529> that<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.829> TM<00:01:27.130> joint<00:01:27.609> could<00:01:28.029> be

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
understanding that the TM joint could be

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.419 
understanding that the TM joint could be
the<00:01:28.749> initiator<00:01:29.079> for<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.829> dysfunction<00:01:30.399> that

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
the initiator for the dysfunction that

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.480 
the initiator for the dysfunction that
they're<00:01:30.789> seeing<00:01:31.149> if<00:01:31.479> we<00:01:32.049> look<00:01:32.289> at<00:01:32.469> the<00:01:32.679> center

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
they're seeing if we look at the center

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.309 
they're seeing if we look at the center
line<00:01:33.670> as<00:01:33.880> we<00:01:34.060> go<00:01:34.270> up<00:01:34.479> she's<00:01:34.869> still<00:01:35.109> off-center

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
line as we go up she's still off-center

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.649 
line as we go up she's still off-center
and<00:01:36.069> certainly<00:01:36.459> needs<00:01:36.729> some<00:01:37.299> treatment

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
and certainly needs some treatment

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.239 
and certainly needs some treatment
although<00:01:37.929> that<00:01:38.109> is<00:01:38.289> a<00:01:38.319> bit<00:01:38.590> better<00:01:38.799> than<00:01:38.979> it

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249 
although that is a bit better than it

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:40.199 
although that is a bit better than it
was<00:01:39.399> previously

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
was previously

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:41.910 
was previously
and<00:01:40.389> the<00:01:40.779> shoulders<00:01:41.229> are<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.469> little<00:01:41.679> more

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
and the shoulders are a little more

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.039 
and the shoulders are a little more
level<00:01:42.429> so<00:01:42.880> again<00:01:43.149> this<00:01:43.299> is<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.509> starting

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
level so again this is a starting

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.629 
level so again this is a starting
process<00:01:44.349> and<00:01:44.799> of<00:01:44.889> course<00:01:45.069> it's<00:01:45.249> only<00:01:45.399> been<00:01:45.579> a

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:45.639 
process and of course it's only been a

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.089 
process and of course it's only been a
very<00:01:45.880> short<00:01:46.149> period<00:01:46.479> of<00:01:46.509> time<00:01:46.569> but<00:01:47.560> with<00:01:47.950> these

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
very short period of time but with these

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.159 
very short period of time but with these
clear<00:01:48.399> indicators<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:50.079> is<00:01:50.289> a<00:01:50.319> very<00:01:50.770> exciting

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:52.169 
clear indicators this is a very exciting

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:56.639 
clear indicators this is a very exciting
example<00:01:53.169> of<00:01:53.439> how<00:01:53.649> quickly<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:55.240> effect<00:01:55.659> can

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
example of how quickly this effect can

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.859 
example of how quickly this effect can
take<00:01:56.859> place<00:01:57.099> and<00:01:57.639> now<00:01:58.149> we'd<00:01:58.299> like<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.630> show<00:01:58.840> you

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
take place and now we'd like to show you

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.339 
take place and now we'd like to show you

the Aqua Lizer some of the things that

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.690 
the Aqua Lizer some of the things that
we<00:02:11.319> see<00:02:11.760> immediately<00:02:13.440> if<00:02:14.440> we<00:02:14.620> line<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
we see immediately if we line the the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.250 
we see immediately if we line the the
plumb<00:02:16.540> line<00:02:16.570> here

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260

with<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.860> shoulder<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:19.390> difference<00:02:19.840> in

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
with the shoulder is the difference in

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.440 
with the shoulder is the difference in
the<00:02:20.260> head<00:02:20.440> position<00:02:20.620> how<00:02:21.519> much<00:02:21.730> more<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.269> has

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the head position how much more it has

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.420 
the head position how much more it has
come<00:02:22.780> back<00:02:23.019> just<00:02:23.409> in<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> short<00:02:23.920> period<00:02:24.190> of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
come back just in the short period of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.039 
come back just in the short period of
time<00:02:24.489> in<00:02:25.420> other<00:02:25.540> words<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:25.870> there's

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
time in other words if there's

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.589 
time in other words if there's
inflammation<00:02:26.319> in<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.890> jaw<00:02:27.190> we<00:02:27.370> know<00:02:27.569> 96%<00:02:28.569> of

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
inflammation in the jaw we know 96% of

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.600 
inflammation in the jaw we know 96% of
the<00:02:28.720> time<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.739> person<00:02:30.129> is<00:02:30.250> leaning

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the time that the person is leaning

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.509 
the time that the person is leaning
forward<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.269> therefore<00:02:32.340> 96%<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.489> time

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
forward so therefore 96% of the time

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.309 
forward so therefore 96% of the time
it's<00:02:33.940> going<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.150> hurt<00:02:34.360> right<00:02:34.629> there<00:02:34.660> on<00:02:35.260> a

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
it's going to hurt right there on a

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.369 
it's going to hurt right there on a
patient<00:02:36.160> with<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> jaw<00:02:36.640> joint<00:02:36.940> problem<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.660> and

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
patient with a jaw joint problem and and

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.500 
patient with a jaw joint problem and and
you<00:02:39.069> can<00:02:39.250> see<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.730> now<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.330> by

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
you can see that now just by

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.270 
you can see that now just by
decompressing<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.349> how<00:02:41.590> far<00:02:41.830> her<00:02:41.980> head<00:02:42.160> has

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
decompressing that how far her head has

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.190 
decompressing that how far her head has
come<00:02:42.489> up<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.819> how<00:02:43.000> much<00:02:43.030> more<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.569> line<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:44.019> is

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
come up and how much more in line it is

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.619 
come up and how much more in line it is
that<00:02:45.069> means<00:02:45.280> there's<00:02:45.549> less<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:46.060> bow<00:02:46.269> right

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
that means there's less of a bow right

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.949 
that means there's less of a bow right
here<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.620> if<00:02:48.069> we<00:02:48.129> take<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.790> look<00:02:49.000> at<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.360> position

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
here so if we take a look at a position

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.670 
here so if we take a look at a position
from<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.739> point<00:02:51.040> on<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.340> heel<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.599> hip<00:02:52.930> to

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
from a point on the heel to the hip to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.449 
from a point on the heel to the hip to
the<00:02:53.799> shoulder<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.640> ear<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.840> W<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:57.220> was

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
the shoulder to the ear the W that was

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.220 
the shoulder to the ear the W that was
quite<00:02:57.760> accentuated<00:02:58.599> in<00:02:58.750> our<00:02:58.870> first

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
quite accentuated in our first

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.069 
quite accentuated in our first
presentation<00:02:59.440> is<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.430> get<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.090> flattening<00:03:01.900> out

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
presentation is is get is flattening out

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.220 
presentation is is get is flattening out
to<00:03:02.739> becoming<00:03:03.129> almost<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.790> line<00:03:04.060> okay<00:03:04.720> there's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
to becoming almost a line okay there's

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.479 
to becoming almost a line okay there's
still<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.470> little<00:03:05.769> bit<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:06.069> forward<00:03:06.280> head

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
still a little bit of forward head

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.000 
still a little bit of forward head
posture<00:03:06.760> here<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:07.569> this<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:08.010> significantly

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
posture here but this is significantly

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.220 
posture here but this is significantly
better<00:03:09.310> in<00:03:09.609> a<00:03:10.390> short<00:03:10.569> amount<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:10.959> time<00:03:11.200> that

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
better in a short amount of time that

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.780 
better in a short amount of time that
we've<00:03:11.620> had<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:12.160> decompress<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.450> joint
