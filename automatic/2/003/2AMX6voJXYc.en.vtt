00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
to shake it up a little before you use

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.629 
to shake it up a little before you use
it<00:03:45.690> just<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.989> kind<00:03:46.169> of<00:03:46.290> activate<00:03:46.769> everything

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
it just to kind of activate everything

it just to kind of activate everything
that's<00:03:47.849> inside<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:49.379> works<00:03:49.650> fabulously<00:03:50.489> so

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
that's inside and it works fabulously so

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.080 
that's inside and it works fabulously so
I<00:03:51.150> highly<00:03:51.629> recommend<00:03:52.049> that<00:03:52.139> um<00:03:52.620> after<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.879> I

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
I highly recommend that um after that I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.089 
I highly recommend that um after that I
use<00:03:54.329> joy<00:03:54.569> Kota<00:03:54.870> joy<00:03:55.019> whip<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.500> got<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:55.889> at<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099

line<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.730> um<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.299> tried<00:04:06.659> this<00:04:06.870> just<00:04:07.319> out<00:04:07.620> of

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
line so um I tried this just out of

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.640 
line so um I tried this just out of
curiosity<00:04:08.400> um<00:04:09.060> just<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:09.900> my<00:04:10.019> Mohawk<00:04:10.409> section

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
curiosity um just in my Mohawk section

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.159 
curiosity um just in my Mohawk section
down<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.519> back<00:04:11.639> of<00:04:11.669> my<00:04:11.819> head<00:04:12.169> before

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
down the back of my head before

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.619 
down the back of my head before
blow-drying<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:15.000> called<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.239> firm<00:04:15.449> hold

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
blow-drying it's it's called a firm hold

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.779 
blow-drying it's it's called a firm hold
design<00:04:16.049> foam<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:16.889> I<00:04:17.159> don't<00:04:17.430> know<00:04:17.669> that

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
design foam and so I don't know that

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.339 
design foam and so I don't know that
that's<00:04:17.940> what<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.180> designed<00:04:18.659> for<00:04:19.019> but

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
that's what it's designed for but

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.719 
that's what it's designed for but
because<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.650> tease<00:04:19.799> my<00:04:19.859> hair<00:04:20.159> it<00:04:20.250> helps<00:04:20.370> the

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
because I tease my hair it helps the

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.959 
because I tease my hair it helps the
look<00:04:21.630> helps<00:04:22.169> give<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.740> tease<00:04:23.219> staying<00:04:23.760> power

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
look helps give the tease staying power

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.600 
look helps give the tease staying power
so<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.599> absolutely<00:04:24.810> love<00:04:25.440> that

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
so I absolutely love that

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.760

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.720 
tried quite a few products that claim to
speed<00:05:16.590> up<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.770> blow-dry<00:05:17.100> but<00:05:17.280> they<00:05:17.370> also<00:05:17.520> make

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
speed up the blow-dry but they also make

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.290 
speed up the blow-dry but they also make
my<00:05:17.850> hair<00:05:18.060> feel<00:05:18.330> slimy<00:05:18.780> or<00:05:19.680> look<00:05:20.460> gross<00:05:20.910> and

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
my hair feel slimy or look gross and

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.050 
my hair feel slimy or look gross and
this<00:05:21.720> doesn't<00:05:22.050> do<00:05:22.170> that<00:05:22.320> now<00:05:23.220> it<00:05:23.460> is<00:05:23.610> an<00:05:23.790> oil

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
this doesn't do that now it is an oil

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.440 
this doesn't do that now it is an oil
and<00:05:24.240> water<00:05:24.420> emulsion<00:05:24.780> so<00:05:25.230> it<00:05:25.620> does<00:05:25.830> separate

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
and water emulsion so it does separate

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.790 
and water emulsion so it does separate
so<00:05:27.450> you<00:05:27.510> have<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.840> shake<00:05:28.170> it<00:05:28.200> up<00:05:28.380> before<00:05:28.710> you

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
so you have to shake it up before you

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.310 
so you have to shake it up before you
use<00:05:28.830> it<00:05:29.190> but<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.640> love<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.090> the<00:05:30.240> smell<00:05:30.480> is<00:05:30.720> great

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320
