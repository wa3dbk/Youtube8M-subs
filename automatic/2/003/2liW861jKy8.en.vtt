00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 when 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.729
 GuÃ©ant 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.490
 at the end of the winter 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.700
 how does this mediate in motion plant and animal machinery 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 numb with months of drowsiness 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.770
 common toads and red frogs 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.060
 are part of early awakening 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.060
 and out of respect to still believe in the arrival of spring 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.840
 the sign are there too 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.810
 but also barely came out the cold and the snow had pushed them to 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810
 run away to hibernate a few months ago 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.640
 after months of sleep 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.480
 they seem very hesitant 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.810
 as if they had to relearn the authors 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.800
 the shapes of places that are so familiar to them 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.670
 yet it is not 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.140
 because the newts know all the secrets of the orientation 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.120
 this allows them to take stock and sometimes very long trip 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.610
 the one who leads them every year at this time 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.610
 on their breeding site 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.140
 the goal on their side the majors 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.420
 is located several hundred meters sometimes kilometers from their 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.210
 usual refuge 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.300
 it's just a puddle 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.460
 most often a pond or the edge of a pond 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.260

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
