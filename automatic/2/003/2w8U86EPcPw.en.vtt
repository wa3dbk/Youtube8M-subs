00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.760
 fans of alex hirsch put in the series 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.830
 many easter eggs 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.739
 encrypted labels and messages 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.350
 written backwards message frequently 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.320
 hinted at the development of the plot and these hints 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.290
 drove the fans of gravity falls but it's time 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.150
 they began to build the most puzzling 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.700
 theories of what he meant 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.340
 and in the second season many of their theory 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.650
 the fans started coming true 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.200
 who is the real author of the diaries and what 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.709
 Uncle Stan hides but another is possible 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.680
 reason alex hirsch also reads forums and 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.590
 surely writes down the best ideas to 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.920
 put it on the show for nothing 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.040
 not recognized but such is our insane 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.790
 theory and in gravity falls paranoids always 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.790
 are right
