00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.650
 few what little they have in my house 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.840

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.460
 here after downloading that they're not going 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.800
 to enter the text page 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.210
 this not only this has been not 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.860
 after having been this we're going to 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.940
 see below 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.119
 we will go to this page where we will download 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.100
 this the wow three points 3.5 to me 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.259
 liked what we downloaded, I hope happy and 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.580
 second we enter the captcha and what 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.920
 we unload 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.920
 what it would be 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.440
 what is here 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.590
 speak 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.310
 was to say that in though is to believe everything 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.350
 this we will accept ok but let me 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.910
 tell them something of mediator 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.570
 personally you will come with two 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.159
 folders and miguel arias is flying 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.799
 with two folders 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.150
 gatilov the other folders are created 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.620
 afterwards so we have 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.670
 let it download 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.670
 let's accept 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.359
 this 17 arrives I think I'm not too sure 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.880
 but that does not matter much to which song 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.759
 you see what to do the neighbors who are 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.579
 coming out is downloading these two patches 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.679
 since the games was updated and you have 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.539
 that 23 wings manually if you do not 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.830
 it worked for me it did not work for me but for 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.450
 people that the function is that of another 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.250
 it was for these people that they did not 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.099
 it works then let's write the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.269
 perchel by the partial the patched no 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.800
 it is up or black 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.080
 I think nothing so 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.670
 they download it they download their maximum 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.450
 good speed almost like the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.830
 torrent 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.140
 let's use it because I do not want the 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.140
 video is still consuming 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.560
 ok as I was saying let's download this 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.420
 then that put has here I no longer have 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.430
 how but it is possible to me discs and we are going to 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.720
 create these two patches which are 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.090
 they are going to write the skele folder is 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.400
 this one and not honor you have to unzip 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.010
 what I was not raising children 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.870
 and this is going to be this, this is two 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.810
 patches then what are you going to 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.650
 to do is go to download your folder 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:02.720
 world of warcraft three points 3.5 to the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.480
 data folder and they will take the threads go 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.620
 to 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.620
 copy here 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.860
 is what we 're going to do because it's going to 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.290
 get this out of this 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.150
 and certain things appear to me now is the 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.700
 moment to get into the game 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.700
 so what you have to do is take the place 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.170
 and then you should open the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.170
 I walk weeks and I'm going to open this 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.900
 not going to do this 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.349
 and there would be our installer 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.280
 the installed patches of the folder the 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.280
 way to download it 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.780
 I really love to warn you 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.930
 only only one small mistake 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.450
 of the game which when you enter is 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.819
 say the game version can not be 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.129
 validate 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.230
 in that moment you have to wait 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.870
 around a minute or a minute and 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.510
 medium and then enter I 'm going to 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.030
 show I'm going to show you now but 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.470
 I need to find the game on screen 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.920
 onscreen 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.389
 that is, a full screen 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.280
 but no 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.960
 ok I think he changed the configuration 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.139
 now I think it should appear in 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.139
 screen 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.380
 a good guy blanket I do not know how to 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.620
 they move so black that if it 's mental 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.560
 because this 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.750
 so now what happens 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.580
 is that we have to enter with our 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.919
 data at the time the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:48.790
 game the game is going to pay a little no 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.790
 much being horribly slow 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:58.330
 with the data immediately then 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:01.190
 I also have to play then you go to 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.340
 validate the version of the games and you 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.800
 you're going to forget or not all this wait will be 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.770
 all this waiting is useless and I have lost 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.970
 everything then not not to me one thing that 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.860
 you also did all the steps 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.450
 correctly 7 every day I told him 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.590
 not that it was wrong that the things that 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.210
 you have to wait around for a 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.690
 minute or so when the 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.690
 song 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.980
 then we will see 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:35.310
 or not 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.970
 the weather france we are going to enter 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.970
 with other fours and we are going to enter 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:47.099
 and this is all the times you come to 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.870
 play and this is born of the alliance that 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.639
 he also founded an alliance and being a magician 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.430
 social and that 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.259
 thank you very much and that's all I hope 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.550
 have you clarified all doubts if it is 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.680
 that can not clarify all doubts 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.550
 how to make how an account is created because 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.210
 I think that was what we missed 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.580
 whale me web.com or do I smell on google 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.259
 and it starts at start record as in 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.719
 all the rpg suite games and all that 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.430
 even this involved so I do not think that 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:15.070
 be again 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:19.020
 and I will be willing to answer questions 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.020
 and that's all, thank you very much
