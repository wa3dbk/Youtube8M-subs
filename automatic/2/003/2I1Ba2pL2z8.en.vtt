players you know this you're tight in
your<00:02:07.579> hip<00:02:07.819> flexors<00:02:07.969> and<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.599> goes<00:02:08.780> for

skinning stride but being tight here one

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.059 
skinning stride but being tight here one
thing<00:02:15.200> that's<00:02:15.319> going<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.530> do<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.709> pull<00:02:15.950> our

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
thing that's going to do is pull our

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.979 
thing that's going to do is pull our
pelvis<00:02:16.489> forward<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.239> already<00:02:17.480> we're<00:02:17.750> putting

pelvis forward so already we're putting

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.289 
pelvis forward so already we're putting
our<00:02:18.110> abdominals<00:02:18.519> on<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.579> stretch<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.239> a

our abdominals on a stretch in a
lengthened<00:02:20.750> position<00:02:21.230> but<00:02:21.769> then<00:02:21.920> when<00:02:22.040> we<00:02:22.160> try

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
lengthened position but then when we try

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.100 
lengthened position but then when we try
to<00:02:22.400> strive<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.269> we're<00:02:23.420> tight<00:02:23.629> here<00:02:23.900> we're

I'm<00:03:48.970> moving<00:03:49.300> into<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.570> length<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:50.080> position<00:03:50.650> and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
I'm moving into a length in position and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.860 
I'm moving into a length in position and
then<00:03:51.220> when<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.370> come<00:03:51.640> back<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:52.180> way<00:03:52.240> i'm<00:03:52.570> using

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
then when I come back this way i'm using

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.020 
then when I come back this way i'm using
the<00:03:52.960> muscles<00:03:53.140> on<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.590> inside<00:03:54.040> here<00:03:54.550> to<00:03:54.850> sort

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
the muscles on the inside here to sort

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.780 
the muscles on the inside here to sort
of<00:03:55.150> help<00:03:55.710> decelerate<00:03:56.710> me<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:57.070> don't<00:03:57.550> know<00:03:57.640> what

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
of help decelerate me I don't know what

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.030 
of help decelerate me I don't know what
I'm<00:03:57.910> going<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.210> also<00:03:58.450> add<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.530> little

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
I'm going to also add is a little

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.640 
I'm going to also add is a little
rotation<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.540> reach<00:04:01.810> away<00:04:02.970> each<00:04:03.970> time<00:04:04.650> to

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
rotation and reach away each time to

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.340 
rotation and reach away each time to
again<00:04:05.980> not<00:04:06.460> just<00:04:06.670> lengthen<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.720> eye<00:04:07.750> doctors

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
again not just lengthen the eye doctors

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.060 
again not just lengthen the eye doctors
but<00:04:09.010> also<00:04:09.870> lengthen<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:13.270> abdominals<00:04:14.070> both

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
but also lengthen the abdominals both

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.840 
but also lengthen the abdominals both
read<00:04:15.430> this<00:04:15.670> ignominious<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:18.430> obliques

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
read this ignominious and the obliques

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.509 
read this ignominious and the obliques
so<00:04:19.540> that's<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.900> little<00:04:20.019> hip<00:04:20.680> then<00:04:21.430> I'm

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
so that's a little hip then I'm

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.220 
so that's a little hip then I'm
going<00:04:21.670> to<00:04:21.730> stay<00:04:22.030> with<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.390> cable<00:04:22.780> call<00:04:25.230> bottom

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
going to stay with the cable call bottom

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:41.670 
going to stay with the cable call bottom
a<00:04:36.510> very<00:04:37.510> light<00:04:37.840> bulb<00:04:38.140> to<00:04:38.380> start<00:04:38.710> with<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:40.680> do

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
a very light bulb to start with and do

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.370 
a very light bulb to start with and do
it<00:04:41.890> adduction<00:04:42.430> so<00:04:43.390> I'm<00:04:43.870> going<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:44.110> bring<00:04:44.320> my

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
it adduction so I'm going to bring my

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.940 
it adduction so I'm going to bring my
heel<00:04:45.220> to<00:04:45.400> my<00:04:45.550> toe<00:04:46.169> but<00:04:47.169> then<00:04:47.320> I'm<00:04:47.470> also<00:04:47.590> going

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
heel to my toe but then I'm also going

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.630 
heel to my toe but then I'm also going
to<00:04:48.010> bring<00:04:48.250> my<00:04:48.430> toes<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:49.080> my<00:04:50.080> heat<00:04:50.530> or<00:04:50.710> friends

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
to bring my toes to my heat or friends

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.800 
to bring my toes to my heat or friends
and<00:04:52.380> back<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:54.700> I<00:04:54.730> get<00:04:54.910> my<00:04:55.060> different<00:04:55.419> adductor

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
and back so I get my different adductor

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.690 
and back so I get my different adductor
muscles<00:04:56.260> make<00:04:56.800> sure<00:04:56.830> your<00:04:57.130> toe<00:04:57.370> stays

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
muscles make sure your toe stays

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.360 
muscles make sure your toe stays
pointing<00:04:58.150> straight<00:04:58.360> ahead<00:04:59.130> often<00:05:00.130> you'll<00:05:00.310> see

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
pointing straight ahead often you'll see

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.690 
pointing straight ahead often you'll see
athletes<00:05:00.850> want<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.870> turn<00:05:02.110> their<00:05:02.950> toe<00:05:03.190> out<00:05:03.430> and

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
athletes want to turn their toe out and

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.580 
athletes want to turn their toe out and
bring<00:05:03.880> their<00:05:04.030> heel<00:05:04.300> in<00:05:04.540> and<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:05.260> they're

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
bring their heel in and that they're

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.650 
bring their heel in and that they're
trying<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.980> use<00:05:06.070> their<00:05:06.280> hands<00:05:06.490> drink<00:05:06.940> to<00:05:07.510> do

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
trying to use their hands drink to do

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.740 
trying to use their hands drink to do
that<00:05:07.900> as<00:05:08.140> opposed<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.370> their<00:05:09.520> doctor<00:05:12.720> use<00:05:13.720> a

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
that as opposed to their doctor use a

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.080 
that as opposed to their doctor use a
half<00:05:14.020> feeling<00:05:14.380> growing<00:05:14.590> stretch<00:05:14.890> a<00:05:14.919> lot<00:05:15.190> but

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
half feeling growing stretch a lot but

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.880 
half feeling growing stretch a lot but
again<00:05:16.419> let's<00:05:16.690> take<00:05:17.080> it<00:05:17.320> so<00:05:17.560> that<00:05:17.770> we're

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
again let's take it so that we're

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.890 
again let's take it so that we're
putting<00:05:18.070> those<00:05:18.340> adapters<00:05:18.970> on<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.210> stretch<00:05:19.660> but

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
putting those adapters on a stretch but

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.159 
putting those adapters on a stretch but
then<00:05:20.290> let's<00:05:20.500> take<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:21.720> through<00:05:22.720> a<00:05:22.750> little

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
then let's take it through a little

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.500 
then let's take it through a little
rotation<00:05:24.630> up<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:25.960> away<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:28.060> from<00:05:28.360> different

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
rotation up and away and from different

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.790 
rotation up and away and from different
postures

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
postures

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:39.730 
postures
little<00:05:30.009> bit<00:05:30.159> forward<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:34.360> mesh<00:05:34.659> tall

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.330 

let's<00:05:40.310> work<00:05:40.520> those<00:05:40.759> different<00:05:41.569> angles<00:05:42.340> call

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
let's work those different angles call

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.850 
let's work those different angles call
this<00:05:43.490> a<00:05:43.669> side<00:05:43.970> plate<00:05:44.360> pull<00:05:44.660> so<00:05:45.380> I<00:05:45.440> just<00:05:45.590> put<00:05:45.830> a

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
this a side plate pull so I just put a

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.460 
this a side plate pull so I just put a
plate<00:05:46.160> on<00:05:46.190> a<00:05:46.370> towel<00:05:46.729> and<00:05:47.090> then<00:05:47.870> I<00:05:47.930> pull<00:05:48.319> it

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
plate on a towel and then I pull it

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.460 
plate on a towel and then I pull it
toward<00:05:48.830> me<00:05:49.039> feet<00:05:49.280> together<00:05:49.520> take<00:05:50.330> a<00:05:50.360> step<00:05:50.780> pull

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
toward me feet together take a step pull

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.830 
toward me feet together take a step pull
it<00:05:51.590> toward<00:05:51.889> me<00:05:52.099> feet<00:05:52.699> together<00:05:52.910> take<00:05:53.720> your

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
it toward me feet together take your

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.719 
it toward me feet together take your
step<00:05:54.139> pull<00:05:54.440> it<00:05:54.560> toward<00:05:54.800> my<00:05:54.889> feet<00:05:55.099> together<00:05:55.250> and

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
step pull it toward my feet together and

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.749 
step pull it toward my feet together and
I'll<00:05:56.000> do<00:05:56.120> about<00:05:56.330> 10<00:05:56.690> in<00:05:57.229> each<00:05:57.560> direction<00:05:57.889> so

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
I'll do about 10 in each direction so

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.029 
I'll do about 10 in each direction so
it's<00:05:58.880> a<00:05:58.940> nice<00:05:59.090> clothes<00:05:59.449> kinetic<00:05:59.960> chain<00:05:59.990> way<00:06:00.979> to

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
it's a nice clothes kinetic chain way to

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.230 
it's a nice clothes kinetic chain way to
our<00:06:01.729> word<00:06:02.060> goes<00:06:02.330> I<00:06:03.130> doctors<00:06:04.130> have<00:06:04.789> to<00:06:04.970> keep<00:06:05.150> a

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
our word goes I doctors have to keep a

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.969 
our word goes I doctors have to keep a
little<00:06:05.389> bit<00:06:05.599> of<00:06:05.630> pressure<00:06:05.900> down<00:06:06.289> on<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.740> towel

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
little bit of pressure down on the towel

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:09.969 
little bit of pressure down on the towel
as<00:06:07.370> you<00:06:08.270> draw<00:06:08.539> together<00:06:08.810> I<00:06:09.289> use<00:06:09.740> with<00:06:09.919> my

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
as you draw together I use with my

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.040 
as you draw together I use with my
hockey<00:06:10.310> players<00:06:10.669> in<00:06:10.940> the<00:06:11.030> summer<00:06:11.270> and<00:06:11.690> it

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
hockey players in the summer and it

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.800 
hockey players in the summer and it
seems<00:06:12.289> to<00:06:13.120> give<00:06:14.120> them<00:06:14.270> a<00:06:14.330> different<00:06:14.479> type<00:06:14.780> of

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
seems to give them a different type of

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.540 
seems to give them a different type of
contraction<00:06:15.530> or<00:06:15.560> different<00:06:15.949> type<00:06:16.069> of<00:06:16.099> fatigue

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
contraction or different type of fatigue

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.270 
contraction or different type of fatigue
than<00:06:16.789> just<00:06:17.030> a<00:06:17.180> standing<00:06:17.659> cable<00:06:18.050> column<00:06:18.409> so<00:06:19.250> I

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
than just a standing cable column so I

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.129 
than just a standing cable column so I
think<00:06:19.430> it's<00:06:19.639> worthwhile<00:06:19.930> including<00:06:20.930> in<00:06:21.020> your

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
think it's worthwhile including in your
