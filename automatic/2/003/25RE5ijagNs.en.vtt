00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
will be another to follow about six

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.010 
will be another to follow about six
months<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.549> Riley<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.720> Riley

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
months from that so Riley because Riley

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.210 
months from that so Riley because Riley
is<00:01:07.140> younger<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.830> more<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
is younger is this more of a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
is younger is this more of a
middle-grade<00:01:08.790> book<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.689> readers

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
middle-grade book like what can readers

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.190 
middle-grade book like what can readers
expect<00:01:10.880> Riley's<00:01:11.880> 12<00:01:12.210> years<00:01:12.420> old<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
expect Riley's 12 years old so it is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.170 
expect Riley's 12 years old so it is
geared<00:01:13.650> somewhat<00:01:14.159> towards<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.640> younger<00:01:14.760> reader

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
geared somewhat towards a younger reader

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.570 
geared somewhat towards a younger reader
but<00:01:15.689> i<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.110> readers<00:01:16.680> at<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> immortal

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
but i think that readers at the immortal

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.370 
but i think that readers at the immortal
series<00:01:18.060> will<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.659> able<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.960> jump<00:01:19.200> right

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
series will just be able to jump right

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
series will just be able to jump right
into<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> enjoy<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.640> well<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.270> don't

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
into it and enjoy it as well I don't

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.719 
into it and enjoy it as well I don't
think<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.590> specific<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.460> younger

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
think it's so specific to a younger

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.280 
think it's so specific to a younger
reader<00:01:24.030> other<00:01:24.299> than<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> fact<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> Riley's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
reader other than the fact that Riley's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.520 
reader other than the fact that Riley's
12<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.610> I'm<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.900> new<00:01:28.080> dart
