carbon<00:00:17.650> is<00:00:17.830> everywhere<00:00:18.460> in<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:18.820> ecosystem

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.540 
carbon is everywhere in the ecosystem

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.280

of years but the rest moves around the

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.320 
of years but the rest moves around the
ecosystem<00:01:20.710> from<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.039> air<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.640> plants<00:01:22.030> to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
ecosystem from the air to plants to

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.590 
ecosystem from the air to plants to
animals<00:01:22.479> and<00:01:22.960> back<00:01:23.470> into<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.770> atmosphere<00:01:23.950> and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
animals and back into the atmosphere and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.399 
animals and back into the atmosphere and
that's<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.899> story<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.649> carbon<00:01:26.950> cycle

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.649 

well<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:33.640> was<00:01:34.530> until<00:01:35.530> we<00:01:35.560> came<00:01:35.890> along<00:01:36.659> we've

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
well it was until we came along we've

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.960 
well it was until we came along we've
been<00:01:37.899> cutting<00:01:38.200> down<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.409> lot<00:01:38.830> of<00:01:38.979> forests<00:01:39.520> that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
been cutting down a lot of forests that

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.309 
been cutting down a lot of forests that
used<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.300> absorb<00:01:40.630> carbon<00:01:40.899> from<00:01:41.259> the

used to absorb carbon from the

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.639 
used to absorb carbon from the
atmosphere<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:42.960> we've<00:01:43.960> been<00:01:44.200> digging<00:01:44.409> up

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
atmosphere and we've been digging up

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.010 
atmosphere and we've been digging up
carbon<00:01:45.069> from<00:01:45.280> deep<00:01:45.460> underground<00:01:45.819> and<00:01:46.330> burning

carbon from deep underground and burning

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.100 
carbon from deep underground and burning
it<00:01:47.140> for<00:01:47.319> energy<00:01:47.649> doing<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:48.909> pumps<00:01:49.659> that<00:01:49.840> old
