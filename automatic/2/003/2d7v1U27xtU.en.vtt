optional<00:01:28.560> range<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.070> 18<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> 22<00:01:29.939> pounds<00:01:30.299> where

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
optional range of 18 to 22 pounds where

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.399 
optional range of 18 to 22 pounds where
it<00:01:30.900> depends<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.380> how<00:01:31.560> tall<00:01:31.829> your<00:01:32.040> child<00:01:32.369> is

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
it depends on how tall your child is

it depends on how tall your child is
there<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.560> 12<00:01:34.920> harness<00:01:35.430> lock<00:01:35.729> positions<00:01:36.329> it's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
there are 12 harness lock positions it's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.350 
there are 12 harness lock positions it's
a<00:01:37.229> movable<00:01:37.770> headrest<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> harness

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
a movable headrest that the harness

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.380 
a movable headrest that the harness
attaches<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.380> okay<00:01:40.770> right<00:01:40.979> now<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.939> attached

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
attaches to okay right now it's attached

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.679 
attaches to okay right now it's attached
through<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> tiny<00:01:43.140> bit

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
through the tiny bit

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:44.849 
through the tiny bit
so<00:01:43.840> you're<00:01:43.990> not<00:01:44.079> going<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.289> see<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.530> harness

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
so you're not going to see the harness

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:46.830 
so you're not going to see the harness
moving<00:01:45.159> up<00:01:45.249> and<00:01:45.399> down<00:01:45.490> but<00:01:45.819> there's<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.450> simple

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
moving up and down but there's a simple

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.359 
moving up and down but there's a simple
handle<00:01:47.170> on<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.409> back<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:47.950> head<00:01:48.130> wings

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
handle on the back of the head wings

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.120 
handle on the back of the head wings
moves<00:01:49.359> the<00:01:49.569> harness<00:01:49.929> up<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.409> down<00:01:50.560> for<00:01:50.890> proper

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
moves the harness up and down for proper

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.609 
moves the harness up and down for proper
position<00:01:51.700> those<00:01:52.479> harness<00:01:52.869> slots<00:01:52.960> are<00:01:53.259> about

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
position those harness slots are about

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.919 
position those harness slots are about
an<00:01:53.829> inch<00:01:54.100> apart<00:01:54.280> so<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.299> makes<00:01:55.509> for<00:01:55.630> great

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
an inch apart so it makes for great

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.039 
an inch apart so it makes for great
positioning<00:01:56.679> right<00:01:57.219> where<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.520> need<00:01:57.729> it

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
positioning right where you need it
