00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.690
 how about space friends gamer here 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.630
 we are once again with a trick of 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.110
 immortality in what it consists 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.180
 we're going to be in this tunnel that happens 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.350
 before attacking an attack station 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.189
 band in which therefore the game has 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:34.640
 an error that leaves you immune to any 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:37.840
 type of damage either indestructible the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.180
 Exact location is this 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.850
 we go to this location we hope between 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.560
 8 and 9 at night now gta 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.060
 we can see it on the cell phone and 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.410
 we started what we have to do is 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.410
 enter with our partner in the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.960
 vehicle 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.390
 our partner will have to come down 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.390
 of the vehicle and kill a few 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.680
 and these young people of the band 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.580
 what we have to do is follow it and 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.570
 once they kill our partner 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.120
 we have to let them kill us 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.300
 us this will activate the book and 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.250
 we will send as dead we already 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.740
 The last thing we have to do is when 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.530
 let the last person be the last 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.120
 enter the vehicle and when we go 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.560
 entering explode the c4 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.360
 and that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.360
 to be immortal 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:38.090
 two things about it I get this 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.130
 of mission overcome attack bandit that to 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.869
 the person who comes out that is not the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.970
 true immortal but to the person 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.780
 who does not get through one of the all 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.970
 you will not leave them would play it 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.770
 will guide the map will not appear 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.369
 blue or light blue icons 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.009
 and the map will start flashing red 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.350
 from time to time those are the signs of 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.119
 that she is the immortal person the other 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.939
 character also that immortal but must 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.429
 be for some kind of game book in 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.830
 that both are immortal but if you go 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.739
 appointment of a multiplayer session with 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.170
 more people to the person who has these 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.720
 conditions that appear to them 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.250
 soul dad icons for that is the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.129
 true person who is immortal the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.459
 another character can kill him and good 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.849
 here you can see that I am in the vehicle 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.510
 my partner gets off and he's going to start me 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.510
 put a c 4 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.819
 345 c4 and will explode them and nothing will happen 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.620
 I'm 100% immortal the problem is that 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.019
 when I get under the car it is not immortal 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.760
 then clear it can be destroyed 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.629
 only you if you are inside the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.129
 vehicle will be immortal the vehicle and if 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.890
 is that you are not inside the vehicle 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.489
 It will be immortal and you can destroy it 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.379
 Now I want to show you what I say 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.500
 but they also remain immortal in this 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.550
 I feel that he who sees us logical 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.880
 not on the map and it has 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.700
 the one that flashes on the map with a 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.730
 red flashing here I'm going to bring you a 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.310
 cairn 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.530
 such 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.530
 as you see, the car destroys us 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.230
 back to your case 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.159
 and as you can see , the vehicle is not destroyed and 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:37.629
 It really is a great gray easy to make 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:40.030
 what will be quite clear to you 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.370
 Learn your classmates 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.500
 here I am a multiplayer session and 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.080
 As you can see they were there that they could not 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.230
 kill that only my car 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.330
 partner as a ramp and I stayed here 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.880
 caught but what happened they threw me 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.270
 a bomb and of course the car is 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:02.820
 invincible these two people died 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.380
 it shows that it works well and what else 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.600
 say that as you can see here they can not 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.840
 shoot but if it happens to me that I 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.700
 can run over me like I was 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.430
 who says peaceful mode but I can 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.590
 get the gun and kill people what 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.320
 it does not stop killing people to the best 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.190
 is not there for iglic marching because 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.110
 apparently it was working to kill people 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.190
 but unfortunately not me I have been 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.220
 worked for you can you 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.740
 work as they see the map blinks not 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.880
 I see logical I do not only see the points 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.160
 that my auto and logical not blank that 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.780
 are the players and I do not expect anything 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.360
 have liked it and then do it 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.440
 Any questions you have tell me the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.330
 let me know that I can put the steps in 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.430
 step by step labels so that you 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.390
 nothing easier and we are on a 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.390
