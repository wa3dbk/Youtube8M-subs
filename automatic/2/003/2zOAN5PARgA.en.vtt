00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
use your single padded plier grab it

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.140 
use your single padded plier grab it
right<00:03:15.340> there<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:16.990> bend<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.410> temple<00:03:17.830> out

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
right there and you bend the temple out

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.300 
right there and you bend the temple out
that's<00:03:19.150> increasing<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.930> temple<00:03:20.290> spread<00:03:20.560> or

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
that's increasing the temple spread or

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.690 
that's increasing the temple spread or
bend<00:03:21.580> it<00:03:21.670> in<00:03:21.880> is<00:03:22.120> decreasing<00:03:23.010> okay<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.610> you

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
bend it in is decreasing okay so you

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.010 
bend it in is decreasing okay so you
want<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.970> make<00:03:25.120> sure<00:03:25.360> that<00:03:25.510> it's<00:03:25.660> parallel

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
want to make sure that it's parallel

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.770 
want to make sure that it's parallel
both<00:03:26.890> sides<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.880> side<00:03:28.090> needs<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.510> come<00:03:28.660> out

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
both sides so the side needs to come out

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.010 
both sides so the side needs to come out
a<00:03:28.840> little<00:03:29.050> bit

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.600 

okay

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.640 

you

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.900 

temple<00:03:43.650> needs<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.980> be<00:03:44.100> straight<00:03:44.460> you<00:03:44.730> don't

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
temple needs to be straight you don't

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.450 
temple needs to be straight you don't
want<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.150> curved<00:03:45.630> or<00:03:45.930> bowed<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:47.040> if<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.310> have

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
want it curved or bowed so if you have

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.840 
want it curved or bowed so if you have
like<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:48.500> contour<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.710> need<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:49.950> check<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.700> make

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
like a contour you need to check to make

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.640 
like a contour you need to check to make
sure<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.240> that's<00:03:51.390> nice<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:51.960> straight<00:03:52.260> going

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
sure that that's nice and straight going

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.900 
sure that that's nice and straight going
all<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.890> way<00:03:52.920> down<00:03:53.190> until<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:54.150> template<00:03:54.510> tip

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.070 

you're<00:04:01.450> panis<00:04:01.840> copic<00:04:02.260> angle<00:04:02.740> is<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:04.080> temple

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
you're panis copic angle is the temple

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.500 
you're panis copic angle is the temple
with<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.440> frame<00:04:05.800> front<00:04:06.130> there<00:04:06.940> should<00:04:07.270> be<00:04:07.480> a

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
with the frame front there should be a

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.770 
with the frame front there should be a
slight<00:04:08.080> dip<00:04:08.850> where<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:09.970> bottom<00:04:10.240> of<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.420> iyr

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
slight dip where the bottom of the iyr

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.650 
slight dip where the bottom of the iyr
is<00:04:11.050> closer<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.770> face<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.400> top<00:04:12.660> all

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
is closer to the face and the top all

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.150 
is closer to the face and the top all
right<00:04:13.870> so<00:04:14.050> you<00:04:14.110> want<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.320> check<00:04:14.470> that<00:04:14.500> from<00:04:14.950> one

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
right so you want to check that from one

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.720 
right so you want to check that from one
side<00:04:15.460> to<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.840> other

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.850 

with<00:04:38.630> your<00:04:38.780> wide-angle<00:04:39.289> player

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.300 

the<00:04:45.759> other<00:04:45.909> way<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.090> check<00:04:49.710> is<00:04:50.710> four-point

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
the other way to check is four-point

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.020 
the other way to check is four-point
touch<00:04:51.580> you<00:04:52.240> can<00:04:52.419> see<00:04:53.099> the<00:04:54.099> sides<00:04:54.370> not<00:04:54.550> touching

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
touch you can see the sides not touching

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.240 
touch you can see the sides not touching
so<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.020> can<00:04:56.110> either<00:04:56.199> bring<00:04:56.409> this<00:04:56.590> one<00:04:56.770> up<00:04:56.800> or

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
so you can either bring this one up or

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.690 
so you can either bring this one up or
that<00:04:57.370> one<00:04:57.580> down

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:10.420 

I'm<00:05:02.090> gonna<00:05:02.330> bring<00:05:02.630> this<00:05:02.810> one<00:05:03.080> up

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:20.519 

nicey-nice<00:05:11.430> four-point<00:05:11.970> touch<00:05:12.180> 1<00:05:12.419> 2<00:05:12.449> 3<00:05:12.990> 4

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:20.529 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.969 

is<00:05:21.369> that<00:05:21.699> you<00:05:21.909> have<00:05:22.179> a<00:05:22.599> nice<00:05:22.899> even<00:05:23.259> temple<00:05:23.739> fold

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
is that you have a nice even temple fold

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.249 
is that you have a nice even temple fold
so<00:05:24.339> when<00:05:24.489> you<00:05:24.639> close<00:05:24.909> the<00:05:25.179> temples<00:05:25.599> they

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
so when you close the temples they

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.949 
so when you close the temples they
should<00:05:26.559> cross<00:05:26.949> here<00:05:27.309> in<00:05:27.399> the<00:05:27.519> center<00:05:27.909> if<00:05:28.119> you

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:28.959 
should cross here in the center if you

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.689 
should cross here in the center if you
had<00:05:29.109> one<00:05:29.379> higher<00:05:29.679> or<00:05:30.039> lower<00:05:30.249> than<00:05:30.519> the<00:05:30.579> other

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
had one higher or lower than the other

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.989 
had one higher or lower than the other
then<00:05:31.089> that's<00:05:31.299> an<00:05:31.509> uneven<00:05:31.899> temple<00:05:32.199> fold<00:05:32.999> to

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:33.999 
then that's an uneven temple fold to

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:38.219 
then that's an uneven temple fold to
correct<00:05:34.509> that<00:05:36.209> can<00:05:37.209> you<00:05:37.359> use<00:05:37.539> your<00:05:37.569> wide-angle

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
correct that can you use your wide-angle

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.989 
correct that can you use your wide-angle
plier<00:05:38.469> you<00:05:38.979> close<00:05:39.459> your<00:05:39.669> temple<00:05:41.879> bracing<00:05:42.879> it

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:42.999 
plier you close your temple bracing it

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.869 
plier you close your temple bracing it
right<00:05:43.209> there<00:05:43.509> the<00:05:44.349> hinge<00:05:44.619> you<00:05:45.549> would<00:05:45.699> then

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:45.879 
right there the hinge you would then

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:52.180 
right there the hinge you would then
bend<00:05:46.179> the<00:05:46.359> temple<00:05:47.639> up<00:05:48.639> or<00:05:49.089> down

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.230
