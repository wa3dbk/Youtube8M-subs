 6 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.149
 yes 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:10.470
 yes 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.799
 yes 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.159
 salazar 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:18.169
 the Peruvian talent the code to see how it works 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.429
 the bitch lies in a league position 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.810
 I did not know him as pohtecktung 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.779
 pop etc tur 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 i percent that tool serves 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.789
 specifically to encourage you organic movement as a material 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.890
 static 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.150
 that we have in this case perfectly serves to animate 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.300
 this how we removed percent 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.330
 pretty much let's say comics are also made with presta 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.760
 technique 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.720
 cantona here we have that is to say comics does not even a paper nor and 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.720
 component other techniques fear having 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.880
 then this 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.760
 We can find this tool here because our top bar 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.590
 tamara mental location of all by the way and also with the apple pear 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.990
 She was selected 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.390
 select the resale 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.370
 2 percent which we have adequate charge points on axis 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.910
 d the equipment of our material 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.550
 then do not give an example do not let ecolo we want galego de chin 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.600
 the hand of arnao that the movement of the hand to go will be endorsed 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.440
 we have to place 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.909
 one percent 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.380
 a point to achieve it 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.009
 the leader's mayor directly when we created a point elena 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.250
 what here 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.009
 the beyond one possession and rome one already and training 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.950
 in training tells us what the hacker has directly created a 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.950
 Kirchner here 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.420
 In another point 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.650
 so that 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.890
 yes yes no when here 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.620
 by the way the or insane will create directly because I did but could 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.830
 stop is not enough just with every event power this one point you have to create 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.009
 more points 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.479
 that are as backup 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.849
 d in our team 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.579
 then this for example in the high jump in forest we simply want 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.439
 move this arm 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.239
 but what to place 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.239
 once here 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.929
 an axis 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.639
 as well 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.099
 2 axes laterally 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.869
 in mexico with all the action 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.869
 so that when modest 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:50.449
 I know that subject to the call missed the middle with the monitor or go away 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.239
 complete for fear that if for example we quit 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.449
 these points we would not give 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:01.009
 we do not want from support and good support if you feel and if we give this 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:06.959
 this then also as acceptable proved that he was following the selection to 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.129
 body but 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.669
 if we also remove this our event 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.929
 in which she loses everything 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.429
 all our league sense savings 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.459
 that is, they qualified those points that require 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.419
 fixed 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.340
 the movement will actually support the movement 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.939
 burned out 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.849
 osx 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.349
 that is, we have the first thing that you get out of 3 percent 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.319
 Hector Ibarra 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.319
 place mercy conacyt position 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.679
 above 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:51.639
 down to the center 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.639
 on the left 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.309
 for this one it makes zero repetitive motion like the case of 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.679
 in moving the flag 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.679
 on the one hand for another alvarado of 20 and copy it 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.329
 cliff in extra controls 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.129
 in the case of d 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.250
 that has to make the movements more complex and there's a big thing 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.550
 that they can do it 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.840
 we can 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.840
 give you more fluency not for this 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.580
 stocker and cecy franco aceves of keyframes be key 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.710
 but from another Spanish but I hope to see you 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.580
 And if it's not that way 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.229
 ekiza interpol edition 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.509
 not for what he did in attendance 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.549
 cinema and fashion the ufase not and when 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.050
 the product 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.110
 lion that looks like that 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.979
 Kirchner the moment 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.639
 marianico strangely 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.639
 crespo as a very mechanical act 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.189
 although then this is how you can use this tool to 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:07.509
 bit 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.969
 consistently resale let's 9 pts more complex 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.000
 we can encourage more of emiliano and create our own 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.050
 on the other hand 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.389
 for partners or let's say they have time 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.059
 and this but until certain 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.560
 yes I want this territory is an interpreter 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.969
 receiving a notification about the provincial north hill 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.000
 of comments to do science is doing well if they are attacked 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.650
 cooley 7 work percent plus if you want 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.650
 the lawyer and client if I'm still single 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.509
 but things that he does not understand cooke and after having left the car until the 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:47.860
 date photoshop 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.550
 ask me what it csn to embrace it with pleasure you can finish outside 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.619
 well I did not suspect greetings 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.710
