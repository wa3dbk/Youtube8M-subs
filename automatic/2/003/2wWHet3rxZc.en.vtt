00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
suggests it's got a lot of different

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.680 
suggests it's got a lot of different
features<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.039> here<00:00:17.369> it's<00:00:17.940> obviously<00:00:18.180> very

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
features in here it's obviously very

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.810 
features in here it's obviously very
lightweight<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:20.070> lot<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.340> features<00:00:20.520> have

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
lightweight a lot of the features have

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.790 
lightweight a lot of the features have
been<00:00:20.850> removed<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.449> provide<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:22.020> very<00:00:22.500> very

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
been removed to provide a very very

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.519 
been removed to provide a very very
flight<00:00:23.640> orientated<00:00:24.420> bag<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.439> obviously

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
flight orientated bag so it obviously

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.650 
flight orientated bag so it obviously
gives<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.070> maximum<00:00:26.580> amount<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.449> weight<00:00:27.630> that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
gives you maximum amount of weight that

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.359 
gives you maximum amount of weight that
you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.960> actually<00:00:28.080> put<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> bag<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.099> terms

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
you can actually put in the bag in terms

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.939 
you can actually put in the bag in terms
of<00:00:29.460> your<00:00:29.519> kit<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:31.230> things<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.740> the

of your kit so things like the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.910 
of your kit so things like the
telescopic<00:00:32.759> arm<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.450> been<00:00:33.600> removed<00:00:33.930> we

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
telescopic arm have been removed we

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.830 
telescopic arm have been removed we
shall<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.309> adds<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.579> lot<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.820> weight<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
shall see it adds a lot of weight to the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.319 
shall see it adds a lot of weight to the
structure<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> bag<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.760> remember

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
structure of the bag so you remember

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.040 
structure of the bag so you remember
some<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> features<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> outside

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
some of the features on the outside

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.700 
some of the features on the outside
first

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
first

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.970 
first
it<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> wheeled<00:00:42.090> bag<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.649> does<00:00:43.800> have

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
it is a wheeled bag so it does have

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.650 
it is a wheeled bag so it does have
large<00:00:44.280> truck<00:00:44.760> wheels<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> bottom

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
large truck wheels on the bottom

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
large truck wheels on the bottom
rubberized<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.530> well<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> good<00:00:47.430> grip

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
rubberized as well so get a good grip

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
rubberized as well so get a good grip
when<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.270> slippery<00:00:48.629> surfaces<00:00:49.020> through

when you have slippery surfaces through

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.189 
when you have slippery surfaces through
airports<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.160> around<00:00:50.489> Paul<00:00:50.969> or<00:00:51.390> improved<00:00:52.110> eye

airports or around Paul or improved eye
centers<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.800> might<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.280> wet<00:00:53.520> area<00:00:55.070> also

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
centers and might have a wet area also

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.660 
centers and might have a wet area also
got<00:00:56.340> skid<00:00:57.030> bars<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> base<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.680> bags

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
got skid bars on the base of the bags

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.849 
got skid bars on the base of the bags
that<00:00:59.789> also<00:01:00.000> prevents<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.719> actual<00:01:00.930> bag<00:01:01.140> from

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that also prevents the actual bag from

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
that also prevents the actual bag from
scuffing<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> lay<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> down<00:01:03.239> or<00:01:03.660> it's

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
scuffing up when you lay it down or it's

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.880 
scuffing up when you lay it down or it's
picked<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.199> at<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:06.590> whilst<00:01:07.590> we're<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
picked up at all whilst we're on the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.600 
picked up at all whilst we're on the
back<00:01:08.070> got<00:01:08.840> a<00:01:09.840> zip<00:01:10.080> top<00:01:10.260> arrow<00:01:10.650> at<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.920> top<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
back got a zip top arrow at the top and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.969 
back got a zip top arrow at the top and
this<00:01:11.820> houses<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.740> shoulder<00:01:13.740> straps<00:01:14.570> which

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
this houses the shoulder straps which

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.740 
this houses the shoulder straps which
fit<00:01:16.979> together<00:01:17.130> from<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.790> point<00:01:18.270> down<00:01:18.450> here

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
fit together from this point down here

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.130 
fit together from this point down here
so<00:01:19.530> their<00:01:19.680> quick-release<00:01:23.000> like<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so their quick-release like that and you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.780 
so their quick-release like that and you
can<00:01:25.259> obviously<00:01:25.530> adjust<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.130> shoulder<00:01:26.460> strap

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
can obviously adjust that shoulder strap

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.480 
can obviously adjust that shoulder strap
to<00:01:27.540> your<00:01:27.570> requirements<00:01:28.409> giving<00:01:29.009> them<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.220> more

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490

to your requirements giving them a more
comfortable<00:01:29.759> fit<00:01:30.320> over<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> shoulder<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.040> if

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
comfortable fit over the shoulder so if

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.830 
comfortable fit over the shoulder so if
you<00:01:32.579> need<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> carry<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.390> any<00:01:33.509> length<00:01:33.720> of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you need to carry it for any length of
