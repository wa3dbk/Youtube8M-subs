00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.809
 a real little one 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.280
 random designer because before the video 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.929
 I would like to say a couple of things well 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.400
 guys if the first thing is we have 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.740
 almost reached one thousand five hundred 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.330
 subscribers are really happy with 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.339
 this goal to say that two months ago 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.410
 we were still a thousand boys enrolled 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.810
 still believe that we have practically 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.400
 reached these 1500 members I hope that 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.960
 within two months reach or again the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.309
 2000 and writings I would be really very 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.629
 happy with this belief in this 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.090
 series you really like about old episodes 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.340
 a little over a month ago we even exceed 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.320
 very 120 and precisely for this reason that 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.149
 I want to buy a lot of this 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.129
 series even if the intention of well 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.649
 start an already another series maybe 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.239

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.260

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.000
 branded as you are seeing or 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.470
 started using shaders again because 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.270
 many of you have asked me to 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.130
 start making connected videos 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.200
 but there were also people to whom 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.060
 did maybe do it so I decided to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.950
 maybe making two viticultural charles is a 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.509
