 lemon city will not be a cake 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.640
 like all the others because it will be composed 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.420
 from three parts the base of pastry the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.340
 lemon cream and a cover cake 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.550
 the first thing to do is to prepare the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.680
 cream here it is I prepared it and it is 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.960
 still a little singing must finish by 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.100
 cool down 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.550
 so for the cream we will need 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.969
 250 ml of milk an egg 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.829
 sugar a tablespoon of cornstarch is 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.440
 the lemon peel 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.789
 the procedure for preparing the cream e 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.499
 I put this in a new pot 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.410
 cornstarch and sugar have 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:01.109
 mixed with the electric mixer 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.800
 then the peel is corporate to milk 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.470
 of lemon 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.380
 I put the saucepan on the stove ho 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.390
 bring to a boil and stir 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.380
 continue until the cream has turned out 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:18.090
 dedicated the cream should be prepared first 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.570
 so as to make it cool well now 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.710

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.840
 method 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.720

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.540
 mix all the ingredients 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.459
 putting them in a jolie amalgam with one 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.459
 electric mixer less still like 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.590
 a planetary or a triaxial vi 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.989
 remember you don't have to put the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.940
 yeast yeast will have to be put to the end 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.940

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:06.760
 yeast and continues to amalgamate ho 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.080
 got a cake pan from 24 worn out and in 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.620
 braking 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:16.060
 now I'm going to get the pastry he was 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.450
 to be placed over the pan and go 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.380
 to spend with the help of the fingers of 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.320
 hands 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:29.440
 I remind you that we must not put it 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.300
 only on the bottom but also on the edges then 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.200
 we must as I said we must roll out 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.620
 the pastry between and create a border a 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.530
 little flange like I did in this 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:48.180
 this in this case now we go to 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:50.410
 put the night cream in the center 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.270
 we must also leave some cream 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.270
 to make the decoration 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.060
 now let's go and put the cake of 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.060
 coverage 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.180
 now with the help of a sac Ã  poche 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.700
