00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
semester intro to computer science I

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.440 
semester intro to computer science I
wrote<00:00:26.020> a<00:00:26.050> program<00:00:26.890> to<00:00:27.220> play<00:00:27.369> tic-tac-toe

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
wrote a program to play tic-tac-toe

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.970 
wrote a program to play tic-tac-toe
and<00:00:28.750> he<00:00:28.840> was<00:00:28.960> pretty<00:00:29.170> humble<00:00:29.410> beginnings<00:00:29.830> I

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
and he was pretty humble beginnings I

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.950 
and he was pretty humble beginnings I
think<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.520> first<00:00:30.790> program<00:00:31.180> I<00:00:31.300> wrote<00:00:31.480> asks

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
think the first program I wrote asks

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.810 
think the first program I wrote asks
things<00:00:32.680> like<00:00:32.950> what's<00:00:33.220> your<00:00:33.340> favorite<00:00:33.610> color

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
things like what's your favorite color

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.360 
things like what's your favorite color
or<00:00:34.030> how<00:00:34.899> old<00:00:34.960> are<00:00:35.230> you<00:00:35.350> I<00:00:35.560> first<00:00:35.950> learned<00:00:36.190> how

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
or how old are you I first learned how

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.180 
or how old are you I first learned how
to<00:00:36.399> make<00:00:36.760> a<00:00:36.970> green<00:00:37.239> circle<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.960> a<00:00:38.230> red<00:00:38.890> square

appear on the screen the first time I

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.930 
appear on the screen the first time I
actually<00:00:41.680> had<00:00:41.920> something<00:00:42.370> come<00:00:42.520> up<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:42.760> say

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
actually had something come up and say

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.990 
actually had something come up and say
hello<00:00:43.300> world<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:44.290> it<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:44.980> made<00:00:45.160> a<00:00:45.190> computer<00:00:45.760> do

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
hello world and it I made a computer do

hello world and it I made a computer do
that<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.390> was<00:00:46.480> just<00:00:46.690> astonishing<00:00:46.929> learning<00:00:47.829> at

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
that it was just astonishing learning at

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.860 
that it was just astonishing learning at
a<00:00:47.920> program<00:00:48.100> didn't<00:00:48.429> start<00:00:48.640> off<00:00:48.730> as<00:00:48.969> wanting<00:00:49.690> to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
a program didn't start off as wanting to

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.979 
a program didn't start off as wanting to
learn<00:00:50.620> all<00:00:50.920> of<00:00:50.949> computer<00:00:51.399> science<00:00:51.969> or<00:00:52.179> or

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
learn all of computer science or or

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.569 
learn all of computer science or or
trying<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.350> master<00:00:53.739> this<00:00:53.920> discipline<00:00:54.429> or

anything<00:00:54.789> like<00:00:55.030> that<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.390> just<00:00:55.420> started<00:00:56.170> off

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
anything like that it just started off

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.110 
anything like that it just started off
because<00:00:56.410> I<00:00:56.559> wanted<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.800> do<00:00:56.949> this<00:00:57.609> one<00:00:57.879> simple

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
because I wanted to do this one simple

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.220 
because I wanted to do this one simple
thing<00:00:58.390> I<00:00:58.510> want<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.719> make<00:00:58.809> something<00:00:59.079> that<00:00:59.170> was

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
thing I want to make something that was

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.590 
thing I want to make something that was
fun<00:00:59.440> for<00:00:59.769> myself<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.399> my<00:01:00.699> sisters<00:01:01.089> and<00:01:01.120> I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
fun for myself and my sisters and I

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.840 
fun for myself and my sisters and I
wrote<00:01:02.019> this<00:01:02.170> little<00:01:02.320> program<00:01:02.620> then<00:01:03.399> basically

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
wrote this little program then basically

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.280 
wrote this little program then basically
just<00:01:03.999> add<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.239> little<00:01:04.420> bit<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.199> then

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
just add a little bit to it and then

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.930 
just add a little bit to it and then
wanted<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:05.740> learn<00:01:05.830> something<00:01:06.130> new<00:01:06.370> I<00:01:06.610> looked

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
wanted to learn something new I looked

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.340 
wanted to learn something new I looked
it<00:01:07.030> up<00:01:07.120> either<00:01:07.360> in<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.600> book<00:01:07.780> or<00:01:08.020> on<00:01:08.050> the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
it up either in a book or on the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.870 
it up either in a book or on the
internet<00:01:08.800> and<00:01:08.980> it<00:01:09.040> added<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.400> little<00:01:09.520> bit<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.850> it

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
internet and it added a little bit to it

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.790 
internet and it added a little bit to it
it's<00:01:10.210> really<00:01:10.330> not<00:01:10.750> unlike<00:01:10.960> kind<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.590> playing

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
it's really not unlike kind of playing

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.010 
it's really not unlike kind of playing
an<00:01:11.920> instrument<00:01:12.280> or<00:01:12.430> something<00:01:12.580> or<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.960> know

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
an instrument or something or you know

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.880 
an instrument or something or you know
or<00:01:14.140> playing<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.440> sport<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:17.380> starts<00:01:17.710> out<00:01:17.800> being

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
or playing a sport it starts out being

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.649 
or playing a sport it starts out being
very<00:01:18.159> intimidating<00:01:18.759> but<00:01:19.000> kind<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.509> get<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
very intimidating but kind of get the

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.170 
very intimidating but kind of get the
hang<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.899> it<00:01:20.020> over<00:01:20.200> time<00:01:20.610> coding<00:01:21.610> is<00:01:21.700> something

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
hang of it over time coding is something

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.870 
hang of it over time coding is something
that<00:01:22.329> can<00:01:22.450> be<00:01:22.600> learned<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.140> I<00:01:24.009> know<00:01:24.430> it<00:01:24.700> can<00:01:24.850> be

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
that can be learned and I know it can be

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.730 
that can be learned and I know it can be
intimidating<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.810> lot<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.290> things<00:01:26.530> are

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
intimidating a lot of things are

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.510 
intimidating a lot of things are
intimidating<00:01:27.460> but<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:29.320> know<00:01:29.470> what<00:01:29.890> isn't<00:01:30.130> a

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
intimidating but you know what isn't a

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.800 
intimidating but you know what isn't a
lot<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.969> coding<00:01:31.149> that<00:01:31.240> people<00:01:31.540> do<00:01:31.689> is

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
lot of the coding that people do is

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.950 
lot of the coding that people do is
actually<00:01:31.990> fairly<00:01:32.350> simple<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.850> it's<00:01:34.719> more

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
actually fairly simple it's it's more

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.270 
actually fairly simple it's it's more
about<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.380> process<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.829> breaking<00:01:36.070> down

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
about the process of breaking down

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.910 
about the process of breaking down
problems<00:01:36.909> then<00:01:37.180> you<00:01:38.049> know<00:01:38.140> sort<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.409> coming<00:01:38.799> up

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
problems then you know sort of coming up

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.100 
problems then you know sort of coming up
with<00:01:38.950> complicated<00:01:39.939> algorithms<00:01:40.479> as<00:01:40.659> people

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
with complicated algorithms as people

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.300 
with complicated algorithms as people
traditionally<00:01:41.290> think<00:01:41.710> about<00:01:41.829> it<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:45.280> don't

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
traditionally think about it you don't

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.130 
traditionally think about it you don't
have<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.820> be<00:01:45.909> a<00:01:45.939> genius<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.570> know<00:01:46.750> how<00:01:46.899> to<00:01:46.960> code

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
have to be a genius to know how to code

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.590 
have to be a genius to know how to code
you<00:01:47.439> need<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.829> be<00:01:47.920> determined

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you need to be determined

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.929 
you need to be determined
addition/subtraction<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:51.310> that's<00:01:51.670> about

addition/subtraction that that's about

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.190 
addition/subtraction that that's about
it<00:01:52.119> should<00:01:52.630> probably<00:01:52.780> know<00:01:53.049> your
