and Roderick O'Connor and then he

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.960 
and Roderick O'Connor and then he
mentioned<00:01:07.799> Treasure<00:01:07.979> Beach<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.430> welded<00:01:08.790> me<00:01:08.939> I

four<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.820> he<00:01:11.880> might<00:01:12.090> stick<00:01:12.330> another<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.750> in

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
four and he might stick another one in

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
four and he might stick another one in
there<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> make<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> running<00:01:13.770> which<00:01:14.670> won't

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.490 
there to make the running which won't
harm<00:01:15.210> Carlton<00:01:15.540> House<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.229> they<00:01:16.320> can
