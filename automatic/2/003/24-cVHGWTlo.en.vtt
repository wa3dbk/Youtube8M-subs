six<00:00:25.560> my<00:00:25.859> son<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.220> almost<00:00:26.519> 5<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.810> still<00:00:28.109> has

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
six my son is almost 5 and it still has

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.500 
six my son is almost 5 and it still has
some<00:00:28.769> growing<00:00:29.189> room<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.480> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
some growing room so if you have a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.299 
some growing room so if you have a
taller<00:00:30.810> child<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.529> will<00:00:31.679> definitely<00:00:32.099> still

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
taller child this will definitely still

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.889 
taller child this will definitely still
fit<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.640> within<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.210> arms<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> legs

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
fit them within the arms and the legs

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.930 
fit them within the arms and the legs
it's<00:00:34.469> still<00:00:34.680> very<00:00:34.800> long<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it's still very long so if you have a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.130 
it's still very long so if you have a
shorter<00:00:36.270> kid<00:00:36.450> you're<00:00:36.690> probably<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
shorter kid you're probably going to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.690 
shorter kid you're probably going to
have<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.380> roll<00:00:37.860> them<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.340> little<00:00:38.579> bit

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
have to roll them up just a little bit

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.160 
have to roll them up just a little bit
which<00:00:38.850> isn't<00:00:39.059> too<00:00:39.480> big<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> deal<00:00:39.989> you'd

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
which isn't too big of a deal you'd

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.229 
which isn't too big of a deal you'd
rather<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.500> fit<00:00:40.770> big<00:00:41.010> then<00:00:41.430> too<00:00:41.730> small<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.180> I'll

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
rather it fit big then too small so I'll

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.520 
rather it fit big then too small so I'll
definitely<00:00:42.629> keep<00:00:42.809> them<00:00:42.930> warm<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.379> it's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
definitely keep them warm because it's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.840 
definitely keep them warm because it's
got<00:00:43.649> quite<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.860> bit<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.070> padding<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.460> there<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
got quite a bit of padding in there and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.010 
got quite a bit of padding in there and
then<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> back<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.879> velcro<00:00:48.020> snaps

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
then the back you have your velcro snaps

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.790 
then the back you have your velcro snaps
here<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.840> three<00:00:52.230> velcro<00:00:52.620> snaps<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.800> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
here so it's three velcro snaps and this

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
like this is going to be a little bit

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.090
