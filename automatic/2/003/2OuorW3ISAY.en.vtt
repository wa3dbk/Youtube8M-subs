we're looking at that even that's the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.960 
we're looking at that even that's the
discussion<00:02:10.770> that's<00:02:10.860> underway<00:02:11.250> now<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.819> how

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
discussion that's underway now just how

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.090 
discussion that's underway now just how
we<00:02:12.030> profile<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.959> investments<00:02:13.560> through<00:02:13.740> time

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
we profile the investments through time

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.800 
we profile the investments through time
so<00:02:14.459> we<00:02:14.640> balance<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.330> know<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> need<00:02:15.660> to

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
so we balance you know the need to

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.720 
so we balance you know the need to
improve<00:02:16.080> infrastructure<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:17.370> know<00:02:17.490> with<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
improve infrastructure you know with the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.670 
improve infrastructure you know with the
overall<00:02:18.150> physical<00:02:18.480> envelope<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.260> that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
overall physical envelope that that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.710 
overall physical envelope that that
we've<00:02:19.830> got<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.459> normal<00:02:20.910> process<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
we've got so it's the normal process of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.780 
we've got so it's the normal process of
trying<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.500> determine<00:02:23.100> what<00:02:23.280> our<00:02:23.310> priorities
