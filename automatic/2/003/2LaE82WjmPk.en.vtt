couple<00:02:08.009> years<00:02:08.250> ago<00:02:08.489> as<00:02:08.729> well<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.660> is

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
couple years ago as well but this is

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.210 
couple years ago as well but this is
really<00:02:09.899> important<00:02:10.470> because<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.800> size<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
really important because the size of the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.270 
really important because the size of the

this<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:27.880> stuff<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.240> Lebel<00:02:28.780> did<00:02:29.380> not<00:02:29.530> have

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
this is stuff that Lebel did not have

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.949 
this is stuff that Lebel did not have

here's<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.300> other<00:02:34.390> cool<00:02:34.630> thing<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.870> King

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
here's the other cool thing that King

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.240 
here's the other cool thing that King
told<00:02:35.319> us<00:02:35.500> he<00:02:35.650> said<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:35.890> they<00:02:35.980> have<00:02:36.130> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
told us he said that they have the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.949 
told us he said that they have the
ability<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.730> flip<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.270> switch<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.630> record

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
ability to flip a switch and record

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.900 
ability to flip a switch and record
every<00:02:38.200> time<00:02:38.230> someone<00:02:38.890> dies<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.700> gives

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
every time someone dies so this gives

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.699 
every time someone dies so this gives
them<00:02:40.030> data<00:02:40.330> on<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.720> lot<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.140> these<00:02:41.350> my<00:02:41.530> new

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
them data on a lot of these my new

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.930 
them data on a lot of these my new
details<00:02:42.130> such<00:02:42.280> as<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.520> distance<00:02:42.819> between

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
details such as the distance between

whether<00:02:48.850> they<00:02:49.000> were<00:02:49.060> aiming<00:02:49.300> using<00:02:49.660> new<00:02:49.780> smart

whether they were aiming using new smart
link<00:02:50.620> system<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.280> on<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.239> really

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
link system and so on and this is really

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.600 
link system and so on and this is really
important<00:02:52.900> because<00:02:52.989> they<00:02:53.500> use<00:02:53.830> all<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.489> this

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
important because they use all of this

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.280 
important because they use all of this
information<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.390> aggregate<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.019> make<00:02:56.170> the

information in aggregate to make the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.400 
information in aggregate to make the
game<00:02:56.500> balanced<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.489> fair<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.269> here's<00:02:59.170> the

game balanced and fair and here's the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.470 
game balanced and fair and here's the
crux<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.830> argument<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.519> need<00:03:00.700> people<00:03:01.239> to

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
crux of the argument you need people to

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.479 
crux of the argument you need people to

do this online if they're playing on a

do this online if they're playing on a
machine<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.660> know<00:03:04.750> with<00:03:04.930> friends<00:03:05.410> head<00:03:06.250> to

machine you know with friends head to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.530 
machine you know with friends head to
head<00:03:06.610> but<00:03:06.819> it's<00:03:06.940> not<00:03:07.060> connected<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.480> the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
head but it's not connected to the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.449 
head but it's not connected to the
Internet<00:03:07.930> then<00:03:08.260> 343<00:03:08.950> doesn't<00:03:09.280> get<00:03:09.370> the

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
Internet then 343 doesn't get the

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.830 
Internet then 343 doesn't get the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
information that they need to make the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.750 
information that they need to make the
game<00:03:10.989> more<00:03:11.019> balanced<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.739> overtime<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.610> see<00:03:12.730> a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
game more balanced to overtime you see a

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.120 
game more balanced to overtime you see a
