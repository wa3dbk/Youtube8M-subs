00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.890
 that one there now in heaven I go 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:42.900
 to deposit a little of the pigment and 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:51.209
 Mix it with the intention of 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:57.650
 make it strong, only a shadow can 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.650
 see that it's a merrequinha kind of okay 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.280
 How am I going to spend here on the green side? 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.220
 It's for you, if we're seeing well. 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:17.530
 because that elimination is better 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:18.670
 Um, I'm doing it, it's so more. 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.400

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.400
 You see the cut good night. 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.650
 how it is okay it gets more 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.980
 Sticky but creamy it's good 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.560

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:45.640
 Dae's pigment is and if the streets are well 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:47.530

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.730
 possible with the pink people I showed 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.520

 hobie 16 sell are all bevelled 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:13.840
 usually I use my own brush to 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:17.220
 mix with a pitcher and flavor and color 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.220
 from skin to people 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.480
 you give a good mix of water 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.700
 This is a good case. 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:45.130
 it looks like a blue skin color 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:46.660
 almost black oil like this brush 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.280

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:01.710
