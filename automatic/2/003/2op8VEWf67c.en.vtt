eight-six is the standard knob the OM

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.950 
eight-six is the standard knob the OM
one<00:00:15.049> it<00:00:16.049> really<00:00:16.230> fits<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.510> middle<00:00:18.810> of

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
your hand really grips the complete

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.720 
your hand really grips the complete
shift<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.539> know<00:00:27.660> as<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:28.830> from<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
shift to know as you can see from the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.569 
shift to know as you can see from the
wear<00:00:29.910> pattern<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.900> owner<00:00:31.140> now<00:00:31.579> most

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
wear pattern on the owner now most

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.150 
wear pattern on the owner now most
people<00:00:32.730> will<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.239> able<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.600> grip<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.160> fully

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
people will be able to grip it fully

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.569 
people will be able to grip it fully
with<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.480> most<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.050> their<00:00:37.200> hand<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:38.129> see<00:00:40.579> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
with the most of their hand you see the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.369 
with the most of their hand you see the
shifting<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.260> smooth<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:44.149> well<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.379> really

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
shifting is smooth and well I really

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.389 
shifting is smooth and well I really
like<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.219> feeling<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> OEM<00:00:48.210> now<00:00:48.420> your

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
like the the feeling of the OEM now your

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.900 
like the the feeling of the OEM now your
front<00:00:50.399> fingers<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.270> wrap<00:00:51.480> around<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
front fingers really wrap around the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
front fingers really wrap around the
around<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.360> front<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.850> no<00:00:57.739> much<00:00:58.739> like

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
around the front of the the no much like

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.660 
around the front of the the no much like
let's<00:00:59.850> say<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.570> improves<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:02.280> shaped

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
let's say it improves that that shaped

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.140 
let's say it improves that that shaped
the<00:01:02.879> feeling<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:04.140> pistol<00:01:04.739> grip<00:01:05.150> feeling

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the feeling like a pistol grip feeling

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.380 
the feeling like a pistol grip feeling
so<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.280> OEM<00:01:08.850> now<00:01:09.090> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
so I think that the the OEM now is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.490 
so I think that the the OEM now is
really<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.369> sweet<00:01:12.150> spot<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.750> people

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
really just in the sweet spot for people

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.690 
really just in the sweet spot for people
with<00:01:13.680> medium-sized<00:01:14.280> hands<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.740> for

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
with medium-sized hands you can see for

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.330 
with medium-sized hands you can see for
you<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.909> compare<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.840> your<00:01:18.990> own<00:01:19.140> hands<00:01:19.560> here

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you to compare with your own hands here

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.740 
you to compare with your own hands here
is<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.790> cigarette<00:01:21.630> lighter

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.370 

for<00:01:30.750> me<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.650> OEM<00:01:32.190> not<00:01:32.430> really<00:01:33.050> fits<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.230> bill

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
for me the OEM not really fits the bill

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.470 
for me the OEM not really fits the bill
I<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.520> no<00:01:35.730> now<00:01:36.090> let's<00:01:36.300> see

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
I really like this this no now let's see

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.110 
I really like this this no now let's see
the<00:01:36.660> TRD<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.370> is<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.610> leather-wrapped

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
the TRD one it is a leather-wrapped

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.120 
the TRD one it is a leather-wrapped
nerve<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.410> stitching<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:42.710> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> sides

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
nerve with stitching on the on the sides

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.850 
nerve with stitching on the on the sides
and<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> top<00:01:45.090> thing<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.660> this<00:01:46.380> gear<00:01:46.650> knob

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and on the top thing is this gear knob

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.270 
and on the top thing is this gear knob
original<00:01:47.430> comes<00:01:47.760> with<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.630> quick<00:01:49.320> shift<00:01:49.620> kits

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
original comes with the quick shift kits

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.470 
original comes with the quick shift kits
from<00:01:50.580> TR<00:01:50.880> D<00:01:51.440> which<00:01:52.440> will<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:53.010> quick<00:01:53.520> shift<00:01:53.760> will

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
from TR D which will a quick shift will

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.340 
from TR D which will a quick shift will
make<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:56.340> pivoting<00:01:56.850> distance<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.930> of

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
make the the pivoting distance of the of

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.280 
make the the pivoting distance of the of
the<00:01:58.590> gear<00:01:58.890> box<00:01:59.090> smaller<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.750> end<00:02:00.840> result<00:02:01.200> is

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the gear box smaller the end result is

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.870 
the gear box smaller the end result is
that<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.590> will<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.770> shorter<00:02:02.340> throws<00:02:02.640> like

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that you will have shorter throws like

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.310 
that you will have shorter throws like
for<00:02:03.030> example<00:02:03.120> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.720> that<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.080> throw

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
for example you can see that the throw

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.860 
for example you can see that the throw
on<00:02:04.620> this<00:02:04.920> standard<00:02:05.310> gear<00:02:05.550> box<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.120> really<00:02:06.630> big

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
on this standard gear box is really big

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.810 
on this standard gear box is really big
there<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> big<00:02:08.040> difference<00:02:08.430> between<00:02:08.550> this

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
there is a big difference between this

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.850 
there is a big difference between this
position<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.660> position<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:10.440> there<00:02:10.770> is

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
position and this position see there is

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.550 
position and this position see there is
a<00:02:10.890> big<00:02:11.160> angle<00:02:12.000> when<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.020> short<00:02:13.260> shift

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
a big angle when you have a short shift

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.290 
a big angle when you have a short shift
the<00:02:14.040> difference<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.820> will<00:02:15.120> shift

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
the difference is that you will shift

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.980 
the difference is that you will shift
only<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.370> for<00:02:17.370> example<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.690> will

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
only like this for example this will

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.930 
only like this for example this will
mean<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.800> instead<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.340> going<00:02:20.700> all<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> way

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
mean not instead of going all the way

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.650 
mean not instead of going all the way
like<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:22.650> from<00:02:23.100> third<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.090> fourth<00:02:24.360> for

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
like this but from third to fourth for

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.930 
like this but from third to fourth for
example<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:25.740> have<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> different<00:02:26.580> throw

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
example you will have a different throw

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.810 
example you will have a different throw
the<00:02:27.540> throw<00:02:27.840> will<00:02:27.990> be<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.310> like

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
the throw will be like this and like

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.490 
the throw will be like this and like
this<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.180> example<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.810> will<00:02:30.990> be<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.260> gear

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
this for example and it will be in gear

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.580 
this for example and it will be in gear
that's<00:02:31.860> how<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> short<00:02:32.700> shift<00:02:32.880> works<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.990> gear

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
that's how a short shift works this gear

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.180 
that's how a short shift works this gear
knob<00:02:34.800> since<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.459> weighted<00:02:36.360> because<00:02:37.190> there

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
knob since it is weighted because there

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.100 
knob since it is weighted because there
is<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:38.970> much<00:02:39.209> heavier<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.810> one<00:02:39.990> is

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
is a it's it's much heavier this one is

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.440 
is a it's it's much heavier this one is
much<00:02:40.290> heavier<00:02:40.470> than<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:41.190> one<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:42.000> feeling

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
much heavier than this one the feeling

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.660 
much heavier than this one the feeling
is<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.110> will<00:02:43.290> make<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.590> easier<00:02:44.010> for<00:02:44.190> you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
is that it will make it easier for you

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.610 
is that it will make it easier for you
to<00:02:44.700> throw<00:02:45.180> between<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.750> gears<00:02:46.020> because<00:02:46.380> of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
to throw between the gears because of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.830 
to throw between the gears because of
the<00:02:46.739> added<00:02:47.040> weight<00:02:47.220> because<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.060> weight<00:02:48.660> is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the added weight because the weight is

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.540 
the added weight because the weight is
on<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.739> end<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:51.330> shaft<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.550> this

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
on the on the end of the shaft and this

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.290 
on the on the end of the shaft and this
will<00:02:53.820> cause<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:56.190> there<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:57.270> a

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
will cause the the there is a like a

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.060 
will cause the the there is a like a
leveraging<00:02:58.140> effect<00:02:59.000> so<00:03:00.000> when<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.320> go<00:03:01.860> between

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
leveraging effect so when you go between

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.630 
leveraging effect so when you go between
the<00:03:02.340> shifts<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:03.300> will<00:03:03.540> propel<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.950> when

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
the shifts this will propel you when

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.330 
the shifts this will propel you when
going<00:03:06.110> from<00:03:07.110> third<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.410> fourth<00:03:07.709> for<00:03:07.950> example

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
going from third to fourth for example

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.880 
going from third to fourth for example
the<00:03:08.459> added<00:03:08.790> weight<00:03:08.970> will<00:03:09.750> make<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.440> easier<00:03:10.860> for

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
the added weight will make it easier for

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.890 
the added weight will make it easier for
you<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.310> throw<00:03:11.580> between<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.120> shifts<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
you to throw between the shifts the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.020 
you to throw between the shifts the
biggest<00:03:13.200> difference<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.250> size<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
biggest difference is the size of the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.810 
biggest difference is the size of the
know<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:16.050> knob<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.320> much<00:03:16.739> bigger<00:03:17.010> than<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
know this knob is much bigger than the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.100 
know this knob is much bigger than the
OEM<00:03:18.150> one<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:20.700> can<00:03:20.850> see<00:03:21.060> let's<00:03:21.600> see<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> shot

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
OEM one you can see let's see a shot

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.500 
OEM one you can see let's see a shot
here<00:03:22.290> for<00:03:22.500> comparison

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
here for comparison

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.930 
here for comparison
you<00:03:25.510> can<00:03:25.660> see<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.050> even<00:03:27.040> on<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.250> slimmest

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
you can see that even on the slimmest

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.100 
you can see that even on the slimmest
side<00:03:28.860> it's<00:03:29.860> really<00:03:30.490> much<00:03:30.670> bigger<00:03:30.880> than<00:03:31.750> the

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
side it's really much bigger than the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.740 
side it's really much bigger than the
slimmest<00:03:32.590> side<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:33.130> this<00:03:33.340> know<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:34.390> end

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
slimmest side of this know the end

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.650 
slimmest side of this know the end
result<00:03:34.930> is<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.350> it<00:03:35.560> reduces<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
result is that it reduces the the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.500 
result is that it reduces the the
feeling<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.560> that's<00:03:39.490> sort<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:39.970> pistol

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
feeling the the that's sort of a pistol

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.370 
feeling the the that's sort of a pistol
grip<00:03:40.540> like<00:03:40.960> feeling<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.980> get<00:03:42.160> when<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:43.380> when

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
grip like feeling you get when you when

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.250 
grip like feeling you get when you when
you<00:03:44.470> grab<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:44.740> knob<00:03:45.040> like<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.810> result<00:03:47.140> is

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
you grab the knob like so the result is

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.440 
you grab the knob like so the result is
a<00:03:47.320> less<00:03:47.950> feedback<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.820> need<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.240> bigger

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
a less feedback you need the bigger

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.400 
a less feedback you need the bigger
hands<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.560> have<00:03:50.800> a<00:03:50.830> good<00:03:51.780> feeling<00:03:52.780> with<00:03:53.170> this

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
hands to have a good feeling with this

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.340 
hands to have a good feeling with this
with<00:03:53.980> this<00:03:54.160> shift<00:03:54.400> knob<00:03:54.640> when<00:03:55.240> I<00:03:55.270> land<00:03:55.750> my<00:03:55.900> palm

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
with this shift knob when I land my palm

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.610 
with this shift knob when I land my palm
on<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:56.950> can<00:03:57.130> see<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:59.050> middle<00:03:59.410> the

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
on it you can see that the middle the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.710 
on it you can see that the middle the
place<00:03:59.830> where<00:04:00.100> where<00:04:00.370> my<00:04:00.580> where<00:04:01.060> my<00:04:01.209> palm<00:04:01.420> meets

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
the top of the gear knob is not not so

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.010 
the top of the gear knob is not not so
good<00:04:06.160> because<00:04:06.310> since<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.270> give<00:04:07.450> now<00:04:07.600> is<00:04:07.780> so

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
good because since the give now is so

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.570 
good because since the give now is so
large<00:04:08.850> can<00:04:09.850> see<00:04:10.000> from<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.300> top<00:04:10.510> also<00:04:11.580> since

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
much larger than the OEM one what the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.340 
much larger than the OEM one what the
end<00:04:18.760> result<00:04:19.090> is<00:04:19.209> that<00:04:19.359> when<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:19.750> shift<00:04:20.049> for

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
end result is that when you shift for

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.520 
end result is that when you shift for
example<00:04:20.859> from<00:04:21.990> for<00:04:22.990> example<00:04:23.290> you're<00:04:23.410> in

fifth you you end up pushing the gear

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.260 
fifth you you end up pushing the gear
knob<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.990> not<00:04:29.410> so<00:04:29.650> much<00:04:29.800> gripping<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.430> because

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
knob and not so much gripping it because

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.980 
knob and not so much gripping it because
the<00:04:31.450> gear<00:04:31.600> knob<00:04:31.720> is<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:32.080> large<00:04:33.480> so<00:04:34.480> after<00:04:34.750> some

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
the gear knob is so large so after some

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.409 
the gear knob is so large so after some
time<00:04:35.020> driving<00:04:35.830> around<00:04:36.070> with<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.520> TRD<00:04:36.850> one<00:04:37.210> I

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
time driving around with the TRD one I

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.650 
time driving around with the TRD one I
ended<00:04:38.110> up<00:04:38.290> removing<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.580> switching<00:04:40.510> back

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
ended up removing it and switching back

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.330 
ended up removing it and switching back
to<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.470> OEM<00:04:41.979> shift<00:04:42.400> knob<00:04:43.050> mainly<00:04:44.050> because<00:04:44.340> it

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
to the OEM shift knob mainly because it

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.840 
to the OEM shift knob mainly because it
