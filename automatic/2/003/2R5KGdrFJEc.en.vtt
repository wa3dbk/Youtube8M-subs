00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.390
 hello today we will learn the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.189
 famous horse very used in the blues 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.630
 but just before you start if you 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.429
 watch this video on youtube 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.439
 do not hesitate to take a look at 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.300
 battery on line.fr on which you 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.559
 find the pdf scores of 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.629
 rhythms that I propose in video 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.220
 also more and more information 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.620
 on the driver I have no time 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.149
 to approach here in video 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.620
 so the driver what is it 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.989
 it's a ternary rhythm a little 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.969
 particular ternary that means that 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.750
 each of his times is divided into three 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:54.259
 so that gives one and then two and then 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.720
 three and c is particular in the sense 

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:59.360
 where we will play that on the first and the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.070
 third subdivision of each time that 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:07.030
 give it huh and then little and then three 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.259
 and then 4 etc 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.229
 so we will start with the rhythm 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.000
 basic shuffle where we will play so on 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.979
 the snare drum and 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.009
 hihat and heating we go on the 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.570
 do on the hihat for good of 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.520
 to play we will start with the rhythm 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.780
 ternary we will play on each of 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.780
 subdivisions that will give that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:38.680
 and then we will remove the 2nd 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:41.020
 subdivision then the trick to play the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.479
 horse regularly is to give a 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.100
 shot in the void instead of playing the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:54.520
 second subdivision on Charleston 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:56.410
 it gives that go it's gone for the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.090
 first exercise play in a first 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:28.000
 time at 50 beats per minute then 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:28.840
 then at 100 beats per minute for 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.360
 the second exercise 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.850
 we will start from the first rhythm 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.799
 adding before each snare a 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.450
 bass drum on the third 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:59.140
 subdivision of present time 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:59.590
 that's what it gives for the third 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.570
 exercise 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.860
 we will start from the first rhythm but 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.130
 this time we will add the big 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:25.690
 checkout 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:26.680
 before each of the pro drums 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.750
 fourth exercise 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.350
 we will simply mix exercises 2 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.350
 and 3 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.050
