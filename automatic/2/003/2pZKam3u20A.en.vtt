afternoon all this is crafty coder with

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.940 
afternoon all this is crafty coder with
dual<00:00:04.339> sport<00:00:04.549> maps<00:00:04.790> I<00:00:05.000> wanted<00:00:05.299> to<00:00:05.450> show<00:00:05.930> off<00:00:06.109> the

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
dual sport maps I wanted to show off the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.690 
dual sport maps I wanted to show off the
latest<00:00:07.330> cockpit<00:00:08.650> version<00:00:09.650> here<00:00:10.100> I've<00:00:10.280> got<00:00:10.670> a

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
latest cockpit version here I've got a

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.300 
latest cockpit version here I've got a
new<00:00:11.120> otterbox<00:00:11.690> that<00:00:12.020> i've<00:00:12.170> been<00:00:12.860> testing<00:00:13.040> that

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.310 
new otterbox that i've been testing that

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.960 
new otterbox that i've been testing that
so<00:00:13.550> far<00:00:13.760> I<00:00:13.790> like<00:00:14.060> it<00:00:15.460> it's<00:00:16.460> pretty<00:00:16.760> durable

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
so far I like it it's pretty durable

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.730 
so far I like it it's pretty durable
it's<00:00:17.300> got<00:00:17.420> a<00:00:17.450> screen<00:00:17.960> cover<00:00:18.200> to<00:00:18.350> protect<00:00:18.470> from

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
it's got a screen cover to protect from

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.200 
it's got a screen cover to protect from
dust<00:00:19.070> it's<00:00:20.030> got<00:00:20.330> a<00:00:20.840> hard<00:00:21.350> box<00:00:21.620> and<00:00:22.130> then<00:00:23.060> it's

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
dust it's got a hard box and then it's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.850 
dust it's got a hard box and then it's
wrapped<00:00:23.420> around<00:00:23.510> by<00:00:23.780> this<00:00:23.930> rubberized<00:00:24.350> boot

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
wrapped around by this rubberized boot

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.230 
wrapped around by this rubberized boot
and<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:26.090> boot<00:00:26.270> slips<00:00:26.660> in<00:00:28.030> to<00:00:29.030> make<00:00:29.210> a

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
and the boot slips in to make a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.779 
and the boot slips in to make a
watertight<00:00:29.900> seal<00:00:30.110> well<00:00:30.800> not<00:00:31.010> watertight<00:00:31.340> but

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
watertight seal well not watertight but

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.740 
watertight seal well not watertight but
water<00:00:32.270> resistant<00:00:32.840> seal<00:00:33.050> I<00:00:34.540> wouldn't<00:00:35.540> want<00:00:35.690> to

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
water resistant seal I wouldn't want to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.750 
water resistant seal I wouldn't want to
submerge<00:00:36.110> this<00:00:36.380> thing<00:00:36.650> which<00:00:37.550> I've<00:00:37.730> been

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
submerge this thing which I've been

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.780 
submerge this thing which I've been
known<00:00:38.060> to<00:00:38.090> do<00:00:38.360> on<00:00:38.540> this<00:00:38.690> bike<00:00:38.750> but<00:00:39.700> short<00:00:40.700> of

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
known to do on this bike but short of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.420 
known to do on this bike but short of
that<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:40.970> think<00:00:41.239> it<00:00:41.329> will<00:00:41.450> be<00:00:41.630> just<00:00:41.870> fine

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
that I think it will be just fine

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.549 
that I think it will be just fine
nothing<00:00:43.430> that<00:00:43.610> a<00:00:43.640> plastic<00:00:44.060> bag<00:00:44.270> zip<00:00:45.230> tied<00:00:45.440> to

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
nothing that a plastic bag zip tied to

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:52.240 
nothing that a plastic bag zip tied to
the<00:00:45.680> top<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:46.070> it<00:00:47.079> wouldn't<00:00:48.079> fix<00:00:48.260> though<00:00:51.250> you

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
the top of it wouldn't fix though you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.410 
the top of it wouldn't fix though you
got<00:00:52.340> access<00:00:52.790> to<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:53.570> real<00:00:53.780> control<00:00:54.140> here<00:00:54.590> and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
got access to the real control here and

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.520 
got access to the real control here and
I<00:00:58.030> think<00:00:59.030> I'm<00:00:59.239> really<00:00:59.450> gonna<00:00:59.690> like<00:00:59.930> this<00:01:00.230> I

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
I think I'm really gonna like this I

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.619 
I think I'm really gonna like this I
need<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.579> get<00:01:01.730> out<00:01:01.879> on<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.120> trail<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:02.540> I'm

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
need to get out on the trail so I'm

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.539 
need to get out on the trail so I'm
gonna<00:01:02.750> give<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:02.899> another<00:01:03.079> shot<00:01:03.500> but<00:01:03.829> so<00:01:04.280> far<00:01:04.459> so

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
gonna give it another shot but so far so

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:05.669 
gonna give it another shot but so far so
good

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:05.679 
good

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:13.149 
good
turn<00:01:06.679> it<00:01:06.829> up<00:01:07.899> bikes<00:01:08.899> on<00:01:11.530> remote<00:01:12.530> turns<00:01:12.829> on<00:01:13.009> the

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
turn it up bikes on remote turns on the

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.230 
turn it up bikes on remote turns on the
app

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.050 

living<00:01:20.240> on<00:01:20.360> screen<00:01:20.810> here<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:21.079> little<00:01:21.229> bit<00:01:22.060> kind

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
living on screen here a little bit kind

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.330 
living on screen here a little bit kind
of<00:01:23.119> shade<00:01:23.299> a<00:01:23.329> relief<00:01:23.659> map<00:01:23.899> on

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.280 

zoom<00:01:31.270> in<00:01:31.540> a<00:01:31.570> tad

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.480 

adjust<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.490> MV<00:01:38.390> um<00:01:38.720> on<00:01:39.050> and<00:01:39.620> off<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:40.160> is<00:01:40.340> all

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
adjust the MV um on and off this is all

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.660 
adjust the MV um on and off this is all
done<00:01:40.700> with<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.660> remote<00:01:42.050> by<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.320> way<00:01:45.550> which<00:01:46.550> I

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
done with the remote by the way which I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.380 
done with the remote by the way which I
think<00:01:46.850> you've<00:01:47.000> seen<00:01:47.240> before

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.860 

so<00:01:51.930> when<00:01:52.020> they're<00:01:52.140> out<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.470> trail<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.840> can

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
so when they're out on the trail you can

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.080 
so when they're out on the trail you can
do<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.290> pretty<00:01:55.440> easy<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.670> need<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.940> look

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
do that pretty easy if you need to look

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.980 
do that pretty easy if you need to look
around<00:01:57.240> some<00:01:58.040> look<00:01:59.040> where<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.370> going<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.810> use

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
around some look where you going you use

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:12.320 
around some look where you going you use
the<00:02:01.110> joystick

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.150 

these<00:02:12.840> are<00:02:12.990> a<00:02:13.020> little<00:02:13.320> bit<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.770> show<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> little

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
these are a little bit you show a little

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:42.809 
these are a little bit you show a little
perspective<00:02:15.320> not<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.470> maps<00:02:16.680> laid<00:02:16.980> up

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.460 

so<00:02:43.819> I'm<00:02:44.000> thinking<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.959> much<00:02:45.110> better<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
so I'm thinking this is much better the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.380 
so I'm thinking this is much better the
glare<00:02:45.769> is<00:02:45.950> not<00:02:46.159> nearly<00:02:46.400> as<00:02:46.580> bad<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:47.000> on<00:02:47.180> the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
glare is not nearly as bad is on the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.080 
glare is not nearly as bad is on the
aqua<00:02:47.690> box<00:02:47.900> yeah<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:49.069> not<00:02:49.220> as<00:02:49.340> watertight<00:02:49.610> but

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
aqua box yeah it's not as watertight but

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.410 
aqua box yeah it's not as watertight but
I<00:02:50.709> think<00:02:51.709> it's<00:02:51.860> a<00:02:51.980> pretty<00:02:52.519> good<00:02:52.849> compromise

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
I think it's a pretty good compromise

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.979 
I think it's a pretty good compromise
between<00:02:54.459> watertight<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.730> generating<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.810> lot

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
between watertight and generating a lot

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:57.580 
between watertight and generating a lot
of<00:02:57.019> heat

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
of heat

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.539 
of heat
well<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.549> doesn't<00:02:58.730> generate<00:02:59.120> heat<00:02:59.360> but<00:02:59.569> it

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
well it doesn't generate heat but it

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.220 
well it doesn't generate heat but it
conserves<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:01.790> actually<00:03:02.750> will<00:03:02.900> dim<00:03:03.110> the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
conserves it actually will dim the

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.720 
conserves it actually will dim the
screen<00:03:03.319> if<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.709> wait<00:03:03.860> too<00:03:04.010> long<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.459> aqua

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
screen if you wait too long in the aqua

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.550 
screen if you wait too long in the aqua
box<00:03:04.940> but<00:03:05.569> this<00:03:05.690> one<00:03:05.900> doesn't<00:03:06.349> have<00:03:06.470> that

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
box but this one doesn't have that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.990 
box but this one doesn't have that
problem<00:03:06.860> it's<00:03:07.099> got<00:03:07.220> venting<00:03:07.579> holes<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:07.909> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
problem it's got venting holes in the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.170 
problem it's got venting holes in the
back<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:09.579> it's<00:03:10.579> not<00:03:10.700> nearly<00:03:10.849> as<00:03:11.030> well

good<00:03:13.819> shock<00:03:14.120> resistance<00:03:14.690> but<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.859> don't<00:03:16.190> think

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
good shock resistance but I don't think

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.880 
good shock resistance but I don't think
I'd<00:03:16.459> want<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.700> test<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.150> losing<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.840> off<00:03:18.590> the

I'd want to test it losing that off the
bike<00:03:19.099> but<00:03:19.420> it's<00:03:20.420> well<00:03:22.329> that's<00:03:23.329> done<00:03:23.599> too<00:03:23.750> with
