00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
with the standard 20 minutes then you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.269 
with the standard 20 minutes then you
can<00:00:18.779> actually<00:00:19.260> set<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.529> for<00:00:19.800> longer<00:00:20.130> or

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
can actually set it for longer or

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.429 
can actually set it for longer or
shorter<00:00:20.689> now<00:00:21.689> I'm<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> go<00:00:22.109> ahead<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
shorter now I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.259

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
cheats on I'm going to go ahead and give

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.250 
cheats on I'm going to go ahead and give
myself

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.369 

item<00:01:01.260> number<00:01:01.559> 137<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.780> just<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:03.930> block<00:01:04.140> is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
item number 137 and just one block is

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.530 
item number 137 and just one block is
all<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.680> need<00:01:05.900> now<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.170> time<00:01:08.390> basically<00:01:09.390> all

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you need to do is set up a redstone

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.820 
you need to do is set up a redstone
timer<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.780> lead<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
timer here and have that lead to the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.609 
timer here and have that lead to the
command<00:01:14.189> block<00:01:14.570> now<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> command<00:01:16.110> block<00:01:16.350> just

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
command block now the command block just

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
command block now the command block just
needs<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:17.310> command<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.659> all

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
needs to have one command on it at all

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.359 
needs to have one command on it at all
and<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.700> add<00:01:20.850> time<00:01:21.860> command<00:01:22.860> time

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and that is the add time command time

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.539 
and that is the add time command time
add<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.680> set<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.100> based<00:01:26.430> on

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
add and here you have set it up based on

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.569 
add and here you have set it up based on
on<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:28.380> you're<00:01:28.590> looking<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.250> far<00:01:29.460> as

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
on on what you're looking for as far as

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.030 
on on what you're looking for as far as
how<00:01:29.700> fast<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.180> advance<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> time<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.170> said<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
how fast to advance the time I said it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.060 
how fast to advance the time I said it
for<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.170> way<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.650> adjust<00:01:34.950> my

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
for one and so this way I can adjust my

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.649 
for one and so this way I can adjust my
timers<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.860> go<00:01:38.070> about<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:39.090> committing<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
timers to to go about it's committing it

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.249 
timers to to go about it's committing it
faster<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.140> slower<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.829> need<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.070> now<00:01:41.479> as<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
faster or slower as I need it now as it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.370 
faster or slower as I need it now as it
is<00:01:43.409> right<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.520> timer<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.299> only<00:01:45.720> set<00:01:46.079> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
is right now this timer is only set to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.179 
is right now this timer is only set to
be<00:01:46.740> done<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.820> work<00:01:48.030> day<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.689> night<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
be done to work day and night if you

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.350 
be done to work day and night if you
would<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.729> some<00:01:51.000> kind<00:01:51.210> of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
would like to have some kind of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.749 
would like to have some kind of
variation<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.170> whether<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> longer

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
variation of that whether it be a longer

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.080 
variation of that whether it be a longer
date<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.840> night<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:55.409> night<00:01:55.740> than<00:01:56.070> day<00:01:56.340> then

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
date that night or night than day then

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.940 
date that night or night than day then
you<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.810> about<00:01:58.049> setting<00:01:58.500> adjust<00:01:58.829> in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
you have to go about setting adjust in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.800 
you have to go about setting adjust in
the<00:01:59.040> circuit<00:01:59.430> probably<00:01:59.850> with<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> use<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the circuit probably with the use of the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.959 
the circuit probably with the use of the
daylight<00:02:01.140> sensor<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.920> order<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.579> go<00:02:02.729> about

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
daylight sensor in order to go about
