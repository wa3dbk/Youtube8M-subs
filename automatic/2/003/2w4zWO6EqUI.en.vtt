 [music] 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:24.419
 hello everyone out in the fields today 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.520
 will test our tractor 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:37.840
 one run was not the other day just not 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:46.080
 it was possible to shoot probably 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:46.080
 interestingly our land cultivator 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:58.379
 cutters already hooked hatch buyante 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.600
 [music] 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.350
 [music] 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:27.869
 [music] 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:48.960
 [music] 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:25.450
 [music] 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.340
 [applause] 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.340
 [music] 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.849
 [applause] 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:40.749
 [music] 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.740
 [music] 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.709
 [music] 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.909
 I'm talking about 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.769
 [music] 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.399
 [music] 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.649
 so the general situation is such a machine 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.279
 the beast 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:22.580
 areas need it even more than 

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.580
 I have 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.289
 my 10 acres have nowhere to go 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.469
 I have enough light for such a land 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:37.699
 manages to cheer 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:42.360
 I tried knights well, in two passes 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:43.919
 quite depth 30 centimeters here in 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:50.419
 late tried 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:50.419
 pass between rows leaving only 2 cutters 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.479
 I probably don't have enough experience 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:07:00.270
 a little more or the ground is too soft 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:03.509
 Well , something he does not dig such a conclusion 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:06.599
 same world looking me narrow 50 centimeters 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:10.529
 it's too small for such a machine of the world 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:15.120
 although in 60-70 then it will be quietly comfortable 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:17.159
 The following releases will not work 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.979
 attachments which else 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:20.779
 all have to sign up for 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:23.779
 channel 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:23.779
 nutrition 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.239
 we 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.239
