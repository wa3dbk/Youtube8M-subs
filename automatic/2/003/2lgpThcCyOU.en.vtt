we<00:02:14.540> notice<00:02:14.930> that

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
we notice that

we're going to do if Jamie improves I
want<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.810> use<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> process<00:02:44.180> q4<00:02:45.590> mini-map<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
want to use a process q4 mini-map and

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.360 
want to use a process q4 mini-map and
HUD<00:02:47.070> indicators<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.880> encapsulate<00:02:49.370> one

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
HUD indicators and encapsulate one

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.520 
HUD indicators and encapsulate one
indicator<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.270> an<00:02:51.390> object<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:51.990> we<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.290> push

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
indicator in an object so we can push

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.710

them<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.860> queue<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.640> just<00:02:54.360> pop<00:02:54.570> them

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
them in a queue and and just pop them

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.449 
them in a queue and and just pop them
off<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.140> process<00:02:55.560> them<00:02:55.740> until<00:02:56.130> our<00:02:56.220> frame

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
off and process them until our frame

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.150 
off and process them until our frame
limits<00:02:56.820> reached<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.480> we'll<00:02:57.750> never<00:02:58.160> directly

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160

spike<00:02:59.720> in<00:03:00.720> those<00:03:00.959> systems<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:02.520> know<00:03:02.640> we'll

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
spike in those systems you know we'll

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.300 
spike in those systems you know we'll
just<00:03:03.260> distribute<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.290> processing<00:03:04.800> out<00:03:04.950> so

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
just distribute the processing out so

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.190 
just distribute the processing out so
far<00:03:05.550> behind<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.330> few<00:03:06.510> frames<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.990> state

management<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.770> really<00:03:07.860> not<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.130> huge<00:03:08.400> deal<00:03:09.020> so

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
management is really not a huge deal so

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.630 
management is really not a huge deal so
I'm<00:03:10.080> gonna<00:03:10.200> work<00:03:10.350> with<00:03:10.410> Chris<00:03:10.740> on<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.160> now

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
I'm gonna work with Chris on that now

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.910 
I'm gonna work with Chris on that now
our<00:03:11.940> next<00:03:12.000> step<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.900> take<00:03:13.170> those<00:03:13.530> spikes

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
our next step is to take those spikes

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.640 
our next step is to take those spikes
and<00:03:14.250> crush<00:03:15.180> them<00:03:15.450> down<00:03:15.600> make<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.140> graph<00:03:16.440> look

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
and crush them down make this graph look

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.410 
and crush them down make this graph look
more<00:03:16.890> organic<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.550> in<00:03:17.850> order<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.090> do<00:03:18.240> that

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
more organic and in order to do that

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.890 
more organic and in order to do that
what<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.959> have<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.350> do<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.800> create<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:21.030> cap<00:03:21.540> on<00:03:21.810> a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
what you have to do is create a cap on a

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.290 
what you have to do is create a cap on a
per<00:03:22.440> frame<00:03:22.650> basis<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> per<00:03:23.489> system<00:03:23.730> basis

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
per frame basis on a per system basis

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.120 
per frame basis on a per system basis
for<00:03:24.600> example<00:03:24.989> i'm<00:03:25.200> not<00:03:25.380> going<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.680> process

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
for example i'm not going to process

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.400 
for example i'm not going to process
more<00:03:26.310> than<00:03:26.489> 200<00:03:27.060> microseconds<00:03:27.810> for<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.290> Hutt

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
more than 200 microseconds for the Hutt

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.350 
more than 200 microseconds for the Hutt
indicator<00:03:28.800> system<00:03:29.190> no<00:03:29.430> matter<00:03:29.640> what<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.150> so

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
indicator system no matter what and so

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.250 
indicator system no matter what and so
once<00:03:30.660> we<00:03:30.840> implement<00:03:31.830> that<00:03:31.980> cap<00:03:32.280> then<00:03:33.180> we'll<00:03:33.989> be

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
once we implement that cap then we'll be

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.100 
once we implement that cap then we'll be
able<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.739> avoid<00:03:35.010> spikes<00:03:35.640> all<00:03:36.030> together<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:36.989> we

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
able to avoid spikes all together so we

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.290 
able to avoid spikes all together so we
have<00:03:37.230> right<00:03:37.380> now<00:03:37.489> we've<00:03:38.489> throttled<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.120> to

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
have right now we've throttled it to

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.880 
have right now we've throttled it to
evaluating<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.140> kind<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.380> requirements

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
evaluating the kind of requirements

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.920 
evaluating the kind of requirements
around<00:03:40.980> three<00:03:41.430> times<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.790> second<00:03:42.209> three<00:03:42.810> or

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
around three times a second three or

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.890 
around three times a second three or
four<00:03:43.080> times<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.940> well<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.120> helps<00:03:45.480> us<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.870> lot

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
four times and well that helps us a lot

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.340 
four times and well that helps us a lot
like<00:03:46.560> by<00:03:47.310> millisecond<00:03:47.970> 22<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.780> will<00:03:49.110> still

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
like by millisecond 22 it will still

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.560 
like by millisecond 22 it will still
spike<00:03:49.799> once<00:03:50.070> in<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.250> while<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.239> we<00:03:51.360> want<00:03:51.540> to

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
spike once in a while and so we want to

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.840 
spike once in a while and so we want to
