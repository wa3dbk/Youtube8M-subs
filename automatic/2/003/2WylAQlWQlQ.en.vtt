00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
was these are a little heavy but after

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
sound is really well it really really

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.300 
sound is really well it really really
gets<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:58.270> base<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.660> the<00:04:00.050> travel<00:04:00.620> down<00:04:00.890> really

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.360 
gets the base and the travel down really
well<00:04:01.460> but<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.300> only<00:04:02.510> thing<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:03.050> I<00:04:03.440> wish<00:04:03.830> it<00:04:04.100> was

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
well but the only thing is I wish it was

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.060 
well but the only thing is I wish it was
a<00:04:04.520> little<00:04:04.610> louder<00:04:05.240> I<00:04:05.570> really<00:04:06.200> do<00:04:06.320> I<00:04:06.350> just<00:04:06.800> wish

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
a little louder I really do I just wish

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.840 
a little louder I really do I just wish
it<00:04:07.280> was<00:04:07.550> louder<00:04:07.990> because<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:10.310> headsets<00:04:10.760> that

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
it was louder because the headsets that

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.740 
it was louder because the headsets that
i<00:04:11.000> use<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:11.690> have<00:04:12.650> used<00:04:13.010> for<00:04:13.670> many<00:04:13.880> months<00:04:14.510> now

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
i use and have used for many months now

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.060 
i use and have used for many months now
are<00:04:15.140> these<00:04:16.100> sony<00:04:17.000> headphones<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.590> i

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
are these sony headphones that i

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.180 
are these sony headphones that i
basically<00:04:19.520> just<00:04:19.640> used<00:04:20.000> for<00:04:20.299> my<00:04:20.480> ipod<00:04:20.930> and

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
basically just used for my ipod and

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.720 
basically just used for my ipod and
these<00:04:22.190> work<00:04:22.850> really<00:04:23.150> really<00:04:24.020> well<00:04:24.470> they<00:04:25.190> do

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
these work really really well they do

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.080 
these work really really well they do
not<00:04:25.910> get<00:04:26.420> as<00:04:26.660> much<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:28.040> bass<00:04:28.310> down<00:04:28.760> and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
not get as much of the bass down and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.950 
not get as much of the bass down and
travel<00:04:29.870> but<00:04:30.530> these<00:04:30.740> are<00:04:30.950> way<00:04:31.550> louder<00:04:32.330> than

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
travel but these are way louder than

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.670 
travel but these are way louder than
these<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:34.160> i<00:04:34.700> think<00:04:34.940> they<00:04:35.390> pick<00:04:35.660> up<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.229> drums

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
these and i think they pick up the drums

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.050 
these and i think they pick up the drums
better<00:04:37.860> than<00:04:38.699> these<00:04:38.940> actually<00:04:40.400> these<00:04:41.400> sounded

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
better than these actually these sounded

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.749 
better than these actually these sounded
like<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.240> surround<00:04:42.750> sound<00:04:42.930> effect<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.100> they

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
like a surround sound effect and they

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.360 
like a surround sound effect and they
definitely<00:04:45.210> got<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:46.050> bass<00:04:46.289> down<00:04:46.530> right<00:04:46.860> but

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
definitely got the bass down right but

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.029 
definitely got the bass down right but
for<00:04:47.610> me<00:04:47.759> I<00:04:47.970> really<00:04:48.720> don't<00:04:48.990> like<00:04:49.289> base<00:04:49.680> that

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
for me I really don't like base that

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.790 
for me I really don't like base that
much<00:04:50.280> at<00:04:50.610> all<00:04:51.180> I<00:04:51.570> have<00:04:51.720> always<00:04:52.020> have<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.560> like

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.689 
not a big fan of it at all these produce
louder<00:05:01.740> sound<00:05:02.220> and<00:05:02.539> higher<00:05:03.539> pitches<00:05:04.699> these

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
louder sound and higher pitches these

several calls and I asked people if they

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.170 
several calls and I asked people if they
could<00:05:36.810> hear<00:05:36.990> me<00:05:37.139> clear<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:38.370> they<00:05:38.699> said<00:05:38.940> yes

could hear me clear and they said yes
they<00:05:39.599> said<00:05:40.169> that<00:05:40.289> they<00:05:40.500> could<00:05:40.680> even<00:05:40.800> actually

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
they said that they could even actually

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.820 
they said that they could even actually
hear<00:05:41.580> me<00:05:41.729> better<00:05:42.000> than<00:05:42.240> my<00:05:42.510> home<00:05:43.050> phone<00:05:43.440> so

hear me better than my home phone so

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.740 
hear me better than my home phone so
that<00:05:43.860> was<00:05:44.159> actually<00:05:44.430> pretty<00:05:44.669> good<00:05:45.180> so<00:05:45.449> I'm<00:05:45.539> I

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
that was actually pretty good so I'm I

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.830

was<00:05:45.960> happy<00:05:46.260> with<00:05:46.380> that<00:05:46.849> so<00:05:47.849> overall<00:05:48.300> I<00:05:48.570> think

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
was happy with that so overall I think

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.379 
was happy with that so overall I think
this<00:05:49.169> is<00:05:49.349> a<00:05:49.380> really<00:05:50.250> good<00:05:50.550> headset<00:05:51.030> it's

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
like these headsets to do but these

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:08.899 
like these headsets to do but these
headsets<00:06:07.620> are<00:06:07.860> used<00:06:08.220> for<00:06:08.400> much<00:06:08.610> more<00:06:08.849> than

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
headsets are used for much more than

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.180 
headsets are used for much more than
just<00:06:09.090> listening<00:06:09.419> to<00:06:09.630> music<00:06:09.780> so<00:06:10.349> i<00:06:10.560> think<00:06:10.830> for

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
just listening to music so i think for

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.730 
just listening to music so i think for
the<00:06:11.280> money<00:06:11.520> they<00:06:11.880> are<00:06:12.060> very<00:06:12.360> good<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:12.930> it<00:06:13.560> does

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
the money they are very good and it does

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.439 
the money they are very good and it does
everything<00:06:14.130> that<00:06:14.310> you<00:06:14.580> would<00:06:14.699> want<00:06:15.000> a<00:06:15.090> headset

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
everything that you would want a headset

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.779 
everything that you would want a headset
to<00:06:15.659> do<00:06:15.810> and<00:06:16.110> it<00:06:16.199> does<00:06:16.380> it<00:06:16.530> really<00:06:16.919> well<00:06:17.220> so<00:06:17.759> I

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789 
to do and it does it really well so I

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.040 
to do and it does it really well so I
think<00:06:17.909> if<00:06:18.120> you<00:06:18.210> want<00:06:18.360> a<00:06:18.389> good<00:06:18.509> headset<00:06:18.900> for

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
think if you want a good headset for

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.379 
think if you want a good headset for
