this one is fully ranked out rank 5 05

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.319 
this one is fully ranked out rank 5 05
level<00:01:26.549> 50<00:01:27.030> or<00:01:27.119> 50<00:01:27.479> his<00:01:28.020> health<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:30.290> 15,000

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
level 50 or 50 his health is like 15,000

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.690 
level 50 or 50 his health is like 15,000
660<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> his<00:01:34.140> attack<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:36.710> 1140<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> pretty<00:01:38.310> high

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
660 and his attack is 1140 a pretty high

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.929 
660 and his attack is 1140 a pretty high
um<00:01:39.360> obviously<00:01:40.229> he's<00:01:40.590> not<00:01:40.770> awakened<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:41.850> you

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
um obviously he's not awakened so you

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.219 
um obviously he's not awakened so you
can<00:01:42.210> see<00:01:42.390> his<00:01:42.600> signature<00:01:43.439> ability<00:01:44.119> urgent

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
can see his signature ability urgent

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.020 
can see his signature ability urgent
refraction<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.680> think<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> same<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.759> an

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
refraction I think that's the same as an

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
refraction I think that's the same as an
o<00:01:48.119> Magnum<00:01:48.509> imagine<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:48.990> too<00:01:49.170> sure<00:01:49.439> sign<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.799> as

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
o Magnum imagine not too sure sign on as

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.030 
o Magnum imagine not too sure sign on as
you<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.159> his<00:01:50.909> abilities<00:01:51.479> are<00:01:51.780> bleed<00:01:52.140> level<00:01:52.710> 5

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
you know his abilities are bleed level 5

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.510 
you know his abilities are bleed level 5
he'll<00:01:53.850> block<00:01:54.270> level<00:01:54.570> 5<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.110> armor<00:01:55.619> break<00:01:55.950> our

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
he'll block level 5 and armor break our

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.609 
he'll block level 5 and armor break our
break<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.329> shadowed<00:01:57.780> out<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.200> no<00:01:58.320> level

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
break is like shadowed out with no level

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.249 
break is like shadowed out with no level
day<00:01:58.740> I'm<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.040> too<00:01:59.219> sure<00:01:59.460> why<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.259> his

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
day I'm not too sure why that is his

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.420 
day I'm not too sure why that is his
