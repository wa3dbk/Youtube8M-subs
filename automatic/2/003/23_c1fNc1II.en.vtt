character that type of thing can be

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.160 
character that type of thing can be
really<00:03:54.600> handy<00:03:56.630> autoformat<00:03:57.630> is<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.959> type

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
really handy autoformat is you type

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.170 
really handy autoformat is you type
again<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.620> couple<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.130> these<00:03:59.280> ones<00:03:59.579> are<00:03:59.849> things

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
again a couple of these ones are things

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.059 
again a couple of these ones are things
to<00:04:00.359> think<00:04:00.480> about<00:04:00.630> first<00:04:01.109> of<00:04:01.260> all<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.650> don't

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
to think about first of all I don't

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.720 
to think about first of all I don't
apply<00:04:02.700> automatic<00:04:03.299> anything<00:04:04.340> because<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.370> find

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
apply automatic anything because I find

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.699 
apply automatic anything because I find
that<00:04:05.849> if<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.120> does<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:06.480> automatically<00:04:07.109> then

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
that if it does it automatically then

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.979 
that if it does it automatically then
I'm<00:04:08.010> not<00:04:08.250> sure<00:04:08.910> what<00:04:09.180> word<00:04:09.329> is<00:04:09.450> doing<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.930> I

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
I'm not sure what word is doing and I

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.349 
I'm not sure what word is doing and I
want<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.290> be<00:04:10.410> in<00:04:10.680> control<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.579> turn<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.120> off

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
want to be in control so I turn that off

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.420 
want to be in control so I turn that off
so<00:04:13.669> the<00:04:14.669> exception<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:16.260> rule<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.799> the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
so the exception to that rule is the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.830 
so the exception to that rule is the
format<00:04:17.700> beginning<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.150> lists<00:04:18.419> like<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.690> one

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
format beginning of lists like the one

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.750 
format beginning of lists like the one
before<00:04:18.989> at<00:04:19.260> because<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:19.709> tend<00:04:20.039> to<00:04:20.130> use<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.340> style

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
before at because I tend to use a style

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.750 
before at because I tend to use a style
that<00:04:20.970> involves<00:04:21.530> bolding<00:04:22.530> before<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.520> period

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
that involves bolding before the period

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.430 
that involves bolding before the period
in<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.180> list<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.630> then<00:04:24.720> not<00:04:25.080> bolding

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
in a list and then not bolding

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.060 
in a list and then not bolding
afterwards<00:04:25.860> and

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
afterwards and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.440 
afterwards and
kind<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.310> nice<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.490> word<00:04:26.850> we'll<00:04:27.030> figure<00:04:27.270> that

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
kind of nice that word we'll figure that

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.160 
kind of nice that word we'll figure that
out<00:04:27.510> for<00:04:27.660> me<00:04:29.270> but<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.510> rest<00:04:30.750> of<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.020> I

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
out for me but the rest of it I

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.950 
out for me but the rest of it I
generally<00:04:32.040> do<00:04:32.310> turn<00:04:32.760> off<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.420> they<00:04:33.570> look<00:04:33.870> at

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
generally do turn off and they look at

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.570 
generally do turn off and they look at
this<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.260> internet<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.890> internet<00:04:35.430> with

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
this the internet the internet with

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.700 
this the internet the internet with
network<00:04:35.820> pass<00:04:36.030> with<00:04:36.210> hyperlinks<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.140> here

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
network pass with hyperlinks is in here

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.520 
network pass with hyperlinks is in here
again<00:04:37.890> so<00:04:38.250> it's<00:04:38.400> in<00:04:38.490> more<00:04:38.640> than<00:04:38.760> one<00:04:38.910> place<00:04:39.090> and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
again so it's in more than one place and

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.020 
again so it's in more than one place and
this<00:04:40.530> one<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:40.950> in<00:04:41.100> here<00:04:41.310> in<00:04:41.490> more<00:04:41.790> than<00:04:41.880> one

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
this one is in here in more than one

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.400 
this one is in here in more than one
place<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:42.390> I'm<00:04:42.480> going<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.660> turn<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:42.930> on<00:04:43.080> in

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
place so I'm going to turn it on in

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.870 
place so I'm going to turn it on in
there<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.600> think<00:04:45.930> that<00:04:46.290> is<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:47.640> once

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
there and I think that is it so once

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.790 
there and I think that is it so once
I've<00:04:48.090> done<00:04:48.420> making<00:04:48.840> changes<00:04:48.870> i'm<00:04:49.590> going<00:04:49.740> to

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
I've done making changes i'm going to

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.920 
I've done making changes i'm going to
make<00:04:49.950> i<00:04:50.100> just<00:04:50.340> click<00:04:50.520> ok<00:04:50.670> here<00:04:51.210> i<00:04:51.360> click<00:04:51.750> ok

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
make i just click ok here i click ok

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.380 
make i just click ok here i click ok
here<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.770> I've<00:04:52.980> now<00:04:53.190> officially<00:04:53.670> updated<00:04:53.880> my

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
here and I've now officially updated my

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.380 
here and I've now officially updated my
autocorrect<00:04:54.720> options
