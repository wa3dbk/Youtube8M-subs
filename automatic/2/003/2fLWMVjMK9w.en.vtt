00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.480
 two years 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:29.290
 the lord of heaven the father of gods 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.369
 zeus treats all the heroes as if 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.780
 were their noisy rebellious sons 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.730
 after being surprised countless times 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.670
 in the middle of meetings with countless 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.160
 mortal women his divine wife gave him 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.610
 finally an ultimatum 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.670
 if you love both mortals sees and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.330
 become one of them if you get 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.629
 show that you are faithful then come back 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.070
 to me as an immortal husband of what 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.940
 contrary 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.110
 go and die among your creatures 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.509
 zeus found his logic and his magic 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.549
 irrefutable and I accept his plan he has 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.220
 maintained its best behavior since 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.460
 then appreciating something else the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.740
 immortality than mortals but 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.770
 to prove to himself that he is worthy 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.830
 of his eternal wife he will have to follow 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.009
 looking for victory in the field of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.420
 battle and that's how zeus became 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.659
 in a mortal being ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.659
