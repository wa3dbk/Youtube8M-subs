00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
already got it and then that could be

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.660 
already got it and then that could be
more<00:03:39.090> files<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.890> this<00:03:41.040> case<00:03:41.250> there's<00:03:41.520> only

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670

and then I'll go to where have my

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.170 
and then I'll go to where have my
vampires<00:03:53.460> installed

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
vampires installed

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.170 
vampires installed
and<00:03:55.330> that's<00:03:56.159> that's<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:59.230> this<00:03:59.909> has<00:04:00.909> to<00:04:01.060> go

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
and that's that's and this has to go

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.170 
and that's that's and this has to go
under<00:04:01.510> AI<00:04:02.310> surprise<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.870> new<00:04:05.080> patient

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
under AI surprise and the new patient

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.530 
under AI surprise and the new patient
and<00:04:07.569> dagger

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
and dagger

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.190 
and dagger
that<00:04:09.900> was<00:04:10.110> basically<00:04:10.489> okay<00:04:11.819> how<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.269> use<00:04:12.569> them

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
that was basically okay how to use them

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.270 
that was basically okay how to use them
first<00:04:13.799> of<00:04:13.890> all<00:04:14.569> create<00:04:15.569> some<00:04:15.840> units<00:04:16.280> just

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
first of all create some units just

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.600 
first of all create some units just
about<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:18.690> much<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.199> then<00:04:19.919> place<00:04:22.610> Scouts

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
about this much and then place Scouts

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.300 
about this much and then place Scouts
for<00:04:23.880> instance<00:04:24.270> they<00:04:24.870> will<00:04:25.410> usually<00:04:25.740> run

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
for instance they will usually run

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.710 
for instance they will usually run
around<00:04:29.389> still<00:04:30.389> in<00:04:30.539> this<00:04:30.720> case<00:04:32.509> if<00:04:33.509> it's

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
around still in this case if it's

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.960 
around still in this case if it's
working<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.289> then<00:04:35.190> they<00:04:35.400> hit<00:04:35.550> oh<00:04:35.610> it's<00:04:35.820> in

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
working and then they hit oh it's in

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.540 
working and then they hit oh it's in
place<00:04:36.210> app<00:04:36.479> and<00:04:36.720> then<00:04:37.229> sig<00:04:37.800> player<00:04:38.100> too

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
place app and then sig player too

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.090 
place app and then sig player too
since<00:04:39.120> there's<00:04:39.630> no<00:04:39.780> air<00:04:39.930> AI<00:04:40.199> for<00:04:40.470> player<00:04:40.889> one

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
this one and that is click it and now it

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.100 
this one and that is click it and now it
should<00:04:51.120> behave<00:04:51.330> like<00:04:51.599> this

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110

should behave like this
a<00:04:52.139> is<00:04:52.770> coded<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:53.820> then<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.720> can<00:04:54.870> set<00:04:55.050> all<00:04:55.169> the

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
a is coded and then you can set all the

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.190 
a is coded and then you can set all the
other

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200
