00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 and finished to assimilate what 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.500
 represented this victory before manny 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.210
 pacquiao that is if I later since it 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.950
 ended the fight will be looking for a fight 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.040
 difficult a very important fight for 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.500
 win and that assimilated for that we 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.529
 we trained and we knew that some 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.199
 way we have to leave everything up 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.930
 and as queens and turned me so 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.519
 after that great triumph we knew 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.720
 what we had done in the fights 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.320
 previous but I had not been 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.570
 recognized and somehow already we 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 fell 20 regarding that that triumph 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.739
 very big you consider that only so 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.090
 You might end the controversy over 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.790
 who was better with such a blow 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.340
 forceful with a knockout in which the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.590
 rival could not get up because of some 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.239
 that way it was a point in my favor 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.170
 because the three previous fights are 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.180
 they had finished in decisions 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.680
 controversial that if you handle it 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.440
 controversial compositions that but 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.260
 for me personally they have been clear 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.820
 clear triumphs the first a triumph 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.359
 closed but good at the end of accounts 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.210
 triumphed the second for 23 points we won 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.900
 the third is not said by 45 points and 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.210
 is that good 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.310
 that way because the judges maybe 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.680
 they will be able to do again of theirs and 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.540
 Going to the decision would be another fight 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.630
 just as controversial and it would be another 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.280
 situation and for the truth I think that it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.930
 saw the reflected work saw the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.760
 concentration that we have in that fight and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.590
 very happy because of the result you have already 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.420
 mentioned together that it's about 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.460
 the most important victory of your life 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.980
 but we are also talking about the best 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.190
 blow that you have given in your life flavio 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.330
 blows in other fights that I have also 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.210
 that have been important that have been 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.340
 hard but good here depends on the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.540
 rival is also the rival 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.460
 manny pacquiao considered the best 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.160
 pound for pound in the manner 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.580
 connect I think that that holds 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.100
 globally the whole situation and for me 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.530
 has been a perfect hit has been a 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.150
 hard blow but I think the knockout has 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.090
 been one of the best for a long time 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.340
 have you mentioned that at the time 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.800
 a few seconds you worried about 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.600
 the health status of manny pacquiao that 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.850
 represented for you then see images 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.100
 in which he and his wife spill 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.080
 tears remembering the impact of 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.210
 blow and obviously the impact of the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.670
 own image for a great feeling 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.380
 because we are two rivals that we are 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.330
 above the quadrilateral what happened to him 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.180
 the now and what could have happened to me 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.820
 me at some point in the fight in some 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.130
 round but good I think we're 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.410
 exposed to this and it gave me a great 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.080
 sadness to know that manny's wife 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.480
 Pacquiao was crying like I was 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.890
 He suffered a lot this situation but good 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.930
 I believe that we are athletes we are 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.360
 professionals and somehow you have to 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.160
 accept this point you talk about that in 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.990
 four fights you were superior to manny 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.470
 pacquiao would you see a fifth case 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.800
 From this reading, I would not see him 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.050
 I case but logically manny pacquiao 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.580
 he wants it as a place but we're going to 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.360
 see let's see what happens I'm seeing 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.850
 if I continue 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.220
 that's going to be an important point and in 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.380
 If my wife allows me 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.850
 continue and make a fight more would be 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.670
 that what I mean with this 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.490
 logically one as a professional and one 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.370
 like as a fighter he looks for the best 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.510
 then here it would be also 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.880
 that we do well in the economic 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.500
 So we've been chopping stone 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.360
 of each of the fights in each 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.980
 of the fights we have been throwing him 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.690
 desire and why not now that 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.530
 acquired the triumph and that possibly 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.700
 one more fight would be that the economic thing 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.680
 I would go very well because it makes 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.209
 One side is that opportunity 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.970
 I have a reading to see if I'm 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.190
 right it seems that you want a 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.440
 fight more and it is your family that asks you 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.390
 No, but you, in particular, if you want 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.090
 continue I feel good I feel 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.770
 well physically and mentally but I did 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.110
 a promise that says the promises 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.550
 are debts and I told my wife that 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.380
 independently depending on 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.930
 result of this fight because 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.150
 it was practically the last and my wife 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.340
 it tells me in the future you promised then there 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.700
 the problem is already, I tell him to slaughter 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.190
 just leave me one more 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.739
 then he has not given me an answer 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.810
 has said yes or no but look I think that 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.269
 the important content with result 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.410
 happy pleased that it was settled 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.019
 what has happened in the three fights 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.120
 previous right now we have to rest and 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.950
 see if my wife repents and gives me 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.840
 chance cited one more because if of you 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.060
 It depends of course that you would do one last 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.780
 fight and in the Aztec stadium you do not 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.320
 I would love 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.870
 I would be great but I think 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.300
 that are wheat are 28 years where where 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.740
 you're practically exposing everything 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.020
 are you training are you throwing 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.669
 so much, so I want to think 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.220
 also carefully if we continue or 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.630
 no and a fight in which that fifth in 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.900
 the stadium is here and here in Mexico 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.860
 It would be formidable for me for my people 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.860
 can I retire here in my country
