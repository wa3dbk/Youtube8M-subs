okay<00:00:00.780> now<00:00:00.989> I'm<00:00:01.079> gonna<00:00:01.260> go<00:00:01.500> and<00:00:02.070> start<00:00:02.840> the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
okay now I'm gonna go and start the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.820 
okay now I'm gonna go and start the
beginning<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.220> circle<00:00:06.049> like<00:00:07.049> you<00:00:07.319> use<00:00:07.500> for

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
beginning of a circle like you use for

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.520 
beginning of a circle like you use for
hats<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.519> caps<00:00:09.559> we're<00:00:10.559> using<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:11.120> two<00:00:12.120> ply<00:00:12.530> self

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
hats and caps we're using a two ply self

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.529 
hats and caps we're using a two ply self
spun<00:00:14.269> yarn<00:00:15.269> made<00:00:15.839> from<00:00:16.199> pure<00:00:16.590> wool<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.539> it's

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
spun yarn made from pure wool and it's

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.609 
spun yarn made from pure wool and it's
hand<00:00:18.779> dyed<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> plant<00:00:20.689> from<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.930> middle<00:00:22.230> in

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
hand dyed was a plant from the middle in

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.810 
hand dyed was a plant from the middle in
a<00:00:23.250> circle<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:27.060> first<00:00:27.439> you<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:29.010> loop<00:00:29.580> this

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
a circle so first you do a loop this

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.680 
a circle so first you do a loop this
time<00:00:30.800> pull<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.830> through<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.420> start

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
time pull it through it's like the start

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.040 
time pull it through it's like the start
loop<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.079> use<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.620> crocheting<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.840> that

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
loop you use for crocheting the one that

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.729 
loop you use for crocheting the one that
pulls<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:38.610> clothes<00:00:39.800> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:41.010> pull<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.370> closed

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
pulls the clothes you can pull it closed

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
pulls the clothes you can pull it closed
don't<00:00:43.739> pull<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.010> too<00:00:44.160> tight<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:45.000> makes<00:00:45.239> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
don't pull it too tight it just makes it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.170 
don't pull it too tight it just makes it
move<00:00:45.510> too<00:00:45.960> hard<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> next<00:00:47.579> part

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
move too hard to do the next part

00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:09.970 
move too hard to do the next part
now<00:00:49.079> put<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.530> loops

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.890 

that's<00:01:10.980> how<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> lot<00:01:11.430> lazy<00:01:11.880> people<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that's how a lot lazy people do the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.030 
that's how a lot lazy people do the
looks<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.440> anything<00:01:13.620> -<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:15.110> do<00:01:16.110> -<00:01:16.500> more<00:01:16.770> than<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
looks for anything - I do - more than I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.779 
looks for anything - I do - more than I
got<00:01:17.190> 14

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.320 

pull<00:01:25.789> it<00:01:25.939> through<00:01:26.270> make

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
pull it through make

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.350 
pull it through make
this<00:01:28.490> close<00:01:29.490> through<00:01:29.760> I<00:01:29.790> keep<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:32.360> will

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
this close through I keep it here will

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.760 
this close through I keep it here will
everything<00:01:33.720> through

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.640 

now<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.490> soon<00:01:41.760> as<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.030> pull<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> through

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.290 

can't<00:01:46.650> see<00:01:46.890> now

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:02:00.870 

how<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:50.960> comes<00:01:51.230> together<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:51.980> circle

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.190 

it's<00:02:01.030> going<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.479> pull<00:02:01.719> through

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.770 

yeah

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.730 

this<00:02:10.380> last<00:02:10.709> loop<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.880> take<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.380> from

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
this last loop you take and go from

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.320 
this last loop you take and go from
behind<00:02:14.180> through<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.330> loop<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.990> London's<00:02:16.410> I

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.620 

will<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.569> with<00:02:21.810> York<00:02:22.170> stitch<00:02:22.590> now<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.630> go

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
will do it with York stitch now I go

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.420 
will do it with York stitch now I go
from<00:02:24.930> front<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.830> row<00:02:26.220> below<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:28.260> go<00:02:28.500> from

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
from front and the row below and go from

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.020 
from front and the row below and go from
behind<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> front<00:02:31.130> under<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.430> loops<00:02:32.640> back

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
behind to the front under the loops back

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.150 
behind to the front under the loops back
loop<00:02:33.360> front<00:02:34.319> loop<00:02:35.120> underneath<00:02:36.120> your<00:02:36.360> yarn<00:02:37.160> and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
loop front loop underneath your yarn and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.050 
loop front loop underneath your yarn and
pull<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.430> through<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:40.280> we<00:02:41.280> are<00:02:41.340> now<00:02:41.459> working<00:02:41.670> in

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
pull it through so we are now working in

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.699 
pull it through so we are now working in
circles<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.739> want<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.880> make<00:02:45.410> like<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> big

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
circles and we want to make like a big

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.650 
circles and we want to make like a big
plate<00:02:47.360> we<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.780> add<00:02:48.959> stitches<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:51.480> add

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
plate we have to add stitches to add

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.110 
plate we have to add stitches to add
your<00:02:51.959> stitch<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.530> will<00:02:52.709> go<00:02:52.860> twice<00:02:53.120> through

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
your stitch you will go twice through

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.630 
your stitch you will go twice through
each<00:02:54.330> loop<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:55.190> your<00:02:56.190> row<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.930> first<00:02:58.200> row

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
each loop of your row in the first row

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.990 
each loop of your row in the first row
so<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.700> go<00:02:59.940> back<00:03:00.150> again<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.860> do<00:03:01.860> another<00:03:02.000> York

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
so you go back again and do another York

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.920 
so you go back again and do another York
stitch<00:03:07.040> now<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.100> take<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.670> next<00:03:08.850> one<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.450> you

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
stitch now you take the next one and you

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.910 
stitch now you take the next one and you
do<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.380> York<00:03:10.680> stitches<00:03:11.190> into<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.760> loop

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
do to York stitches into this loop

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:22.390 
do to York stitches into this loop
stitch<00:03:13.920> one

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.699 

I'm<00:03:23.000> doing<00:03:23.420> another<00:03:23.629> stitch<00:03:24.140> in<00:03:24.379> the<00:03:24.470> same

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
I'm doing another stitch in the same

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.530 
I'm doing another stitch in the same
loop

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.979 

this<00:03:31.170> way<00:03:31.409> I<00:03:31.439> will<00:03:31.620> double<00:03:32.280> my<00:03:32.310> stitches<00:03:33.090> all

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
this way I will double my stitches all

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:42.280 
this way I will double my stitches all
the<00:03:34.049> way<00:03:34.469> around<00:03:39.980> let's<00:03:40.980> go<00:03:41.129> again<00:03:41.430> through<00:03:41.700> it

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
the way around let's go again through it

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.309 
the way around let's go again through it
do<00:03:43.290> another<00:03:43.500> stitch

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.379
