00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.569
 Now that the people of youtube gamer are 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:07.450
 a tutorial on how to hack our 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.900
 playstation 2 good for this consists of 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:15.620
 three things we occupy a memory that already 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:20.840
 is hacked with him with the fycma cut 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:23.900
 another that is not and a usb memory the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.439
 size does not matter if it's league or 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.509
 512 megs onwards with this is fine 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.430
 well the first step is going to be insert 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.579
 our usb memory in our 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.559
 computer once doing this let's 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.240
 to select all these files 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.310
 we give you in right click copy 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.600
 but before this we are going to format 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:48.850
 our usb in fat32 format we give in 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.940
 fast format and we accept 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:57.239
 once completed we copy all this and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.239
 we paste it inside our usb 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.930
 I 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.289
 very well once ready, this we go to 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.289
 what is the playstation 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.300
 we disconnect it and put it inside 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.300
 our playstation 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.109
 all right 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.109
 now we connect the two memories 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.060
 the hacked one and on the sheets that do 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.960
 and we introduce the usb memory 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.009
 now we're leaving and now we restart the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.009
 console 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.990
 and he's going to start reading what's coming 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.990
 being the usb memory 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.560
 okay 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:19.510
 now we go to where it says 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.510
 a lunch and ls 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.620
 Now let's see where the circle says 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.819
 when it says firewall be 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.170
 where it says in the zero c and ms 1 the ms 0 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.140
 is the one in the port of the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.730
 Left memory and MS 1 is the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.640
 it's in the port on the right 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.069
 this folder is also our folder 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.440
 where are the files of the usb 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.030
 we give circle 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.030
 and we give him a king says 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.030
 wood 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.090
 and we press circular 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.450
 Now we give it in normal installation with 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.450
 x 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.099
 where we want to install what 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.629
 we put here for example I want that 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.629
 install on sides 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.110
 let's see in ok 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.740
 tells me that this configuration is already 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.200
 done because I already have the two numbers 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.360
 what you want but it does not matter 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.680
 it's going to be the same procedure 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.680
 and it's happening 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.810
 we wait for them to go to the archives 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.770
 if they are just writing the files 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.240
 for 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.710
 our memory to run the 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.710
 pirate backups 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.890
 the process does not take long how much it takes 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.590
 55 minutes 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.989
 about or less 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.920
 it also depends on your playstation of what 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.920
 so fucking you have it 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.640
 yes 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.060
 and the same memory that you are going to 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.460
 have an angry default as 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.130
 they can ask for the hacked from a cousin 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.810
 a neighbor or the same can buy one in 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.110
 the tianguis and you can build your own 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.090
 business of hacking the memories and the 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.180
 final is going to tell us that the feedback 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.420
 that you have installed in our memory 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.740
 2 now 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:55.509
 we get the memory that we do not need 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:59.949
 where jaqués install this and 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:03.360
 original is this 2 is we vote it and 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.360
 we put the pirate 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.750
 now 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.369
 this game is the dragon ball z budokai 

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:18.799
 tenkaichi 3 that is in divided as 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:23.839
 you will see pirate we put it inside 

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:27.420
 our console and the usb we can already 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:30.900
 take out no longer serves us at all 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:34.130
 and proceed we will proceed to restart 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.130
 our playstation 2 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.870
 If all goes well so far as soon as 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.870
 put the disc you will read 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.750
 we wait a moment 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.490
 although we are already in the language of the dragon 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.490
 holt and you're done 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.530
 data is already being loaded 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:30.289
 and we continue with the game 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:32.689
 ya hamás to show them that 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.119
 the game works and it runs as if 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:38.289
 out a totally original game let's go 

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:38.289
 to put a little bit of the game 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.680
 or as always working and swallowing 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:59.220
 to be sure 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.600
 is that everyone runs a lot 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.600
