00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.190
 blue and welcome to the best 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.160
 video of me in this video I show 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.350
 you piercings the pallas curse for it 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.830
 you have to go to the harvest bartoli mission 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.880
 that would be here 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.279
 I cut that short then it works 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.279
 know quickly to the same or if we 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.990
 even that would be the steffen we 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.460
 go right then I do boost 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.560
 purely then it is a bit faster 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.980
 then it does not take that long 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.980
 we are there 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.700
 Well then we would be here already 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.580
 We have to break up then 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.740
 wait for the DropShip to arrive like that 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.230
 if now a wolf pack is up 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.800
 booty to come to the dropships I 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:01.180
 I've been up here on the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.480
 point yes there you have to really only 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.390
 still kill down there 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.590
 until then the last landing ship comes 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.120
 he is with the last landing ship 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.660
 then come that is the invisible one 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.970
 maybe here will be visible 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.850
 if you hit it, look here 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.190
 persies pallas flight has to be 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.060
 kill if you killed him you have 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.220
 The mission even succeeded 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.580
 your car points if you are the first 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.660
 and then we are still looking for the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.900
 tour here at the beginning once the 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.850
 tour the other points I show now 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.960

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.960
 to make the foray 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.039
