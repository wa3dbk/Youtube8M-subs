00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.790
 I'm still making a transfer and under the gun 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.519
 next issue I would like to you 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.640

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.730
 Counter strike 1 6 game of course this is a 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.660
 because he kicked like you can do on 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.710
 such a console 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.859
 thin such an angle between them 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.500
 the old thing itself would bet 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.250
 version let's still see now 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.160
 how does it all look like this menu 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:45.960
 next we click and choose which 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.910
 still choose a card from these then 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.379
 any principle for me to gray 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.829
 Here now is the bait that shoot 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.149
 tom with this walk here these buttons 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.370
 back and forth and choose so now 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.479
 first choose who we will play 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:13.530
 for terrorists of course life and choose 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:17.759
 so anyway what to play and now 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.950
 press this button and yes you first need 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.790
 move away instead of this button by the way 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.600
 move up 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.680
 for you rights oh they give in pink all 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.329
 now we are by the way here weapons can 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.259
 obviously buy as long as you want 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.320
 you will not end 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.930
 that is, they did it so stupidly at home 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.159
 that is, you can buy weapons as much 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.159
 you want to choose 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:52.479
 I buy weapons as much as I want and you can 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.079
 choose him all my weapons that 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.329
 I bought 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:02:01.350
 and to make a bot on this button too 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.350
 press his work bots for me 22 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.929
 some more here sometimes from hanging 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.690
 see some kind of freeze let's say it 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.470
 Of course, we have such a card but nonsense 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.489
 Of course the game but even if it was possible 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.040
 put in 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:29.470
 don't even shoot me like that somehow 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.640
 it is clear they still killed yes if 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.040
 could transfer 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:39.099
 this outfit is called crap 20 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:42.519
 send even to what caste seems so 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.180
 here they give them that they showed their 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.880
 transmission 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.970
 it is like a pony and so it is so lowered 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:54.760
 said that it is collagen but this 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.950
 because because of you again and therefore 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.269
 what they don't have and they only buy 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.920
 Rabble gadgets and 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.450
 different Chinese flies so we see here 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.190
 so but when it does not cheat on the map 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:13.989
 done well and weapons all well but 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:17.489
 the gameplay from I uploaded anything 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:21.870
 so that like paint was like 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.970
 In general, you all understand what kind of game 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.060
 you can go out and finally show 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.450
 how much does it weigh this game is not a principle 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.450
 all now 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.240
 see how much it weighs so go 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:51.860
 again we will win Dagestan and look here 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:55.490
 here and so weighs 85 megabytes 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.910
 The principle of such a game is normal although you can 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.660
 there were smaller ghettos 50 in general, all with 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:07.220
