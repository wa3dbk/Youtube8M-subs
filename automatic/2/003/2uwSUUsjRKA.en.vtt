00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
because you want to know how to build an

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.900 
because you want to know how to build an
app<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.930> not<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.379> any<00:01:01.680> type<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.219> app<00:01:02.550> you

want to build an app for free which in

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.330 
want to build an app for free which in
some<00:01:07.110> essence<00:01:07.530> some<00:01:07.710> people<00:01:07.950> would<00:01:08.040> say<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
some essence some people would say that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.490 
some essence some people would say that
it's<00:01:08.490> pretty<00:01:08.670> tough<00:01:09.110> because<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.260> lot<00:01:10.380> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
it's pretty tough because a lot of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.859 
it's pretty tough because a lot of
people<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:11.040> there<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:12.510> they<00:01:12.630> can't

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
people out there and because they can't

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.260 
people out there and because they can't
be<00:01:13.080> bothered<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> coding<00:01:13.950> they<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:15.119> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
be bothered with the coding they get it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.770 
be bothered with the coding they get it
outsourced<00:01:15.920> which<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> problem<00:01:17.850> but

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
outsourced which is not a problem but

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.330 
outsourced which is not a problem but
you<00:01:18.840> obviously<00:01:19.320> want<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> know<00:01:19.710> how<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you obviously want to know how to do it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.810 
you obviously want to know how to do it
for<00:01:20.430> free

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
for free

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.480 
for free
so<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:22.320> depends<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> type<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.130> app

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
so and it all depends on the type of app

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.880 
so and it all depends on the type of app
that<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.820> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> build<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.049> I'm<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that you want to build so I'm going to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.850 
that you want to build so I'm going to
look<00:01:26.100> at<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.500> because<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.560> don't<00:01:28.740> know

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
look at this as a because I don't know

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.569 
look at this as a because I don't know
everyone's<00:01:29.670> thought<00:01:30.090> process<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.680> have

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
everyone's thought process and I have

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
everyone's thought process and I have
for<00:01:32.820> me<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> tutorial<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.869> how<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.170> build

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
for me to do a tutorial on how to build

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.230 
for me to do a tutorial on how to build
an<00:01:34.680> app<00:01:34.799> through<00:01:35.040> doing<00:01:35.640> through<00:01:35.820> code<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
an app through doing through code is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.600 
an app through doing through code is
going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> take<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> while<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.250> I'm<00:01:38.400> going

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
going to take a while but what I'm going

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.039 
going to take a while but what I'm going
to<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.909> show<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.150> something<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.840> very

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
to do is show you something a very

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.030 
to do is show you something a very
simpler<00:01:40.860> way<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:42.060> get<00:01:42.750> your<00:01:42.960> app<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.500> there<00:01:43.890> on

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
simpler way to get your app out there on

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.080 
simpler way to get your app out there on
the<00:01:44.159> market<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.810> top<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:47.090> generate

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the market and on top of that generate

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.999 
the market and on top of that generate
some<00:01:48.390> some<00:01:48.960> revenue<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:49.799> bit<00:01:49.920> of

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
some some revenue a little bit of

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.060 
some some revenue a little bit of
revenue<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.780> then<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.110> potentially<00:01:52.770> use

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
revenue and then you can potentially use

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.300 
revenue and then you can potentially use
that<00:01:53.100> money<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:54.060> build<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.470> app<00:01:55.680> yourself<00:01:55.890> in

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
that money to build the app yourself in

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.550 
that money to build the app yourself in
other<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.729> other<00:01:57.000> future<00:01:57.899> videos<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.290> will<00:01:58.320> be

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
showing you how to get how to build a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.109 
showing you how to get how to build a
really<00:02:00.840> good<00:02:01.229> quality<00:02:01.500> app<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.399> well<00:02:02.759> but<00:02:02.969> for

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
really good quality app as well but for

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.219 
really good quality app as well but for
this<00:02:03.270> video<00:02:03.570> we're<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> make<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.200> very
