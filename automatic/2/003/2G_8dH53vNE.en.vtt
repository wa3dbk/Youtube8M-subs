00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
power save mode it means that you have

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.809 
power save mode it means that you have
maybe<00:05:27.449> ten<00:05:27.810> percent<00:05:28.440> of<00:05:28.620> battery<00:05:29.039> you<00:05:29.789> can

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
maybe ten percent of battery you can

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.230 
maybe ten percent of battery you can
choose<00:05:30.210> its<00:05:30.449> mode<00:05:30.720> and

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
you can work only with second screen and

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.320 
you can work only with second screen and
to<00:05:35.720> your<00:05:36.410> phone<00:05:36.710> your<00:05:37.400> power<00:05:37.669> consumption

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
to your phone your power consumption

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.189 
to your phone your power consumption
will<00:05:38.509> be<00:05:38.690> more<00:05:39.199> greater<00:05:39.500> in<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:40.099> big<00:05:40.250> screen

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
will be more greater in the big screen

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.730 
will be more greater in the big screen
also<00:05:42.199> we<00:05:42.500> have<00:05:43.220> a<00:05:43.699> plane<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:44.210> develop<00:05:44.690> on<00:05:44.870> some

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:54.570 

reasons<00:05:53.550> for<00:05:54.089> example

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
reasons for example

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.050 
reasons for example
company<00:05:55.120> buy<00:05:55.240> this<00:05:55.300> phone<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.830> this<00:05:57.520> one<00:05:57.759> can
