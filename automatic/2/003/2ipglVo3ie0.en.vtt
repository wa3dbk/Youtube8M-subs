00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
from the Canon 1.4 versus the 1.8 I did

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.950 
from the Canon 1.4 versus the 1.8 I did
a<00:00:16.109> earlier<00:00:16.949> video<00:00:17.400> comparing<00:00:18.390> pretty<00:00:18.810> much

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
a earlier video comparing pretty much

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.099 
a earlier video comparing pretty much
the<00:00:19.310> physical<00:00:20.720> aspect<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.230> two<00:00:22.740> lens<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
the physical aspect of the two lens and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.259 
the physical aspect of the two lens and
some<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> pricing<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.430> things<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.210> that

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
some of the pricing and things like that

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.470 
some of the pricing and things like that
and<00:00:27.750> I'll<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.529> link<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.000> but<00:00:30.000> this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
and I'll have a link to that but this

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
and I'll have a link to that but this
one<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:31.080> video<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.470> wanted<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> concentrate

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
one this video I wanted to concentrate

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.540 
one this video I wanted to concentrate
just<00:00:32.489> strictly<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.140> image<00:00:34.739> quality<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
just strictly on the image quality of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.709 
just strictly on the image quality of
the<00:00:35.690> 1.4<00:00:36.690> versus<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> 1.8<00:00:38.210> what<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.510> up

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the 1.4 versus the 1.8 what I have up

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.810 
the 1.4 versus the 1.8 what I have up
right<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:41.809> over<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.610> over<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
right now is over on the over on the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.750 
right now is over on the over on the

left its the 1.4 over on the right is to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.840 
left its the 1.4 over on the right is to
1.8<00:00:48.329> they're<00:00:49.230> both<00:00:49.500> shot<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
1.8 they're both shot right now on the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.529 
1.8 they're both shot right now on the
focal<00:00:51.239> length

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
focal length

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.310 
focal length
I<00:00:51.989> mean<00:00:52.770> it's<00:00:52.949> Ariana<00:00:53.280> f-stop<00:00:54.350> 1.8<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
I mean it's Ariana f-stop 1.8 so if you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.040 
I mean it's Ariana f-stop 1.8 so if you
look<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:59.489> pretty<00:00:59.820> much<00:00:59.969> wide<00:01:00.239> open<00:01:00.719> for

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
look that's pretty much wide open for

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.100 
look that's pretty much wide open for
the<00:01:01.109> 1.8<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> 1.4<00:01:02.910> that's<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.329> that's<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the 1.8 but the 1.4 that's a that's a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.219 
the 1.8 but the 1.4 that's a that's a
that's<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.710> that's<00:01:05.479> actually<00:01:06.479> stopped<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.960> from

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
that's a that's actually stopped up from

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.120 
that's a that's actually stopped up from
there

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
there

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.690 
there
if<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.700> look<00:01:08.909> at<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> image<00:01:10.010> what<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> did<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.549> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
if you look at the image what I did is I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.560 
if you look at the image what I did is I
put<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.390> camera<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> tripod<00:01:13.400> I<00:01:14.570> set

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
put the camera on a tripod I set

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.980 
put the camera on a tripod I set
everything<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.110> manual

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
everything to manual

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.070 
everything to manual
except<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.229> focus<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> focus<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.600> put

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
except for focus and when I focus I put

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.270 
except for focus and when I focus I put
the<00:01:22.290> focus<00:01:22.650> right<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.540> e<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.200> way<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the focus right on the e in this way the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.740 
the focus right on the e in this way the
first<00:01:26.549> E<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.439> I<00:01:28.439> took<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> pictures<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.750> just

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
first E and I took the pictures and just

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.620 
first E and I took the pictures and just
taking<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.170> look<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.400> could<00:01:32.579> see<00:01:33.270> wide

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
taking a look at this you could see wide

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.649 
taking a look at this you could see wide
open<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:35.189> 1.8<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.860> blurry<00:01:38.000> compared<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
open the 1.8 is blurry compared to the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.800 
open the 1.8 is blurry compared to the
1.4<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:41.540> more<00:01:42.540> Kris

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.359 

certain<00:01:46.810> things<00:01:47.020> are<00:01:47.229> all<00:01:47.380> focused<00:01:48.159> on<00:01:48.250> the

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
certain things are all focused on the

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:55.649 
certain things are all focused on the
1.8<00:01:48.909> wide<00:01:49.090> open<00:01:53.100> 1.4<00:01:54.100> over<00:01:54.340> on<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.579> left<00:01:54.820> 1.8

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
1.8 wide open 1.4 over on the left 1.8

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.960 
1.8 wide open 1.4 over on the left 1.8
over<00:01:55.960> on<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.140> right<00:01:56.409> we're<00:01:57.100> currently<00:01:57.579> at<00:01:59.970> 2.8

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
over on the right we're currently at 2.8

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.950 
over on the right we're currently at 2.8
on<00:02:01.329> our<00:02:01.569> elf<00:02:01.780> stop<00:02:02.159> I'm<00:02:03.159> going<00:02:03.369> to<00:02:03.549> zoom<00:02:03.759> up<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
on our elf stop I'm going to zoom up and

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.900 
on our elf stop I'm going to zoom up and
you<00:02:05.229> can<00:02:05.439> still<00:02:05.799> see<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.689> 1.4<00:02:08.349> is

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
you can still see that the 1.4 is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.789 
you can still see that the 1.4 is
sharper<00:02:09.910> than<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.209> 1.8<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.019> one<00:02:11.170> plate<00:02:11.530> is

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
sharper than the 1.8 the one plate is

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.020 
sharper than the 1.8 the one plate is
starting<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.430> come<00:02:13.209> into<00:02:13.390> focus<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:15.160> it's

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
starting to come into focus but it's

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.789 
starting to come into focus but it's
still<00:02:16.209> not<00:02:16.420> as<00:02:16.569> Chris<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:16.989> sharp<00:02:17.530> as<00:02:17.769> it

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
still not as Chris and sharp as it

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.640 
still not as Chris and sharp as it
should<00:02:18.220> be<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:20.790> over<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:21.910> left<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.930> 1.4

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
should be so over on the left is the 1.4

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.960 
should be so over on the left is the 1.4
over<00:02:24.640> on<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.940> right<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.390> 1.8

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.880 

I'm<00:02:32.420> going<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.630> go<00:02:32.720> ahead<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.050> zoom<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.530> to

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
I'm going to go ahead and zoom that to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.940 
I'm going to go ahead and zoom that to
see<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.640> quality<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:36.200> sharpness<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:39.770> can

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
see the quality of the sharpness you can

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.090 
see the quality of the sharpness you can
still<00:02:40.190> see<00:02:40.460> that<00:02:40.730> at<00:02:42.460> 4.0<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:45.220> 1.4<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.840> sharper

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
still see that at 4.0 the 1.4 is sharper

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.640 
still see that at 4.0 the 1.4 is sharper
than<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.370> 1.8<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.990> can<00:02:51.140> see<00:02:51.290> some<00:02:51.470> other

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
than the 1.8 you can see some other

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.580 
than the 1.8 you can see some other
details<00:02:52.250> like<00:02:52.550> around<00:02:52.910> here<00:02:53.360> around<00:02:54.110> this

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
area at the bottom the bottles still

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:10.330 
area at the bottom the bottles still
sharper<00:02:58.780> next<00:02:59.780> one<00:03:02.980> let's<00:03:03.980> go<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.400> eighth

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.240 

okay<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.400> over<00:03:11.910> on<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.240> left<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.720> 1.4<00:03:13.350> over

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
okay so over on the left to the 1.4 over

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.120 
okay so over on the left to the 1.4 over
on<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.430> right<00:03:14.580> is<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.850> 1.8<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:16.140> was<00:03:16.530> shot<00:03:16.860> at

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
on the right is a 1.8 this was shot at

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.950 
on the right is a 1.8 this was shot at
both<00:03:17.700> at<00:03:18.060> 8<00:03:18.690> point<00:03:19.050> all<00:03:19.290> typically<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.490> sweet

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
both at 8 point all typically the sweet

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.740 
both at 8 point all typically the sweet
point<00:03:21.960> of<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.410> lens<00:03:23.210> and<00:03:24.210> you<00:03:24.420> look<00:03:24.600> around

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
point of a lens and you look around

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.960 
point of a lens and you look around
can't<00:03:25.470> really<00:03:25.800> tell<00:03:26.040> which<00:03:26.250> one<00:03:26.520> is<00:03:26.700> which

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
can't really tell which one is which

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.430 
can't really tell which one is which
they<00:03:27.960> all<00:03:28.170> seem<00:03:28.590> pretty<00:03:28.800> sharp<00:03:29.160> at<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:29.490> point

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
they all seem pretty sharp at this point

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.290 
they all seem pretty sharp at this point
so<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:32.160> conclusion<00:03:34.400> what<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.580> get<00:03:35.820> for<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.090> one

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
so in conclusion what you get for a one

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.930 
so in conclusion what you get for a one
point<00:03:36.480> four<00:03:36.780> versus<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> one<00:03:37.470> point<00:03:37.680> eight

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
point four versus a one point eight

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.190 
point four versus a one point eight
bigger<00:03:38.940> aperture<00:03:39.800> sharper<00:03:40.800> image<00:03:41.190> wide<00:03:42.090> open

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.370 

for<00:03:46.790> for<00:03:47.790> about<00:03:47.880> two<00:03:48.150> hundred<00:03:48.300> dollars<00:03:48.810> more<00:03:49.080> I

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
for for about two hundred dollars more I

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.930 
for for about two hundred dollars more I
would<00:03:50.010> totally<00:03:50.310> go<00:03:50.700> for<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.570> one<00:03:51.750> point<00:03:52.050> four

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
would totally go for the one point four

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.420 
would totally go for the one point four
just<00:03:53.940> because<00:03:54.740> when<00:03:55.740> you're<00:03:55.860> taking<00:03:56.190> pictures

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
just because when you're taking pictures

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.880 
just because when you're taking pictures
images<00:03:57.440> image<00:03:58.440> quality<00:03:58.710> is<00:03:59.130> what<00:03:59.550> matters
