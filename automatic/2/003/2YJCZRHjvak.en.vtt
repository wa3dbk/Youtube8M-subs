this one here in 2006 and then again in
2007<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.800> pull<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:24.880> out<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.480> we<00:02:25.630> can<00:02:25.780> see

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
2007 and pull it on out here we can see

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.400 
2007 and pull it on out here we can see
that<00:02:26.110> we're<00:02:26.260> coming<00:02:26.530> up<00:02:26.770> into<00:02:27.370> an<00:02:27.550> area<00:02:27.820> of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
that we're coming up into an area of

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.660 
that we're coming up into an area of
possible<00:02:29.410> resistance<00:02:29.950> where<00:02:30.160> traders<00:02:30.430> will

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
possible resistance where traders will

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.390 
possible resistance where traders will
look<00:02:30.880> at<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.470> say<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.860> know<00:02:33.010> enough's

enough here let's take some profits here

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.090 
enough here let's take some profits here
and<00:02:35.470> get<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.100> pullback<00:02:36.400> like<00:02:36.730> we<00:02:36.880> did<00:02:37.030> back<00:02:37.240> here

course here this big massive drop here
and<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.890> then<00:02:48.190> coming<00:02:48.730> up<00:02:48.880> here<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.270> could<00:02:49.420> get

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
and and then coming up here we could get

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.290 
and and then coming up here we could get
a<00:02:49.600> pullback<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.920> know<00:02:51.070> nothing's<00:02:51.910> ever<00:02:52.030> for

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
a pullback you know nothing's ever for

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.210 
a pullback you know nothing's ever for
sure<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:53.080> would<00:02:53.590> expect<00:02:53.980> some

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
sure but I would expect some

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.370 
sure but I would expect some
profit-taking<00:02:54.670> as<00:02:55.090> we<00:02:55.270> do<00:02:55.420> get<00:02:55.989> into<00:02:56.140> this

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
profit-taking as we do get into this

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.960 
profit-taking as we do get into this
area<00:02:56.680> here<00:02:57.040> because<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.310> lot<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.489> traders<00:02:57.730> will

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
area here because a lot of traders will

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.520 
area here because a lot of traders will
be<00:02:58.030> looking<00:02:58.150> at<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.780> we've<00:02:59.050> had<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.290> very

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530

be looking at that and we've had a very
very<00:03:00.510> sizeable<00:03:01.510> run<00:03:01.660> here<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.440> that's<00:03:02.590> just

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
very sizeable run here so that's just

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.100 
very sizeable run here so that's just
something<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.040> think<00:03:03.100> about<00:03:03.630> now<00:03:04.630> here's<00:03:04.959> an

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
something to think about now here's an

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.020 
something to think about now here's an
interesting<00:03:05.260> chart<00:03:05.680> when<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:05.920> price<00:03:06.280> silver<00:03:06.820> in

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
interesting chart when I price silver in

out and running substantially higher and
let's<00:03:33.549> take<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.120> daily<00:03:34.420> chart<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.900> silver<00:03:35.230> and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
let's take a daily chart a silver and

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.750 
let's take a daily chart a silver and
draw<00:03:35.470> some<00:03:35.709> trend<00:03:35.980> lines<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.310> try<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.610> figure

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
draw some trend lines to try and figure

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.970 
draw some trend lines to try and figure
out<00:03:36.880> how<00:03:37.299> to<00:03:37.360> trade<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:37.900> on<00:03:38.140> an<00:03:38.470> intermediate

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
out how to trade this on an intermediate

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.100 
out how to trade this on an intermediate
trend<00:03:39.220> basis<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.940> we<00:03:40.930> can<00:03:41.260> see<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.739> we<00:03:42.370> had<00:03:42.549> a

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
trend basis and we can see that we had a

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.750 
trend basis and we can see that we had a
downward<00:03:44.110> trending<00:03:44.680> line<00:03:45.220> here<00:03:45.579> at<00:03:45.670> the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
downward trending line here at the

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.090 
downward trending line here at the
beginning<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.239> year<00:03:46.680> little<00:03:47.680> channel

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
beginning of the year little channel

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.650 
beginning of the year little channel
here<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.579> it<00:03:48.670> was<00:03:48.700> following<00:03:49.239> then<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.450> broke

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
here that it was following then it broke

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.330 
here that it was following then it broke
out<00:03:49.870> here<00:03:50.110> right<00:03:50.290> as<00:03:50.410> februari<00:03:50.860> came<00:03:51.070> in<00:03:51.250> and

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
out here right as februari came in and

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.610 
out here right as februari came in and
we<00:03:51.400> broke<00:03:51.610> out<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.329> now<00:03:53.110> we've<00:03:53.290> been<00:03:53.320> running

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
we broke out and now we've been running

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.120 
we broke out and now we've been running
up<00:03:54.209> pretty<00:03:55.209> much<00:03:55.420> along<00:03:55.750> this<00:03:56.049> gray<00:03:56.470> line<00:03:56.500> here

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
up pretty much along this gray line here

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.979 
up pretty much along this gray line here
which<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.610> 10<00:03:57.850> day<00:03:58.030> moving<00:03:58.269> average<00:03:58.570> so

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
which is the 10 day moving average so

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.140 
which is the 10 day moving average so
it's<00:03:59.019> getting<00:03:59.320> a<00:03:59.410> lot<00:03:59.530> of<00:03:59.590> support<00:04:00.010> there<00:04:00.310> at

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
it's getting a lot of support there at

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.090 
it's getting a lot of support there at
its<00:04:01.450> 10-day<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.380> might<00:04:02.560> be<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.769> place

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
its 10-day so that might be a place

so you could take a little top here and

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.640 
so you could take a little top here and
draw<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.460> trend<00:04:47.759> line<00:04:47.910> like<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.120> or<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:49.500> could

draw a trend line like that or you could

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.499 
draw a trend line like that or you could
actually<00:04:49.830> take<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.639> blow<00:04:50.820> through<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:51.300> and

actually take and blow through that and

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.840 
actually take and blow through that and
pick<00:04:51.720> up<00:04:51.870> something<00:04:52.169> like<00:04:52.320> this<00:04:52.710> as<00:04:53.639> your

trend line but I would follow the

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.800 
trend line but I would follow the
Bollinger<00:04:56.009> Band<00:04:56.220> top<00:04:56.490> here<00:04:56.849> and<00:04:57.000> never<00:04:57.539> by
