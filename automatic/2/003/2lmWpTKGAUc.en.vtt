cz-75 pistol with the full auto upgrade
reason<00:01:24.450> being<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> acts<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.439> almost

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
reason being it's just it acts as almost

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.780 
reason being it's just it acts as almost
like<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> secondary<00:01:27.829> submachine<00:01:28.829> gun<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.549> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
like a secondary submachine gun so that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.460 
like a secondary submachine gun so that
you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.090> kill<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.479> enemies<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:30.960> well<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.439> we

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
you can kill your enemies as well and we

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.980 
you can kill your enemies as well and we
go<00:01:31.680> ahead<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.860> switch<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.430> back<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:33.210> all

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
go ahead and switch this back there all

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.200 
go ahead and switch this back there all
right<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.380> first<00:01:35.070> grenade<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> use<00:01:35.909> the
