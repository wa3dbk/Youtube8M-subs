00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.310 
one of the things I really want to
emphasize<00:00:18.310> is<00:00:19.060> that<00:00:19.150> they<00:00:19.480> pass<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:20.110> puck

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
emphasize is that they pass the puck

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.350 
emphasize is that they pass the puck
hard<00:00:22.260> learn<00:00:23.260> to<00:00:23.500> pass<00:00:23.710> hard<00:00:24.160> and<00:00:24.430> learn<00:00:25.119> to

if<00:00:39.220> you<00:00:39.280> miss<00:00:39.460> it<00:00:39.610> you<00:00:40.000> can<00:00:40.150> chase<00:00:40.360> it<00:00:40.390> but<00:00:40.690> if

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
if you miss it you can chase it but if

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.630

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
you pass it easy has a chance to get

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.100 
you pass it easy has a chance to get
picked<00:00:42.879> off<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:43.239> going<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.540> other<00:00:43.570> way

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
picked off and going the other way

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.319 
picked off and going the other way
now<00:00:44.500> when<00:00:44.680> you<00:00:44.800> are<00:00:44.860> passing<00:00:45.190> on<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.820> forehand

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
now when you are passing on the forehand

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.870 
now when you are passing on the forehand
you've<00:00:46.930> got<00:00:47.110> your<00:00:47.290> whole<00:00:47.530> strength<00:00:48.399> behind<00:00:48.579> it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
you've got your whole strength behind it

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.700 
you've got your whole strength behind it
so<00:00:48.970> it's<00:00:49.120> easier<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.660> pass<00:00:49.930> hard<00:00:50.230> in<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.380> forum

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
so it's easier to pass hard in the forum

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.920 
so it's easier to pass hard in the forum
which<00:00:50.890> move<00:00:51.070> over<00:00:51.309> first<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:51.790> your<00:00:52.510> body<00:00:52.720> is

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
which move over first so your body is

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.360 
which move over first so your body is
behind<00:00:53.470> it<00:00:53.649> so<00:00:53.770> you're<00:00:53.890> going<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.070> get<00:00:54.160> more

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
behind it so you're going to get more

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.280 
behind it so you're going to get more
power<00:00:54.670> on<00:00:54.790> it<00:00:55.059> so<00:00:55.420> as<00:00:55.540> you<00:00:55.570> watch<00:00:55.780> these<00:00:56.050> two

power on it so as you watch these two

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.170 
power on it so as you watch these two
boys<00:00:56.500> here<00:00:56.890> all<00:00:57.340> right<00:00:57.460> they're<00:00:57.730> going<00:00:58.000> to<00:00:58.090> be

facing each other and passing the puck

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.139 
facing each other and passing the puck
back<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:00.850> forth<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:06.220> catch<00:01:06.490> it<00:01:06.700> just<00:01:06.729> like

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
back and forth you catch it just like

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.030 
back and forth you catch it just like
you<00:01:07.300> do<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.899> a<00:01:08.140> baseball<00:01:08.560> you<00:01:08.680> don't<00:01:08.860> leave

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
your glove there you catch it and get

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.469 
your glove there you catch it and get
now<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:12.190> make<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.490> more<00:01:12.610> realistic<00:01:13.060> they're

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
now to make it more realistic they're

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.330 
now to make it more realistic they're
going<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.810> turn<00:01:13.990> sideways<00:01:14.289> you're<00:01:15.039> going<00:01:15.250> to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
going to turn sideways you're going to

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.100 
going to turn sideways you're going to
pass<00:01:15.520> from<00:01:15.700> side<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.000> side<00:01:16.180> so<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.660> feet<00:01:16.869> are

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
pass from side to side so the feet are

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.940 
pass from side to side so the feet are
facing<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.860> park<00:01:18.040> down

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.130 

and<00:01:26.950> sometimes<00:01:27.850> in<00:01:28.179> the<00:01:28.210> game<00:01:28.479> they<00:01:29.109> don't

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
and sometimes in the game they don't

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.620 
and sometimes in the game they don't
have<00:01:29.560> time<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.100> stop<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.490> puck<00:01:30.700> so<00:01:31.240> now<00:01:31.390> that

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
have time to stop the puck so now that

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.300 
have time to stop the puck so now that
there's<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.020> person<00:01:32.320> right<00:01:32.619> on<00:01:32.799> them<00:01:32.979> so<00:01:33.159> now

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
there's a person right on them so now

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.639 
there's a person right on them so now
they're<00:01:33.820> going<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.210> one<00:01:34.509> touch<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.840> puck<00:01:35.229> back

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:48.930 
they're going to one touch the puck back
and<00:01:35.920> forth<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.280> each<00:01:36.310> other

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.750 

this<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:49.870> very<00:01:50.260> very<00:01:50.620> difficult<00:01:51.010> skill<00:01:51.430> to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
this is a very very difficult skill to

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.790 
this is a very very difficult skill to
do<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:52.060> these<00:01:52.150> boys<00:01:52.390> just<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:52.960> they<00:01:53.500> keep<00:01:53.680> the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
do that these boys just in they keep the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.080 
do that these boys just in they keep the
puck<00:01:53.980> on<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.280> ice<00:01:54.370> from<00:01:54.580> bouncing<00:01:54.970> all<00:01:55.060> over

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
puck on the ice from bouncing all over

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.610 
puck on the ice from bouncing all over
the<00:01:55.240> place<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.720> passing<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.080> back<00:01:56.230> and<00:01:56.410> forth

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
the place and passing it back and forth

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.710 
the place and passing it back and forth
but<00:01:57.070> sometimes<00:01:57.730> you<00:01:57.880> don't<00:01:58.000> have<00:01:58.210> enough<00:01:58.480> time

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
but sometimes you don't have enough time

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.810 
but sometimes you don't have enough time
to<00:01:59.170> put<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.500> there<00:01:59.710> and<00:01:59.920> pass<00:02:00.400> it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
to put it there and pass it

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.290 
to put it there and pass it
I<00:02:00.850> encourage<00:02:01.720> passing<00:02:02.620> when<00:02:03.250> coaches<00:02:04.150> are

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
I encourage passing when coaches are

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.750 
I encourage passing when coaches are
teaching<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:04.780> not<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.590> have<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:05.800> kid<00:02:06.130> just<00:02:06.160> say<00:02:06.550> I

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
will get it all right now we're going to

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.580 
will get it all right now we're going to
go<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.490> our<00:02:24.640> backhand<00:02:25.240> side<00:02:25.450> now<00:02:25.990> first<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.470> all

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
go to our backhand side now first of all

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.440 
go to our backhand side now first of all
as<00:02:26.680> far<00:02:26.710> as<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.010> backhand<00:02:27.490> is<00:02:27.610> concerned<00:02:27.970> it's

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
as far as the backhand is concerned it's

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.080 
as far as the backhand is concerned it's
much<00:02:28.840> weaker<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.740> go<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.040> back<00:02:30.190> hand<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:31.000> a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
much weaker to go in the back hand and a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.390 
much weaker to go in the back hand and a
forehand<00:02:31.510> we<00:02:31.750> have<00:02:31.840> all<00:02:32.170> our<00:02:32.380> body<00:02:32.590> behind<00:02:32.950> on

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
forehand we have all our body behind on

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.870 
forehand we have all our body behind on
the<00:02:33.640> backhand<00:02:34.090> all<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.660> have<00:02:34.840> is<00:02:35.290> our<00:02:35.500> wrist

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
the backhand all we have is our wrist

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.760 
the backhand all we have is our wrist
alright<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.060> top<00:02:37.330> hand<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:38.380> have<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.680> be

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
alright and top hand so we have to be

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.610 
alright and top hand so we have to be
are<00:02:39.010> obviously<00:02:39.610> weaker<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.720> backhand<00:02:41.110> so

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
are obviously weaker on the backhand so

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.020 
are obviously weaker on the backhand so
now<00:02:41.770> we're<00:02:41.980> gonna<00:02:42.070> bring<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.490> stick<00:02:42.790> back

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
now we're gonna bring the stick back

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.930 
now we're gonna bring the stick back
farther<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.720> push<00:02:44.440> straight<00:02:44.770> through<00:02:45.100> back

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
farther and push straight through back

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.510 
farther and push straight through back
farther<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.690> put<00:02:47.350> straight<00:02:47.650> through<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:48.310> do

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
farther and put straight through you do

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520 
farther and put straight through you do
not<00:02:48.700> want<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.030> go<00:02:49.210> on<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.540> pendulum<00:02:50.110> like<00:02:50.260> this

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
not want to go on a pendulum like this

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.330 
not want to go on a pendulum like this
around<00:02:51.190> around<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.540> want<00:02:52.750> back<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.500> through

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
around around you want back and through

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:10.960 
around around you want back and through
back<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.690> slow

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.150 

now<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:12.110> boys<00:03:12.320> are<00:03:12.560> going<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.830> skate<00:03:13.040> around

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
now the boys are going to skate around

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.950 
now the boys are going to skate around
the<00:03:13.460> ice<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.910> they're<00:03:14.300> going<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.540> start<00:03:14.750> from

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
the ice and they're going to start from

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.740 
the ice and they're going to start from
here<00:03:15.020> at<00:03:15.740> this<00:03:15.980> side<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.520> one<00:03:17.210> will<00:03:17.390> be<00:03:17.510> on<00:03:17.630> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
here at this side and one will be on the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.630 
here at this side and one will be on the
forehand<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.320> one<00:03:18.680> will<00:03:18.890> be<00:03:19.010> on<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.280> backhand

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
forehand and one will be on the backhand

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.920 
forehand and one will be on the backhand
so<00:03:19.850> they're<00:03:19.970> obviously<00:03:20.300> going<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.570> pass<00:03:20.750> the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
so they're obviously going to pass the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.170 
so they're obviously going to pass the
puck<00:03:21.050> to<00:03:21.350> an<00:03:21.710> all<00:03:21.860> around<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.220> ice<00:03:22.310> but<00:03:23.000> watch

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
puck to an all around the ice but watch

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.060 
puck to an all around the ice but watch
how<00:03:23.450> they<00:03:23.600> lead<00:03:23.810> each<00:03:24.050> other<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.590> they<00:03:24.920> don't

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
how they lead each other and they don't

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.440 
how they lead each other and they don't
put<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.490> each<00:03:25.700> other<00:03:25.880> skate<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.330> they're

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
put it in each other skate so they're

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.910 
put it in each other skate so they're
gonna<00:03:26.540> put<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.900> puck<00:03:27.110> in<00:03:27.140> front<00:03:27.740> of<00:03:27.830> each

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
gonna put the puck in front of each

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:52.460 
gonna put the puck in front of each
others<00:03:28.220> just<00:03:28.400> get<00:03:28.610> around

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.470 

now<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:53.530> know<00:03:53.680> that's<00:03:53.980> rather<00:03:54.189> basic<00:03:54.580> stop<00:03:55.090> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
now I know that's rather basic stop the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.600 
now I know that's rather basic stop the
more<00:03:55.689> complicated<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:56.470> make<00:03:56.620> things<00:03:56.920> in<00:03:57.129> a

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
more complicated you make things in a

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.330 
more complicated you make things in a
game<00:03:57.790> or<00:03:58.000> in<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.420> practice<00:03:58.900> unless<00:03:59.349> the<00:04:00.069> kids

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
game or in a practice unless the kids

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.119 
game or in a practice unless the kids
will<00:04:00.519> understand<00:04:00.970> making<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.810> simple<00:04:02.260> it's<00:04:02.829> so

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
will understand making it simple it's so

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.190 
will understand making it simple it's so
important<00:04:03.730> I<00:04:03.909> know<00:04:04.150> those<00:04:04.450> are<00:04:04.629> simple<00:04:04.930> drills

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
important I know those are simple drills

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.410 
important I know those are simple drills
but<00:04:05.379> you<00:04:05.500> know<00:04:05.620> what<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:06.010> go<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:06.730> watch<00:04:06.909> NHL

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
they go down in the corner and they do

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.750 
they go down in the corner and they do
exactly<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.260> same<00:04:11.470> thing<00:04:11.769> now<00:04:12.430> we're<00:04:12.640> going

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
exactly the same thing now we're going
