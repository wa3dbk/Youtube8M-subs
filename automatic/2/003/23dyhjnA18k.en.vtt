00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.930
 I heard the following sentence in the series 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.970
 human beings were created with a space for 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.150
 receive the light of God within them 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.350
 when they sinned they went mad for 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.090
 that we may possess but if one of them 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.020
 fill this space with the light of God 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.590
 again only one of them with this light 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.650
 is mightier than legions of us 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.500
 who said this phrase was the actor who 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.850
 was playing the role of Lucifer and not 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.370
 it makes sense 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.640
 I had it in my head very 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.879
 time and I hope you do not go out I am 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.420
 crazy did I need to fill my 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.340
 inner space with the presence of God 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.129
 I have seen so many young people around 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.860
 filling their empty spaces with 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.340
 so many things without them realizing 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.770
 they increase this emptiness and they 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.649
 door for the devil to enter people who 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.320
 they waste so much time with futile things 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.119
 but you do not have a time to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.280
 study the word of god 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.030
 people who want to fill their space 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.820
 with another person with drinks with addictions 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.850
 try to feel full then 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.840
 none of us would feel complete 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.509
 in this world 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.280
 we lose the glory of God in us when 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.680
 sin entered here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.110
 so this fight for what is so 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.979
 detention of the god guys keep the communion 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.850
 because we live in the kingdom of darkness 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.070
 unfortunately when we are in a location 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.259
 full of mud for everything that is on the side 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.280
 It's difficult, we smudged a little bit. 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.290
 more careful than we are or maintain 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.680
 here where I live it rains a lot at the time 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.829
 of the year and not even umbrella solves 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.189
 sometimes you need a cover for 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.740
 wear a garment and understood to put a 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.969
 waterproof cover over everything to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.700
 avoid getting wet 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.439
 but still sometimes his shoe that 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.229
 new waterproof will be all 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.729
 wet the same thing happens with the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.560
 our spiritual life 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.600
 the enemy made this land his empire 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.210
 of malice he knows the human being 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.810
 knows our voids and everything that 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.750
 he wants to invade us by offering things 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.880
 that seem to solve at least 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.750
 temporarily our problems and 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.610
 you and I often accept 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.530
 we often lose the notion that 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.490
 we are on the battlefield between good 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.730
 and evil 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.310
 and this dispute is for human duration 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.010
 we have a God wanting to rescue us 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.440
 initial plan and an enemy wanting us 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.990
 away from all good and the presence of 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.600
 God as well as wanting to dwell in us 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.060
 filling our empty space 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.730
 pay close attention to this report of a 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.580
 book called council for the church that 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.730
 I read that satan see that he is in 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.790
 danger of losing a person and initiative 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.040
 to preserve it there and when the 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.950
 individual is awakened to danger in 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.010
 who is distressed and dangerously 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.710
 search for strength in jesus the enemy fears 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.900
 lose a captive and calls for the 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.390
 his angels in order to curragh laren poor 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.970
 person forming a wall of darkness in 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.590
 around it so that in the light of the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.920
 arrives to where she is 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.310
 the hamas if the person I say 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.230
 perseveres and in his impotence he throws himself 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.570
 on the merits of the blood of Christ 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.600
 Our Savior Hears Fervent Prayer 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.210
 of faith and sends reinforcements from those angels 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.790
 magnificent without power in order to free 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.700
 Satan does not support appealing to the 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.950
 its powerful rival because it fears and 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.250
 before his majesty 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.640
 to the sound of earnest prayer all his 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.310
 army shakes makes sense to you 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.050
 so the phrase I heard on the show 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.210
 I have lived experiences in my life. 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.070
 who feels exactly this happening 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.050
 felt as if she were surrounded by 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.670
 darkness and could not survive 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.800
 that moment 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.170
 I've spent sleepless nights in distress. 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.570
 but I chose to cry and weep before 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.030
 lord for help and if I'm here today 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.820
 speaking to you is because my redeemer 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.070
 my savior is powerful 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.109
 enough to ward off the darkness 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.870
 I have no idea what your 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.060
 battle or if you are living 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.699
 normal life as if I had not even 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.500
 awareness of this spiritual battle 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.410
 I worry a lot with some people. 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.210
 who are called Christians and have no 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.449
 any kind of difficulties and 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.590
 persecutions in a prosperous life 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.380
 too relaxed 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.960
 I'm not here to say that to be 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.660
 Christian, you have to 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.270
 live a difficult life full of struggles 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.400
 but I also say that the normal here is 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.010
 happens when you are trying to 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.410
 to look more like Jesus and live like him 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.289
 lived is to suffer is to be persecuted 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.120
 problems this is normal because 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.979
 if I want to look like jesus 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.880
 I will also take part of your 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:09.310
 sufferings and persecutions dear friend 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.229
 My friend, you're here with me. 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.270
 I did not come here just counts thanks 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.940
 For you to say that's it, we're ready. 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.150
 in the dark world and it's over but I came here 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.419
 say that there is hope the good part of 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.970
 The text I read is you can launch and 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:28.270
 ask the one you cry to God for 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:32.229
 fill its void with the presence 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.570
 there is no darkness to resist his light. 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.760
 I'm worried about you with you. 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.930
 who is not aware of the signs of 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.520
 Christ face 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.680
 You who do not read the Bible 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.650
 with you that you do not even know what 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.229
 happens in this world but I worry about the 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.479
 who live by living who prioritize everything 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.520
 in life less the presence of God of the 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.150
 holy spirit and is also concerned 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.060
 you are going through a chase and 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.599
 improve to plead plead you quit 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.240
 delivers the points and who is already 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.310
 defeated by the cross of Christ his 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.310
 enemy is strong yes but he already has 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.460
 final sentence he has already lost are 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.729
 mighty in Christ to overcome evil 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.039
 to beat legions of them with the presence 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:21.190
 of the light of God in us 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:23.680
 This light needs to shine more on you. 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.400
 This happens when you have a 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.930
 besides thirst for god I pray that the 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.600
 holy spirit touch in your heart 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.669
 through everything you've heard and taken 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.940
 the decision to repent if you surrender and 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.720
 say sir here is an empty space 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.090
 God 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.039
 I fill in because I want your light on 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.870
 me and not the darkness 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:46.330
 I want to overcome evil, I want the 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.080
 power inside of me against my 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:52.479
 trends but it should be serious and 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.729
 coming to war against evil 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:57.210
 to which we already have the victory that God 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:57.210
 bless you
