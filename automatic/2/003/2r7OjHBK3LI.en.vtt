was surprised i don't even happen that

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.380 
was surprised i don't even happen that
often<00:02:29.290> that's<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> 1<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:31.040> 150<00:02:31.970> chance

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
often that's like a 1 in 150 chance

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.260 
often that's like a 1 in 150 chance
right<00:02:32.600> there<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.260> said<00:02:33.440> now<00:02:33.650> moved<00:02:33.950> and
