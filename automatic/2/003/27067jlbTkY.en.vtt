00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.980
 maybe not so much activist yes 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.709
 you have to activate it 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.230
 I like to do it in time I want to 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:09.690

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:17.190
 to return here descola well long 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.290
 however, we are very much at my 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.900
 fucking session with his wife that I'll 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.470

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.650
 wait there was not another 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.970
 machine actively also to tangi this 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.750
 theme I do not know why I feel it 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.549
 it is to mark when it is the end 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.239
 usually yes it's open behind 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.540
 it's open to all in the beginning all of us 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.160
 beginnings to open up yeah knew justin 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.739
 that this is the end of the journey for that the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.640
 aisles there 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.200
 we are not afraid of anything at the door or the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.859
 ball and we all go at the same time go 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.859
 go go go go 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.799
 in this case and undermines the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.180
 doors there are doors must be very 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.769
 strong on the barrels as would the 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.890
 metals but what is it? 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.729
 an enigma for the key words it takes 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:22.350
 put something on a cardboard 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:26.820
 kind of cardboard a jump that's no ca the 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:31.680
 same size and the same face and that hop there 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:34.460
 it was downright fun justice served me 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.419
 yes that's it yeah in addition yes yes but 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.650
 still young I do not know but I 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.690
 sought especially level one does 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.389
 beware of you there is not to say it I 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.270

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.380
 feel the pop dance 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.680

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:59.010
 a shelf here wait wait 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:05:02.160

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.630

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.160
 bar of ram

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.570
 swings and you have control at the same 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.570
 time finally on the end of your jump yes 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.770

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.750
 we do not know who it is we do not know who 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.780
