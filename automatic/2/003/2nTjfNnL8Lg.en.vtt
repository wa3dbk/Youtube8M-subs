see<00:00:56.730> right<00:00:56.760> there<00:00:57.090> power<00:00:57.329> saver<00:00:57.690> optimize

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
see right there power saver optimize

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.799 
see right there power saver optimize
battery<00:00:58.890> life<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.690> this

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
battery life so that is on but this

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
battery life so that is on but this
thing<00:01:01.050> does<00:01:01.230> last<00:01:01.469> me<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:01.710> day<00:01:02.160> without<00:01:02.340> any

my note 3 camera better that high a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.890 
my note 3 camera better that high a
megapixel<00:01:35.040> reading<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.750> lot

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
megapixel reading is just just a lot

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.390 
megapixel reading is just just a lot
better<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.350> opinion<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:38.070> get<00:01:38.189> better
