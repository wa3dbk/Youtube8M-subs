00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
can see that the leaves grow at the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.710 
can see that the leaves grow at the
exact<00:00:19.710> same<00:00:19.980> point<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.820> stem<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.390> both

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
exact same point on the stem on both

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.439 
exact same point on the stem on both
sides<00:00:22.460> which<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.670> something<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.029> all<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
sides which is something that all the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.400 
sides which is something that all the
eupatorium<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.820> it's<00:00:26.820> very<00:00:26.939> pretty<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:30.410> it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
eupatorium is do it's very pretty and it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.220 
eupatorium is do it's very pretty and it
stays<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:32.070> bud<00:00:32.430> stage<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.270> quite<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> while<00:00:33.809> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
stays in bud stage for quite a while so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
stays in bud stage for quite a while so
once<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.890> starts<00:00:35.250> budding<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.910> get<00:00:36.090> really

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
once it starts budding up we get really

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.150 
once it starts budding up we get really
excited<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.380> bones<00:00:37.559> that's<00:00:37.739> almost<00:00:37.920> ready

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
excited the bones that's almost ready

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.709 
excited the bones that's almost ready
should<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.579> offer<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> people<00:00:39.090> next<00:00:39.570> week

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
should we offer it to people next week

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.750 
should we offer it to people next week
and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.320> takes<00:00:40.590> about<00:00:40.710> three<00:00:41.280> weeks

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and then it takes about three weeks

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
and then it takes about three weeks
until<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> actually<00:00:42.629> starts<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> open<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
until it actually starts to open up and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.490 
until it actually starts to open up and
this<00:00:44.789> bones<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.510> being<00:00:45.750> grown<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.200> partial

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
this bones that's being grown in partial

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.910 
this bones that's being grown in partial
shade<00:00:47.300> in<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.690> shade<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.230> Eastern<00:00:49.649> black

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
shade in the shade of Eastern black

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.450 
shade in the shade of Eastern black
cherry<00:00:50.280> trees<00:00:50.670> cottonwoods<00:00:51.739> some<00:00:52.739> cascara

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.689 

currants<00:00:58.430> and<00:01:00.710> there's<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.190> marshmallow

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
currants and there's this marshmallow

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.390 
currants and there's this marshmallow
right<00:01:03.149> behind<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.830> harvest<00:01:08.220> it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
right behind it and so we harvest it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
right behind it and so we harvest it
with<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> sickles<00:01:09.479> again<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:12.619> generally

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
with the sickles again and generally

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.760 
with the sickles again and generally
well<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.760> bones<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.390> cut<00:01:15.659> down<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
well on bones that we cut down to the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.039 
well on bones that we cut down to the
yellow<00:01:17.100> leaves<00:01:17.700> which<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.509> don't<00:01:18.750> really

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
yellow leaves which these don't really

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.550 
yellow leaves which these don't really
have<00:01:19.320> any<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:21.600> would<00:01:21.750> still<00:01:22.049> need<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> leave

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
have any so we would still need to leave

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.670 
have any so we would still need to leave
at<00:01:22.740> least<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.630> or<00:01:24.630> two<00:01:24.659> sets<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.290> leaves<00:01:25.470> at

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
at least one or two sets of leaves at

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.719 
at least one or two sets of leaves at
the<00:01:25.710> bottom<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.520> still

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the bottom so it can still

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.109 
the bottom so it can still
photosynthesize<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:28.020> make<00:01:28.380> its<00:01:28.700> next<00:01:29.700> growth

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
photosynthesize to make its next growth

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.620 
photosynthesize to make its next growth
so<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.229> grow<00:01:31.380> again<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.210> be<00:01:33.210> healthy

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so that it can grow again and be healthy

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.289 
so that it can grow again and be healthy
and<00:01:33.810> keep<00:01:34.110> its<00:01:34.290> roots<00:01:34.970> thriving<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.150> can

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and keep its roots thriving so I can

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.660 
and keep its roots thriving so I can
make<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.450> through<00:01:36.659> winter<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.500> perennial

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.740 

wonderful<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:44.970> again<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.329> harvest<00:01:45.630> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
wonderful and so again you harvest it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.020 
wonderful and so again you harvest it
when<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.140> full<00:01:46.320> bloom<00:01:46.560> yeah<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.579> mean

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
