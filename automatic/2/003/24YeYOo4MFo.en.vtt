00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello here I am again new wwe 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.629
 collectors 14 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.010
 and what is that yes you see here 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.320
 already an empty shelf around a loose 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.070
 Figures were always in it that they only 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.000
 still packed 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.260
 Now that's the reason for it 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.920
 why I'm doing this video now 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:29.869
 and yes, here are the two 23 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.009
 and the wind with mandy still has to be done 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.219
 be cleaned up with a movie now 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.850
 new camera you have synonymous hd I know 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.520
 not if you notice it and show it now 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.940
 I tell you but I know the 97 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.730
 the person loosely applied the table 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.379
 made with all his news figures 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.379
 and I've cleared out now 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.050
 I actually wiped dust and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.320
 that's why I have everyone now 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.809
 on a spot in our storeroom 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.149
 put on a big table 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.540
 then we go in here now and 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.720
 Here you can see all my wwe 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:17.220
 Mattel loose figures so that's possible 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:20.790
 Here are the elite everything so that is 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.080
 I counted that is 430 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:31.229
 the pieces now on the table here 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:38.640
 are different so yes you can 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:41.240
 everyone here sees the basics the tu packs 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.240
 come then 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.520
 here come the battle pack and 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.890
 Here I have a department here 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:02:09.190
 here come the pay per views pay per 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:13.360
 views everything here the elite song 116 the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.280
 Wrestlemania exclusive double the me 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.680
 the two clubs are already in front of me 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.209
 have the let's dance here for me 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.450
 that somehow pleases on the table 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.280
 no idea really good 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.349
 you can see her again 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.209
 overview of the blues table so that 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.940
 really almost the whole table was full 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.290
 can see here but I find it right 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.209
 as cool as that looks 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.730
 but they will probably be back 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.549
 come back to the shelf and you 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.690
 Decide now if I have the new ones 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:52.350
 basics we go back out with stand 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.510
 everything else we have rearranged everything 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:01.180
 if I the new basics you I to 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:04.660
 Number 1 to number 52 with mason 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.280
 Ryan completely off if I unpack 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.319
 should or not 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.200
 I do not have so much space yet 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.959
 but maybe i will come to blood 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.880
 and you could then I would be 52 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:25.359
 unboxing make figures or even near 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:28.780
 55 because there are three of the basic 23 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.750
 then yes, you too 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.280
 decides if I should leave like that 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.079
 By numbers, that also looks right 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.190
 horny but I could me too 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.019
 Imagine doing the kids here and all 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.569
 Although there are in germany the 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.340

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.380
 mason ryan 9 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.299
 and so unpack the new characters 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.000
 I could actually correct myself 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.820
 well imagine 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.680
