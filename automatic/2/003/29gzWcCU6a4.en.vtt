whatever you want
it's<00:03:21.140> just<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.350> I'm<00:03:21.470> using<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:23.209> RCA<00:03:23.630> for

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
it's just that I'm using the the RCA for

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.960 
it's just that I'm using the the RCA for
this<00:03:24.050> example<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.340> plug<00:03:25.520> it<00:03:25.670> in<00:03:25.760> for

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
this example so you plug it in for

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.690 
this example so you plug it in for
normal<00:03:26.330> so<00:03:26.570> into<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:26.959> input<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.500> normal<00:03:27.860> simple

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
normal so into the input a normal simple

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.390 
normal so into the input a normal simple
as<00:03:28.910> that<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:30.880> then<00:03:31.880> you'd<00:03:32.060> plug<00:03:33.370> one<00:03:34.370> end

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
as that and then you'd plug one end

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.870 
as that and then you'd plug one end
above<00:03:35.300> your<00:03:35.570> three<00:03:36.410> pin<00:03:36.650> RCA<00:03:37.520> and

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
above your three pin RCA and

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.920 
above your three pin RCA and
mouth-to-mouth<00:03:38.209> connection<00:03:38.959> into<00:03:39.830> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
mouth-to-mouth connection into the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.930 
mouth-to-mouth connection into the
easycap<00:03:41.930> so<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.950> normal<00:03:43.600> white<00:03:44.600> clothes<00:03:44.810> -<00:03:44.990> why

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
easycap so a normal white clothes - why

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.510

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.270 
obviously um the remainder is an s-video
it's<00:03:52.640> an<00:03:52.730> alternative<00:03:53.270> connection<00:03:54.280> dominated

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
it's an alternative connection dominated

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.360 
it's an alternative connection dominated
it<00:03:55.640> replaces<00:03:55.970> di<00:03:56.740> but<00:03:57.740> for<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.010> set<00:03:58.190> up<00:03:58.280> I'm

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
it replaces di but for the set up I'm

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.190 
it replaces di but for the set up I'm
just<00:03:58.400> going<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.760> use<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.120> RCA<00:03:59.540> so<00:03:59.660> once<00:04:00.050> your

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
just going to use the RCA so once your

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.160 
just going to use the RCA so once your
what<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:01.340> other<00:04:01.520> end<00:04:01.790> of<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.660> RCA

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
what that the other end of the RCA

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.220 
what that the other end of the RCA
cables<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:03.830> just<00:04:04.040> taping<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:05.050> leftover<00:04:06.050> or

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
cables so just taping the leftover or

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.550 
cables so just taping the leftover or
gross<00:04:06.440> simply<00:04:06.800> into<00:04:07.010> your<00:04:07.130> output<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:09.320> this

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
gross simply into your output and this

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.729 
gross simply into your output and this
is<00:04:09.620> as<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:10.550> do<00:04:10.670> not<00:04:10.820> normally<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:12.260> airport

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
is as you do not normally the airport

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.240 
is as you do not normally the airport
has<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.250> be<00:04:13.510> RCA<00:04:14.510> or<00:04:14.930> converted<00:04:15.470> into<00:04:15.590> RCA<00:04:16.130> so

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
has to be RCA or converted into RCA so

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.090 
has to be RCA or converted into RCA so
it<00:04:16.609> will<00:04:16.730> fit<00:04:17.000> into<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.450> easycap<00:04:18.100> ICSD

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
it will fit into the easycap ICSD

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.620 
it will fit into the easycap ICSD
anything<00:04:19.460> will<00:04:19.580> set<00:04:19.820> up<00:04:19.910> as<00:04:20.060> well<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:20.510> need

anything will set up as well so you need

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.540 
anything will set up as well so you need
an<00:04:20.780> output<00:04:21.020> and<00:04:21.530> you

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
an output and you

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.899 
an output and you
-<00:04:22.639> heavy<00:04:23.560> RCIA<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.680> all<00:04:24.770> converted<00:04:25.310> into<00:04:25.430> RCA

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
- heavy RCIA it all converted into RCA

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.740 
- heavy RCIA it all converted into RCA
or<00:04:26.360> lb<00:04:27.110> uh<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:28.580> we<00:04:28.729> can<00:04:28.879> now<00:04:29.030> go<00:04:29.240> into<00:04:29.449> these<00:04:29.539> you

go into the USB slot

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.670 
go into the USB slot
simple<00:04:45.860> as<00:04:45.949> that<00:04:46.129> I<00:04:47.110> can<00:04:48.110> get<00:04:48.229> there<00:04:48.379> mangle

and then that will go into the other

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.020 
and then that will go into the other
connection<00:04:54.590> like<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:55.520> said<00:04:55.699> I've<00:04:55.789> got<00:04:55.819> the
