the<00:00:29.609> first<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.779> cross<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the first is you have to cross the

the<00:00:33.660> second<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.230> limit<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.739> amount<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.100> red

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the second is to limit the amount of red

detected anyway the first part of the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.319 
detected anyway the first part of the
mission<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.250> course<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.879> make<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.180> across

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
mission is of course to make it across

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.580 
mission is of course to make it across
the<00:00:45.510> battlefield<00:00:45.899> without<00:00:46.020> taking<00:00:46.469> any

the battlefield without taking any

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.650 
the battlefield without taking any
damage<00:00:46.770> now<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.910> there's<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.270> simple

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
damage now to do this there's one simple

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
damage now to do this there's one simple
trick<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.410> watch<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.100> British

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
trick and that is to watch the British

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.450 
trick and that is to watch the British
line<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.940> fire<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.899> see<00:00:52.110> or<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.100> units

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
line of fire when you see or the units

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.580 
line of fire when you see or the units
open<00:00:53.670> fire<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> few<00:00:55.140> seconds

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
open fire then you have a few seconds

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.490 
open fire then you have a few seconds
freely<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.399> move<00:00:56.610> between<00:00:56.820> cover<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.140> as<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
freely to move between cover so as you

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.060 
freely to move between cover so as you
see<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.160> wait<00:00:59.399> until<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.629> fire

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
see here I wait until all of them fire

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.889 
see here I wait until all of them fire
here<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:02.789> you're<00:01:02.910> able<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.300> move<00:01:03.449> freely

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
here and then you're able to move freely

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.500 
here and then you're able to move freely
you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.070> move<00:01:05.220> before<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> want<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.360> but

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
you can move before if you want to but

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.719 
you can move before if you want to but
it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.810> bit<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.260> risk<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.070> move<00:01:08.310> when

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it is a bit of a risk you can move when

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.300 
it is a bit of a risk you can move when
only<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.210> few<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.869> units<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.350> fired<00:01:10.650> but

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
only a few of the units have fired but

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.789 
only a few of the units have fired but
like<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.000> said<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.390> probably<00:01:12.570> safer<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> wait

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
like I said it's probably safer to wait

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.530 
like I said it's probably safer to wait
until<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> mass<00:01:14.430> majority<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:15.180> them<00:01:15.360> have

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
until the mass majority of them have

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.539 
until the mass majority of them have
fired<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.560> don't<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> rush<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
fired you don't have to rush here you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.520 
fired you don't have to rush here you
can<00:01:17.850> take<00:01:18.090> your<00:01:18.240> time<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
can take your time all you have to do is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
can take your time all you have to do is
keep<00:01:19.740> her<00:01:19.890> eye<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> British<00:01:20.970> firing<00:01:21.390> line

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
keep her eye on the British firing line

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.390 
keep her eye on the British firing line
and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.470> easily<00:01:22.740> make<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.100> across

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and then you can easily make it across

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.830 
and then you can easily make it across
the<00:01:23.580> battlefield<00:01:23.970> without<00:01:24.060> taking<00:01:24.600> any

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the battlefield without taking any

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
the battlefield without taking any
damage<00:01:24.930> at<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.580> now<00:01:26.580> once<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.850> made<00:01:27.000> it

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
damage at all now once you made it

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.310 
damage at all now once you made it
across<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> battlefield<00:01:27.630> you'll<00:01:27.960> come<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
across the battlefield you'll come to a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.230 
across the battlefield you'll come to a
wooded<00:01:28.740> area<00:01:28.770> where<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.640> are<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.820> few

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
wooded area where there are a few

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
wooded area where there are a few
British<00:01:30.509> patrols<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.770> take<00:01:32.009> them<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.250> if

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
British patrols you can take them out if

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
British patrols you can take them out if
you<00:01:32.520> want<00:01:32.549> because<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> constraint<00:01:33.630> for

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
you want because the constraint for

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.690 
you want because the constraint for
minimizing<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> amount<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.009> Redcoat<00:01:35.430> kills

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
minimizing the amount of Redcoat kills

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.060 
minimizing the amount of Redcoat kills
is<00:01:35.850> not<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.240> effect<00:01:36.360> yet<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.799> kill

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
is not in effect yet so you can kill

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.010 
is not in effect yet so you can kill
them<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.430> wish<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.360> find<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> quicker

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
them if you wish but I find it quicker

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.050 
them if you wish but I find it quicker
and<00:01:40.259> easier<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.280> climb<00:01:41.520> across<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and easier to just climb across the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.740 
and easier to just climb across the
treetops

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
treetops
