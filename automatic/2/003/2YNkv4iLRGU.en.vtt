00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.730 
that sometimes you go in a bit pre or
you<00:05:21.390> go<00:05:21.510> in<00:05:21.630> like<00:05:21.660> after<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.080> do<00:05:22.170> it<00:05:22.200> once<00:05:22.530> and

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
you go in like after you do it once and

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.830 
you go in like after you do it once and
then<00:05:22.920> it<00:05:22.950> doesn't<00:05:23.250> work<00:05:23.580> so<00:05:24.480> you<00:05:24.600> might<00:05:24.750> have

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
then it doesn't work so you might have

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.380 
then it doesn't work so you might have
to<00:05:24.930> do<00:05:25.050> it<00:05:25.170> twice<00:05:25.290> or<00:05:25.620> three<00:05:25.890> times<00:05:25.920> but<00:05:26.910> once

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
to do it twice or three times but once

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.330 
to do it twice or three times but once
you've<00:05:27.570> done<00:05:27.750> it<00:05:27.810> eventually<00:05:28.770> what's<00:05:29.130> going

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
you've done it eventually what's going

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.520 
you've done it eventually what's going
to<00:05:29.400> happen<00:05:29.730> is<00:05:29.960> you're<00:05:30.960> going<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.170> be<00:05:31.260> able<00:05:31.290> to

in there and it seems to work and then I

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.200 
in there and it seems to work and then I
made<00:06:16.980> everything<00:06:17.250> so<00:06:17.610> that<00:06:17.640> you<00:06:17.850> don't<00:06:18.060> have

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
made everything so that you don't have

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.850 
made everything so that you don't have
to<00:06:18.420> go<00:06:18.540> in<00:06:18.690> and<00:06:18.840> playing<00:06:19.050> what<00:06:19.230> Matt<00:06:19.380> address

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
to go in and playing what Matt address

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.370 
to go in and playing what Matt address
you<00:06:20.310> just<00:06:20.520> go<00:06:21.060> in<00:06:21.240> you<00:06:21.480> download<00:06:21.870> the<00:06:21.990> app<00:06:22.020> and

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
you just go in you download the app and

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.340 
you just go in you download the app and
then<00:06:23.070> you<00:06:23.940> install<00:06:24.390> it<00:06:24.420> you<00:06:24.870> have<00:06:24.990> to<00:06:25.140> clear

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
then you install it you have to clear

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.320 
then you install it you have to clear
cache<00:06:25.560> maybe<00:06:25.890> twice<00:06:26.220> maybe<00:06:26.520> three<00:06:26.880> times<00:06:26.910> but

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
cache maybe twice maybe three times but

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.490 
cache maybe twice maybe three times but
then<00:06:27.480> that's<00:06:27.630> it<00:06:27.930> and<00:06:28.110> then<00:06:28.230> you<00:06:28.320> have<00:06:28.470> your

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500
