three-piece in years past there is the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.390 
three-piece in years past there is the
black<00:02:22.579> cone

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
black cone

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.759 
black cone
and<00:02:23.720> then<00:02:24.720> there<00:02:24.959> was<00:02:25.080> kind<00:02:25.409> of<00:02:25.560> this

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
and then there was kind of this

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.250 
and then there was kind of this
patterned<00:02:26.400> piece<00:02:26.790> called<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.390> blank<00:02:27.750> put<00:02:28.110> on

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
patterned piece called a blank put on

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.100 
patterned piece called a blank put on
top<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.799> then<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.610> slide<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.480> then<00:02:30.959> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
top and then the slide and then the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.899 
top and then the slide and then the
mouthpiece<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:32.129> like<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> 3-piece

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
mouthpiece so it's like a 3-piece

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.360 
mouthpiece so it's like a 3-piece
mouthpiece<00:02:33.390> attended<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.110> leak<00:02:34.370> they've

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
mouthpiece attended the leak they've

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.250 
mouthpiece attended the leak they've
actually<00:02:35.670> pioneered<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.569> use<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.810> a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
actually pioneered the use of a

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.050 
actually pioneered the use of a
two-piece<00:02:37.709> mouthpiece<00:02:38.280> where<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.849> have

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
two-piece mouthpiece where you just have

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.160 
two-piece mouthpiece where you just have
the<00:02:39.239> slide<00:02:39.599> on<00:02:40.049> top<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.730> column<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.420> you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the slide on top of the column and you

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.250 
the slide on top of the column and you
have<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.560> mouthpiece<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.549> it<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.540> doesn't

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
have the mouthpiece so it it doesn't

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.960 
have the mouthpiece so it it doesn't
leak<00:02:46.440> air<00:02:46.709> which<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.489> something<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.940> really

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
leak air which is something I really

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.080 
leak air which is something I really
like<00:02:48.420> also<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.470> look<00:02:49.769> at<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.489> shaping<00:02:50.970> of

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
like also if you look at the shaping of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.600 
like also if you look at the shaping of
the<00:02:51.239> mouthpiece<00:02:51.500> you'll<00:02:52.500> see<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.340> is

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
the mouthpiece you'll see that it is

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.780 
the mouthpiece you'll see that it is
rounded<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.629> not<00:02:54.930> angular<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.129> find<00:02:56.519> that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
rounded and not angular and I find that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.520 
rounded and not angular and I find that
that's<00:02:57.239> more<00:02:57.569> comfortable<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.319> mouth<00:02:58.500> and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
that's more comfortable to the mouth and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.550 
that's more comfortable to the mouth and
also<00:02:58.859> makes<00:02:59.400> playing<00:02:59.760> octaves<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.810> little

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
also makes playing octaves a little

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.190 
also makes playing octaves a little
easier<00:03:02.040> now<00:03:02.340> what<00:03:02.579> is<00:03:02.700> an<00:03:02.819> octave<00:03:03.269> that's<00:03:03.540> two

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
easier now what is an octave that's two

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.199 
easier now what is an octave that's two
notes<00:03:04.530> which<00:03:05.310> are<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.700> same<00:03:05.940> note<00:03:06.180> but

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
notes which are the same note but

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.899 
notes which are the same note but
separated<00:03:07.019> by<00:03:07.230> one<00:03:07.829> octave<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.459> an<00:03:08.519> example

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
separated by one octave and an example

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.000 
separated by one octave and an example
would<00:03:09.120> be<00:03:09.269> this

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.509 

two<00:03:15.010> notes<00:03:15.219> separated<00:03:15.819> by<00:03:15.939> an<00:03:16.030> octave<00:03:16.799> now<00:03:17.799> the

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
two notes separated by an octave now the

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.580 
two notes separated by an octave now the
other<00:03:18.700> thing<00:03:18.999> that<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:19.450> is<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.719> this

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
other thing that I like is that this

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.089 
other thing that I like is that this
particular<00:03:21.489> instrument<00:03:22.079> comes<00:03:23.079> from<00:03:23.469> factory

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
particular instrument comes from factory

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.610 
particular instrument comes from factory
pretty<00:03:24.730> much<00:03:24.939> correctly<00:03:25.569> tuned<00:03:25.930> which<00:03:26.469> I

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
pretty much correctly tuned which I

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.800 
pretty much correctly tuned which I
really<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:27.189> and<00:03:27.519> they're<00:03:28.120> phosphor<00:03:28.629> bronze

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
really like and they're phosphor bronze

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.530 
really like and they're phosphor bronze
reeds<00:03:29.379> so<00:03:29.950> they<00:03:30.069> have<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.280> little<00:03:30.609> bit<00:03:30.819> deeper

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
reeds so they have a little bit deeper

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.240 
reeds so they have a little bit deeper
tone<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.379> my<00:03:32.560> ear<00:03:32.950> then<00:03:33.879> let's<00:03:34.510> say<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:35.250> brass

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
tone to my ear then let's say a brass

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.629 
tone to my ear then let's say a brass
Reed<00:03:36.849> so<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:38.170> has<00:03:38.439> a<00:03:38.469> tone<00:03:38.950> that's<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.370> little

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
Reed so it has a tone that's a little

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.970 
Reed so it has a tone that's a little
bit<00:03:39.790> rounder<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.719> a<00:03:40.900> little<00:03:41.169> darker<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.829> I

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
bit rounder and a little darker and I

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.069 
bit rounder and a little darker and I
like<00:03:42.219> that<00:03:42.549> now<00:03:43.180> one<00:03:43.419> of<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.569> things<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:43.959> was

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
like that now one of the things I was

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.780 
like that now one of the things I was
concerned<00:03:44.290> about<00:03:44.950> having<00:03:45.219> been<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.549> Hohner

it would be missing some of the high

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.509 
it would be missing some of the high
overtones<00:04:11.019> but<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.439> has<00:04:11.620> not<00:04:11.859> been<00:04:12.159> an<00:04:12.340> issue
