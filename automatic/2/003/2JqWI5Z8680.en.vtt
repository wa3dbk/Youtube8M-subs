essentially you could do the same with
any<00:03:00.989> cartridge<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.139> wanted<00:03:02.530> assuming<00:03:03.280> it's

any cartridge you wanted assuming it's

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.910 
any cartridge you wanted assuming it's

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
got CIC to some of the later cartridges

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.129 
got CIC to some of the later cartridges
it's<00:03:09.129> built<00:03:09.370> into<00:03:09.720> their<00:03:10.720> own<00:03:10.840> hands<00:03:11.049> and

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
it's built into their own hands and

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:17.759 
it's built into their own hands and
chips<00:03:15.120> there<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.180> go<00:03:16.239> then<00:03:16.739> thanks<00:03:17.739> for

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
chips there you go then thanks for
