another time each week I've got a
question<00:03:19.250> on<00:03:19.519> how<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.850> texture<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
question on how the texture is the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.190 
question on how the texture is the
texture<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.860> hair<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:23.110> is<00:03:24.580> it's<00:03:25.580> not<00:03:26.239> silky

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
texture of the hair is is it's not silky

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.410 
texture of the hair is is it's not silky
it's<00:03:27.410> not<00:03:27.560> like<00:03:27.709> Indian<00:03:28.190> hair<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:28.670> don't<00:03:29.239> think

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
it's not like Indian hair I don't think

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.940 
it's not like Indian hair I don't think
it's<00:03:29.510> like<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.810> zillion<00:03:30.170> is<00:03:30.410> closer<00:03:30.769> to

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
it's like the zillion is closer to

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.699 
it's like the zillion is closer to
Indian<00:03:31.370> hair<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.760> brazilian<00:03:32.480> hair<00:03:32.720> but<00:03:33.440> it's

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
Indian hair the brazilian hair but it's

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.690 
Indian hair the brazilian hair but it's
more<00:03:34.040> dense<00:03:34.400> than<00:03:34.989> Indian<00:03:35.989> hair<00:03:36.260> but<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.220> little

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
more dense than Indian hair but a little

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.880 
more dense than Indian hair but a little
bit<00:03:37.790> less<00:03:38.030> dense<00:03:38.390> than

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
bit less dense than

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.550 
bit less dense than
brazilian<00:03:39.520> hair<00:03:39.550> I<00:03:40.000> like<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.780> texture<00:03:41.170> i<00:03:41.290> like

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560

closure<00:03:50.020> on<00:03:50.319> top<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:51.700> not<00:03:51.819> that<00:03:52.090> different

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
closure on top it's not that different

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.809 
closure on top it's not that different
from<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:53.170> Peruvian<00:03:53.470> but<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.370> can<00:03:54.550> tell<00:03:54.790> that

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
from the Peruvian but you can tell that

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.860 
from the Peruvian but you can tell that
this<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:56.230> Brazilian<00:03:56.860> has<00:03:57.220> more<00:03:57.850> texture<00:03:58.540> than

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
this the Brazilian has more texture than

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.199 
this the Brazilian has more texture than
the<00:03:58.990> peruvian<00:03:59.770> hair<00:03:59.950> but<00:04:00.760> they<00:04:00.910> blend

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
the peruvian hair but they blend

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.580 
the peruvian hair but they blend
perfectly<00:04:03.240> okay<00:04:04.240> so<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:04.840> guess<00:04:05.050> that's<00:04:05.380> all<00:04:05.560> I
