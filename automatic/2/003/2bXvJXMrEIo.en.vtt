00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
it

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.089 
it
I<00:04:34.410> think<00:04:36.349> that's<00:04:37.349> not<00:04:37.440> going<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.680> follow<00:04:37.919> our

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
I think that's not going to follow our

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.580 
I think that's not going to follow our
deal<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:38.970> we<00:04:39.690> bought<00:04:39.870> them<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:40.020> second<00:04:40.259> home<00:04:40.410> or

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
deal so we bought them a second home or

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.960 
deal so we bought them a second home or
just<00:04:40.830> discussing<00:04:41.220> do<00:04:41.340> we<00:04:41.430> give<00:04:41.550> them<00:04:41.639> a<00:04:41.759> piece

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
just discussing do we give them a piece

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.740 
just discussing do we give them a piece
each<00:04:42.210> or<00:04:42.690> do<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.810> give<00:04:42.930> them<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.110> sack<00:04:43.320> of<00:04:43.530> cold

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
each or do you give them a sack of cold

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.100 
each or do you give them a sack of cold
well<00:04:45.750> it's<00:04:45.960> frozen<00:04:46.169> convoluted<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:47.990> think<00:04:48.990> more

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
well it's frozen convoluted I think more

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.990 
well it's frozen convoluted I think more
of<00:04:49.139> an<00:04:49.229> impact<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.710> whole<00:04:49.949> bag<00:04:50.160> of<00:04:50.190> calm<00:04:50.580> if

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
of an impact is a whole bag of calm if

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.400 
of an impact is a whole bag of calm if
they're<00:04:51.180> both<00:04:51.330> got<00:04:51.539> a<00:04:51.570> bag<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.780> cold<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.259> it

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
they're both got a bag of cold and it

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.610 
they're both got a bag of cold and it
kind<00:04:52.620> of<00:04:52.650> works<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:54.229> think<00:04:55.229> we<00:04:55.289> just<00:04:55.380> have<00:04:55.530> to

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
kind of works I think we just have to

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.960 
kind of works I think we just have to
see<00:04:55.740> how<00:04:55.860> well<00:04:56.039> then<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.220> have<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.400> share
