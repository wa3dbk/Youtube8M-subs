office gave me far more protected inside
of<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.610> case<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.870> other<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.170> also

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
of this case and the other is also

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.680 
of this case and the other is also
shorter<00:00:37.890> designed<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.460> you're<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:39.300> combined

going<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.829> able<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> solve<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.550> complete

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
going to be able to solve the complete

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.940 
going to be able to solve the complete

when you do have your bone inside of
this<00:00:48.840> case<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.829> rim<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.340> case<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.789> very

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
this case the rim on this case is very

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.700 
this case the rim on this case is very
tough<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.690> also<00:00:51.780> quite<00:00:51.989> flexible<00:00:52.260> as

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
tough but it's also quite flexible as

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.139 
tough but it's also quite flexible as
well<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.219> again<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.550> phone<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.940> an<00:00:54.030> upper

you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.100> how<00:00:59.219> easy<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> clip

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
you can see just how easy it was to clip

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.689 
you can see just how easy it was to clip
in<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> case<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.190> back<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> case
