been<00:02:47.270> exactly<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.960> same<00:02:48.170> thing<00:02:48.410> if<00:02:49.040> you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
been exactly the same thing if you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.780 
been exactly the same thing if you
bought<00:02:49.400> one<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.610> these<00:02:49.820> in<00:02:50.650> 92<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:52.460> would<00:02:52.580> say

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
bought one of these in 92 it would say

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.790 
bought one of these in 92 it would say
forward<00:02:53.300> on<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.600> engine<00:02:54.020> right<00:02:54.170> there

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
forward on that engine right there

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.500 
forward on that engine right there
but<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.910> 93<00:02:56.720> Ford<00:02:57.080> bought<00:02:57.290> out<00:02:57.500> Mazda<00:02:58.160> if<00:02:58.820> they

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
but in 93 Ford bought out Mazda if they

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.970 
but in 93 Ford bought out Mazda if they
stopped<00:02:59.810> putting<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.290> Ford<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.770> there

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
stopped putting the Ford on there

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.320 
stopped putting the Ford on there
because<00:03:01.130> they<00:03:01.310> started<00:03:01.670> using<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.090> same

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
because they started using the same

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.690 
because they started using the same
engine<00:03:02.650> right<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:03.830> Mazda<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.550> they

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
engine right in the Mazda so they

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.520 
engine right in the Mazda so they
actually<00:03:04.880> just<00:03:05.240> took<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.600> casting<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.320> cut

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
actually just took the casting and cut

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.770 
actually just took the casting and cut
the<00:03:06.710> Ford<00:03:06.980> off<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.460> casting<00:03:07.970> if<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.570> look

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
the Ford off of the casting if you look

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.210 
the Ford off of the casting if you look
closer<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.260> can<00:03:09.350> actually<00:03:09.560> see<00:03:09.920> where<00:03:10.100> the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
closer you can actually see where the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.610 
closer you can actually see where the
where<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.510> cut<00:03:11.720> mark<00:03:11.960> came<00:03:12.230> off<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.440> a

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
where the the cut mark came off of a

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.560 
where the the cut mark came off of a
casting<00:03:13.100> where<00:03:13.220> they<00:03:13.310> cut<00:03:13.520> off<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.910> they

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
casting where they cut off the they

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.750 
casting where they cut off the they
grinded<00:03:14.990> off<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.350> original<00:03:15.740> Ford<00:03:16.370> off<00:03:16.580> the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
grinded off the original Ford off the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.570 
grinded off the original Ford off the
casting<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.480> kind<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.440> funny<00:03:18.680> if<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.400> look

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
casting and kind of funny if you look

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.610 
casting and kind of funny if you look
you<00:03:20.180> know<00:03:20.300> everything<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.020> exactly<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.530> same

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
you know everything is exactly the same

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.830 
you know everything is exactly the same
as<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.040> Mazda<00:03:22.400> truck<00:03:22.640> but<00:03:22.850> be<00:03:23.480> honest<00:03:23.720> it

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
as the Mazda truck but be honest it

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840 
as the Mazda truck but be honest it
wasn't<00:03:24.440> really<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.680> big<00:03:24.890> loss<00:03:25.130> because<00:03:25.430> Mazda

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
wasn't really a big loss because Mazda

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.820 
wasn't really a big loss because Mazda
couldn't<00:03:26.120> build<00:03:26.270> a<00:03:26.360> decent<00:03:26.540> truck<00:03:26.900> at<00:03:27.140> 93

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
couldn't build a decent truck at 93

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.010 
couldn't build a decent truck at 93
Mazda<00:03:28.790> was<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:29.120> about<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.420> worst<00:03:29.450> truck<00:03:29.870> you

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
Mazda was just about the worst truck you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.600 
Mazda was just about the worst truck you
can<00:03:30.200> get<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.590> had<00:03:30.709> all<00:03:30.860> sorts<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.250> engine

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
can get it had all sorts of engine

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.360 
can get it had all sorts of engine
noises<00:03:31.820> and<00:03:32.300> lifter<00:03:32.600> ticks<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.230> heads<00:03:33.890> go<00:03:34.160> bad

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
noises and lifter ticks and heads go bad

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.940 
noises and lifter ticks and heads go bad
and<00:03:34.580> all<00:03:34.700> sorts<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.120> stuff<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:35.690> Ford<00:03:36.560> bottomed

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
and all sorts of stuff so Ford bottomed

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.140 
and all sorts of stuff so Ford bottomed
out<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.489> now<00:03:38.090> Mazda<00:03:38.570> is<00:03:38.630> built<00:03:38.840> by<00:03:38.959> Ford

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150
