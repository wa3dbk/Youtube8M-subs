00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.440
 Syria has passed this 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.440
 when I heard they started operating windows 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.989
 what they have in this case was proven to remove me because it is 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.320
 for the reason that led 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.320
 the one that is missing the file 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.359

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.679
 I squeezed control to the subjects their first goal 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.089
 the solution stream 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.490

 indicate what problems they have 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:33.240

 so 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.980
 what we are going to do is this 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.980
 we are starting windows 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.940

 as he teaches everyone in good 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.350
 what I'm going to do 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.840
 that to stop showing you this is not worth it 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.840
