00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
appear as a level 6 true that would be

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.179 
appear as a level 6 true that would be
pretty<00:01:41.790> good<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> smaller<00:01:42.540> clans<00:01:43.189> extra

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
pretty good for the smaller clans extra

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.389 
pretty good for the smaller clans extra
storage<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.880> war<00:01:45.299> loot<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.960> extra<00:01:46.920> bonus<00:01:47.369> for

storage in war loot and extra bonus for
clan<00:01:47.880> wars<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.329> remember<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> storage<00:01:49.350> is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
clan wars so remember the storage is

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.740 
clan wars so remember the storage is
really<00:01:49.740> critical<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.399> lewdness<00:01:51.299> thorn

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
really critical because lewdness thorn

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.969 
really critical because lewdness thorn
in<00:01:51.869> your<00:01:51.899> clan<00:01:52.229> castle<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.710> best

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
in your clan castle is the best

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.940 
in your clan castle is the best
protected<00:01:53.490> loop<00:01:53.729> there<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.570> two<00:01:55.380> reasons<00:01:55.409> one

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
protected loop there is two reasons one

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.249 
protected loop there is two reasons one
you<00:01:56.250> lose<00:01:56.460> 5%<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.540> entire<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.140> have

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you lose 5% of the entire so if you have

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.050 
you lose 5% of the entire so if you have
a<00:01:58.290> hundred<00:01:58.500> gold<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.610> there<00:01:59.759> you're<00:01:59.969> gonna

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
a hundred gold in there you're gonna

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.969 
a hundred gold in there you're gonna
lose<00:02:00.240> five<00:02:00.540> gold<00:02:00.869> if<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.229> taken<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.799> that's

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
lose five gold if it's taken and that's

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.819 
lose five gold if it's taken and that's
better<00:02:02.250> than<00:02:02.520> anything<00:02:03.360> else<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.810> also<00:02:04.710> it's

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
better than anything else and also it's

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.410 
better than anything else and also it's
right<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.310> center<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.729> your<00:02:05.820> base<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.299> it's

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
right at the center of your base so it's

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.359 
right at the center of your base so it's
harder<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:06.780> people<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.560> usually<00:02:08.039> your

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
harder for people to get to usually your

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.619 
harder for people to get to usually your
clan<00:02:08.550> castle<00:02:08.580> should<00:02:08.970> be<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.179> right<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.420> center

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
clan castle should be it right to center

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.240 
clan castle should be it right to center
in<00:02:09.750> base<00:02:09.869> you're<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> do<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.410> right<00:02:10.619> so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
in base you're going to do that right so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.949 
in base you're going to do that right so
and<00:02:11.879> then<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> war<00:02:12.209> bonus

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
and then a war bonus

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.959 
and then a war bonus
I<00:02:12.989> mean<00:02:13.349> massive<00:02:13.530> these<00:02:13.859> are<00:02:14.010> these<00:02:14.159> these<00:02:14.819> are

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 
I mean massive these are these these are

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.360 
I mean massive these are these these are
really<00:02:15.299> quite<00:02:15.510> normative<00:02:16.200> ideas<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.310> I

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
really quite normative ideas and and I

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.220 
really quite normative ideas and and I
really<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.209> gonna<00:02:18.359> give<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> big

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
really think this is gonna give a big

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.959 
really think this is gonna give a big
incentive<00:02:19.560> for<00:02:19.859> people<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.280> do<00:02:20.400> well<00:02:20.609> in<00:02:20.730> clan

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:20.969 
incentive for people to do well in clan
