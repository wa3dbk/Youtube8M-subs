 from scratch you can not have to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.060
 buy it they did not prove it they have 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.470

 and it tells us that the battery is 2000 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:43.010
 Mertz is very good indeed is the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:45.980

 frontal is 1.2 contains nm nfc that 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.720
 It is also very good and we are going to 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.290
 open the box 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.290

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.750
 presents us 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.460
 of 3 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.270
 let's leave it in the theoretical but already 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.920
 They know we're going to get them out 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.920
 the little things that come here 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:37.380
 ok let's see well really good 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.760
 the dock connection connection to the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.760
 motorola currents 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:48.350
 on this side 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.350
 then we have here 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.590
 usb 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.110
 for 2 for the computer 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.110

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.540
 hannspree 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.600
 to this 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.600
 is for 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.920
 take it out and put it in if I'm not wrong 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.780
 I suppose so 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.740
 and basically that's all I bring 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.740
 annual 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.010

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.910

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.910
 let's go 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.080
 as we had said 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.720
 is in fact megapixels your camera 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:59.000

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.890
 screen 3 of 4.3 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.010
 something very interesting also from this 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.670
 team is that jolie ville and good as 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.670

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.720
 in the confirmed update for the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.720
 next version of android 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.340
 as iniesta that the most hinders 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.640
 they paid well well pegadito 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.120
 but I'm doing it with a 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.120
 hand 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.730
 with the other 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.730
 over here and now 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.310
 let's turn on the team 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.880
 I told them this good I had it I had to 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.880
 turn on to be tested there 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.510
 and I already removed all the ones that are 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.150
 p 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.400
 the configuration of the principle of 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.480
 android 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.019
 that we have here so good 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.550
 we have the microphone 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.419
 front side are your 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.419
 buttons 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.990
 on / off volume and by the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.400
 other side 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.830
 we have 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.830
 what is the ports 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.590
 this is for 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.680
 well we can not see it there says 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:04.500
 the other port 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.500
 is for 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:12.400
 a microsd goes to the side we have there 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.410
 this 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.410
 to load it in port to load it 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.759
 have with the factory living we can 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.759
 see here 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.680
 living room 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:46.930
 and it tires us to focus well 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:50.850
 but 4.1.2 is with the hunger that comes 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.850
 plant 4.3 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.680
 1.2 comes to this double core 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.050
 and a gig of ram really has very very 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.919
 complete the team 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.919
 this 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:09.569
 much 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.790
 compilation comes out 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:27.280

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.440
 Well, it's going to be a review 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:41.260
 about the team 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:45.670
 and good for the moment it would be all 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:49.480
 in Telcel is priced at 3 thousand 500 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.990
 weights 3 thousand 700 3700 sonic and then it is 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.760
