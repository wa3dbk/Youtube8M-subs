00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
a good washing before you put your dough

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.770 
a good washing before you put your dough
out<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.569> get<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.840> out<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:21.989> your<00:02:22.230> bowl<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:23.780> then

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.800 
out so get it out of your bowl and then
just<00:02:25.440> do<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> light<00:02:26.099> meaning<00:02:26.549> basically<00:02:27.209> just

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
just do a light meaning basically just

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.670 
just do a light meaning basically just
to<00:02:27.930> get<00:02:28.049> all<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> ingredients

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
to get all of the ingredients

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.470

this<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.810> few<00:02:42.870> times<00:02:43.139> and<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.680> may<00:02:43.799> need<00:02:44.579> to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
this a few times and you may need to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.120 
this a few times and you may need to
sprinkle<00:02:45.420> your<00:02:46.139> workstation<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.769> little<00:02:47.010> bit

more<00:02:47.370> make<00:02:48.060> sure<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.389> doesn't<00:02:48.540> start<00:02:48.870> sticking

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
more make sure it doesn't start sticking

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.349 
more make sure it doesn't start sticking
and<00:02:51.680> just<00:02:52.680> give<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.010> good<00:02:53.130> need<00:02:53.459> kneading

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
and just give it a good need kneading

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.920 
and just give it a good need kneading
until<00:02:54.510> all<00:02:55.079> of<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:56.340> mixture<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.819> ready<00:02:57.030> is

incorporated and smooth take just a few

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.069 
incorporated and smooth take just a few
more<00:03:03.299> minutes

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
more minutes

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.990 
more minutes
once<00:03:05.069> you're<00:03:05.280> done<00:03:05.459> kneading<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.970> dough

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
once you're done kneading the dough

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.660 
once you're done kneading the dough
break<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.930> apart<00:03:07.019> into<00:03:07.500> little<00:03:07.920> balls<00:03:08.100> about

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
break it apart into little balls about

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.500 
break it apart into little balls about
the<00:03:08.880> size<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.299> golf<00:03:09.480> balls<00:03:10.910> roll<00:03:11.910> them<00:03:12.120> up<00:03:12.239> so

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
the size of golf balls roll them up so

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.059 
the size of golf balls roll them up so
they're<00:03:12.660> nice<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.840> tight<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.620> go<00:03:13.739> ahead<00:03:13.950> and

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
they're nice and tight and go ahead and

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.370 
they're nice and tight and go ahead and
put<00:03:14.220> them<00:03:14.280> on<00:03:14.430> your<00:03:14.579> pan<00:03:17.329> then<00:03:18.329> brush<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.170> top

put them on your pan then brush the top

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.740 
put them on your pan then brush the top
of<00:03:19.590> them<00:03:19.769> with<00:03:20.010> just<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.519> little<00:03:20.549> bit<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.239> melted

so<00:03:37.829> butter<00:03:38.519> them<00:03:38.760> all<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.209> then<00:03:39.540> you're<00:03:39.690> going

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
so butter them all and then you're going

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.600 
so butter them all and then you're going

somewhere
warm<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.870> rise<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:44.269> like<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.390> keep<00:03:45.569> my<00:03:45.719> house

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
warm to rise I like to keep my house

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.770 
warm to rise I like to keep my house
pretty<00:03:46.349> cool<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:47.370> what<00:03:47.609> I<00:03:47.640> do<00:03:47.819> is<00:03:48.329> turn<00:03:48.599> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
pretty cool so what I do is turn the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.259 
pretty cool so what I do is turn the
oven<00:03:48.930> on<00:03:49.230> for<00:03:49.620> just<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:50.069> minute<00:03:50.250> maybe<00:03:50.939> a<00:03:51.060> minute

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
oven on for just a minute maybe a minute

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.000 
oven on for just a minute maybe a minute
and<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.450> half<00:03:51.599> so<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:51.930> starts<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.409> get<00:03:52.560> warm<00:03:52.799> and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
and a half so it starts to get warm and

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.059 
and a half so it starts to get warm and
then<00:03:53.579> put<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:55.079> dough<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.590> oven<00:03:55.680> to

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
then put the the dough in the oven to

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.770 
then put the the dough in the oven to
rise<00:03:56.250> make<00:03:56.790> sure<00:03:56.939> not<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.150> leave<00:03:57.359> your<00:03:57.510> up<00:03:57.629> and

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
rise make sure not to leave your up and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.780 
rise make sure not to leave your up and
on<00:03:57.870> for<00:03:58.170> too<00:03:58.349> long<00:03:58.530> or<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:59.189> might<00:03:59.340> start<00:03:59.670> to

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
on for too long or it might start to

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.179 
on for too long or it might start to
cook<00:03:59.969> the<00:04:00.030> dough<00:04:00.359> and<00:04:00.659> it<00:04:00.780> won't<00:04:00.989> rise<00:04:01.260> it's

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
cook the dough and it won't rise it's

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.490 
cook the dough and it won't rise it's
also<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.639> good<00:04:02.790> idea<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.420> put<00:04:03.659> a<00:04:03.689> little<00:04:03.810> bit<00:04:04.260> of

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
also a good idea to put a little bit of

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.690 
also a good idea to put a little bit of
water<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:05.700> in<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.180> pan<00:04:06.590> underneath<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:08.129> dough

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
water just in a pan underneath the dough

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.640 
water just in a pan underneath the dough
when<00:04:08.939> it's<00:04:09.060> rising<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.900> keep<00:04:10.079> it<00:04:10.230> nice<00:04:10.349> and

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
when it's rising to keep it nice and

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.709 
when it's rising to keep it nice and
humid<00:04:10.829> inside<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.459> your<00:04:11.579> oven<00:04:11.609> this<00:04:12.329> will<00:04:12.540> help

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:12.719 
humid inside of your oven this will help

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:20.449 
humid inside of your oven this will help
