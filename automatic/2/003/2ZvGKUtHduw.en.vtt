00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.649
 we always talk about expensive smartphones 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.480
 but how are those who are in the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.460
 another tip of the cheapest 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:20.189
 market is what we will talk about 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:22.140
 today for this comparative we selected 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.570
 four devices they all found 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 in retail for prices below 500 reais 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.820
 are the optimum nokia lumia 520 of the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.669
 lg 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.420
 the rector of a motorola and xperia e 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.829
 subject matter 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.399
 all have good configurations 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.590
 basic and 43 work with android 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.129
 The exception is that lumen 520 runs 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.129
 windows phone 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.590
 the volume and 521 cheap basic smartphone 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.770
 and very friendly it is the windows phone 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.660
 which sells the most in the world today and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.030
 restrictions that Microsoft imposes on 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.800
 manufacturers adopting windows phone 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.100
 despite the modest configurations he 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.420
 works reasonably well windows phone 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.540
 no longer suffers with the photo of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.610
 applications and overall the quality of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.610
 Construction of the apparatus excelled 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.630
 support digital tv space for three 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.390
 operator chips are the highlights of 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.570
 optimus alive 4 2 but the low definition 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.580
 modest settings and one 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.700
 drawing not very proud the name qo 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.660
 end up leaving behind if comparative 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.660
 there are better options 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.190
 the rigor of one stands out in relation to 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.479
 two comparative androids by 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.640
 amount of ram 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.619
 it comes with a gigabyte and that does 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.209
 difference in the show is when you have 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.369
 open more than one application at the same 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:56.009
 time he also earn points for 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.200
 android that is pure with few 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.420
 motorola interventions and some 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.720
 very happy interventions such as smart 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.030
 actions and makes the smartphone the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.720
 day 11 is pretty cool only sins on the screen that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.720
 falls short 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.590
 before daughter and has a rather strange screen 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.110
 but his construction is nice 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.330
 different though cheap with a 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.930
 very cool slot and one button 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.299
 power is very resistant to the spin of 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.150
 bad hein performance is very similar to 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.150
 optimal is 4 2 or weak 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.580
 you can not demand much from any of these 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.519
 smartphones 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.459
 they live up to the price it cost and in 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.230
 camera and battery performance does not 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.000
 highlight a clean 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.940
 the finish is not there either. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.530
 better and better 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.920
 today it will connect with the limitations 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.900
 if the budget is tight, taking into account 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.980
 view all this and the text you already 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.590
 must have read 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.010
 it was difficult to reach a winner but in 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.010
 rows 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.680
 the best smartphone up to $ 500 sold from 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.599
 brazil today is the lumia 520 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.849
 he wins the lead I went from the 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.859
 windows phone and a very finish 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.129
 cool for this price range 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.599
 the camera is okay and overall a good prize 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.340
 nice 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.859
 just behind the laser was one of the 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.200
 motorola up to 500 reais there is no other 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.239
 android that faces d 1 and d where 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.340
 has a cool design and some 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.980
 difficult to find in 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.709
 me from hands like 1 gigabytes of ram 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.959
 the only possible rival of the one is a 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.569
 another way also in motorola he has 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.579
 appeared in some promotions for 550 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.069
 and by this minimum difference 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.090
 compensates for its superiority 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.090
 in almost all respects 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.240
 life with the smartphone under 500 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.780
 is not easy but it is possible to be 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.480
 happy 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.370
 we indicate the fire 521 around 1 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.150
 despite the limitations are devices 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.150
 incompetence
