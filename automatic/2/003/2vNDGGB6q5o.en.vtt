00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
bit we're going to give a sample that

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:11.809 
bit we're going to give a sample that
recording<00:02:00.439> is<00:02:00.619> that<00:02:00.679> good

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.520 

okay<00:02:12.819> Chris<00:02:13.150> last<00:02:13.569> but<00:02:13.840> not<00:02:13.930> least<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:15.400> third

okay Chris last but not least the third

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.720 
okay Chris last but not least the third
possibility<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.650> recording<00:02:17.980> your<00:02:18.310> acoustic

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
possibility of recording your acoustic

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.530 
possibility of recording your acoustic
guitar<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.599> just<00:02:19.959> typical<00:02:20.290> where<00:02:21.159> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
guitar this is just typical where the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.690 
guitar this is just typical where the
capsules<00:02:22.540> are<00:02:22.629> crossed<00:02:22.930> as<00:02:23.439> the<00:02:23.769> XY<00:02:24.129> pattern

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
capsules are crossed as the XY pattern

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.240 
capsules are crossed as the XY pattern
and<00:02:25.390> as<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.079> see<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.620> capsules<00:02:27.129> are

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
and as you can see the capsules are

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.559 
and as you can see the capsules are
crossed<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.659> XY<00:02:29.549> configuration<00:02:30.549> this<00:02:31.510> is

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
crossed to the XY configuration this is

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.229 
crossed to the XY configuration this is
the<00:02:32.609> right<00:02:33.609> and<00:02:33.760> left<00:02:33.939> microphone<00:02:34.569> and

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
the right and left microphone and

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.539 
the right and left microphone and
they're<00:02:37.239> crossed<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.310> waves

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
they're crossed like this so the waves

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.490 
they're crossed like this so the waves
don't<00:02:40.299> cancel<00:02:40.840> each<00:02:41.109> other<00:02:41.290> out<00:02:41.939> and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
don't cancel each other out and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.520 
don't cancel each other out and
basically<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:45.430> set<00:02:45.669> them<00:02:45.819> like<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.269> at<00:02:46.750> 90

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
basically you set them like this at 90

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.210 
basically you set them like this at 90
degrees<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:49.680> away<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.709> go

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
degrees and away you go

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.649 
degrees and away you go
a<00:02:51.250> few<00:02:51.400> questions<00:02:51.579> does<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.299> matter<00:02:52.419> which

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
a few questions does it matter which

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.119 
a few questions does it matter which
ones<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.049> top<00:02:53.230> which<00:02:53.680> ones<00:02:53.859> on<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.040> bottom

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
ones on top which ones on the bottom

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.459 
ones on top which ones on the bottom
just<00:02:54.730> as<00:02:54.849> long<00:02:55.030> as<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:55.329> is<00:02:55.810> just<00:02:56.079> as<00:02:56.169> long<00:02:56.349> as

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.469 
just as long as this is just as long as

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:57.809 
just as long as this is just as long as
they're<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.859> position<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.549> are<00:02:57.700> they

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
they're in that position and are they

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:58.619 
they're in that position and are they
touching<00:02:58.030> each<00:02:58.299> other

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
touching each other

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.470 
touching each other
nope<00:02:59.189> barely<00:03:00.189> away<00:03:00.459> from<00:03:00.700> each<00:03:00.849> other<00:03:00.969> I<00:03:01.239> don't

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
nope barely away from each other I don't

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.659 
nope barely away from each other I don't
know<00:03:01.719> I<00:03:01.750> meant<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.409> imagine<00:03:03.159> it<00:03:03.370> wouldn't

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
know I meant I imagine it wouldn't

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.599 
know I meant I imagine it wouldn't
matter<00:03:03.819> if<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.180> mics<00:03:04.419> touched<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.900> little<00:03:05.019> bit

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
matter if the mics touched a little bit

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.399 
matter if the mics touched a little bit
what<00:03:06.609> you<00:03:06.760> don't<00:03:07.000> want<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.419> mic<00:03:07.629> separated

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
what you don't want is the mic separated

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.759 
what you don't want is the mic separated
from<00:03:09.400> each<00:03:09.549> other<00:03:09.909> where<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.409> pick<00:03:11.620> up

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
from each other where the the pick up

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.800 
from each other where the the pick up
patterns<00:03:12.010> can<00:03:12.519> can<00:03:13.090> get<00:03:13.239> in<00:03:13.329> each<00:03:13.450> other's<00:03:13.629> way

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
patterns can can get in each other's way

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.449 
patterns can can get in each other's way
that's<00:03:14.349> what<00:03:14.469> you<00:03:14.590> don't<00:03:14.709> want<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:15.219> are<00:03:15.310> they

guitar like the other two we're not as

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.990 
guitar like the other two we're not as
much<00:03:19.269> no<00:03:19.889> point<00:03:20.889> in<00:03:20.979> this<00:03:21.040> entire<00:03:21.370> area<00:03:21.639> this
