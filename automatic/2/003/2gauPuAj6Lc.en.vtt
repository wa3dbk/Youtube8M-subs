Hi Guys, Nik here from NMDK Design 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.749
in today's episode, I want to give you a Quicktip 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.489
how you can fold such a background, this is one from Walimex

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.759
I post you the link in the video description 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.230
how you can

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.619
fold up

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.769
unfold should be no problem 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.409
I have a special folding technique that I want to show you today 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.200
you take the background crosswise 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.210
grab here

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.110
practically at the background 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.770
and push against your back

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.680
and now you can see

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.240
here the hand and fold down here 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.460
let´s repeat it

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.470
it doesn´t matter if you fold it from the white side

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.010
or the black side. I'll show you now with the black side 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.110
grab here

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.010
press forward 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.730
squeeze back 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.330
you got him like that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.180
folded 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.190
Now you can put the background

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.640
back into case

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.660
I hope this video helped you

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.740
and ... 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.850
because i had a lot of problems

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.300
folding this background

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.440
I hope the video is helpful for you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.680
and could 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.070

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.570
