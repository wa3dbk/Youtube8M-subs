00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that we don't normally see and what what

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.469 
that we don't normally see and what what
I<00:02:03.990> find<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.409> interesting<00:02:04.439> about<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.850 
I find so interesting about that is that
was<00:02:06.960> sort<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.619> there<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.979> my<00:02:08.129> script<00:02:09.440> but<00:02:10.440> it's

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
was sort of there and my script but it's

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.490 
was sort of there and my script but it's
really<00:02:11.310> there<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.510> way<00:02:12.629> Matt

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
really there in the way Matt

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.920 
really there in the way Matt

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
having to be an in and actually in a

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.610 
having to be an in and actually in a
weird<00:02:38.340> way<00:02:38.430> out<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:39.060> his<00:02:39.180> comfort<00:02:39.450> level<00:02:39.630> and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.500 

that<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:44.120> something<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:47.180> sort<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.210> thought

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
that is something that I sort of thought

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.000 
that is something that I sort of thought
about<00:02:48.840> while<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.050> was<00:02:49.140> writing<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.770> but<00:02:49.920> it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
about while I was writing it but it

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.620 
about while I was writing it but it
wasn't<00:02:50.190> big<00:02:50.520> an<00:02:50.640> important<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.210> wasn't<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:51.540> the
