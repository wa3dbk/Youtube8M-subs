00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.380
 there will be a round soon 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.690
 driving backwards with villages and me 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.230
 we do not show you everything fully right away 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.230
 pukes 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.489
 or vw course field of view 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.050
 whoever knows English 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.090
 is simply the field of vision 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.250
 and here in relation to the visible 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.410
 done in a first person shooter 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.059
 how battlefield finale is yes I know 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.250
 full light of lost funds 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.050
 as well as field of view fire anyway 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.370
 is defined by the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.519
 field of vision which us both in the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.070
 depth as well as width is commanded 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.300
 the higher this value the greater than 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.850
 our field of vision in relation to the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.530
 respective dimensions in battlefield 4 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.619
 this is on a standard 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.140
 value of 60 as a comparison I give you 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.860
 the higher values ​​90 and the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.690
 highest menu selectable value 120 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.910
 as you can see , this is the goal 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.130
 aim with a higher fo as worth 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.920
 each further away in reality 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.840
 However, it always has a value of 120 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.289
 still the same distance as at 60 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.320
 in this case exactly 35 meters and now 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.630
 comes for you the respective one 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.729
 goal with a higher fvw worth yes 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.560
 farther away we were already awake 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.240
 and according to numerous mathematical 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.890
 equations and the calibration of the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.270
 industrial fly commentator 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.970
 i am reflection on the result 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.189
 come that by the respective goal 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:52.040
 Hold on tight, yes, smaller is yes 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.810
 properly means a higher sv veert 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.600
 on the one hand a larger field of vision 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.280
 here on the reverse also smaller ones 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.530
 goals due to the postponed 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.180
 deep dimension and now we come to 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.659
 crux in battlefield 4 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.610
 that is still going to be something of a yes 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.739
 if you have one in battlefield 4 one 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.140
 weapon uses which a sighting with 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.049
 magnification so zoom level has then 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.970
 reset euro vj worth in this way it became 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.829
 back to the standard value of 60 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.480
 as long as you are in the zoom and 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.820
 jump back into those of you 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.299
 set value when he returns from the 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.070
 swamp out since it leads among you 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.840
 the still quantum physics through the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.970
 head celebrates and who due to brain death 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.800
 already tommy moderate on the keyboards 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.350
 conjure 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.050
 Here's an example, you have your value 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.370
 put on 120 who through the area 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.920
 you are moving through this 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.290
 tunnel and also have the enlarged 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.810
 field of view neither with a laptop 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.000
 Armed in visor mode is also 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.060
 everything paletti still worth a 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.850
 120 you turn your has now, however, the 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.120
 example with a head so with cod and 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.910
 not equip with ck at the end and with 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.180
 you are aiming for this 4x zoom 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.660
 will be worth this mode again at the fv 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.810
 shot of 60 , what does that mean ? 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.250
 for you i can you because of this 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.590
 incredible knowledge of 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.570
 give world-following tips when 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.790
 her klaus kotter or general 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.130
 small and fast-paced cards like 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.560
 for example, operation loose or grad 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.810
 in domination or team deathmatch mode 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.970
 et cetera you should be on the way 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.070
 worth a rather small field of view 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.810
 drive around your opponents also accordingly 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.540
 Precisely under fire to be able to take 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.850
 give them a lower value 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.300
 visually presented in more detail and 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.470
 to make a bigger goal 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.270
 However, you should be a hobby sniper 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.709
 through the area eggs and anyway something 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.810
 be more careful 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.700
 so you can value here at a higher 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.950
 go around your environment around you 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.260
 to have a better view and not that 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.840
 victim of knife horny adversary 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.620
 In addition , the sniper theoretically yes 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.500
 also a rifle with zoom and reset 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.080
 thereby in the 60 fv if her opponent 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.790
 wanted to take under fire and if you want 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.709
 it also belongs to the troupe 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.050
 smaller cards or equivalent 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.830
 modi with a fourfold zoom for the rex 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.830
 run around 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.280
 then you can basically one 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.989
 higher ffo how to choose value in general 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.180
 there is no mean here and also 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.580
 the well-known and used 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.770
 worth of 90 is rather counterproductive 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.750
 Here you should really worth it 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.270
 correspond to the given conditions of the map 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.250
 of the mode and the respective style of play 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.260
 adjust to get the best out of it 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.300
 can and that means the opponents 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.360
 neat to rip up the ass 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.060
 because how play battlefield 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.060
 In this sense, your goal is in the eye
