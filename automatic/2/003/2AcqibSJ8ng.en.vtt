complicated so you have to click on
advanced<00:00:37.829> setting<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.730> create<00:00:39.239> an<00:00:39.540> actual

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
advanced setting and create an actual

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.639 
advanced setting and create an actual
rule<00:00:41.329> that<00:00:42.329> will<00:00:42.540> allow<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.750> traffic<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
rule that will allow that traffic in so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.770 
rule that will allow that traffic in so
if<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.950> what<00:00:44.160> port<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.090> traffic<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
if you know what port the traffic is

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
if you know what port the traffic is
it's<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.379> pretty<00:00:46.620> easy<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.610> click<00:00:48.450> on

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it's it's pretty easy you just click on

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.029 
it's it's pretty easy you just click on
inbound<00:00:48.989> rules<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.530> don't<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:49.950> you

program if we if we know the program we

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.450 
program if we if we know the program we
can<00:01:00.149> choose<00:01:00.420> next<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.590> locate<00:01:02.399> that

can choose next and we can locate that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.000 
can choose next and we can locate that
executable<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.300> allow<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.799> choose

the port which we're going to do in a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.980 
the port which we're going to do in a
second<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.860> choose<00:01:08.010> predefined<00:01:08.820> which<00:01:09.810> is

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
second we can choose predefined which is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.460 
second we can choose predefined which is
a<00:01:10.020> list<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.619> various<00:01:10.680> different<00:01:11.210> predefined

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
ports that are well-known they're called

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.960 
ports that are well-known they're called
well-known<00:01:15.060> ports<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.280> also<00:01:17.430> choose

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
well-known ports and you can also choose

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
well-known ports and you can also choose
to<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.570> custom<00:01:18.930> rule<00:01:20.090> which<00:01:21.090> again<00:01:22.049> looks<00:01:22.290> at

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
to do a custom rule which again looks at

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.080 
to do a custom rule which again looks at
a<00:01:22.650> particular<00:01:23.009> program<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.700> may<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:24.030> be

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
a particular program that may not be

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.350 
a particular program that may not be
easy<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.740> easy<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.040> find<00:01:26.159> as<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.000> through

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
easy to as easy to find as it is through

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
easy to as easy to find as it is through
the<00:01:27.509> first<00:01:27.750> option<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.950> let's<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.130> ahead<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the first option so let's go ahead and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.649 
the first option so let's go ahead and
choose<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> port<00:01:29.850> that's<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.090> real<00:01:30.210> easy<00:01:30.450> way

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
choose the port that's a real easy way

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.660 
choose the port that's a real easy way
to<00:01:30.720> open<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.140> open<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.920> we're<00:01:32.549> going

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to open and open it up and we're going

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
to open and open it up and we're going
to<00:01:32.700> choose<00:01:32.909> TCP<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.960> we're<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.320> go<00:01:34.409> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to choose TCP and we're going to go to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.870 
to choose TCP and we're going to go to
specific<00:01:34.650> ports<00:01:35.189> let's<00:01:35.340> say<00:01:35.430> we're<00:01:35.549> hosting<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
specific ports let's say we're hosting a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.969 
specific ports let's say we're hosting a
web<00:01:36.030> server<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.540> let's<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:36.990> ahead<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.320> do

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
web server so let's just go ahead and do

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.149 
web server so let's just go ahead and do
that<00:01:38.159> hosted<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.000> port<00:01:39.360> 80<00:01:39.570> click<00:01:40.560> Next

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that hosted on port 80 click Next

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.770 
that hosted on port 80 click Next
we're<00:01:41.340> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.579> allow<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.970> connection<00:01:42.540> we
