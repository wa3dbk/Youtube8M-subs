the instructions I don't know if it's
the<00:01:06.510> angle<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> lighting<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the angle or the lighting on the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.280

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
are you got the 1 by 1 bricks and then

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.540 
are you got the 1 by 1 bricks and then
you<00:03:28.380> put<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> 1<00:03:28.860> by<00:03:28.890> 4<00:03:29.100> plate<00:03:31.010> across<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.220> place

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
but I finally figured it out and that's

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.770 
but I finally figured it out and that's
your<00:03:41.519> instructions<00:03:42.150> was<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.420> fold<00:03:42.630> out

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
your instructions was to fold out

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
real simple one not expensive one to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.560 
real simple one not expensive one to
find<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.180> may<00:03:51.480> even<00:03:51.690> now<00:03:51.959> 34<00:03:52.860> years<00:03:53.100> later<00:03:53.570> and

are the vintage parts

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.650 
are the vintage parts
and<00:04:22.050> the<00:04:23.050> plate<00:04:23.320> is<00:04:23.650> it's<00:04:24.460> not<00:04:24.660> terribly

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
and the plate is it's not terribly

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.020 
and the plate is it's not terribly
common<00:04:25.990> but<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.440> mean<00:04:26.890> it's<00:04:27.250> not<00:04:27.370> rare<00:04:27.640> the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
common but it I mean it's not rare the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.950 
common but it I mean it's not rare the
base<00:04:28.690> plate<00:04:28.990> there<00:04:29.200> which<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:29.910> 8<00:04:30.910> by<00:04:31.150> 16<00:04:31.930> I

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
base plate there which is 8 by 16 I

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.510 
base plate there which is 8 by 16 I
think<00:04:32.110> oh<00:04:33.060> wait<00:04:34.090> overall<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:35.200> like<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.890> sit<00:04:36.220> I

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
like the simplicity of it but it still

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.120 
like the simplicity of it but it still
has<00:04:41.140> some<00:04:41.590> unique<00:04:42.040> elements<00:04:42.700> which<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:42.970> like

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
has some unique elements which I like
