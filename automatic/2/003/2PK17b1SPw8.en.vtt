then<00:00:51.390> team<00:00:51.570> defender<00:00:52.020> you're<00:00:52.440> gonna<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
then team defender you're gonna have to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.170 
then team defender you're gonna have to
go<00:00:52.920> somewhere<00:00:53.250> towards<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> fly<00:00:53.820> because

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
go somewhere towards the fly because

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.610 
go somewhere towards the fly because
that's<00:00:54.449> where<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.870> else<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that's where one else is going to be and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.069 
that's where one else is going to be and
so<00:00:56.129> does<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> sole<00:00:56.760> fact<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.570> added<00:00:57.750> an

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
so does the sole fact that they added an

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.049 
so does the sole fact that they added an
objective<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.890> team<00:00:59.399> deathmatch<00:00:59.760> tile

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
is our base this is what we're holding

is our base this is what we're holding
down<00:03:20.400> because<00:03:21.209> in<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:21.450> match<00:03:21.630> we're<00:03:22.110> playing

down because in this match we're playing

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.560 
down because in this match we're playing
on<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.500> map<00:03:22.650> dome<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.280> actual<00:03:23.459> dome<00:03:23.850> part

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
on the map dome and the actual dome part

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.630 
on the map dome and the actual dome part
of<00:03:24.750> dome<00:03:25.020> is<00:03:25.320> where<00:03:25.560> we<00:03:25.920> decided<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.340> hold<00:03:26.520> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
of dome is where we decided to hold the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.910 
of dome is where we decided to hold the
map<00:03:26.790> how<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.150> flag<00:03:27.540> because<00:03:28.380> what<00:03:28.800> I'm

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
map how the flag because what I'm

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.410 
map how the flag because what I'm
looking<00:03:29.190> right<00:03:29.340> now<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.790> one<00:03:30.000> way<00:03:30.150> they<00:03:30.300> can

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
looking right now is one way they can

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.520 
looking right now is one way they can
come<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.870> other<00:03:30.990> way<00:03:31.110> they<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.350> come<00:03:31.500> out

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
come and the other way they can come out

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.050 
come and the other way they can come out
of<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.740> is<00:03:32.010> from<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.250> tunnel<00:03:32.610> there<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.910> only

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
of this is from the tunnel there is only

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.670 
of this is from the tunnel there is only
really<00:03:33.240> two<00:03:33.660> ways<00:03:33.690> for<00:03:34.260> them<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.380> get<00:03:34.530> into

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
really two ways for them to get into

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.650 
really two ways for them to get into
that<00:03:34.740> dome<00:03:35.040> there's<00:03:35.280> two<00:03:35.520> doors<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.540> with

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
that dome there's two doors and so with

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.060 
that dome there's two doors and so with
our<00:03:36.810> team<00:03:36.959> setting<00:03:37.320> up<00:03:37.410> all<00:03:37.530> around<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.950> and

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
our team setting up all around it and

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.530 
our team setting up all around it and
that<00:03:38.580> we're<00:03:38.730> spawning<00:03:39.060> next<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.450> our

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
that we're spawning next to our

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.910 
that we're spawning next to our
teammates<00:03:39.930> it's<00:03:40.140> pretty<00:03:40.380> hard<00:03:40.560> for<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.800> other

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
teammates it's pretty hard for the other

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.590 
teammates it's pretty hard for the other
team<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.250> get<00:03:41.370> anywhere<00:03:41.700> near<00:03:41.910> our<00:03:41.970> flag<00:03:42.300> and

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
team to get anywhere near our flag and

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.140 
team to get anywhere near our flag and
those<00:03:43.080> are<00:03:43.110> three<00:03:43.440> general<00:03:43.890> tips<00:03:44.340> play<00:03:45.000> with

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
those are three general tips play with

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.780 
those are three general tips play with
the<00:03:45.209> team<00:03:45.530> use<00:03:46.530> an<00:03:46.620> assault<00:03:46.920> rifle<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.580> mean

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
the team use an assault rifle I mean

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.760 
the team use an assault rifle I mean
pick<00:03:48.120> PE<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.720> really<00:03:48.959> pick<00:03:49.140> your<00:03:49.290> engagements

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
pick PE to really pick your engagements

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.710 
pick PE to really pick your engagements
a<00:03:49.800> lot<00:03:49.950> more<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.459> there<00:03:51.300> isn'ta<00:03:51.630> may

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
a lot more in this there isn'ta may

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.180 
a lot more in this there isn'ta may
cover<00:03:51.930> points<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.440> game<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:52.860> there<00:03:53.040> are

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
cover points in this game but there are

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.130 
cover points in this game but there are
enough<00:03:53.550> cover<00:03:54.060> points<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.630> be<00:03:54.810> used

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
enough cover points to be used

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.870 
enough cover points to be used
effectively<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.459> need<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.730> learn

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
effectively and so you need to learn

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.540 
effectively and so you need to learn
them<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.360> right<00:03:57.930> there<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.440> fail<00:03:58.800> a<00:03:58.830> quad<00:03:59.280> you

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
them and right there I fail a quad you

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.430 
them and right there I fail a quad you
know<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.670> people<00:04:00.000> right<00:04:00.209> there<00:04:00.420> what<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:01.260> see

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
know a people right there what you see

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.140 
know a people right there what you see
how<00:04:01.620> we're<00:04:01.770> all<00:04:01.830> staying<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.280> area<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.820> way

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
how we're all staying this area that way

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.310 
how we're all staying this area that way
that's<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.570> reason<00:04:03.810> we're<00:04:03.930> winning<00:04:04.200> guys

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.600 
that's the reason we're winning guys
it's<00:04:04.650> solely<00:04:04.950> because<00:04:05.160> we're<00:04:05.459> communicating

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
it's solely because we're communicating

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.040 
it's solely because we're communicating
we're<00:04:06.300> calling<00:04:06.570> out<00:04:06.660> where<00:04:06.780> they're<00:04:06.900> coming
