00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
flight on the fly review obviously it

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.210 
flight on the fly review obviously it
looks<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.210> lot<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.810> tracks<00:00:22.260> alias<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
looks a lot like the tracks alias so the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.160 
looks a lot like the tracks alias so the
big<00:00:23.400> question<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:24.060> does<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.450> perform<00:00:24.900> like

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
big question is does it perform like

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.270 
big question is does it perform like
Villa<00:00:25.470> tracks<00:00:25.740> alias<00:00:26.480> so<00:00:27.480> start<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.260> 40%<00:00:29.070> rate

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
Villa tracks alias so start on 40% rate

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.760 
Villa tracks alias so start on 40% rate
see<00:00:29.610> what<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.880> looks<00:00:30.090> like

thing<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:14.080> awesome<00:02:17.880> well<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:18.910> think<00:02:19.000> what<00:02:19.239> is

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
thing is awesome well I think what is

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.820 
thing is awesome well I think what is
this<00:02:19.480> sixty<00:02:19.900> dollars<00:02:20.290> or<00:02:20.500> something<00:02:20.770> like

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
this sixty dollars or something like

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.100 
this sixty dollars or something like
that<00:02:21.630> Wow<00:02:22.690> Oh<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:24.610> little<00:02:25.209> bit<00:02:25.450> louder<00:02:25.780> than

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
that Wow Oh a little bit louder than

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.430 
that Wow Oh a little bit louder than
alias<00:02:26.620> but<00:02:26.980> that's<00:02:27.550> pretty<00:02:28.260> minor<00:02:29.310> points

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
alias but that's pretty minor points

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.130 
alias but that's pretty minor points
maybe<00:02:32.440> not<00:02:32.680> quite<00:02:33.190> as<00:02:33.430> smooth<00:02:34.390> as<00:02:34.690> they<00:02:34.900> Leah

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
maybe not quite as smooth as they Leah

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.290 
maybe not quite as smooth as they Leah
so<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.380> feels<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.709> little<00:02:35.890> more<00:02:36.130> twitchy<00:02:36.700> but<00:02:37.150> it

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
so it feels a little more twitchy but it

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.440 
so it feels a little more twitchy but it
is<00:02:37.390> definitely<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.730> same<00:02:40.000> kind<00:02:40.330> of

it does have a cool little rubber
landing<00:02:58.700> fee<00:02:59.000> on<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.360> too<00:02:59.569> so<00:02:59.599> it's<00:03:00.080> got<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.260> good

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
landing fee on it too so it's got a good

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.220 
landing fee on it too so it's got a good
landing<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.970> can<00:03:02.120> turn<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.510> LEDs<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.200> and

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
I press and hold it that's how I turn on

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.250 
I press and hold it that's how I turn on
headless<00:03:09.950> mode<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.340> I<00:03:10.370> think<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:10.760> just<00:03:11.260> locks

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
headless mode and I think it just locks

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.580 
headless mode and I think it just locks
into<00:03:12.620> whatever<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.489> front<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:18.350> does

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
into whatever is in the front that does

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.020 
into whatever is in the front that does
not<00:03:18.770> seem<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.069> be<00:03:19.220> working<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.760> may<00:03:19.970> be

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
not seem to be working that may be

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.650 
not seem to be working that may be
because<00:03:20.540> I'm<00:03:20.930> using<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.739> I'm<00:03:22.640> using<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.390> V

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
because I'm using the I'm using the V

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.110 
because I'm using the I'm using the V
2:22<00:03:24.560> transmitter<00:03:25.310> inside<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.819> one<00:03:25.970> that

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
2:22 transmitter inside the one that

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.460 
2:22 transmitter inside the one that
came<00:03:26.330> with<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.599> just<00:03:26.840> because<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.110> didn't<00:03:27.319> want

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
came with it just because I didn't want

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.949 
came with it just because I didn't want
to<00:03:27.560> put<00:03:27.739> batteries<00:03:27.950> in<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.400> new<00:03:28.550> one<00:03:28.959> but

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
to put batteries in the new one but

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.110 
to put batteries in the new one but
otherwise<00:03:30.319> are<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.739> same<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.400> maybe<00:03:31.610> headless

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
otherwise are the same so maybe headless

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.240 
otherwise are the same so maybe headless
mode<00:03:32.360> only<00:03:33.170> works<00:03:33.709> with<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:34.069> new

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
mode only works with that new

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.460 
mode only works with that new
transmitter<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.510> have<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.810> try<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.049> later

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
transmitter so I have to try that later

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.479 
transmitter so I have to try that later
but<00:03:37.510> this<00:03:38.510> will<00:03:38.750> work<00:03:38.780> for<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.489> on-the-fly

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
but this will work for a on-the-fly

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.110 
but this will work for a on-the-fly
review<00:03:41.000> just<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.299> see<00:03:41.540> how<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.840> flies<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.910> it

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
review just to see how it flies and it

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:53.050 
review just to see how it flies and it
flies<00:03:44.540> nice<00:03:46.600> wow<00:03:47.600> I'm<00:03:47.810> impressed<00:03:47.989> ooh<00:03:52.060> there's

flies nice wow I'm impressed ooh there's
a<00:03:53.120> couple<00:03:53.330> flips<00:03:53.660> there

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.800 

Wow<00:04:00.799> okay<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:01.400> if<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:01.879> just<00:04:02.060> keep<00:04:02.269> holding<00:04:02.689> the

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
Wow okay so if you just keep holding the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.569 
Wow okay so if you just keep holding the
sticks<00:04:03.139> now<00:04:03.439> and<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.680> just<00:04:03.709> keeps<00:04:04.159> flipping

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
sticks now and it just keeps flipping

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.349 
sticks now and it just keeps flipping
and<00:04:04.879> flipping<00:04:05.109> that<00:04:06.109> was<00:04:06.290> pretty<00:04:06.530> cool<00:04:07.359> let's

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
and flipping that was pretty cool let's

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.819 
and flipping that was pretty cool let's
try<00:04:08.659> that<00:04:08.810> again<00:04:08.870> let's<00:04:09.260> do<00:04:09.379> a<00:04:09.409> little<00:04:09.650> hand

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
try that again let's do a little hand

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.470 
try that again let's do a little hand
launch<00:04:10.810> no<00:04:11.810> problem<00:04:12.879> so<00:04:13.879> let's<00:04:14.060> get<00:04:14.180> some

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
launch no problem so let's get some

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.789 
launch no problem so let's get some
height<00:04:14.750> here<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:20.079> think<00:04:21.079> that<00:04:21.229> was<00:04:21.380> like<00:04:21.560> four

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
height here I think that was like four

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.550 
height here I think that was like four
or<00:04:21.829> five<00:04:22.039> backflips<00:04:22.759> in<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:23.000> row<00:04:23.150> there<00:04:23.560> all

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
or five backflips in a row there all

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.379 
or five backflips in a row there all
right<00:04:24.830> that's<00:04:25.160> cool<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:25.820> you<00:04:25.910> just<00:04:26.000> hit<00:04:26.210> the

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
right that's cool so you just hit the

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.270 
right that's cool so you just hit the
flip<00:04:26.780> button<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.289> then<00:04:27.440> I'll<00:04:27.590> keep<00:04:27.830> holding<00:04:28.009> a

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
flip button and then I'll keep holding a

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.999 
flip button and then I'll keep holding a
stick<00:04:28.520> in<00:04:28.699> and<00:04:28.849> it<00:04:28.940> just<00:04:29.090> keeps<00:04:29.330> flipping

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
stick in and it just keeps flipping

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.279 
stick in and it just keeps flipping
looks<00:04:31.009> like<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.400> was<00:04:31.550> losing<00:04:31.849> some<00:04:32.449> it<00:04:32.960> kind<00:04:33.199> of

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
looks like it was losing some it kind of

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.010 
looks like it was losing some it kind of
got<00:04:33.440> some<00:04:33.970> angle<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.360> there<00:04:35.630> as<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.990> was

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
got some angle to it there as it was

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.980 
got some angle to it there as it was
doing<00:04:36.830> multiple<00:04:37.280> flips<00:04:37.639> I<00:04:38.530> think<00:04:40.570> my<00:04:41.570> battery

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
doing multiple flips I think my battery

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.080 
doing multiple flips I think my battery
popped<00:04:42.530> out<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:43.630> thought<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.660> saw<00:04:45.050> something<00:04:46.090> fly

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
popped out I thought I saw something fly

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.360 
popped out I thought I saw something fly
off<00:04:47.389> of<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.750> but<00:04:47.930> maybe<00:04:48.080> that<00:04:48.289> was<00:04:48.470> just<00:04:48.500> from

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
off of it but maybe that was just from

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.939 
off of it but maybe that was just from
the<00:04:49.520> grass<00:04:50.229> looks<00:04:51.229> like<00:04:51.410> I<00:04:51.560> got<00:04:51.770> all<00:04:51.919> my

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
the grass looks like I got all my

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:58.180 
the grass looks like I got all my
landing<00:04:52.610> feet<00:04:53.949> everything's<00:04:54.949> there<00:04:55.280> so<00:04:57.190> I'm

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
landing feet everything's there so I'm

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.740 
landing feet everything's there so I'm
not<00:04:58.250> sure<00:04:58.370> what<00:04:58.729> that<00:04:58.759> was

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.300 

man<00:05:04.750> those<00:05:05.020> flips<00:05:05.380> are<00:05:05.590> just<00:05:05.800> really

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
man those flips are just really

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.880 
man those flips are just really
impressing<00:05:06.880> me<00:05:06.910> I<00:05:07.270> can't<00:05:08.140> believe<00:05:08.230> how<00:05:08.620> fast

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
impressing me I can't believe how fast

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:17.260 
impressing me I can't believe how fast
this<00:05:09.130> thing<00:05:09.190> flips

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.909 

so<00:05:18.520> try<00:05:19.520> to<00:05:19.580> get<00:05:19.759> some<00:05:20.000> speed<00:05:20.360> gone<00:05:20.720> let's<00:05:21.620> full

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
so try to get some speed gone let's full

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:34.420 
so try to get some speed gone let's full
speed<00:05:22.250> ahead<00:05:24.009> pretty<00:05:25.009> quick

Claude<00:06:19.490> here<00:06:24.220> definitely<00:06:25.220> flies<00:06:26.000> nice<00:06:26.510> Wow

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.600 

and<00:06:30.470> this<00:06:30.680> is<00:06:30.919> the<00:06:31.190> V<00:06:32.060> 222<00:06:32.810> protocol<00:06:33.349> so<00:06:33.740> you

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
and this is the V 222 protocol so you

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.240 
and this is the V 222 protocol so you
can<00:06:34.849> use<00:06:35.090> existing<00:06:35.590> transmitters<00:06:36.590> or<00:06:36.889> maybe

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
can use existing transmitters or maybe

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.450 
can use existing transmitters or maybe
that<00:06:37.400> headless<00:06:37.789> mode<00:06:38.090> off<00:06:38.510> a<00:06:38.539> look<00:06:38.840> into<00:06:39.020> that

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
that headless mode off a look into that

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.960 
that headless mode off a look into that
looks<00:06:40.460> like<00:06:40.610> I<00:06:40.760> got<00:06:40.940> some<00:06:40.970> LVC<00:06:41.750> warning<00:06:41.780> so

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
looks like I got some LVC warning so

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.430 
looks like I got some LVC warning so
maybe<00:06:43.970> not<00:06:44.210> the<00:06:44.360> longest<00:06:44.840> flight<00:06:45.110> time<00:06:45.410> I

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
maybe not the longest flight time I

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.339 
maybe not the longest flight time I
don't<00:06:45.710> think<00:06:45.830> that<00:06:46.190> was<00:06:46.870> that<00:06:47.870> long<00:06:48.139> of<00:06:48.289> a

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 
don't think that was that long of a

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:50.980 
don't think that was that long of a
flight<00:06:48.650> but<00:06:49.130> anyway<00:06:50.120> there<00:06:50.360> it<00:06:50.479> is<00:06:50.599> that's<00:06:50.840> the
