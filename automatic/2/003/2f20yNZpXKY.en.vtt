00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.633
- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT'S MAY 1ST?

00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:03.766
IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT?
IT'S ALREADY MAY.

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.433
TODAY IS A HOLIDAY.
IT'S KNOWN AS MAY DAY.

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:10.133
AND THIS MORNING I CELEBRATED
BY DANCING AROUND A MAY POLE.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.133
AND I DON'T WANT TO BRAG,
BUT I MADE 20 BUCKS.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.600
[cheers and applause]

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.833
THANKS VERY MUCH.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.733
IT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE I'M SAVING UP
TO BUY THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS,

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.066
SO THAT'S...

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.633
[cheers and applause]

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.900
MAY 1ST.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS REALLY?

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.966
REALLY WHAT IT MEANS IS
THAT WE'RE ABOUT A MONTH AWAY

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.333
FROM SWIMSUIT SEASON,

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.933
AND, UH...

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.766
SORRY TO REMIND EVERYBODY
ABOUT THAT.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.766
I KNOW.

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.866
PEOPLE--USUALLY RIGHT
AROUND NOW,

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.866
WE START PANICKING,

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.466
'CAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO LOSE
A FEW POUNDS

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.433
BEFORE WE PUT ON A BATHING SUIT.

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:48.300
MY ADVICE IS,
DO IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.766
DRINK COFFEE
AND SMOKE CIGARETTES.

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.433
THAT'S SURE-FIRE WEIGHT LOSS.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.000
ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR WAYS

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.366
THAT PEOPLE
ARE LOSING WEIGHT IS,

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.266
THEY'RE DOING A JUICE CLEANSE,

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.366
AND IT'S WHERE YOU SPEND

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.066
ANYWHERE FROM A COUPLE OF DAYS
TO A WEEK NOT EATING.

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:04.066
INSTEAD YOU JUST DRINK A BUNCH
OF VERY EXPENSIVE JUICES.

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.100
AND IT'S GREAT
IF YOU LOVE HAVING JUICE

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.233
AND HATE HAVING MONEY.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.500
THAT'S WHAT IT'S--THEY'RE
EXPENSIVE, IS WHAT THEY ARE.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.166
JUICE--YOU'D THINK JUICE
WOULDN'T BE EXPENSIVE.

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.133
IT'S EXPENSIVE,
AND PEOPLE ARE SO EXCITED

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.600
WHEN THEY GET STARTED TOO.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.866
THEY COME INTO THE OFFICE
ON MONDAY MORNING.

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.933
THEY'VE GOT A DUFFEL BAG FULL
OF 30 DIFFERENT JUICES.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.800
FOR THE FIRST HOUR,
THAT'S WHAT THEY DRINK.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.900
AND THEN THE ENTIRE MORNING,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.966
JUICE CLEANSE IS
ALL THEY TALK ABOUT.

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.366
YOU KNOW,
"HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND?"

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.700
"I'M ON A JUICE CLEANSE."

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.766
"HOW ARE YOUR KIDS?"

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.900
"WHO CARES?
I'M ON A JUICE CLEANSE."

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.133
BY LUNCH, THEY'RE STARTING
TO REGRET THEIR DECISION.

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.666
THEY'RE JUST STARING AT THE FOOD
WHILE YOU EAT THE FOOD.

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.700
AND THEN THEY'RE STANDING
TOO CLOSE TO YOU ALL DAY LONG

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.700
JUST TRYING TO SMELL THE FOOD
FROM YOUR BREATH,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.166
WHICH IS DISGUSTING.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.200
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.900
THEY'VE LOST THEIR WILL TO LIVE.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.500
THEY'RE JUST CRAWLING
INTO YOUR OFFICE.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.733
THEY'RE LAYING ON THE FLOOR.
THEY'RE CRYING.

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:50.966
YOU LEAN DOWN TO COMFORT THEM,

00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:53.566
THEY START GNAWING ON YOUR HAIR,
JUST TRYING TO--

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:56.766
ANY FOOD THAT MAY HAVE FALLEN
IN YOUR HAIR, THEY WANT.

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.766
AROUND THE THIRD DAY,
THEY'RE HUNGRY.

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:00.400
THEY JUST--THEY'RE JUST
NOT EVEN HUNGRY.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.900
THEY'RE JUST ANGRY.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.933
AND YOU ASK HOW
THEIR JUICE CLEANSE IS GOING,

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.700
AND THEY YELL BACK, "YOUR MOM IS
A JUICE CLEANSE!"

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.900
AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE,
"WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.266
'YOUR MOM IS A JUICE CLEANSE'?"

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:10.866
BY THE END OF THE WEEK,
THEY'RE IN A GREAT MOOD.

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:12.566
THEY SAY THEY'RE EUPHORIC,

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:14.833
AND THEY'RE PROUD BECAUSE
THEY'VE LOST THREE POUNDS,

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.400
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
THE HEART TO TELL 'EM

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.033
IT'S 'CAUSE THEY FORGOT TO PUT
ON THEIR SHOES AND PANTS.

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:21.633
JUST DELIRIOUS BY NOW.

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:22.733
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED
A JUICE CLEANSE

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:23.800
TO MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.266
IF YOU WANT TO FEEL EUPHORIC,

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:26.433
YOU JUST HAVE TO DANCE.
