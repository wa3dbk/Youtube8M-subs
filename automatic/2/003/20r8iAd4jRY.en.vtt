00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
stem actually broke off so i'll probably

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.550 
stem actually broke off so i'll probably
be<00:01:11.880> remaking<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.869> there's<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> leaf

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
be remaking this so there's like a leaf

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
actually followed her tutorial for this

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.880 
actually followed her tutorial for this
one<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.409> randomly

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
one but this one is just a randomly

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.730 
one but this one is just a randomly
textured<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.630> vine<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.590> one

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
broke off a little but this is just how

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.080
