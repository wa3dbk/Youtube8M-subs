00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:47.739 
I would probably wake up and spend the

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:50.309 
I would probably wake up and spend the
first<00:01:47.890> 18<00:01:48.340> hours<00:01:48.610> of<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.819> day<00:01:49.000> not<00:01:49.869> leaving<00:01:50.200> my

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
room and just playing with myself I

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.370 
room and just playing with myself I
think<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.270> that<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.450> think<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.080> would<00:01:53.229> waste

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
think that that I think I would waste

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.260 
think that that I think I would waste
the<00:01:53.590> day<00:01:53.709> doing<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.550> saying<00:01:54.759> wasting

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
the day doing that and saying wasting

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.279 
the day doing that and saying wasting
the<00:01:55.360> day<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.509> mean<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.899> would<00:01:55.989> that<00:01:56.140> be

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
the day I mean that would that be

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.680 
the day I mean that would that be
valuable<00:01:56.739> time<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.069> me<00:01:57.190> but<00:01:57.970> after<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:58.629> I

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
valuable time to me but after that I

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.919 
valuable time to me but after that I
would<00:01:58.959> probably<00:01:59.440> uh<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:01.149> from<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.660> of
