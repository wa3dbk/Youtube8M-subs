00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:09.190
 This is this terminal 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:13.880
 Evil Osu Zeta sh 03 will be in 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.750
 Screen size is 5.5 inches of crew d nine places 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.950
 me 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.810
 The design feature is this side edge web 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:41.800
 It has become a hexagon 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:44.400
 The lucky suffered Chamanu Chilla is now equipped with a fingerprint sensor fingerprint authentication sensor 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.560
 This is also one of the first 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:53.890
 I was in this time that DoCoMo 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:57.100
 There is biometric authentication as a whole sale of Kishu, and such fingerprint sensor 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:03.390
 It is the iris of the eye to that dating after 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.390
 There is a model that the sensor is also equipped with such recognizes the iris authenticating 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:14.450
 Compared to it about surgery 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:18.979
 I applications that do, but selling of exhaustion is had become towards the camera application 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.390
 It is slow recording here even if there is some thing 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:28.390
 Become a slow recording 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.870
 So-called slow motion shooting is possible here and up to 20010 frames per second 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.480
 To 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:36.890
 Seems to be able to shoot up to 210 ps 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.890
 It takes a little simple 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.190
 Hmm 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.380
 I'm moving a little hard 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:57.860
 It is quite understandable that the video playback of that is normal for a moment now 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.300
 I think that if there is 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.300
 Hey playing it 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.770
 It's like this , usually in Hiroshima 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:16.840
 You can not see it a 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:20.710
 This 8 for example, but I'm thumbnail comes out towards the lower it is by touch here 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:25.410
 You can choose the place for slow playback like this 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.410
 I would like to play in on it 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.970
 But I think Well, from the middle and either has to throw you have It is Sacco 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.520
 In this way considerable slow motion playback is possible 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.980
 Hmm 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:53.450
 There is also a feeling that the image quality of the resolution of the ship is a little bit rough, but this outdoors 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.250
 Well, it's a bit clearer when shooting 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.250
 I think it is possible to shoot motion 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:09.739
 Especially the scene where such a function is exhibited is watching sports 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:13.629
 For example, it is a motion check of baseball or such that kind of sports system especially 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.629
 I think I can use it conveniently 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:23.629
 It is the house of another one You're here m par after 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.040
 Application also this time even more apps that par is I will be towards the Koch 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:31.639
 I am upgrading 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.240
 Here 's the new little that is loaded from all 8 aquos models 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:37.290
 Oh dear 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.530
 It is a communication application or a strong application with playful elements 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.530
 but 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.300
 Here 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.340
 But say what app 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:55.490
 Basically a is an application like life support 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.970
 It is my birthday in advance 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:06.170
 That hobbies taste later schedule etc 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:09.170
 Automatically morning eyes of dishes from the result towards the m par that have registered 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:14.480
 I want to wake you up in the morning 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:18.739
 Management of degree schedule For example, if there is any schedule from 12 o'clock, please tell it 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:24.889
 It seems like an application that does something like 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:31.460
 In the past, people who talk to me from m par automatically 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:35.650
 It was there, but with this newly upgraded version, this version is against 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.320
 Te by speaking from the direction of the user 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.910
 For example, it What's 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:46.290
 Things like say that the other leaders Shikaitai when you've been talking about things like that when you now 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.440
 It seems that things like talking once will talk once more are also possible this time 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.440
 is 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.190
 Later 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:01.090
 Until this time until now , I could only handle it nearby 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:07.120
 From this time 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:09.490
 You can use it even when you go out when you are boron 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.910
 For example, it is in this kind of Fu um 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:18.910
 The station where you get off when listening to music on a train, etc. It is a role that you usually use 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:25.210
 As it approaches, from m fans 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:27.160
 There is also a feature 1 that will talk about something that is about to play a role soon 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.330
 Has been added 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.349
 It was in 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.349
 This one is 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:41.969
 It will be a new feature 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:46.000
 Overall, the terminal is so complete 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:51.950
 Big progress is good 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:57.680
 There is an atmosphere that has been put out to this large brush up or not 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:06:04.030
 Because the in-camera is an edge design by this example 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.030
 It is a place there at the bottom is interesting or rather chopped feature of aquos 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:14.560
 It is the color of the design after 8 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:17.800
 There are three colors of this red and after white and black 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:23.919
 This whole resonance finish has become 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:26.680
 It's almost like I 'm getting into letters, but I feel that it's a little noticeable like fingerprints 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:33.080
 The taste may be divided by 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:34.050
 In fact, I think it would be nice if you could get this around in the store 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.270
 Let 's leave 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.910
 100 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:43.070
 That's why aquos phone sweater Akoya Worst OSU was tax ash 03 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.910
 will be g 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.910
 There is no
