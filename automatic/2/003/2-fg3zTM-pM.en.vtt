00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.570
 without thinking university graduation to get yes 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.040
 these days no longer and 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.090
 high school is of course a good one 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.040
 requirement 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.809
 that's fine too, but that's me 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.000
 still not lose myself in the 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.280
 they really still have this yes 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.050
 I enjoy it and I also enjoy it 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.850
 They learn and really learn meaningfully 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.650
 Now what I'm learning for me now 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.640
 is that totally important the abi in the 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.559
 to have a bag 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.600
 Alone because it is the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.460
 Requirements for studying 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.739
 the prerequisites for a good one 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.360
 enter into professional life when I do that 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.559
 first time I got that 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.119
 I can still do that in ten years 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.770
 I would like to study now 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:11.049
 that inspired jonstein for the start in 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.280
 the plants expect theirs to live 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.250
 Employees Employees 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.869
 Team ability to communicate 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.610
 Conflict also something like 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.520
 reliability and ambition 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.200
 because we do not convey the knowledge 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.450
 only technical competence but we work 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.740
 also at the personal and social 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.130
 competence of our students 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.920
 student 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.090
 We do this in class but how to do it 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.179
 here also looks outside the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.969
 possibility to choose courses must 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:45.609
 surfing skiing and other sports 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:47.649
 the school and also has a lot of fun 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:50.109
 although the weather is not quite 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.639
 with has played in all but me much 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.359
 have fun and have learned a lot 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:53.889
 and also had the opportunity 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.200
 to make sound 

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:57.729
 I was the sexy one on the ski vacation 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.439
 So the last two years how to 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.939
 once in Austria and once here in 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.600
 Southern Germany that was very nice 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.670
 I really enjoy it, there are also modern 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.580
 I've heard that from all sides 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.350
 that's a lot of fun and then 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.420
 you also learn the classmates again 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.410
 know better 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.209
 There is a lot of difference between the students 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.709
 good harmony I think so we help 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.910
 each other if any questions 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.950
 are even when we are actually at 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.940
 projects are working against each other 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.010
 the groups still with each other 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.690
 there for each other and I like that very much 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.670
 positively surprised 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.500
 the people keep everybody here is 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.170
 is helped each other 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.920
 Support because you get help if 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.980
 you need them 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.980
 we can only work as a community 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.050
 otherwise it is not possible and especially this 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.640
 community strengthens us and that's why 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.650
 we have to learn and especially the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.350
 Students how to work together as a team 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.610
 I think it's good because then you laugh 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.750
 maybe also recognizes differently and also 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.880
 recognize very much from his classmates 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:57.720
 maybe how to eat 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.530
 should because he has more idea German 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.390
 founder award 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.830
 the students have to go in groups one 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.750
 develop business idea 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.819
 and here you have the cooperation 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.450
 seek out with an entrepreneur rides 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.450
 the operational practice 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.049
 you just have your own strengths and 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.970
 characterized weaken discovered and it has 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.769
 somehow a bit learned what 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.810
 means that everyone is also involved 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.560
 have to 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.690
 Of course it's about the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.489
 teaching of skills but the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.859
 teaching methodological competencies and 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.260
 Social competences are elementary 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.480
 is just important for studying 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.769
 because it is easier then especially 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.130
 if you are in the business sector 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.480
 for example, in mathematics was 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.960
 It's always very, very much, at the old school 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.060
 theorielastig 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.230
 and here it is very practical, I know 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.360
 what i for example a 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.060
 Curve discussion needs in the real one 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.980
 life you can tell that the teacher knows 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.820
 they have what they talk about in contrast 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.820
 to other schools 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.710
 they manage the material for the students 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.320
 to teach witty but that too 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.420
 to go through as the plan envisages 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.360
 it's not like a normal one 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.160
 general school where then just 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.930
 dull is learned that bring us too 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.900
 things they have experienced themselves 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.770
 own experiences in the working life and 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.770
 then you do not notice that the 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:23.020
 teachers have a lot of fun and therefore ours 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.940
 funds the classrooms are very 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.230
 big and we have the smartboards in 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.760
 many classes 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.680
 we have a beamer in the classroom 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.020
 We have the calculator in the classroom 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.760
 if you have the latest technology then 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.660
 you can also be teaching differently 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.780
 shape and hold varied 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.910
 Erwitte interesting edv knowledge 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.340
 Today, companies are studying 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.470
 just asked and the students the 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.610
 bbs 11 have left this knowledge 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.960
 here they won 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.810
 can successfully apply 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.790
 the situation is very important to me 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.770
 because I myself from very far 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.880
 come outside and there it was for me 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.770
 important that I really in the 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.200
 Central closeness I was only to 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.580
 station to run with me in the place if 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.969
 directly at the main station and need too 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.379
 five minutes previously, after suter 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.379
 That's really great 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.030
 I have become more self-confident 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.630
 I have continued in many areas 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.040
 educated 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.690
 you now have an overview of what 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.110
 In general , a company means 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.790
 establish 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.010
 I did not know that economy either 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.480
 somehow that would be my thing 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.970
 but this is going to be great here 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.010
 is taught that everyone with 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.310
 that everyone somehow gets promoted 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.230
 becomes 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.160
 Actually, these are all things 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.660
 therefore to have a successful conclusion 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.460
 learn with success in life 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.890
 that 's our motto life like him 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.840
 come to us and start 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.470
 together with and her professional 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.580
 Career

 We look forward to you
