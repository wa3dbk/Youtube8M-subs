00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
stop every so often I would have to take

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.280 
stop every so often I would have to take
the<00:02:24.670> real<00:02:24.880> boot<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.570> would<00:02:25.720> set<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.110> right

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the real boot and I would set it right

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.670 
the real boot and I would set it right
alongside<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.220> wood<00:02:27.370> boot<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:29.050> standing

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
alongside of the wood boot in standing

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.440 
alongside of the wood boot in standing
back<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.250> looking<00:02:30.520> at<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.730> with<00:02:30.940> fresh<00:02:31.209> eyes

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
back and looking at it with fresh eyes

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.600 
back and looking at it with fresh eyes
from<00:02:31.750> time<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.110> time<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.010> put<00:02:33.430> things

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
from time to time it just put things

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.880 
from time to time it just put things
back<00:02:33.940> into<00:02:34.420> perspective<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.320> could<00:02:35.500> see<00:02:35.739> if

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
back into perspective and I could see if

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.370 
back into perspective and I could see if
something<00:02:36.280> was<00:02:36.310> out<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.700> proportion<00:02:40.290> one<00:02:41.290> of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
something was out of proportion one of

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.290 
something was out of proportion one of
the<00:02:41.440> more<00:02:41.620> complicated<00:02:42.370> time-consuming

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
the more complicated time-consuming

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.140 
the more complicated time-consuming
parts<00:02:43.840> was<00:02:44.050> making<00:02:44.470> sure<00:02:44.709> that<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:45.340> top<00:02:45.910> of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
parts was making sure that the top of

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.600 
parts was making sure that the top of
the<00:02:46.239> boot<00:02:46.450> matched<00:02:47.110> perfectly<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.220> bottom

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
the boot matched perfectly to the bottom

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.330 
the boot matched perfectly to the bottom
part<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.000> boot<00:02:49.650> throughout<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.770> process

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
part of the boot throughout the process

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.120 
part of the boot throughout the process
I<00:02:51.730> would<00:02:52.030> put<00:02:52.630> them<00:02:52.750> together<00:02:52.930> make<00:02:53.739> sure<00:02:53.920> that

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
I would put them together make sure that

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.130 
I would put them together make sure that
they<00:02:54.340> fit<00:02:54.700> or<00:02:54.940> seeing<00:02:55.239> how<00:02:55.299> they<00:02:55.600> were<00:02:55.660> fitting

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
they fit or seeing how they were fitting

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.080 
they fit or seeing how they were fitting
they<00:02:56.560> started<00:02:57.040> with<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.160> power<00:02:57.430> carving<00:02:57.880> tool

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
they started with a power carving tool

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.080 
they started with a power carving tool
to<00:02:58.390> get<00:02:58.540> out<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.810> high<00:02:58.959> spots<00:02:59.580> use<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.820> chalk

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
to get out the high spots use the chalk

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.240 
to get out the high spots use the chalk
line<00:03:01.390> dust<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.290> could<00:03:02.560> mark<00:03:02.860> where<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.070> high

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
line dust so I could mark where the high

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.210 
line dust so I could mark where the high
spots<00:03:03.640> were<00:03:03.940> on<00:03:04.690> down<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.350> finer<00:03:05.650> sandpaper

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
spots were on down to finer sandpaper

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.600 
spots were on down to finer sandpaper
and<00:03:07.049> just<00:03:08.049> put<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.620> together<00:03:08.739> it's<00:03:09.370> still

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
and just put it together it's still

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.340 
and just put it together it's still
rocking<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.209> little<00:03:10.239> bit<00:03:10.630> there's<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.900> high<00:03:11.049> spot

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
rocking a little bit there's a high spot

rocking a little bit there's a high spot
sand<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.010> put<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.250> together<00:03:12.340> it's<00:03:12.730> sand<00:03:12.970> it

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.320 
sand and put it together it's sand it
put<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:13.420> together<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:15.030> finally<00:03:16.030> made<00:03:16.209> it

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
put it together and finally made it

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.940 
put it together and finally made it
because<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.570> knew<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.810> had<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:16.959> fit<00:03:17.290> just

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
because I knew it had to fit just

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.940 
because I knew it had to fit just
perfect<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.780> rubber<00:03:22.989> part<00:03:23.320> of<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.500> boot<00:03:23.680> had

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
perfect the rubber part of the boot had

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.759 
perfect the rubber part of the boot had
a<00:03:23.980> total<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.580> six<00:03:24.880> coats<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.390> finish<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.709> I

a total of six coats of finish and I

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.470 
a total of six coats of finish and I
knew<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.040> needed<00:03:27.310> six<00:03:27.549> coats<00:03:27.820> because<00:03:28.330> I

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
knew it needed six coats because I

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.360 
knew it needed six coats because I
wanted<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.989> depth<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.680> upper<00:03:32.920> part<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
shine or a low gloss it would take away

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.810 
shine or a low gloss it would take away
from<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.950> look<00:03:42.130> of<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.489> leather<00:03:44.519> I'm<00:03:45.519> happy

from the look of the leather I'm happy

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.280 
from the look of the leather I'm happy
with<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.060> way<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.480> came<00:03:46.690> out<00:03:46.870> when<00:03:47.260> I

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
with the way that it came out when I

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.199 
with the way that it came out when I
first<00:03:47.590> started<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.190> was<00:03:48.220> just<00:03:48.489> looking<00:03:48.850> at<00:03:49.000> big

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
first started I was just looking at big

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.650 
first started I was just looking at big
blocks<00:03:49.540> of<00:03:49.810> wood<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.799> was<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:50.980> little<00:03:51.250> daunting

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
blocks of wood it was a little daunting

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.360 
blocks of wood it was a little daunting
and<00:03:52.660> also<00:03:53.049> all<00:03:53.230> along<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.680> process<00:03:53.860> knowing

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
and also all along the process knowing

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.090 
and also all along the process knowing
that<00:03:54.760> this<00:03:55.390> has<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.750> come<00:03:55.780> out<00:03:55.989> just<00:03:56.829> about

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
that this has to come out just about

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.360 
that this has to come out just about
perfect<00:03:58.320> finally<00:03:59.320> at<00:03:59.440> one<00:03:59.620> point<00:03:59.919> one<00:04:00.160> day

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
perfect finally at one point one day

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.520 
perfect finally at one point one day
when<00:04:00.639> it<00:04:00.669> was<00:04:00.880> virtually<00:04:01.359> done<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:01.660> stood<00:04:02.169> back

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
when it was virtually done I stood back

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.400 
when it was virtually done I stood back
and<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.889> looked

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
and I looked

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.130 
and I looked
and<00:04:03.890> it's<00:04:04.010> like<00:04:04.310> oh<00:04:04.640> hi<00:04:05.090> my<00:04:05.270> own<00:04:05.420> worst<00:04:05.630> critic
