or prunes and they're wrinkled and you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.400 
or prunes and they're wrinkled and you
know<00:01:00.030> there's<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.300> no<00:01:00.539> water<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
know there's just no water so it's the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
and we put water and this one is you can

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.470 
and we put water and this one is you can
see<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.490> oil<00:01:23.760> I<00:01:24.090> mean<00:01:24.120> it

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
see that one with the oil I mean it

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.780 
see that one with the oil I mean it
didn't<00:01:24.750> plump<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.170> at<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.610> with

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
didn't plump up at all and the one with

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.120 
didn't plump up at all and the one with
water<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.080> huge<00:01:28.500> difference<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
water and that's a huge difference that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.520 
water and that's a huge difference that
shows<00:01:29.550> you<00:01:29.730> how<00:01:29.850> powerful<00:01:30.080> water<00:01:31.080> is<00:01:31.320> at

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
shows you how powerful water is at

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.400 
shows you how powerful water is at
plumping<00:01:32.010> tissue<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.510> spent<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.050> fortune

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
plumping tissue but we spent a fortune

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.370 
plumping tissue but we spent a fortune
on<00:01:34.860> oils<00:01:35.760> protein<00:01:36.120> topicals<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.080> it's<00:01:37.200> not

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
on oils protein topicals on and it's not

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.710 
on oils protein topicals on and it's not
I<00:01:37.620> mean<00:01:37.770> that's<00:01:38.580> not<00:01:38.910> where<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.300> want<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.570> be

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
I mean that's not where you want to be

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.680 
I mean that's not where you want to be
so<00:01:40.640> resumen<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.760> so<00:01:41.940> great<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.300> it's<00:01:42.600> got

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
so resumen is so great because it's got

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.630 
so resumen is so great because it's got
the<00:01:42.870> higher<00:01:43.020> onic<00:01:43.440> acid<00:01:43.830> in<00:01:44.010> there<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.490> it's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the higher onic acid in there and it's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.940 
the higher onic acid in there and it's
nature's<00:01:45.030> moisturizer<00:01:45.330> it's<00:01:46.050> got<00:01:46.200> 17<00:01:46.710> other

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
nature's moisturizer it's got 17 other

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.980 
nature's moisturizer it's got 17 other
