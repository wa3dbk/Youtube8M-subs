00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.280
 Hello UTB lg g3 big and beautiful 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.420
 Korean flagship 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.780
 g3 has a display resolution of 2560 on 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.990
 1440 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.730
 snapdragon 801 2 or 3 gigabytes 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.100
 RAM depending on 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.080
 countries the phone itself looks cool yes 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.029
 in-he is really very cool 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.789
 Looks like the first feeling when you take g3 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 ease having such a huge display and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.380
 body is bigger than jit you don't care 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.180
 lighter than predecessor case material 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.160
 ordinary plastic but it looks like 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.290
 metal plastic textured 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.110
 and not so smooth gloss like this 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.000
 was the case with gg2 although the concept of g 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.040
 the phone remained the same as it was to me 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.469
 there are no buttons in front of the stones 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.510
 they are behind only now not bulging a 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.730
 the power button has become round and around it 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.270
 lira lights disappeared as it was in lg 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.550
 g2 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.350
 Someone like this option someone in 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 to the rage of the inconvenience I personally have 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.699
 button layout doesn't like it but 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.469
 certainly a matter of habit g3 got 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.809
 55 inch screen 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.810
 it's half an inch larger than g2 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.229
 the novelty has become thinner 89 mm against 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.179
 9 and 14 at g2 g3 with such really 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.850
 large display hands do not feel with how 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.709
 shovels it a little more nexus 5 frame 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.719
 around the display is very small and it is for 

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:20.310
 due to this the Koreans got direct 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.920
 sense of cram so literate 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.439
 display main plus g3 is ergonomics 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.649
 compared to galaxy s5 van plus one 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.479
 xperia z2 and especially honor Ivan m8 he 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.389
 looks like the size of the device 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.639
 similar but just at Algie as big 

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:38.039
 display it is still sevan in general now 

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:39.810
 ashamed to look at this model housing on 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.159
 the device is removable under it is 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.009
 flash card slot 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.049
 he has not gone anywhere and micro-sim battery 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.499
 has become more now it is 3000 milliamps 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.929
 o'clock 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.459
 g2 was famous for its excellent battery 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.079
 after all, it was this apparatus that held 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:55.649
 about two times better than the same 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.249
 nexus 5 or sgs4 g3 shows the same 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.259
 result 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.939
 no it's a big plus back on 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.369
 opposite side of the flash 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.899
 there was something else this laser like on 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.729
 almost any digital soap dish 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.919
 it helps to instantly focus 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.079
 what's interesting is laser autofocus worth and 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.519
 in front therefore shootouts or 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.970
 different links can do more 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.500
 quickly 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.020
 and this thing really works 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.490
 fast camera in g3 quality is not strong 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.770
 different from the same 2 because the sensor 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.270
 stayed the same 13 megapixels 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.000
 allows you to take quite good pictures 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.650
 but the point is also in the optical 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.630
 stabilization inside is worth a special 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.940
 motor is not the only one 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.800
 phone minutes along with g2 with such a thing 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.110
 that is, shaking the video will be noticeable 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.540
 reduced due to this a video here it 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.290
 almost a fad and slow motion 120 fps 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.310
 4k ultra hd resolution view 4k 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.530
 The video on the screen is 2560 by 1440 pixels clearly 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.110
 pleasures turn in time to the very 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.070
 sweet to the screen is it really 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.200
 the coolest 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.000
 screen among all the flagships of the existing 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.330
 now it's two and a half to 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.910
 and a huge pi pi ah 538 dpi 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.040
 the screen is very sharp and bright there is no 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.990
 what claims he is perfect but it is still 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.760
 not all of you are finally thinking about changing 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.070
 interface as fashion follows 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.370
 g3 got flat design has become much 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.080
 better than before but absolutely certain 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.480
 It looks and is now a terrible shell very 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.760
 frightening is still not beautiful this of course 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.980
 more like android 4 4 but by 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.769
 compared to the beautiful nexus 5 interface 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.660
 incomparably but this interface has 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.519
 your chips let's say instead of google 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.620
 to the left of the main screen here 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.019
 there is a window with the program tracker and 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.269
 There are more tips for using g3 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.130
 An interesting chip with a keyboard can be 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.140
 customize its size to your pretty 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.030
 cool feature that did not stop 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.459
 would be the standard android keyboard itself 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.680
 by the way is very convenient and in my hands 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.870
 prerelease version g3 it is not very 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.910
 running smoothly but no doubt about it 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.250
 correct because g2 in due time 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.799
 did the same thing and now it works where 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.370
 faster than many flagships nominal raw 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.900
 software 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.760
 antutu shows not the best 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.650
 the result is only 30 thousand points 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.330
 Well, and secondly, I hold in my hand version with 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.610
 two gigabytes of ram 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.010
 they are with three as we would like and thirdly 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.290
 the shell is still heavy and takes away 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.299
 much of the power what are we 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.769
 we will wait we will wait for g3 when 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.650
 going on sale will be faster 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.060
 work we will wait for the optimization of games and 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.549
 programs for such a high resolution 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.900
 because watch videos and sit in without 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.970
 such a screen is great 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.130
 well, most of all, I think we will wait 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.620
 play edishen lg g3 version 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.580
 after all with naked android this is a dream phone with 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.979
 great design 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.699
 great screen and capacious battery all 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.699
 like that
