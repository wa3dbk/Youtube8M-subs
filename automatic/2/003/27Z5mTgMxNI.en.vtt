00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.750
 Hello guys in this video will tell you how 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.490
 create effect after combat damage 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:13.230
 or how to justify your poorly executed 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.299
 products to start scratching effect 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.029
 to create a scratch effect you can 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.859
 use at least two ways the way 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.039
 number one 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.800
 Take for example the primed helmet and 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.340
 we put in places future scratches 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.340
 silver paint 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.920
 give dry and then we will cover our 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.200
 color that is red gold when 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.280
 the paint has dried the place where it was applied 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.219
 service then paint 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.950
 we pass sandpaper and red Galicia 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.149
 it turns out scratches on so like on the chest 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.969
 already painted 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.600
 this is a way we can not use 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:57.059
 let's do it differently let's go brush and 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 silver paint or sew them with paint 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.460
 on the brush now where we need 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.460
 gently draw a brush 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.020
 there are scratches 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.430
 but after all in more women do not get 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.690
 only scratches but various burns and 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.720
 here the fun begins 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:36.530
 burns can be given paint but it 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:39.310
 boring and so now new year we burn 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.310
 betray with 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.070
 but you better don't repeat it just dangerous 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.070
 and wash your fingers loose
