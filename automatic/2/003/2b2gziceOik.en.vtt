the aerodynamics for the development of
this<00:02:24.950> 2013<00:02:25.450> fusion<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.599> very<00:02:26.810> important

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
this 2013 fusion it's very important

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.650 
this 2013 fusion it's very important
because<00:02:27.560> we<00:02:27.890> want<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.280> we<00:02:28.880> want<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.239> put<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.450> new

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
because we want to we want to put a new

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.470 
because we want to we want to put a new
car<00:02:29.989> out<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.130> very<00:02:31.430> very<00:02:31.730> similar<00:02:32.090> in

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
car out that is very very similar in

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.050 
car out that is very very similar in
downforce<00:02:33.170> level<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.920> drag<00:02:34.310> level<00:02:34.790> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
downforce level and drag level and

downforce level and drag level and
balance<00:02:35.750> level<00:02:36.430> then<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.120> current<00:02:38.540> car

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
balance level then the the current car

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.550 
balance level then the the current car
were<00:02:39.080> racing<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.190> end<00:02:40.400> up<00:02:40.610> with<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:42.019> smooth

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
were racing so we end up with a smooth

tunnel and the racetrack was was very

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.720 
tunnel and the racetrack was was very
good<00:02:52.459> because<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:54.380> last<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:55.010> iteration

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
good because the the last the iteration

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.710 
good because the the last the iteration
we<00:02:56.290> rebuilt<00:02:57.290> before<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:58.610> car<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.330> that

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
we rebuilt before the car that you that

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.410 
we rebuilt before the car that you that
we<00:02:59.870> have<00:03:00.049> in<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.319> tunnel<00:03:00.620> today<00:03:00.769> was<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:02.090> was

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
we have in the tunnel today was just was

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.550 
we have in the tunnel today was just was
which<00:03:02.720> had<00:03:02.930> just<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.620> few<00:03:03.650> details<00:03:04.310> different

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
which had just a few details different

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.190 
which had just a few details different
that<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.769> took<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.220> car<00:03:07.549> drove<00:03:08.209> very<00:03:08.569> well<00:03:08.900> at

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
that it took that car drove very well at

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.339 
that it took that car drove very well at
Homestead<00:03:09.799> in<00:03:09.950> fact<00:03:10.480> Matt<00:03:11.480> Kenseth<00:03:11.989> who<00:03:12.140> drove

Homestead in fact Matt Kenseth who drove
the<00:03:12.590> car<00:03:12.620> there<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.549> said<00:03:14.450> he<00:03:14.599> couldn't

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
the car there and said he couldn't

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.240 
the car there and said he couldn't
really<00:03:15.049> tell<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.470> difference<00:03:15.830> between<00:03:16.010> a

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
really tell the difference between a

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.699 
really tell the difference between a
current<00:03:16.670> car<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.209> new<00:03:17.420> car<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.080> that

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
current car and this new car and that

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.650 
current car and this new car and that
was<00:03:18.769> really<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.250> whole<00:03:19.519> object<00:03:20.359> of<00:03:20.510> the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
was really the whole object of the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.880 
was really the whole object of the
exercise<00:03:22.030> because<00:03:23.030> really<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.810> know<00:03:23.900> if<00:03:24.109> it's

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
exercise because really you know if it's

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.310 
exercise because really you know if it's
as<00:03:25.190> crucially<00:03:25.820> it's<00:03:26.090> absolutely<00:03:26.810> important

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
as crucially it's absolutely important

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.039 
as crucially it's absolutely important
that<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:28.220> wind<00:03:28.459> tunnel<00:03:28.790> numbers<00:03:29.150> transfer<00:03:29.750> to

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
that the wind tunnel numbers transfer to

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.770 
that the wind tunnel numbers transfer to
the<00:03:30.170> racetrack<00:03:30.790> between<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.150> current<00:03:32.569> car

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
the racetrack between the current car

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.319 
the racetrack between the current car
and<00:03:32.959> a<00:03:33.019> 2013<00:03:33.769> there<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.160> actually<00:03:34.910> very<00:03:35.090> little

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
and a 2013 there is actually very little

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.090 
and a 2013 there is actually very little
difference<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:35.959> mean<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.200> biggest<00:03:36.410> thing<00:03:36.650> it's

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
difference I mean the biggest thing it's

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.970 
difference I mean the biggest thing it's
the<00:03:37.970> car<00:03:38.239> is<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.450> bit<00:03:38.720> more<00:03:38.870> drag<00:03:39.200> because<00:03:39.769> it's

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
the car is a bit more drag because it's

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.819 
the car is a bit more drag because it's
got<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.690> slightly<00:03:41.690> sleeker<00:03:42.260> greenhouse<00:03:42.799> that

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
got a slightly sleeker greenhouse that

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.250 
got a slightly sleeker greenhouse that
flows<00:03:43.459> more<00:03:43.850> air<00:03:44.090> onto<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.540> spoiler<00:03:45.049> and

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
flows more air onto the spoiler and

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.460 
flows more air onto the spoiler and
therefore<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:47.060> has<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.329> little<00:03:47.900> bit<00:03:47.959> more<00:03:48.019> drag

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
therefore it has a little bit more drag

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.160 
therefore it has a little bit more drag
than<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.980> current<00:03:49.370> car<00:03:49.720> but<00:03:50.720> as<00:03:50.870> far<00:03:51.139> as

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
than the current car but as far as

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.680 
than the current car but as far as
downforce<00:03:51.859> level<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.760> balance<00:03:53.239> level

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
downforce level and and balance level

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.750 
downforce level and and balance level
wise<00:03:53.989> we're<00:03:54.650> very<00:03:54.889> very<00:03:55.130> close<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.730> the

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
wise we're very very close to the

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.509 
wise we're very very close to the
current<00:03:56.180> car<00:03:56.420> where<00:03:56.930> we're<00:03:57.170> at<00:03:57.350> today<00:03:58.040> in

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
current car where we're at today in

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.780 
current car where we're at today in
today's<00:03:58.670> tests<00:03:59.510> were<00:03:59.630> just<00:03:59.930> really

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
today's tests were just really

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.699 
today's tests were just really
fine-tuning<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.940> car<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.600> satisfy<00:04:03.230> some<00:04:03.560> of

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
fine-tuning the car to satisfy some of

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.949 
fine-tuning the car to satisfy some of
the<00:04:03.799> NASCAR<00:04:04.370> target<00:04:05.120> numbers<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.630> we<00:04:05.810> need

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
the NASCAR target numbers that we need

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.099 
the NASCAR target numbers that we need
to<00:04:06.139> hit<00:04:06.319> to<00:04:07.010> arrow<00:04:07.220> match<00:04:07.579> our<00:04:08.000> competitors<00:04:08.810> up

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
to hit to arrow match our competitors up

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.830 
to hit to arrow match our competitors up
to<00:04:09.410> now<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:10.069> first<00:04:10.370> few<00:04:10.639> tests<00:04:11.120> which<00:04:11.269> started

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
to now the first few tests which started

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.680 
to now the first few tests which started
back<00:04:11.870> in<00:04:12.079> in<00:04:12.889> August<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.549> last<00:04:13.579> year<00:04:13.940> that<00:04:14.480> was

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
back in in August of last year that was

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.960 
back in in August of last year that was
when<00:04:14.900> we<00:04:15.079> we<00:04:16.070> worked<00:04:16.340> through<00:04:16.609> several

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
when we we worked through several

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.779 
when we we worked through several
iterations<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.930> this<00:04:18.109> car<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.859> get<00:04:19.039> where<00:04:19.609> we

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
iterations of this car to get where we

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.180 
iterations of this car to get where we
are<00:04:19.820> now<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.660> main<00:04:20.900> objective<00:04:21.530> for<00:04:21.560> this<00:04:21.889> car

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
are now the main objective for this car

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.300 
are now the main objective for this car
is<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:23.120> put<00:04:23.360> more<00:04:23.539> brand<00:04:23.840> identity<00:04:24.530> into<00:04:25.190> the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
is to put more brand identity into the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.350 
is to put more brand identity into the
race<00:04:25.460> car

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
race car

so<00:04:26.509> so<00:04:27.020> what<00:04:27.379> we've<00:04:27.560> been<00:04:27.590> trying<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:28.189> do<00:04:28.370> is

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:28.909 
so so what we've been trying to do is

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.320 
so so what we've been trying to do is
capture<00:04:29.330> all<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.169> as<00:04:31.039> many<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.699> 2013

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
capture all the as many of the 2013

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.480 
capture all the as many of the 2013
fusion<00:04:32.870> character<00:04:33.319> lines<00:04:33.560> as<00:04:33.830> we<00:04:34.009> possibly

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
fusion character lines as we possibly

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.969 
fusion character lines as we possibly
can<00:04:34.789> and<00:04:35.229> incorporate<00:04:36.229> them<00:04:36.439> into<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.830> race

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
can and incorporate them into the race

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.340
