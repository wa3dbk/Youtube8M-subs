00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.440
 let's see then some trigger for i 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.140
 simpler predators easier but 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.040
 however definitely always effective 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.230
 let's see the squid is undoubtedly a 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.740
 bait very pleasing to all predators 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.040
 we want to do to prepare a 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.040
 trigger 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.700
 cut we close a sort of tail 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.600
 let's take a suitable hook in this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.510
 diary clearly I answer 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.840
 small squid and therefore I have 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.840
 doubled 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.450
 the trigger 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.430
 otherwise with Italian calamari then 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.070
 with more consistent baits or with the chair 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.110
 we can easily use the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.810
 Single trash is always advisable 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.780
 when we try the predator use 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.000
 a small steel portion about 10 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.560
 centimeters but almost all are needed 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.320
 the mouths of the predators they frequent 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.430
 the Mediterranean coasts cut e 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.269
 therefore it is necessary to reinforce the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.269
 terminal lot 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.080
 thanks very simple 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.290
 we die 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:47.680
 we insert let the tip of the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.269
 our hook is in the middle of the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.620
 hill that we have built to this 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.620
 point let's take some elastic thread 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.040
 let's compact the trigger lot 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.470
 the match is over 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.709
 we can surely use also the 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.180
 squid head a very trigger 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.310
 very welcome even in the presence of 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.030
 current we can also bury it if 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.480
 we want the medium is very simple itself 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.510
 crime I prefer to use a circle e 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.819
 guarantees a trigger on these 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.950
 greater possibility of grip 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.200
 in the apparatus of the prey that will go to 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.200
 turn around twice 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.560
 and therefore between the eyes 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.019
 we're going to reposition it to this 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.019
 point the elastic thread gelatin 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.290
 will compact the whole let us remember that the 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:21.590
 circle is a man who has to work 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:27.320
 must be out must be 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.760
 exposed completely clearly as 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.039
 will have the opportunity to show us the friend 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.350
 the friend antonio we can use 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.930
 even some fish to be proposed 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.510
 absolutely appetites welcome appetites 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.580
 from the predators we can use 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.620
 of sardines we can avoid that 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.630
 uncluttered or otherwise we can 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.910
 we can also use togas la 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.410
 foga however turns out to be a very bait 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.550
 appreciated by almost all the former in turin 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:55.160
 below coast in this case we use 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.199
 a bogue we first cut 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.350
 the head clearly we have private 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.600
 of the innards our and seek and now 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.710
 antonio is preparing to make two 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.710
 fillets two trans 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.080
 white meat is certainly very tasty 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.139
 much that the olfactory message that 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.889
 will come will certainly be important 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.560
 if near the wedding in expo ci 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.690
 they are thieves 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.810
 regarding the sardine 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.780
 surely there is no need to eliminate the 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.639
 thorn but with fish like boca looks 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.250
 in the morning 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.110
 rather consistent it is better to deprive it 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:43.560
 and now we are going to make the trigger 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:49.050
 real because the thing comes 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:51.930
 cured on meat from meat comes the 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.790
 slice is turned and then with 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.280
 the aid of the elastic thread we go to 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.440
 repay to compact the trigger 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:04.290
 unlike the squid with 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:06.360
 meat and tough leather fish primer 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.900
 surely the need for more laps 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:13.740
 elastic thread otherwise we risk that 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.820
 only with the launch of losing ours 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.820
 unloved trigger 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:36.190
 here our trance is ready we have 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.960
 seen three simple triggers but 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.390
 effective to carry out on the fly if any 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.040
 we will have the opportunity to realize if i 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.780
 predators for attracted ours 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.060
 situation now is ours 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.060
 Mediterranean as much as possible
