hey everybody its Jason blah hi here and

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.190 
hey everybody its Jason blah hi here and
today<00:00:09.090> I'm<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.360> teach<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.690> guys<00:00:09.870> how<00:00:09.929> to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
today I'm going to teach you guys how to

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.560 
today I'm going to teach you guys how to
perform<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.160> incline<00:00:11.639> barbell<00:00:11.849> bench<00:00:12.269> press

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
perform the incline barbell bench press

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.640 
perform the incline barbell bench press
and<00:00:12.750> yes<00:00:12.900> I'm<00:00:13.049> actually<00:00:13.200> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.469> use<00:00:13.620> a

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
and yes I'm actually going to use a

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.379 
and yes I'm actually going to use a
different<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.280> weight<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:15.030> could<00:00:15.240> break

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
different of weight that it could break

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.990 
different of weight that it could break
my<00:00:15.599> form<00:00:15.900> down<00:00:16.139> if<00:00:16.980> I'm<00:00:17.190> not<00:00:17.340> careful<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.850> I'm

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
my form down if I'm not careful so I'm

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.519 
my form down if I'm not careful so I'm
going<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> go<00:00:18.300> ahead<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.630> use<00:00:18.779> 100<00:00:19.199> kilos

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
going to go ahead and use 100 kilos

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.980 
going to go ahead and use 100 kilos
today<00:00:19.800> for<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.210> just<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.359> demonstration

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
today for this just for demonstration

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.840 
today for this just for demonstration
purposes<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.500> lift<00:00:22.740> isn't<00:00:23.189> actually<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.730> my

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
purposes this lift isn't actually in my

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.939 
purposes this lift isn't actually in my
own<00:00:23.970> routine<00:00:24.359> at<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.539> moment<00:00:24.930> now<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> would

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
own routine at the moment now I would

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.349 
own routine at the moment now I would
recommend<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.519> most<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.970> watched<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
recommend that most of you watched the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.120 
recommend that most of you watched the
benchpress<00:00:27.660> tutorial<00:00:28.439> first<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
benchpress tutorial first it's in the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.060 
benchpress tutorial first it's in the
same<00:00:29.369> playlist<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.590> an<00:00:31.710> idea<00:00:31.830> of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
same playlist so that you get an idea of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.500 
same playlist so that you get an idea of
the<00:00:32.130> basic<00:00:32.489> mechanics<00:00:32.940> because<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> lifts<00:00:33.420> are

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the basic mechanics because a lifts are

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.000 
the basic mechanics because a lifts are
very<00:00:33.719> very<00:00:33.960> similar<00:00:34.320> now<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> couple<00:00:34.890> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
very very similar now a couple of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.040 
very very similar now a couple of
mistakes<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.460> people<00:00:35.610> make<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.570> incline

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
mistakes that people make on the incline

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.280 
mistakes that people make on the incline
bench<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> three<00:00:39.270> biggest<00:00:39.600> mistakes<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.260> see

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
bench the three biggest mistakes I see

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.470 
bench the three biggest mistakes I see
are<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:40.980> don't<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.370> their<00:00:41.640> scapula<00:00:42.180> fully

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
are they don't have their scapula fully

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.650 
are they don't have their scapula fully
retracted<00:00:43.489> to<00:00:44.489> get<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> proper<00:00:45.000> stretch<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
retracted to get a proper stretch on the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.020 
retracted to get a proper stretch on the
chest<00:00:45.930> they<00:00:46.680> tend<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.010> set<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> incline<00:00:47.760> too

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
chest they tend to set the incline too

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.840 
chest they tend to set the incline too
high<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.890> either<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.219> those<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.700> go

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
high and either one of those if you go

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.760 
high and either one of those if you go
above<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.239> 45<00:00:51.750> degrees<00:00:52.110> either<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
above about 45 degrees either one of

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.010 
above about 45 degrees either one of
those<00:00:52.860> situations<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.879> itself<00:00:54.270> takes

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
those situations in and of itself takes

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.510 
those situations in and of itself takes
the<00:00:55.260> shift<00:00:55.500> off<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> chest<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> upper

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the shift off of the chest and the upper

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.970 
the shift off of the chest and the upper
chest<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.090> puts<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> more<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> delts<00:00:58.170> so

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
chest and puts it more on the delts so

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.520 
chest and puts it more on the delts so
you're<00:00:59.250> essentially<00:00:59.910> doing<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:01.199> delta

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you're essentially doing a delta

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.260 
you're essentially doing a delta
exercise<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> incline<00:01:02.940> bench<00:01:03.090> is

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
exercise now the incline bench is

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.690 
exercise now the incline bench is
already<00:01:03.570> very<00:01:03.809> very<00:01:04.250> anterior<00:01:05.250> deltoids

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
already very very anterior deltoids

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.190 
already very very anterior deltoids
dominant<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.390> does<00:01:06.570> work<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.960> upper

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
dominant but it does work the upper

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
dominant but it does work the upper
chest<00:01:07.439> very<00:01:07.680> very<00:01:07.920> effectively<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> could

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
chest very very effectively and it could

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.810 
chest very very effectively and it could
be<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> fantastic<00:01:10.280> lift<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.430> someone<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
be a fantastic lift for someone with a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
be a fantastic lift for someone with a
lagging<00:01:12.090> chest<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> third<00:01:13.920> mistake

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
lagging chest and then the third mistake

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.620 
lagging chest and then the third mistake
that<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.820> people<00:01:14.939> make<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.600> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
that you see people make it if you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.780 
that you see people make it if you
notice<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.740> look<00:01:16.770> at<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> guys<00:01:17.549> on

and me on the sides at least in
proportion<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:35.250> turn<00:01:35.310> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
proportion but then when they turn to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580 
proportion but then when they turn to
the<00:01:35.759> side<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.299> disappear<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:36.960> hit<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> side

the side they disappear they hit a side

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
the side they disappear they hit a side
chest<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.750> it's<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.189> flat<00:01:41.189> straight<00:01:41.640> down

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850

inches of the rep and they play notice
because<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.020> hurts<00:01:55.170> my<00:01:55.290> shoulders<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:55.799> hurts

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
because it hurts my shoulders what hurts

because it hurts my shoulders what hurts
their<00:01:56.219> shoulders<00:01:56.610> because<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.360> don't<00:01:57.540> know

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
their shoulders because they don't know

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
their shoulders because they don't know
how<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.719> grip<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> bar<00:01:58.259> correctly<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.100> they

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
how to grip the bar correctly and they

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.520 
how to grip the bar correctly and they
don't<00:01:59.820> know<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> proper<00:02:00.329> bar<00:02:00.570> path<00:02:00.840> now

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
don't know the proper bar path now

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.530 
don't know the proper bar path now
obviously<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:05.159> can't<00:02:05.490> go<00:02:05.729> down<00:02:05.969> here<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
obviously you can't go down here on the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.969 
obviously you can't go down here on the
lower<00:02:06.689> chest<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.170> an<00:02:07.290> incline<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.829> yellow

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
lower chest on an incline and yellow

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.740 
lower chest on an incline and yellow
stream<00:02:08.190> very<00:02:08.550> very<00:02:08.789> shallow<00:02:09.000> angle<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.569> you're

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
stream very very shallow angle so you're

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.780 
stream very very shallow angle so you're
gonna<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> go<00:02:10.349> higher<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> chest<00:02:11.099> but

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
gonna have to go higher up the chest but

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.410 
gonna have to go higher up the chest but
you<00:02:11.879> don't<00:02:12.060> want<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> bar<00:02:12.599> way<00:02:12.840> up<00:02:13.020> here

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
you don't want the bar way up here

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.350 
you don't want the bar way up here
I<00:02:13.450> recommend<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.349> about<00:02:15.220> one<00:02:15.700> inch<00:02:15.940> above<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
I recommend is about one inch above the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.880 
I recommend is about one inch above the
NIP<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:16.690> if<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.870> get<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.080> incline<00:02:17.440> set<00:02:17.709> right

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
NIP one if you get the incline set right

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.100 
NIP one if you get the incline set right
you<00:02:18.069> can<00:02:18.250> still<00:02:18.459> touch<00:02:18.670> right<00:02:19.060> here<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.599> I

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
you can still touch right here and I

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.809 
you can still touch right here and I
recommend<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.860> pause<00:02:21.220> with<00:02:21.640> your

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
recommend that you pause with your

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.940 
recommend that you pause with your
scapula<00:02:22.270> retracted<00:02:22.959> because<00:02:23.470> that's<00:02:23.770> what's

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
scapula retracted because that's what's

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.620 
scapula retracted because that's what's
going<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.099> activate<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.730> most<00:02:24.940> muscle<00:02:25.330> fibers

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
going to activate the most muscle fibers

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.210 
going to activate the most muscle fibers
in<00:02:25.750> your<00:02:25.870> chest<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.380> what<00:02:26.500> happens<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.010> that

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
in your chest and what happens is that

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.880 
in your chest and what happens is that
if<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:28.239> put<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.720> brakes<00:02:29.020> on<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.349> on<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.739> way

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
if you put the brakes on it on the way

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.750 
if you put the brakes on it on the way
down<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.430> causes<00:02:30.790> more<00:02:31.209> flare<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.860> puts<00:02:33.100> stress

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
down it causes more flare it puts stress

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.580 
down it causes more flare it puts stress
on<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.300> rotator<00:02:34.900> cuff<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.290> go<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.440> sound

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
on the rotator cuff so you go to sound

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.140 
on the rotator cuff so you go to sound
would<00:02:35.770> even<00:02:36.010> hurts<00:02:36.160> much<00:02:36.370> my<00:02:36.640> shoulders<00:02:36.970> lower

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
would even hurts much my shoulders lower

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.520 
would even hurts much my shoulders lower
coming<00:02:37.450> out<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.630> there<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.930> can't<00:02:38.200> go<00:02:38.350> any

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
coming out of there so I can't go any

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
coming out of there so I can't go any
lower<00:02:38.680> well<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.010> because<00:02:39.280> you're<00:02:39.400> putting

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
lower well it's because you're putting

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.120 
lower well it's because you're putting
the<00:02:39.760> brakes<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.530> bars<00:02:41.769> too<00:02:41.980> high

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
the brakes on it and the bars too high

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.210 
the brakes on it and the bars too high
up<00:02:42.280> your<00:02:42.459> chest<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.050> when<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.590> it

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
up your chest and when you do that it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.040 
up your chest and when you do that it
causes<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.730> flare<00:02:46.150> more<00:02:46.450> when<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.750> slow

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
causes you to flare more when you slow

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.020 
causes you to flare more when you slow
it<00:02:47.230> down<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.769> makes<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.190> delts<00:02:48.610> take<00:02:48.819> all

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
it down and it makes the delts take all

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.670 
it down and it makes the delts take all
of<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.239> load<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:49.540> your<00:02:49.690> chest<00:02:49.989> gets<00:02:50.230> none<00:02:50.560> of

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
of the load so your chest gets none of

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.530 
of the load so your chest gets none of
the<00:02:50.769> load<00:02:50.980> whereas<00:02:51.760> if<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.150> bring<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.420> all

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
the load whereas if you to bring it all

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.000 
the load whereas if you to bring it all
the<00:02:52.569> way<00:02:52.690> down<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.140> stretch<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.620> chest<00:02:53.799> by

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
the way down and stretch the chest by

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.530 
the way down and stretch the chest by
touching<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.489> chest<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:54.940> pause<00:02:55.239> on<00:02:55.450> the

the weight moving and it's going to

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.740 
the weight moving and it's going to

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
obviously I have a makeshift bench here

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.259 
obviously I have a makeshift bench here
so<00:03:22.720> it's<00:03:22.900> gonna<00:03:23.079> look<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.739> little<00:03:23.859> different

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.550 

then<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.390> used<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.810> he<00:03:28.900> doesn't<00:03:29.049> have<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.260> pad

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
to sit on are you pull yourself up get a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.860 
to sit on are you pull yourself up get a
very<00:03:33.250> very<00:03:33.609> small<00:03:33.940> arch<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.510> reason<00:03:34.750> you

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
very very small arch and the reason you

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.479 
very very small arch and the reason you
need<00:03:35.019> that<00:03:35.260> is<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.739> your<00:03:35.859> traps<00:03:36.190> are

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
need that is so that your traps are

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.979 
need that is so that your traps are
mostly<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:36.910> contact<00:03:37.269> with<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.510> bench<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.930> you

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
mostly in contact with the bench and you

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.300 
mostly in contact with the bench and you
can<00:03:38.109> get<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.350> shoulder<00:03:38.680> blades<00:03:38.950> pasted

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
can get the shoulder blades pasted

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.599 
can get the shoulder blades pasted
together<00:03:40.239> really<00:03:40.780> tight<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.470> also<00:03:42.040> recommend

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
together really tight I also recommend

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.460

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
that you get the bar this way so that

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.259 
that you get the bar this way so that
your<00:03:44.680> elbows<00:03:44.829> can<00:03:45.280> pop<00:03:45.489> out<00:03:45.670> just<00:03:45.730> like<00:03:46.120> I

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
get a better idea of what the setup

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.230 
get a better idea of what the setup
looks<00:04:42.590> like<00:04:42.800> with<00:04:43.069> the<00:04:43.190> bar<00:04:43.430> path<00:04:43.699> itself

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
looks like with the bar path itself

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.200 
looks like with the bar path itself
looks<00:04:44.569> like<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:46.370> can<00:04:46.580> see<00:04:46.729> where<00:04:46.910> it<00:04:47.000> touches

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
looks like you can see where it touches

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.480 
looks like you can see where it touches
on<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.569> chest<00:04:47.870> you<00:04:48.740> can<00:04:48.889> see<00:04:49.099> where<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.370> blocks

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
on the chest you can see where it blocks

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.480 
on the chest you can see where it blocks
on<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:50.000> top<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:51.530> again<00:04:51.740> it's<00:04:51.919> ever<00:04:52.130> been<00:04:52.340> good
