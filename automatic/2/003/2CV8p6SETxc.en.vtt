in-depth with the NHL 13 Ultimate Team

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.499 
in-depth with the NHL 13 Ultimate Team
they<00:00:14.400> made<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> lot<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.790> changes<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.360> a

actually kind of made a lot of changes

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.320 
actually kind of made a lot of changes
going<00:00:19.289> more<00:00:19.920> towards<00:00:20.369> how<00:00:20.609> FIFA<00:00:20.939> does<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.240> with

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
going more towards how FIFA does it with

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.689 
going more towards how FIFA does it with
the<00:00:21.359> bronze<00:00:21.630> silver<00:00:21.840> gold<00:00:21.990> packs<00:00:22.470> no<00:00:23.220> career

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
cards only last I think a game maybe two

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.519 
cards only last I think a game maybe two
games<00:00:29.039> now<00:00:29.250> which<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.240> like<00:00:30.449> because<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
games now which I really like because I

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.020 
games now which I really like because I
kind<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:32.189> all<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> cards<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> same

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
kind of like all the cards are the same

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.560 
kind of like all the cards are the same
I<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:33.840> player<00:00:34.110> posted<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.680> him<00:00:35.219> having

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
I like one player posted like him having

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.610 
I like one player posted like him having
different<00:00:36.570> overall<00:00:36.840> every<00:00:37.079> time<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
different overall every time and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.840 
different overall every time and
different<00:00:37.860> number<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> career<00:00:38.399> games<00:00:38.610> left

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
different number of career games left

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580 
different number of career games left
every<00:00:39.030> time<00:00:39.239> really<00:00:39.840> hard<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.140> judge<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.350> much

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
every time really hard to judge how much

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.229 
every time really hard to judge how much
the<00:00:40.680> players<00:00:40.920> worth<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.550> makes<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> lot

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the players worth so it makes it a lot

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.360 
the players worth so it makes it a lot
harder<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.570> trade<00:00:42.840> more<00:00:43.620> people<00:00:43.860> trading<00:00:44.280> more

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
harder to trade more people trading more

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.740 
harder to trade more people trading more

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
especially when this like the player you

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.960 
especially when this like the player you
get<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> wing<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.580> skied<00:01:08.850> up

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

she<00:01:09.180> starts<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> really<00:01:09.780> accelerate<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.470> lot

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
she starts to really accelerate a lot

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.170 
she starts to really accelerate a lot
faster<00:01:11.040> now<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> lot<00:01:11.400> more<00:01:11.430> realistic<00:01:11.729> too<00:01:12.060> with

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
faster now a lot more realistic too with

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.820 
faster now a lot more realistic too with
a<00:01:12.240> stick<00:01:12.510> way<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.840> front<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.080> them<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.409> like

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.440 
a stick way out in front of them I like
the<00:01:13.979> new<00:01:14.130> stopping<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> player<00:01:15.210> trying

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the new stopping now the player trying

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
the new stopping now the player trying
to<00:01:15.570> skate<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> side<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.470> see<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> ice<00:01:17.009> come

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
that's what happened so that's really

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.030 
that's what happened so that's really
good<00:02:55.299> in<00:02:56.299> terms<00:02:56.569> of<00:02:56.870> other<00:02:57.319> game<00:02:57.590> modes<00:02:57.829> guys

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
like the FIFA 12 arena mode where you

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.490 
like the FIFA 12 arena mode where you

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
net which I really like I don't know why

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.559 
net which I really like I don't know why
it<00:03:06.530> took<00:03:06.739> them<00:03:06.919> so<00:03:06.980> long<00:03:07.159> to<00:03:07.310> implement<00:03:07.879> that<00:03:08.329> I

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
it took them so long to implement that I

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.059 
it took them so long to implement that I
know<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.959> can<00:03:08.989> do<00:03:09.169> that<00:03:09.290> would<00:03:09.349> be<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.560> pro<00:03:09.859> when

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
know you can do that would be a pro when

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.500 
know you can do that would be a pro when
they<00:03:10.189> have<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.519> be<00:03:10.639> a<00:03:10.669> pro<00:03:10.879> like<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.120> could<00:03:11.359> go

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
they have it be a pro like you could go

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.059 
they have it be a pro like you could go
there<00:03:11.689> I'm<00:03:12.200> not<00:03:12.349> sure<00:03:12.500> why<00:03:12.620> took<00:03:12.799> me<00:03:12.889> so<00:03:13.040> long

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
play in the demo but there was a thing

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.210 
play in the demo but there was a thing
for<00:03:38.599> it<00:03:38.690> I<00:03:38.750> seen<00:03:38.989> a<00:03:39.019> little<00:03:39.470> video<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.979> think

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
for it I seen a little video I think

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.530 
for it I seen a little video I think
that<00:03:40.340> he<00:03:40.519> was<00:03:40.639> actually<00:03:40.790> on<00:03:40.970> my<00:03:41.060> channel<00:03:41.419> and

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
that he was actually on my channel and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.990 
that he was actually on my channel and
then<00:03:42.199> there<00:03:42.470> was<00:03:42.560> also<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.979> plane<00:03:43.699> out<00:03:43.879> which

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
then there was also the plane out which

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.909 
then there was also the plane out which
is<00:03:44.120> just<00:03:44.239> like<00:03:44.389> a<00:03:44.419> Stanley<00:03:44.750> Cup<00:03:44.810> game<00:03:45.139> with<00:03:45.650> LA

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
you know eighty five eighty two and 82

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.959 
you know eighty five eighty two and 82
they're<00:04:58.139> like<00:04:58.409> four<00:04:59.009> and<00:04:59.039> a<00:04:59.159> half<00:04:59.189> four<00:04:59.729> and

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
they're like four and a half four and

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.659 
they're like four and a half four and
four<00:05:00.240> for<00:05:00.539> their<00:05:00.710> stat<00:05:01.710> reading<00:05:02.039> now<00:05:02.520> that

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
four for their stat reading now that

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.249 
four for their stat reading now that
it's<00:05:02.819> different<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.360> it's<00:05:03.509> pretty<00:05:03.659> cool<00:05:03.930> cuz

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
I guess all the teams are so equal they

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:06.769 
I guess all the teams are so equal they
can<00:05:05.939> do<00:05:06.029> that<00:05:06.210> but<00:05:06.389> I<00:05:06.449> would<00:05:06.599> much<00:05:06.750> rather

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:06.779 
can do that but I would much rather

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:08.059
