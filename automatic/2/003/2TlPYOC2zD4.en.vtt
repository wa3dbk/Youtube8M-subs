00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
guess somebody asks you how secure they

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.529 
guess somebody asks you how secure they

through them and someone asked hey are
wireless<00:00:50.399> keyboards<00:00:51.000> secure<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> didn't

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
wireless keyboards secure so I didn't

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.090 
out what I'm typing you know you're it
turns<00:01:00.690> an<00:01:00.870> email<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.379> hard<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.859> somebody

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
turns an email it's hard for somebody

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.000 
turns an email it's hard for somebody
office<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.539> signal<00:01:04.010> great

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
office not to get your signal great

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.539 
office not to get your signal great
turns<00:01:05.760> out<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.630> shocking<00:01:07.260> how<00:01:07.979> bad<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
turns out it's just shocking how bad the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.609 
turns out it's just shocking how bad the
security<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> wireless<00:01:09.810> keybo<00:01:10.140> not<00:01:10.290> using

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
security is a wireless keybo not using

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
security is a wireless keybo not using
encryption<00:01:10.920> well<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.540> what

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
encryption well what they have what

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.230 
encryption well what they have what
they're<00:01:13.290> doing<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> cannot<00:01:14.250> call<00:01:14.520> encryption

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
they're doing you cannot call encryption

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
they're doing you cannot call encryption
okay<00:01:15.689> maybe<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.439> could<00:01:16.590> call<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.860> obfuscation

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
okay maybe you could call it obfuscation

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.539 
okay maybe you could call it obfuscation
when<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.479> associate<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.770> keyboard<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
when you associate the keyboard with the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.830 
when you associate the keyboard with the
receiver<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.869> agree<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.790> one<00:01:23.790> bite<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.689> say

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
receiver they agree on one bite they say

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.990 
receiver they agree on one bite they say
they<00:01:25.049> choose<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> bite<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:25.979> random<00:01:26.610> that's<00:01:26.850> kind

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
they choose a bite at random that's kind

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.600 
they choose a bite at random that's kind
of<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.210> past<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.930> six<00:01:28.170> sorry<00:01:29.130> eight<00:01:29.310> bits

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
of your past like six sorry eight bits

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.120 
of your past like six sorry eight bits
yeah<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.990> happens<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> data<00:01:31.799> coming

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
yeah and what happens is the data coming

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.810 
yeah and what happens is the data coming
out<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> keyboard<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.650> ex-ored<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.829> this

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
out of the keyboard is ex-ored with this

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.080 
out of the keyboard is ex-ored with this
bike<00:01:36.150> what's<00:01:36.479> X<00:01:36.659> or<00:01:36.869> X<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.500> isn't<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.490> my<00:01:38.610> ax<00:01:38.880> or

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
bike what's X or X or isn't a my ax or

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.929 
bike what's X or X or isn't a my ax or
it's<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.049> it's<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.500> process<00:01:40.979> basically<00:01:41.250> which

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it's a it's a process basically which

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.969 
it's a it's a process basically which
says<00:01:42.439> invert<00:01:43.439> some<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> bits<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
says invert some of the bits right and

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.550 
says invert some of the bits right and
always<00:01:46.979> always<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.640> same<00:01:47.850> bits<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
always always the same bits right so and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.670 
always always the same bits right so and
there's<00:01:49.860> only<00:01:50.119> 256<00:01:51.119> possible<00:01:51.680> combinations

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
there's only 256 possible combinations

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.569 
there's only 256 possible combinations
of<00:01:52.920> eight<00:01:53.250> bits<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.920> turns<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.399> it's

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
of eight bits so so it turns out it's

in<00:02:21.209> everything<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.260> turns<00:02:22.560> out<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:22.890> it's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
in everything it turns out that it's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.180
