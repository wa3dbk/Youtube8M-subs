of<00:01:11.440> its<00:01:11.619> own<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:12.310> certainly<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:12.820> motivating

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
of its own it certainly is motivating

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.539 
of its own it certainly is motivating
because<00:01:13.689> no<00:01:13.990> one<00:01:14.170> wants<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.530> be<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.040> team<00:01:15.520> that

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
because no one wants to be the team that

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.969 
because no one wants to be the team that
you<00:01:16.330> know<00:01:16.420> it's<00:01:16.570> their<00:01:16.750> senior<00:01:17.290> class<00:01:17.560> senior

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
you know it's their senior class senior

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.980 
you know it's their senior class senior
year<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.549> and<00:01:18.729> they're<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.539> team<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:19.930> the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.469 
year and and they're the team that the
streak<00:01:20.380> is<00:01:20.530> you<00:01:21.220> know<00:01:21.310> broken<00:01:21.670> I<00:01:21.909> guess<00:01:22.119> it's

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
streak is you know broken I guess it's

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.210 
streak is you know broken I guess it's
going<00:01:22.720> to<00:01:22.869> happen<00:01:23.020> eventually<00:01:23.409> it's<00:01:23.979> going<00:01:24.130> to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
going to happen eventually it's going to

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.460 
going to happen eventually it's going to
happen<00:01:24.399> I<00:01:24.640> think<00:01:24.670> we<00:01:24.970> all<00:01:25.000> realize<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.720> we're

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
happen I think we all realize that we're

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.870 
happen I think we all realize that we're
just<00:01:26.590> trying<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:26.920> delay<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.399> for<00:01:27.549> as<00:01:27.670> long<00:01:27.820> as

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
just trying to delay it for as long as

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.139 
just trying to delay it for as long as
we<00:01:28.210> possibly<00:01:28.390> can<00:01:28.869> I<00:01:29.190> think<00:01:30.190> we've<00:01:30.789> remained

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
we possibly can I think we've remained

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.760 
we possibly can I think we've remained
hungry<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:31.960> we're<00:01:32.080> always<00:01:32.229> looking<00:01:32.409> for<00:01:32.710> that

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
hungry and we're always looking for that

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.440 
hungry and we're always looking for that
next<00:01:32.830> win<00:01:33.369> so<00:01:33.700> rather<00:01:33.880> than<00:01:34.000> sitting<00:01:34.420> around

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
next win so rather than sitting around
