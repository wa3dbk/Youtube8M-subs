 I'm here to bring you an amap taste 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.430
 anyway then neither to see a little 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.500
 this map rules then this 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.420
 you know the paper already for the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.369
 mini ctm that now that the site in my 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.199
 channel some time ago however with the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.029
 they are all game rugby and peaceful 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.519
 don't break blocking don't use of the balance 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.750
 automatic don't give a cit way no 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.059
 jump to free good level 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.100
 fun then we put the peaceful 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.739
 we say it already can be automatic it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.829
 we therefore remove that we are in place of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.600
 render see information 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.610
 information all information of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.670
 map creator so we can already 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.110
 immediately start the map then here there 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.969
 are the levels we start we seem to have 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.489
 understood that if we go to complete 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.710
 these levels we can give unlock 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.120
 the last goal that the last level 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 that would be that of the net then 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.170
 let's start immediately with parkour 02 all ici 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.489
 that I tried a little to do some 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.470
 parkour and it's really something 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.210
 too much too comfortable with the button 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.950
 side here for the jump really 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.430
 too much too comfortable too 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.830
 too much 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.000
 ok we have already arrived at the end of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.580
 level then we take ours 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.100
 beautiful obsidian peace the exits with 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 i say go down here and go or that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.689
 let's do the second level with the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.430
 anvils away we start maybe at the beginning 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.680
 this might have seemed uncomfortable 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.509
 mechanism but really very comfortable 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.030
 these commands then this too 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 second level has been completed 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.270
 tramelli these levels because they are 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.329
 very very short but they are nice and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.280
 instant to do as he warns that I am 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.670
 exceeding the temperature of 70 degrees 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.500
 perfect even lexus suffers from heat here 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.549
 we come to the perfect third level with the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.030
