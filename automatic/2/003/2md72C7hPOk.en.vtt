00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
controlled these days there's a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.400 
controlled these days there's a
difference<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.300> lot<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.020> people<00:00:34.170> would<00:00:34.260> think

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
difference a lot of people would think

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.410 
difference a lot of people would think
that<00:00:34.559> that's<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.460> krump<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.790> now<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.239> not

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
that that's what krump is now it's not

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.060 
that that's what krump is now it's not
it's<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:38.040> lot<00:00:38.430> more<00:00:38.579> controlled<00:00:39.469> it's<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.770> point

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
it's a lot more controlled it's on point

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.709 
it's a lot more controlled it's on point
and<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.489> changed<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.120> very<00:00:42.300> different<00:00:42.510> now

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and it's changed it's very different now

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.510 
and it's changed it's very different now
because<00:00:43.290> tie-dye<00:00:43.620> has<00:00:43.860> brought<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> new<00:00:44.219> thing

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
because tie-dye has brought a new thing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.610 
because tie-dye has brought a new thing
to<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.789> well<00:00:45.629> he<00:00:45.960> switched<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.230> style<00:00:46.469> up

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to it well he switched the style up

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.940 
to it well he switched the style up
anyway<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.809> when<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.930> bring<00:00:49.110> arm<00:00:49.410> swings<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
anyway so when you bring arm swings to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.590 
anyway so when you bring arm swings to
the<00:00:49.980> table<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:51.270> very<00:00:51.570> dynamic<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.680> it's

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
the table it's very dynamic like it's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.880 
the table it's very dynamic like it's
the<00:00:54.600> stronger<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> more<00:00:55.410> powerful

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the stronger you are the more powerful

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.139 
the stronger you are the more powerful
you<00:00:55.980> are<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.370> control<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you are the more control you have the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.670 
you are the more control you have the
better<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.539> will<00:00:57.690> look<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.109> you're<00:00:58.260> very<00:00:58.469> loose

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
better it will look if you're very loose
