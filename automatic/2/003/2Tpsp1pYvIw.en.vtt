00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.610

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:19.240
 [Music] 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.240

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.460

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.180
 [Music] 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.180
 pinchinn 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.960

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.960
 We do the damn war 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.510

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.510

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.539

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.780
 [Music] 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.369
 fastest possible and the most basic solar 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.720
 that turns the enemies all that 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.720
 love it but this one has 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.660
 I hope that 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.030

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.360
 [Music] 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.680

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.680

 do you have 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.240
 and take out a console or at least 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.850
 to get better 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.850
 whether it's competition with the young 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:39.730
 that can not be better work and if 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.880

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.880
 [Applause]

 I'm a gamer 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.990
 also everything there is to see here 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.990
 allows the very 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:32.500
