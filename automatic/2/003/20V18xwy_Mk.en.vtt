00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.180
 I 'm alex ax and this is the 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:21.500
 review of the titanium congress and until 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.800
 one of the very good compressor for whom 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.050
 still do not know is an effect that tries 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.840
 standardize your timbre 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.620
 this way it picks up the signals that are 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.540
 with a lower volume and extend and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:42.609
 the signal peaks and reduce certain 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.340
 So here I am with my banes. 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:49.489
 using her ability to stay with 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.030
 a lord body and that's her ring 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.030
 then the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.270
 when turning on the compressor 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:23.700
 Just when I call confess I realize 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:25.350
 a small reduction in the attack is him 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.200
 staying a little softer does not stay so 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:35.630
 as installed as usual right 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 that's ok 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.320
 in these controls you have the first 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.190
 control that the level and amount of 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.860
 It is made 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.479
 the second is the attack time and the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.350
 third is your time 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.240
 If I shorten the attack he gets the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.460
 sound even less natural because more 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.530
 quickly the compressor will start 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.060
 to act and therefore the notes will stay 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.060
 even faster 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:27.870
 I have and I really enjoyed leaving. 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.639
 the attack in 75% 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.129
 this causes the compressor to slow down 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:38.659
 little more to be able to act and left my 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.659
 very natural timbre 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.199
 if you expand your livelihood on the sound 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:57.959
 also got a little less natural 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:00.650
 but you get the sus 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.650
 stretched out 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.650
 if I take it if I take the sound already cut 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.400
 he is going to fall, his book is already growing, huh? 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:39.090
 realize then it's really cool its a 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.280
 The regulation that I liked the most was 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.050
 that controls in flat with the attack 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.610
 in 75% 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.850
 I think it looks pretty natural from the 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.850
 world 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:04:09.000
 disconnecting another form of use 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:13.800
 that the course here now put the goal 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.910
 I placed a distortion here and it will 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.360
 it 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:22.440
 this is one is using here the a voxtron hleb 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:25.100
 connected in line with this one is one of the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.100
 artifacts 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.000
 he is already distortion to Dedeu right 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.520
 but even then sometimes I liked 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.050
 put a little compressor see that 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.600
 it has increased a little run that is 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.730
 expected is the use of the compressor 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:54.040
 So what I did is he gives you more. 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.050
 body is still, so I'm going to play with it 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.200
 off then I'll call you 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.200
 go along 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.020
 he gives a punch 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.170
 without counting on the tem 's, it is also 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.170
 at that 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.879
 ae 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.879
 ie ii 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.040
 I came back a little sharper than in the 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.040
 first 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:24.560
 It's quite the idea is this. 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.780
 there is the tip for who this pedal can 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.820
 for people who are 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.639
 interested in using an extract 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.820
 guitars that have a single and that does not give 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.220
 a full bodied one a little compensated in the 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:41.090
 year volume that actually decreases when 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.790
 we extract it and for people who already 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:47.419
 have an ample team or pedals with a 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.250
 drive and that does not give one a pushed the 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:52.250
 cons is that the controls are very 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:56.510
 sensitive then you quickly lose 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:59.660
 a little there of the dynamics's footprint is 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:05.120
 to win as an extra these other 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:07.400
 things that are bad have etc 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.949
 Yeah, but it's something for you to test. 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.930
 even and see their real needs 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:14.840
 usually not a first pedal is 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.150
 that the guitarist choose to put more 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.830
 those that put you the sound guitarists 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:23.169
 what do you know you 're doing right? 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.169
 So this is a hug and until the next
