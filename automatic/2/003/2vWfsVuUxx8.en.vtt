00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.640
 to make me miami farmer hello 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.970
 welcome to the farm welcome to call 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.800
 TV 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.750
 today I present you a series 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.070
 of three mice they are all 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.670
 identical they come from 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.769
 at roccat 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.500
 it's mostly a special series 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.730
 a limited edition of the mouse 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.579
 that you know and that we have 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.320
 already tested the recognizes pure optical so 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.780
 there is talk of the military 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.340
 edition so you see at the level of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.829
 color we are going to turn it is to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.600
 something very military so 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.950
 this mouse well I'll talk about it 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.570
 quite quickly because you know 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.399
 that I think the greatest good is 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.079
 not very objective I recognize it but 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.000
 it is in my opinion the best mouse 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.460
 content size for a type of grip 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.829
 hand access and finger or cloud gate so 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.600
 certainly the best mouse to my 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.250
 sense now obviously maybe that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.930
 some will disagree but in 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.549
 all cases we are left with a 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.990
 packaging on which I pass quickly 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.760
 it's hard because we will find the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.030
 blue information inserts a box to 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.390
 rama a little explanatory diagram behind 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.250
 at the same bundle level they are 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.600
 all provided with a small guide of 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.189
 quick start and that's about it 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.240
 all three boxes are identical 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.850
 I took out the mice mostly to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.930
 show the few differences of 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.759
 colors 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.490
 we are at roccat so the finish is 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.570
 excellent is nothing to say for the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.990
 return in every way you do not 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:40.200
 find no fault here is the camo 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:43.020
 load the naval storm and the desert 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.000
 strike so a sailboat covered with 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.270
 softouch so a mouse a word 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.610
 change rather focused green camouflage a little 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.040
 army naval stone whose gray 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.920
 rather boat and the desert strike a little 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.140
 yellow of the sand tunes and so this is a 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.969
 relatively thin mouse not very long 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.009
 not too much the hull is good 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.390
 world and on the bomb and biting on 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.179
 the back we will find the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.080
 traditional logo that will light up from 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.580
 the color you want 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.910
 since of one through the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.980
 dwelling 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.150
 she will choose the hull and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.130
 in one piece with the cliques who 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.470
 are roms a wheel 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.600
 in an insert the buttons to go up and 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.660
 to lower the dpi the wheel that 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.740
 wear the delicate name of titan wind 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.940
 really a nice currency 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.980
 who might have deserved a little 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.570
 of aluminum and the unwinding and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.760
 scrolling and the screen are very very 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.800
 very well mark quite nice 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.110
 it's really a soul a wheel of 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.400
 good quality on the side of the coup goes 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.400
 find a small marking on the front 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.470
 recess of buttons on the edge and 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.230
 on the other hand rather simple is a 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.820
 conne and ergonomics too 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 relatively simple below we go 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.910
 find an evolution of the sensor 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.240
 optical roccat home since there 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.790
 goes pro on the small cq5 r5 if I do not 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.710
 misleads me with skates evolution 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.070
 the main sensor is that of the 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.560
 pure optical cone first name to 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.370
 this one in 2000 dpi so we reached 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.500
 5000 dpi 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.180
 obviously we are at roccat so you 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.870
 have a mouse that is compatible with 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.460
 the numbers 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.540
 a handset roughly the buttons of the 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.310
 mouse with the keyboard buttons so 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.230
 to multiply the number of buttons 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.490
 programmable at the technical level 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.780
 what can I teach you I wanted 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.200
 says the sensor is another foot of 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.670
 optics 100 1000 dpi destruction of 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.680
 neurons I wanted to said she embarks a 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.940
 32-bit turbo core processor for the 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.709
 that communication by nora with 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.540
 the computer is translating 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.810
 it also has a memory chip 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.060
 576 kilos 16 million colors at 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.610
 level of 7 button diodes 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.090
 programmable more obviously with 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.489
 the schist isi so we have a mouse that 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.230
 finally we get a little bit of 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.780
 personality then as much tell you that 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.800
 these two there I find them very successful 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.060
 little less seduced by the thermo 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.810
 charge since the glass is a little too much 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.980
 green green lattice very muddy but 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.660
 for once, it's still a mouse 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.920
 really really nice to take 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.170
 in hand very nice 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.390
 obviously not at all tomorrow but 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.910
 finger closed no problem so a 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.350
 mouse sold 69 euros 90 it's still 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.060
 a little bit the problem and cros 4 that's 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.500
 a bit expensive but looking good we 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.300
 finds them very very very often in 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.040
 promotion and in fact they become 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.830
 quite recommendable at the level of 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.419
 rate the software cdu roccat so a 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.980
 gas plant on which you will be able to 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.420
 pretty much do everything so I'll you 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.670
 invite to come read the written test for 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.120
 have more details about the app 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.470
 and it was the roccat kone pure military 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.660
 cowcotland edition 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.580
 I invite you to read the test 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.630
 writing I'm telling you very soon and I 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.630
 say you especially goodbye
