00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.160 
another effort to dig down through what
is<00:01:55.860> some<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.280> hardest<00:01:56.579> stone<00:01:57.000> known<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
is some of the hardest stone known you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.480 
is some of the hardest stone known you
know<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> looks<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.799> tried<00:01:59.159> at<00:01:59.369> one

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
know it looks like they tried at one

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.789 
know it looks like they tried at one
point<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.820> drive<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> tunnel<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.780> hit<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
point to drive a tunnel and hit the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.920 
point to drive a tunnel and hit the
gravel<00:02:02.219> from<00:02:02.579> below<00:02:02.969> through<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.570> talus

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
gravel from below through the talus

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.780 
gravel from below through the talus
slope<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.439> they<00:02:04.860> gave<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.460> effort

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
slope and they gave up on that effort

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.940 
slope and they gave up on that effort
and<00:02:06.149> figured<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:06.780> easier<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.259> punch

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and figured it would be easier to punch

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.400 
and figured it would be easier to punch
down<00:02:08.190> through<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> top<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.379> know

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
down through the top and that's you know

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.010 
down through the top and that's you know
that's<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.860> an<00:02:11.129> incredible<00:02:11.910> amount<00:02:12.150> of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
that's just an incredible amount of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.020 
that's just an incredible amount of
moving<00:02:13.380> rock<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.890> there's<00:02:14.400> no<00:02:14.580> production

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
moving rock and there's no production

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.880

records<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.480> tell<00:02:15.660> us<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.410> know<00:02:16.500> whether<00:02:16.680> they

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
were successful so I did I'm guessing

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.970 
were successful so I did I'm guessing
that<00:02:18.810> they<00:02:18.930> probably<00:02:19.140> didn't<00:02:19.530> find<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.860> whole

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
that they probably didn't find a whole
