00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.320
 The Tteyuu to say is 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.850
 What is difficult 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.750
 Sunday you sunday 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.750
 What kind of thing 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.160
 Great 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.330
 What you can do 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.030
 1 piece 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.090
 But I always think that 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.729
 What is it? 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.880
 The erase 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.830
 Or say tsunami 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.810
 Because of the great earthquake 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.140
 On the other hand 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.830
 The answer is that you can do something about the photo year 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:57.510
 When I got an interview like this and I can suck it back 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.160
 I do not think there is a photo 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.160
 I think I'm wondering 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.270
 So the Tteyuu doing the guidelines because not found maybe now things like that answer breath 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.270
 Spit up 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.989
 It Big 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.820
 Part of such a chaotic 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.820
 Also to have become 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.110
 I have a feeling that 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.770
 Not only that 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.770
 You will always be asked as if you are doing photos 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:48.900
 Not only Mr. Masaru , but also as a Hurren 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.900
 After all 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.930
 You sometimes want to tell 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:02.420
 I think that there is something I want to think, I'm doing it myself 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:05.019
 UGA So if anything in the photograph What is whether like a answer to quit even born If you get the amazing clear 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.019
 I think 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.960
 If you can make music like you said before , let's do it with music 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.720
 You might want to be maybe the philosopher 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.379
 Always thinking 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.379
 I'm doing 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.569
 amazing 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.230
 I think that a large amount of information 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.960
 That the Tteyuu 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.590
 Seeing that there is a lot of information 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.640
 Nogaa Tteyuu that I thought 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.410
 Friends and their photo 8 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.720
 That photo is from Doi or I know to some extent 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:52.520
 Also Nde I knew some degree of I mean Ryobi jal 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:55.460
 Ah I mean I think if you look at it is Nante say so would think this thing 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:04:00.880
 I guess that's an estimate of the degree 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.880
 It is made to think about various things far beyond 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.140
 42 The performance called that photo 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.550
 Although it is something to record 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.550
 Well that's gone 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.609
 How is there what originally existed 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:25.210
 The photo exists as a representation of the data 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.270
 That doubles down to 30 and drops to 0 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.270
 so 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.540
 But if it is substance it talks day 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.540
 We are living color 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.139
 Things are delicious too 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:45.889
 Memory is not another thing 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.889
 Something one such 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.599
 Sometimes I have no memory 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.800
 What is the opportunity to think about great deeply attached to such differences like 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.940
 Something amazing 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.190
 To be honest 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.889
 First of all look at that picture 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:17.409
 I came to think about Grandpa all the time 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.639
 My grandpa is now the first 13-year-old Day 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:24.860
 That 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:28.740
 I do not go to the 5th edition dementia but it is beginning to say that I do something 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.900
 I memory is rewritten in your grandpa's head 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.590
 To something that did not exist Castle 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.910
 How to remember 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:41.930
 It's been done that Grandpa everyone's Ne- 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:45.060
 Not 's for me I Ke thread in it that really deep 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.360
 I think it is strange for any person 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.360
 That 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:57.030
 What did you say about what existed ? 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:01.139
 But it really a matter of course to say I have stood in its place 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.310
 Standing in place of what was not present 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.969
 4 grandpa 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.830
 And Tashi had 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:12.790
 What kind of scenery can you see from Grandpa? 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.270
 To think much to say is what has fallen is what in the eyes of Knitting Grandpa 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.270
 become 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:23.580
 And popping a such a thought 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.780
 I thought I wanted to do something about making a single piece of work 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:30.050
 But 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.050
 But not mean or take a direct Grandpa to say that it is because 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:36.310
 I think I will go to something else different if I take grandpa directly 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:45.780
 Because 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:45.780
 It supposed to be I am allowed to participate in this project while doing I thought to say 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.470
 That try 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:59.180
 I don't know what it really does not look at 8 o'clock but what happens 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:01.960
 Fun to say is Na's seems to be able to grab something one answer what chance to see me 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.960
 There is so much 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.919
 So I also want to make the title a love letter 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.919
 but 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.670
 I am thinking about it
