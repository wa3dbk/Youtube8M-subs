chicken<00:01:36.729> thigh<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:36.910> cut<00:01:37.150> off<00:01:37.240> all<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.450> sinew

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
chicken thigh is cut off all the sinew

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.910 
chicken thigh is cut off all the sinew
and<00:01:37.780> just<00:01:38.050> cut<00:01:38.200> them<00:01:38.350> up<00:01:38.410> into<00:01:38.590> small

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
and just cut them up into small

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.130 
and just cut them up into small
bite-sized<00:01:39.729> pieces<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.450> just<00:01:40.630> want<00:01:40.840> mushroom

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
bite-sized pieces and just want mushroom

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.630 
bite-sized pieces and just want mushroom
about<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.440> same<00:01:41.619> although<00:01:42.070> mushroom<00:01:42.460> does

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
about the same although mushroom does

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.230 
about the same although mushroom does
shrink<00:01:42.880> as<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.210> cooks<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:44.460> maybe<00:01:45.460> pieces<00:01:45.970> like

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
shrink as it cooks so maybe pieces like

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.880 
shrink as it cooks so maybe pieces like
that<00:01:46.420> pick<00:01:46.630> them<00:01:46.750> up<00:01:46.869> tight<00:01:47.260> yeah<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.470> mean<00:01:47.680> big

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
that pick them up tight yeah I mean big

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.990 
that pick them up tight yeah I mean big
motions<00:01:48.160> like<00:01:48.220> this<00:01:48.369> really<00:01:48.580> easy<00:01:48.760> just<00:01:48.910> to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
motions like this really easy just to

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.820 
motions like this really easy just to
break<00:01:49.240> slice<00:01:49.900> whatever<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:50.380> find<00:01:50.500> easier

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
break slice whatever you find easier

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.030 
break slice whatever you find easier
easier<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.790> better<00:01:51.970> when<00:01:52.210> it<00:01:52.330> comes<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.750> Mike

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
easier the better when it comes to Mike

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.160 
easier the better when it comes to Mike
there<00:01:54.040> you<00:01:54.100> go<00:01:54.220> so<00:01:54.430> onion<00:01:54.790> bacon<00:01:55.119> garlic<00:01:55.660> next

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
there you go so onion bacon garlic next

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.780 
there you go so onion bacon garlic next
in<00:01:56.380> all<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.860> chicken<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.369> all<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.729> the

on it so that's the bulk to our filling
of<00:02:08.020> our<00:02:08.110> cobbler<00:02:08.320> now<00:02:08.739> we<00:02:08.800> need<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.160> source

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
of our cobbler now we need to source

and chicken stock a little bit at a time
stirring<00:02:28.060> until<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.570> becomes<00:02:28.870> kind<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.170> lump

free a nice consistency for sauce and
then<00:02:32.049> let<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.320> bubble<00:02:32.470> down<00:02:32.709> for<00:02:32.920> 10<00:02:33.070> minutes

then let it bubble down for 10 minutes

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.410 
then let it bubble down for 10 minutes
can<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.129> stop<00:02:35.370> at<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.550> breather<00:02:35.879> room<00:02:36.180> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
can I stop at the breather room is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.119 
can I stop at the breather room is
bubbling<00:02:36.840> away<00:02:36.930> which<00:02:37.379> means<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.800> move

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
bubbling away which means we can move

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.559 
bubbling away which means we can move
all<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.459> bit<00:02:38.580> actually<00:02:38.879> makes<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.209> cobbler

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
all the bit actually makes this cobbler

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.229 
all the bit actually makes this cobbler
yes<00:02:40.019> no<00:02:40.349> cobbler<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.160> what<00:02:41.550> we've<00:02:41.700> got<00:02:41.730> is

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
yes no cobbler so what we've got is

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.839 
yes no cobbler so what we've got is
still<00:02:42.959> pressing<00:02:43.110> flour<00:02:43.410> which<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.830> go<00:02:43.980> into<00:02:44.640> a

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
still pressing flour which can go into a

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.619 
still pressing flour which can go into a
mixer<00:02:45.330> along<00:02:45.660> with<00:02:45.930> cold<00:02:46.890> diced<00:02:47.519> butter<00:02:48.030> you

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
mixer along with cold diced butter you

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.449 
mixer along with cold diced butter you
need<00:02:48.810> precise<00:02:49.470> weights<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.980> measurements<00:02:50.250> in

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
need precise weights and measurements in

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.830 
need precise weights and measurements in
this<00:02:50.580> bit<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:51.480> comes<00:02:51.660> together

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
this bit so that it comes together

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.869 
this bit so that it comes together
properly<00:02:52.200> same<00:02:53.040> as<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.250> wouldn't<00:02:53.459> fall<00:02:53.700> with

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
properly same as you wouldn't fall with

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:54.770 
properly same as you wouldn't fall with
you're<00:02:54.030> just<00:02:54.180> rubbing<00:02:54.330> together<00:02:54.540> your

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
you're just rubbing together your

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.330 
you're just rubbing together your
fingertips<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.349> crumble<00:02:55.769> we<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.160> do<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
fingertips for a crumble we can do the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.910 
fingertips for a crumble we can do the
same<00:02:56.549> in<00:02:56.879> here<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.440> cobbler<00:02:58.799> is

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
same in here so the cobbler is

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.250 
same in here so the cobbler is
essentially<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.640> crispy<00:03:00.120> topping<00:03:00.420> yeah

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
essentially the crispy topping yeah

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.530 
essentially the crispy topping yeah
there's<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.500> cross<00:03:01.709> between<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.340> dumpling<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.180> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
there's a cross between a dumpling and a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.050 
there's a cross between a dumpling and a
crumble<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.620> pie<00:03:05.040> crust<00:03:05.099> kind<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.849> all<00:03:05.940> in

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
crumble and the pie crust kind of all in

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.960 
crumble and the pie crust kind of all in
one<00:03:06.090> right<00:03:06.720> sounds<00:03:07.349> very<00:03:07.440> nice<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:11.760> let's

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
one right sounds very nice so let's

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.080 
one right sounds very nice so let's
slowly<00:03:12.239> slowly<00:03:15.799> pass<00:03:16.799> right<00:03:17.610> around<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.000> my

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090

of this I just kind of dotted on top
really<00:04:36.390> quite<00:04:36.630> rusty<00:04:36.990> but<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.140> want<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.320> cover

really quite rusty but you want to cover
most<00:04:37.740> of<00:04:37.980> it<00:04:38.070> because<00:04:38.490> it's<00:04:38.640> self<00:04:38.880> raising

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
most of it because it's self raising

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.240 
most of it because it's self raising
flour<00:04:39.270> when<00:04:39.750> it<00:04:39.840> goes<00:04:39.960> in<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.170> oven<00:04:40.290> it<00:04:41.040> will
