00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.109
 with victory, Sergey, tell me when in the morning 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.400
 I learned that you will start the game in the first link 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:15.980
 what emotions did I experience yesterday 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.859
 training but I played there 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.570
 simple ended before the game in the hall that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.080
 when the last period ends 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.949
 I managed to score well 3 goals 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.660
 the team won no more joy 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.369
 say it is clear what is needed now 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.989
 defeating any opponent legs harder 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.090
 tune into commands like 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.090
 Novokuznetsk because in the last place 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.739
 in the table , after all, it is hard to understand 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.530
 any opponent everyone understands that 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.090
 but for some reason everything always goes wrong 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.710
 smooth as planned I could again 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.140
 i 'm saying you're beautiful there already 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.210
 stories forget everything and great 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.550
 two goals scored today tell us about 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.010
 the second one, what did sergey do there ? 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.470
 what he did there I now I myself do not 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.390
 expected words done 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.460
 so but it turned out that since itâ€™s not 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.300
 ran there there she bounced empty 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.150
 gates clogged great say was 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.659
 very good departure from two home games 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.159
 6 points as if they took what has changed in 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.930
 team game what has changed in the team 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.580
 that finally with a good chest came 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:32.000
 result came points answered a lot this 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:36.020
 the question is one with which is big together 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.820
 the more naturally the stronger the result 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.860
 better say when 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.020
 scored 2 step in the third period wanted 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.369
 make your hits Pavel wanted to say 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.690
 it was not a career that tepre 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.030
 wanted but 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.860
 first there are team interests 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.640
 the child is terrible to stroke and 0 to the end 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.420
 Played a match is convenient and the lace from the tower 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.700
 helped a little bit Andrei Fomin noted 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.180
 in return for telling us a little secret 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.220
 What will the team do? 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:12.640
 break here in this example ovation 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.650
 who will you be the training commander I even 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.860
 I don't know, but I think that the bunker 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.090
 work with us still in games before new 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.090
 year he must win
