00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
just like a shiny beige yeah it's a

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.650 
just like a shiny beige yeah it's a
really<00:02:14.890> beautiful<00:02:15.099> metallic<00:02:15.610> base<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:16.390> up

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
really beautiful metallic base just up

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.479 
really beautiful metallic base just up
just<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.140> give<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.319> little<00:02:17.380> bit<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:17.950> contour<00:02:18.459> to

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
just to give a little bit of contour to

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.100 
just to give a little bit of contour to
the<00:02:18.610> eye<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.060> very<00:02:19.269> very<00:02:19.480> subtle<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:19.989> has

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
the eye it's very very subtle but it has

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.839 
the eye it's very very subtle but it has
a<00:02:20.140> nice<00:02:20.319> impact<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.950> bring<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.190> ISO<00:02:21.370> as<00:02:21.640> well

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
a nice impact to bring the ISO as well

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.820 
a nice impact to bring the ISO as well
so<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> cheeks<00:02:22.900> aren't<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.230> only<00:02:23.410> thing

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830
