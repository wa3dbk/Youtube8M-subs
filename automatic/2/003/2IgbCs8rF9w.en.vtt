00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.670 
acquainted with this now the reason I
bring<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.740> up<00:00:52.950> is<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:53.520> gel<00:00:54.300> blush<00:00:54.680> cream

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.550 
than say a brush would a regular
traditional<00:02:05.130> blush<00:02:05.970> brush<00:02:06.330> would<00:02:06.780> speaking

I<00:02:14.110> think<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.770> because<00:02:15.250> blush<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.850> one<00:02:16.000> of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
I think that is because blush is one of

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.400 
I think that is because blush is one of
those<00:02:16.150> things<00:02:16.450> where<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.810> don't<00:02:16.930> want<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.230> to

now the reason I like this is it's

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.490 
now the reason I like this is it's
because<00:04:23.650> it's<00:04:23.980> very<00:04:24.310> very<00:04:24.580> soft<00:04:24.940> it's<00:04:25.930> tapered
