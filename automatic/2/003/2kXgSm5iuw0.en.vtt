17-under wat so it's gonna be about 850
watts<00:03:11.220> person<00:03:12.220> yeah<00:03:12.730> 850<00:03:13.480> watts<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.650> each<00:03:14.830> one

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
watts person yeah 850 watts to each one

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.060 
watts person yeah 850 watts to each one
and<00:03:15.430> it's<00:03:16.090> 600<00:03:16.690> RMS<00:03:17.080> when<00:03:17.320> we<00:03:17.470> pushing<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:17.980> a
