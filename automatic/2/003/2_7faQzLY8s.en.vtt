hitting the ball solidly and the first
thing<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:14.010> worked<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.820> my<00:01:14.880> one

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
thing I really worked on in my one

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.149 
thing I really worked on in my one
position<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:17.070> posture<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> lot

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
position was posture and I think a lot

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.800 
position was posture and I think a lot
of<00:01:20.189> us<00:01:20.400> take<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.880> granted<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
of us take it for granted I have a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.870 
of us take it for granted I have a
tendency<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.530> real<00:01:22.740> life<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
tendency in real life to kind of have a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.240 
tendency in real life to kind of have a
little<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.570> round<00:01:24.869> shoulder<00:01:25.320> posture<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
little bit round shoulder posture and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.030 
little bit round shoulder posture and
what<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.119> found<00:01:27.509> was<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.290> was<00:01:28.650> hitting<00:01:28.950> the
