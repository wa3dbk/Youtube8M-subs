 cheap and beautiful quicktipp 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.369
 for your home in autumn, so to speak 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.350
 winter is the time of coziness 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.939
 factor even more important than in 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.430
 spring or summer and I think so 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.470
 also important knows meanwhile also the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.939

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.390
 not possible knows that the majority 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.950
 to my audience 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.600
 with autumn and winter as well 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.510
 looks like me and we all want that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.610

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.949
 Anyway, I want you to choose that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.879
 is currently a miracle beautiful 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.420
 and auspicious and a bit of the target 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.400
 forth in another table side table 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.740
 dessert whatever you whatsoever out of this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.280
 wants to make table and that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.400
 at woolworth world or google 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.770
 I have looked again where it 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.540
 because the layers are everywhere in 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.520
 germany not that it just stops him 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.979
 in southern Germany only in northern Germany 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.420
 There is no real money distributed and fair 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.979
 I think if you google that 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.890
 if you do not know the days yet 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.130
 should then be against determined also in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.299
 Finding Your Neighborhood It's about a table 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.130
 as I said and that are the feet 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.689
 so to speak and that's a bit 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.460
 breathed oriental and then comes 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.460
 just that on top of it 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.509

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:58.530

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.990

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.720

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.120
