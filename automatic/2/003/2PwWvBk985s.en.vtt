00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.129
Home

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.870
is a place to relax

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.559
but the thought of our duties

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.050
often steals us from our family

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.949
Pimpy is a home automation server that without

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.419
any need for installation will relieve you from many of your day-to-day tasks

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.220
Pimpy can pamper you

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.530
by waking you up with the aroma of fresh coffee

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.140
and your favourite temperature in every room of your house.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.449
Pimpy can operate any of your remotely controlled devices

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.550
as well as the latest wi-fi ones

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.780
By plugging your oven into a smart socket

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.250
you can have Pimpy roast chicken for your dinner

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.790
Its motion detectors, along with its GPS connection with your phone

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.490
allow Pimpy to know when nobody is home

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.210
You don’t need to keep

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.880
everything in mind, leave it to Pimpy

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.409
It turns off any device that’s not being used

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.950
to respect the environment and to make you save money on your bills

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.640
Pimpy can check the weather forecast

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.750
to know when to water your plants

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.370
so your garden grows more beautiful while you avoid wasting water

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.220
Its user friendly Homy Automation interface

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.130
allows you to control your home with few clicks

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.460
An antitheft system makes your home safe, but Pimpy makes it easy for you to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.530
manage eventual false-alarms

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.610
It was only the neighbours’ cat!

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.100
By connecting Pimpy

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.800
with a smart lock, you won’t have to worry about forgetting

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:17.960
your keys again

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.710
The Homy Automation app has different functions

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.710
to suit the needs of the whole family.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.050
With Pimpy your children won’t miss their favourite TV programs

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.410
Forgetting a roast in the oven is not a problem

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:45.420
as Pimpy reminds you and turns it off for you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.790
It is cheaper

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.240
to run your appliances during the night, let Pimpy start your washing machine

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.290
and dishwasher in sequence

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.290
Enjoy you home,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.520
there’s Pimpy

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.980
Pimpy is easy to use and its interface was designed to be

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.150
user-friendly.
You can use it as a magic wand

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.380
to command on your house, but you can also rely on its

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.069
setting tips.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.420
Pimpy is meant to be the heart of your home automation,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.700
this is why I carefully chose a unique and effective design

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.879
that harmonizes with any furnishing style.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.120
In its plastic version, Pimpy comes in four colours

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.260
plus a clear one for real tech geeks.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.069
We also thought of a handcrafted ceramic  model

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.200
for a more classic and timeless choice.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.569
Pimpy is a revolutionary product in home automation

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.849
it doesn’t need installation and can be employed in your home

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.640
just as it is, without any need to change your appliances and electric

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.829
wiring.

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.900
Pimpy can be interfaced with your old devices with a remote control

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.690
and with any Wi-Fi, ZigBee and Home Kit tool.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.390
There are countless programming possibilities.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.010
This is our project

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.660
Help us make our dream come true

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.480
Thank you
