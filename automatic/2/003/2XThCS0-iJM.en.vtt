make her new project as success number

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.730 
make her new project as success number
one<00:00:17.279> use<00:00:17.970> loosely<00:00:18.359> fitted<00:00:18.750> silhouettes<00:00:19.199> what

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
should stick with loosely fitted

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.460 
should stick with loosely fitted
silhouettes<00:00:24.570> because<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.019> fabric<00:00:25.380> is

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
silhouettes because the fabric is

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.439 
silhouettes because the fabric is

she<00:00:30.750> should<00:00:30.929> also<00:00:31.080> think<00:00:31.320> about<00:00:31.470> stress

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
she should also think about stress

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.040 
she should also think about stress
points<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.430> try<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> minimize<00:00:33.090> those<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:33.780> find

fabrics don't do well in stressful

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.280 
fabrics don't do well in stressful
situations<00:00:38.540> number<00:00:39.540> two<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
situations number two it's not the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.889 
situations number two it's not the
easiest<00:00:40.620> fabric<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> work<00:00:41.219> with<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.719> one

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
easiest fabric to work with now this one

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.340 
easiest fabric to work with now this one
isn't<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.770> tip<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.390> she<00:00:45.930> should<00:00:46.140> still

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
isn't really a tip but she should still

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.520 
isn't really a tip but she should still
watch<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:48.020> she<00:00:49.020> should<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.350> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
watch out for this she should know that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.170 
watch out for this she should know that
because<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.160> an<00:00:50.309> easy<00:00:50.520> fabric<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.149> work

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
because it's not an easy fabric to work

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.819 
because it's not an easy fabric to work
with<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.020> move<00:00:52.110> around<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.620> her

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
with it's going to move around on her

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.060 
with it's going to move around on her
and<00:00:53.070> require<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.899> bit<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.260> working

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and require a little bit of working

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.270 
and require a little bit of working
before<00:00:56.760> she<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.449> actually<00:00:57.690> use<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.800> well<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
before she can actually use it well and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.270 
before she can actually use it well and
it<00:00:59.879> also<00:01:00.090> phrase<00:01:00.570> easily<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.649> Robin<00:01:01.980> really

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it also phrase easily so Robin really

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.799 
it also phrase easily so Robin really
wants<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> make<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.879> garment<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:03.629> can
