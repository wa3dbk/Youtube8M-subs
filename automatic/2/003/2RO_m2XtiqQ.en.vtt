00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.320
 and now I have to accommodate taking 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.230
 or the one that is also once again this 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.539
 channel that is called a nightly reader and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.400
 today is Thursday free and he has it 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.770
 like to tell you in this game is free 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
 is what I think every reader and that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.750
 everything move they have to bring in their 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.400
 backpack so I brought them my backpack and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.160
 I'm going to tell you what I think is 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.279
 necessary to start earlier than before 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.519
 that being ships we are readers and 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.480
 as a good reader or as a need for 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.629
 some people 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.070
 the glasses is the first thing we do 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.750
 people that we have problems the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.340
 view the lenses are essential second 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.399
 a book has to see a book like 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.870
 this plan for here of 1,005 debt of 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.489
 spirit that the publisher sent me 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.469
 alfaguara thank you very much editorial 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.629
 alfaguara a book always has to 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.219
 being in our backpack always has 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.890
 to be a book and obviously when 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.170
 one is reading there are certain phrases or 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.289
 parts of the book that you like so 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.720
 a post-its package equipped with 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:12.240
 many types of post-it always have 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.740
 that being on hand the post-it is 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.810
 important now 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.720
 there are some people who are not 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.970
 like to put pieces of paper so the most 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.700
 recommended for those people is a 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.600
 notebook and a pencil to write on the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.640
 notepad the sentences and then a book that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.250
 do not mistreat yourself with pieces of paper now 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.950
 there are also many more people 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.350
 risky people who like to underline the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.840
 books so a brand texts for the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.990
 phrase that you like also has to 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.270
 always be always available there 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.229
 Now this part is very essential as 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.000
 reader always in life wipes no 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.940
 you know when you're going to cry or when 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.509
 you're going to need a wipe for 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.610
 tears of suffering so too 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.950
 Always the necessary 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.780
 wipes now already in the look a bit 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.270
 more than book your but obviously the camera 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.220
 you always have to bring the camera but 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.289
 we're going to do everything like 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.730
 I live 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.939
 to the camera you always have to be 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.890
 present clear the camera charger 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.049
 because I mean the cameras do not last 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.760
 charged for a lifetime now what 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.280
 next I consider it important 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.590
 because sometimes when one record is 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.670
 dry the mouth where he is reading gives 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.590
 thirst so water always bring water in 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.109
 your reader backpack always bring 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.599
 water the following extras but I what 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.980
 I consider also very important is a 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.959
 orange because you're going to get hungry 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.120
 a certain point so an orange always 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.760
 it's important although sometimes only the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.269
 Orange is not enough, so Chile 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.919
 chili for delicious orange and if you 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.709
 You are one of those people who can not 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:56.250
 peel an orange obviously you have to 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.609
 bring a knife knife party chile 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.319
 delicious miami orange now for 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.930
 last and I think it's also very 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.270
 important that ace double vote or be read 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.410
 reader 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.310
 your purse 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.700
 you finish from lion book there is a sequel 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.900
 more and the purchases that you broke the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.520
 low camera if shopping does not matter 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.400
 how are you going to do it no matter who 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.040
 you are going to sell your soul you always have to 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.890
 bring your wallet to buy things that 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.720
 it is indispensable and as an extra a 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.610
 gift of me to you that I 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.880
 I use and I want to share it with 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.760
 you obviously have to be a killer 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.610
 insects like esther right close to that 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.910
 giant because sometimes he's just reading 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.560
 and a person approaches him 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.440
 ready what you're recording and someone is 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.600
 approached is interrupted ready or that 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.380
 you just saw it and it fell badly and 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.780
 ready you take away from many troubles does not leave 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.750
 marks does not leave traces is very natural 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.120
 I almost recommend this garden 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.460
 will help them as they do not have a 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.930
 click idea so that's all that is 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.880
 everything I charge the same chile 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.830
 reader and I think it's important that 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.720
 people consider it because 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.560
 they always go always and you have to be 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.420
 prepared 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.220
 although nothing else we go out to the park 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.620
 let's go to record something you have to be 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.480
 prepared with all the necessary equipment and 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.250
 I think that's what all the 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.230
 doctors we should have in our 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.210
 backpacks if you can think of something else 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.639
 it is a life and response to this 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.169
 comment below what you want you know 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.360
 I hope you have a very good 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.360
 week and it makes very very good book 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.120
 this is a joke or that they do not take it as 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.950
 literal is like a funny video for 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.139
