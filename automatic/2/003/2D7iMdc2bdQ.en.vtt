00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
you're not going to get better that's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.660 
you're not going to get better that's
the<00:01:46.500> fact<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.830> mean<00:01:46.950> there's<00:01:47.100> nothing<00:01:47.250> better

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the fact I mean there's nothing better

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.760 
the fact I mean there's nothing better
than<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.179> there<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.630> competing<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.710> a

venue for learning life lessons that guy

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.550 
venue for learning life lessons that guy
that's<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.440> high<00:02:17.130> profile<00:02:17.730> high<00:02:18.260> draft<00:02:19.260> guy

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
we anybody can pick that guy out on the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.770 
we anybody can pick that guy out on the
field<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.760> guy<00:02:23.910> that's<00:02:24.209> maybe<00:02:24.510> not

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
field it's it's the guy that's maybe not

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.440 
field it's it's the guy that's maybe not
quite<00:02:25.320> hit<00:02:25.829> that<00:02:26.040> level<00:02:26.430> yet<00:02:26.640> maybe<00:02:27.000> hasn't

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
quite hit that level yet maybe hasn't

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.979 
quite hit that level yet maybe hasn't
reached<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.840> level<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:29.190> maturity<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.840> we

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
reached that level of maturity and so we

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.470 
reached that level of maturity and so we
try<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.230> go<00:02:31.440> out<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.860> project<00:02:32.340> not<00:02:33.090> only<00:02:33.120> where

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
try to go out and project not only where

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.720

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
where he's going to be when he's 19 20

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.430 
where he's going to be when he's 19 20
21<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:39.150> know<00:02:39.239> there<00:02:39.390> are<00:02:39.480> five<00:02:39.720> tools<00:02:40.110> that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
21 you know there are five tools that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.440 
21 you know there are five tools that
that<00:02:40.709> baseball<00:02:41.190> coaches<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.880> professional

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
that baseball coaches and professional

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.330 
that baseball coaches and professional
Scouts<00:02:42.690> look<00:02:42.900> for<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.230> ability<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.650> hit<00:02:43.859> hit

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
Scouts look for the ability to hit hit

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.099 
Scouts look for the ability to hit hit
with<00:02:44.489> power<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.480> run<00:02:45.720> throw<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.709> field<00:02:48.109> they

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
with power to run throw and field they

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.259 
with power to run throw and field they
look<00:02:49.380> at<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.769> pro<00:02:50.430> scouts<00:02:50.730> look<00:02:51.000> at<00:02:51.120> that

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
look at that pro scouts look at that

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.809 
look at that pro scouts look at that
purely<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.959> those<00:02:52.470> five<00:02:52.769> things<00:02:53.069> it's<00:02:53.580> it's

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
purely on those five things it's it's

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.610 
purely on those five things it's it's
it's<00:02:54.150> pretty<00:02:54.390> cut-and-dry<00:02:55.080> for<00:02:55.349> them

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
it's pretty cut-and-dry for them

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.080 
it's pretty cut-and-dry for them
I<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:55.950> college<00:02:56.280> coaches<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:56.849> to<00:02:56.940> go

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
I think college coaches have to go

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.010 
I think college coaches have to go
beyond<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.599> they<00:02:57.840> have

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
beyond that they have

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.490 
beyond that they have
to<00:02:58.080> have<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.380> academic<00:02:58.980> aspect<00:02:59.790> to<00:03:00.270> be<00:03:00.450> a

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
to have the academic aspect to be a

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.780 
to have the academic aspect to be a
factor<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:02.040> think<00:03:02.340> personally<00:03:02.760> that

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
factor and I think personally that

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.820 
factor and I think personally that
there's<00:03:03.180> another<00:03:03.450> factor<00:03:03.990> that's<00:03:04.110> equally<00:03:04.680> as

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
there's another factor that's equally as

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.730 
there's another factor that's equally as
important<00:03:05.370> as<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.810> five<00:03:07.050> tools<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.650> that

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
important as the the five tools and that

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.130 
important as the the five tools and that
is<00:03:07.860> what<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> guy<00:03:08.250> hasn't<00:03:08.490> in<00:03:08.850> here<00:03:09.210> and<00:03:09.360> up<00:03:09.780> here

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
is what a guy hasn't in here and up here

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.500 
is what a guy hasn't in here and up here
