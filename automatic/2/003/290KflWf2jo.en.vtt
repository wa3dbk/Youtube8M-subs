posted somewhere around this video but
let<00:01:26.970> me<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.299> i<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.509> get<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:30.439> make<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
let me see if i can get this to make the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
let me see if i can get this to make the
sound<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.100> kind<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.729> kind<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.150> cool<00:01:33.390> like

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
sound it kind of it's kind of cool like

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.319 
sound it kind of it's kind of cool like
you<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.140> dry<00:01:34.560> ice<00:01:34.590> contracts<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.970> metal

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
you just the dry ice contracts the metal

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.010 
you just the dry ice contracts the metal
and<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.439> forces<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> go<00:01:38.780> back<00:01:39.780> into

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and so it just forces it to go back into

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.160 
and so it just forces it to go back into
its<00:01:40.619> form<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:41.189> these<00:01:41.340> edges<00:01:41.880> they<00:01:42.810> keep

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
its form because these edges they keep

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.710 
its form because these edges they keep
how<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.220> already<00:01:44.460> been<00:01:44.579> molded<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.450> metal

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
how it's already been molded the metal

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.440 
how it's already been molded the metal
wants<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.140> go<00:01:46.259> back<00:01:46.439> into<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.860> shape

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
wants to go back into that shape

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.850 
wants to go back into that shape

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.789 
like that big you know from like all
this<00:03:42.709> space<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.370> now<00:03:44.180> it's<00:03:44.449> I<00:03:44.780> mean<00:03:45.439> I<00:03:45.500> can

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
this space and now it's I mean I can

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.830 
this space and now it's I mean I can
still<00:03:46.010> sort<00:03:46.219> of<00:03:46.310> see<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.579> little<00:03:47.030> bit<00:03:47.180> but<00:03:47.599> on

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
still sort of see a little bit but on

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.959 
still sort of see a little bit but on
this<00:03:48.049> edge<00:03:48.260> just<00:03:48.590> because<00:03:48.859> that's<00:03:49.129> strong

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:49.969 
this edge just because that's strong

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.439 
this edge just because that's strong
point<00:03:50.299> of<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:51.129> shape<00:03:52.129> of<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.400> metal<00:03:52.669> and<00:03:52.879> it's

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
point of the shape of the metal and it's

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.059 
point of the shape of the metal and it's
kind<00:03:53.989> of<00:03:54.019> hard<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.290> have<00:03:54.409> to<00:03:54.469> use<00:03:54.650> some<00:03:54.799> tools<00:03:54.980> to
