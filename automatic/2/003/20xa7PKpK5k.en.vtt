airplane is floor it looks like why
remember<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> little<00:00:56.430> bitty<00:00:56.820> five<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.420> looked

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
remember the little bitty five it looked

remember the little bitty five it looked
like<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.410> fast<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.309> such

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
like is really going fast but it's such

like is really going fast but it's such
a<00:00:59.579> small<00:00:59.730> airplane<00:01:00.300> honesty<00:01:01.260> tell<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.980> it's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
a small airplane honesty tell you it's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.460 
a small airplane honesty tell you it's
going<00:01:02.309> faster<00:01:02.850> I'm<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:04.110> looking<00:01:04.439> forward

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
going faster I'm really looking forward

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.250 
going faster I'm really looking forward
to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> arrival<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> Airbus<00:01:06.240> 380<00:01:06.750> because

to the arrival of the Airbus 380 because

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.620 
to the arrival of the Airbus 380 because
we'll<00:01:07.470> probably<00:01:07.500> look<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.939> fine<00:01:09.180> very

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
we'll probably look like it's fine very

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.160 
we'll probably look like it's fine very

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
clear up to 55,000 feet so up there i'll

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.590 
clear up to 55,000 feet so up there i'll
be<00:01:16.950> doing<00:01:17.130> about<00:01:17.729> point2<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:19.159> Mach<00:01:20.159> number<00:01:20.600> but

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
be doing about point2 to Mach number but

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.010 
be doing about point2 to Mach number but
here<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.790> south<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> north

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
