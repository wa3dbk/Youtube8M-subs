00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.900
 pool and fast then today we 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.309
 will make the puff surprise 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.940
 recipe is obviously very low if there 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.799
 it's gone 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.170
 so for the recipe we will have to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.930
 four chocolate bars one egg is 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.220
 a puff pastry 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.230
 I just unrolled so my dough 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.910
 puffed there at the bars 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.470
 chocolate you really take what 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.890
 you have to go through the cupboards 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.960
 so here I took jupiter then 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.650
 it looks like a little bit of 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.110
 Kinder Bueno 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.730
 I place the chocolate bar so on the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.410
 puff pastry 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:45.050
 then I come to beat my work 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:48.149
 to have offered the gilding with the brush 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:56.579
 so I will lightly basting on 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:01:07.260
 the outline and then I fold so my 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:07.760
 puff pastry I press here so with 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.760
 my finger 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 I press 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.820
 and I close my chocolate bar 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.009
 with the knife I come so cut off 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.810
 and I place it directly on my plate 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.280
 Cooking 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.370
 Come on we made a knife home 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.080
 game in the east what then exceeds the 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.360
 sludge that goes beyond we'll be able to everything 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.270
 time to rework and train 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:12.600
 rectangles to imprison so our 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:20.310
 jupiter I put gilding and then 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:28.800
 I recur with the finger I press 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:33.380
 to solder the edges and that knife I 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.380
 cut the sides 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.180
 so now we're going to basting them 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.180
 So gilding years 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.410
 you can put a tablespoon 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.200
 of milk and an egg yolk to make 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.069
 your gilding can also put 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.660
 so a whole egg 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.660
 that's up to you to see 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.739
 then I'm not deceiving my fork 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.940
 in the flour and I will come so 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.940
 make small decorations 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.750
 and here I am going to make small holes 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.750
 to let moisture escape 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.709
 then the oven is in the process of 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.299
 so preheat to 180 Â° and I'll go 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.879
 put in the oven until it turns 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.170
 as it certainly takes between 15 and 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.370
 20 minutes so it's always at 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.920
 watch our flicker surprise without 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.060
 cooked and cooled then I show you that 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.060
 closely I want to show this one is 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.739
 well beautiful well shiny well cooked and I 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.739
 immediately went to the tasting 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.919
 puff pastry become sugars 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.229
 and a little bit the chocolate bar 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.940
 we have crunchy it's really 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.870
 super good this recipe it's worth 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.639
 absolutely attested I hope that the 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.320
 video you liked I also hope you 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.910

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.560
 to make this recipe 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.360

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.949
 little green thumb and I tell you to very 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.000
