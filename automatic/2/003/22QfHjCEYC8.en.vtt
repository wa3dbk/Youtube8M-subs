00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:42.819 
difference between the nailin tips and

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.899 
difference between the nailin tips and
the<00:06:42.879> ones<00:06:43.089> that<00:06:43.269> I<00:06:43.389> bought<00:06:43.889> here<00:06:44.889> is<00:06:45.099> an<00:06:45.549> ailing

clear tip and you see it's got a little
bit<00:06:49.959> more<00:06:50.259> of<00:06:50.559> a<00:06:50.769> plastic<00:06:51.099> right<00:06:51.999> down<00:06:52.209> here

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 
bit more of a plastic right down here

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.409 
bit more of a plastic right down here
and<00:06:52.839> it's<00:06:52.959> not<00:06:53.199> you<00:06:54.189> see<00:06:54.369> the<00:06:54.489> Halfmoon<00:06:54.699> it

00:06:58.709 --> 00:06:58.719 
extends beyond that so that is the

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:03.419 
extends beyond that so that is the
nailin<00:06:59.289> tip<00:06:59.799> and<00:07:00.659> these<00:07:01.659> are<00:07:01.929> the<00:07:02.079> ones<00:07:02.319> that<00:07:02.769> I

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:03.429
