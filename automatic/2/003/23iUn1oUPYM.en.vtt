00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.330
 Yes Hello Note's right here, which was the last time you introduce 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.760
 It's a polaroid cube video camera 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.720
 what 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:19.870
 But it is what it is a video camera by the video camera 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:23.370
 We talk you to Fu that want to take an on-board video put on the right back to sleep this 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:27.750
 It does put in snakeskin any mini back 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.240
 I 've made it for a while, and I 've got a magnet on it too 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.500
 Oh dear 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.120
 That I'm not get put out this Well then I kinda jerky I'm stick is made 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.760
 I dedicated by 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.290
 In the wind to make a mini 4WD 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.390
 In eh 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.170
 I also thought about what kind of flower I was actually making while making this 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.090
 but 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.780
 There are so many things I have to do if I think about it 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:59.260
 This is in making another by say and can not video 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.670
 Well, actually it took me a week to make it by trial and error, but it came 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.570
 Person 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.000
 It feels like this 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 I point point I would like to take a look while watching, but little I whole picture 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.560
 But 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.520
 I think Na magnet skiing think first I ne direct halo and is a platform to put here the camera first 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.390
 But 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.210
 I have a feeling that it seems to be able to be loaded a little bit on a tripod mount, so here 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.820
 Let's go to 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.820
 It is to say that Kawano 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.890
 Or Buber Shi'itsu 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.620
 I mean if you mean it- I've already tried it It's okay 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:59.190
 Well, I'm also putting out tripod 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.340
 Is also easy to break away to drink it is to say 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:07.200
 Tteka or pretty cheap cat of camera era 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.680
 40,000 yen like a high professional like using with care, I can not put such a little bit 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.500
 But 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:18.190
 The it This was Once you still give up even broken if it later has to this by say Innovation Tsukare 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.420
 It is good and I want to suppress the vibration as much as possible 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.930
 There are some points in that, but two large 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.190
 There are only two points in Gacha. There are two points. 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.580
 First I hit it hollow rubber tires here have already seen 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:38.180
 What to say when wearing hollow bomb tires 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.180
 After the front roller This is a key with rubber ring 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.680
 We have aluminum bill bearing roller 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:49.680
 I the Toka sheet of ne a place wearing to 10,000 steps under after cat Rubber 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.280
 It is by sandwiching a breath in order to coffee vibration on whether the ass Pashu 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:59.010
 Behind we are doing various apart from especially 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:02.939
 It's not like I usually put a stay and black for the demand for aluminum with pros of 19 people 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.460
 It is also in fairly easy Mochoi just wearing Luo 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.700
 There is no brake 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:12.450
 To in 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:17.610
 Motor motor has to normal Kedomo Well I'm here is important 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:22.290
 The gear ratio is the 4th first, so it's close to securities 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.680
 We are supposed to say to the corresponding of that hollow phrase 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.370
 Speed at all Zenesu 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.970
 I bought early 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.290
 Shi there is also a risk that Chow in futon wonder if rest is not ginger even when the image you do not know it too early 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.930
 I thought so 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.110
 a 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.410
 5 selected by normal 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.750
 Not because bad when it stops 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:48.020
 Mr. Kia has made that ratio higher to avoid stopping because it is heavy. 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.530
 The above is the point of this machine 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.810
 In that 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:59.130
 It hey may not ne this 3 plants or Meda lot prove to be movement me a little I thin 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.990
 Yeah an image of a single-lens reflex Nde hard to understand 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.990
 I would like to see for a moment 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:12.740
 It is a scene here because it is yes 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:16.450
 Say you when and where you're carrying a camera 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.450
 It is such a feeling wonder if seen in this about 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.030
 Here 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:28.240
 I of the nearest tire of ma chassis 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.440
 It's a long- handed screw from the bottom to the listener's place where the screw hole is called 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.070
 It is on the top 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.650
 I body to here 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.409
 I 'm out on the back 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.270
 so 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.990
 a 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:44.160
 Multi-rear setting of this color stay home 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.960
 It is hard to understand 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.319
 This one more frp is included This is 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.800
 It is attached to the ball link mass damper 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.910
 It is frb 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:01.650
 Setting of this 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.650
 There in the form that has to stop this mount in at-inch screws 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.839
 Yes 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.610
 I put a sheet to go to sleep for a while 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.610
 Kana view Urakkawa 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.480
 Let's go back 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.430
 Such a form 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.110
 Especially what a stranger mon 5 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.560
 It is said that it is put out to the front through here 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.560
 It means 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.400
 Vehicle height is quite low 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.400
 It is quite low 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:51.650
 I like the tire after Nakaku personally, but it is not quick if I use it as it is 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.650
 I want to use it seriously next time 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:06:00.780
 What will happen 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.780
 The above is the whole view of the camera-equipped machine 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:08.240
 Yes I mean, as I saw, I'm making mostly of the back part 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.750
 Well 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.360
 The image that is actually running 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.360
 I would like to see you immediately 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.810

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.689
 Four days

 traffic 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.719
 Oh 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.090
 Putsu 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.409
 Making 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.810
 wh 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.840
 Shooting 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.840
 Huh 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.760
 Bach 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.580
 Four days 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.580
 tan 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.580
 par 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.110
 eh 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.000
 What 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.430
 Hmm 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.200
 Hmm 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:08.680
 [musics] 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:14.920
 Yes, we made this one would have been how 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:22.610
 This machine was a short effort because I just ran in my own house this time . 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:25.639
 There is a scene of the course using the photograph of the key configuration cat in the various shops now 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.890
 I think I want to let you 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:48.720
 See you again
