to<00:00:21.330> make<00:00:21.360> a<00:00:21.600> torch<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.380> know<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.160> they<00:00:23.340> you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
to make a torch you know so they you

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.790 
to make a torch you know so they you
know<00:00:23.850> got<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:24.270> some<00:00:24.540> pieces<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.990> paper<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
know got out some pieces of paper and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.860 
know got out some pieces of paper and
start<00:00:26.070> twisting<00:00:26.550> them<00:00:26.700> together<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.480> trying

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
start twisting them together and trying

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.390 
start twisting them together and trying
to<00:00:27.960> figure<00:00:28.230> out<00:00:28.260> how<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.800> make<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.310> know

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
to figure out how I can make you know

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700 
to figure out how I can make you know
something<00:00:29.670> little<00:00:29.850> burn<00:00:30.120> well<00:00:30.870> enough<00:00:31.200> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
something little burn well enough and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.650 
something little burn well enough and
and<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.129> pretty<00:00:32.309> soon<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.820> became<00:00:33.149> painfully

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
and and pretty soon it became painfully

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.740 
and and pretty soon it became painfully

simple<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.550> medieval<00:00:50.970> torch<00:00:51.450> I<00:00:51.840> mean<00:00:52.680> it's

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
simple as a medieval torch I mean it's

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
simple as a medieval torch I mean it's
not<00:00:53.040> rocket<00:00:53.399> science<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.809> studied

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
not rocket science and they studied

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.400 
not rocket science and they studied
rocket<00:00:55.649> science<00:00:56.040> for<00:00:56.130> crying<00:00:56.520> out<00:00:56.670> loud

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
rocket science for crying out loud

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.720 
rocket science for crying out loud
anyway<00:00:59.120> that<00:01:00.120> episode<00:01:01.110> really<00:01:01.800> drove<00:01:02.160> home<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
anyway that episode really drove home to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.850 
anyway that episode really drove home to
me<00:01:03.739> how<00:01:04.739> tragic<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.180> some<00:01:07.080> people<00:01:07.110> are

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
me how tragic it is that some people are

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.000 
me how tragic it is that some people are
so<00:01:08.990> overprotected<00:01:09.990> growing<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.830> they

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
so overprotected growing up but they

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
so overprotected growing up but they
never<00:01:11.190> have<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> chance<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.909> learn<00:01:12.060> things<00:01:12.360> like

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
never have a chance to learn things like

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.440 
never have a chance to learn things like
this<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.799> needless<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.610> say<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.909> showed<00:01:15.210> them

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this so needless to say I showed them

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.360 
this so needless to say I showed them
how<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.930> make<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> torch<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> night<00:01:17.010> they<00:01:17.310> were

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
how to make a torch that night they were

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.940 
how to make a torch that night they were
ecstatic<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.510> today<00:01:18.810> I'm<00:01:19.440> gonna<00:01:19.680> give<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
ecstatic and and today I'm gonna give a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.880 
ecstatic and and today I'm gonna give a
simple<00:01:20.400> tutorial<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:21.240> torch<00:01:21.600> making<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
simple tutorial in torch making for the

have suffered the same fate of being

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.820 
have suffered the same fate of being
overprotective<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.190> kid<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.560> first

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
overprotective it's the kid so the first

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.580 
overprotective it's the kid so the first
thing<00:01:32.040> you'll<00:01:32.189> need<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:33.119> stick<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
thing you'll need is a stick just a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.770 
thing you'll need is a stick just a
piece<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.950> wood<00:01:35.100> metal<00:01:36.030> would<00:01:36.180> probably<00:01:36.630> work

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
piece of wood metal would probably work

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.210 
piece of wood metal would probably work
too<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.290> wanted<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> use<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.830> piece<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
too if you wanted to use like a piece of

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.350 
too if you wanted to use like a piece of
pipe<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.970> stick<00:01:39.720> works<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.229> fine<00:01:41.360> also

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
pipe but a stick works just fine also

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.870 
pipe but a stick works just fine also
need<00:01:42.540> an<00:01:42.810> old<00:01:43.049> rag<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.100> case<00:01:44.310> I'm<00:01:44.520> using<00:01:44.549> a

worn out pair of socks a worn out
t-shirt<00:01:47.939> would<00:01:48.150> probably<00:01:48.540> work<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.720> about

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
t-shirt would probably work just about

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
t-shirt would probably work just about
as<00:01:49.350> well<00:01:49.380> worn<00:01:50.040> out<00:01:50.130> dish<00:01:50.400> rag<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.420> any
