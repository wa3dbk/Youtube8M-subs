something different
easy<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.750> clamp<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.140> fairly<00:01:07.409> universal<00:01:08.040> also<00:01:08.729> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
easy to clamp on fairly universal also I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.789 
easy to clamp on fairly universal also I
really<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.869> mic<00:01:10.080> its<00:01:10.350> corded

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
really like to see this mic its corded

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.830 
really like to see this mic its corded
so<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.610> easy<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.150> move<00:01:12.270> around<00:01:12.540> but

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so it's really easy to move around but

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.570 
so it's really easy to move around but
if<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> three-quarter<00:01:13.950> helmet<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
if you have a three-quarter helmet you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.190 
if you have a three-quarter helmet you
can't<00:01:14.820> use<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> fully<00:01:15.390> quarter<00:01:15.720> mic<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
can't use a fully quarter mic so it's a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.289 
can't use a fully quarter mic so it's a
hybrid<00:01:16.380> corded<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.250> boom<00:01:17.490> that's<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.210> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
hybrid corded and boom that's going to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.940 
hybrid corded and boom that's going to
allow<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.960> coverage<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.409> need<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.740> won't

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
allow you the coverage you need it won't

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.170 
allow you the coverage you need it won't
flex<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:20.520> move<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.909> way<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.090> the

flex or move out of the way with the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.090 
flex or move out of the way with the
wind<00:01:21.360> also<00:01:21.600> noise<00:01:21.960> cancelling<00:01:22.560> foam<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.009> the

wind also noise cancelling foam on the

wind also noise cancelling foam on the
outside<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.970> really<00:01:24.210> good<00:01:24.299> sound<00:01:24.540> quality

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
outside it's a really good sound quality

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.380 
outside it's a really good sound quality
some<00:01:25.619> other<00:01:25.770> features<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
some other features that I like the
