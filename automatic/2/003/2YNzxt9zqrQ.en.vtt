00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.889
 who wants to do something digital do a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.830
 animation wedding anniversary party 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.119
 anyway you will need to download 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.160

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.980

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.390
 The download link is in the description and 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.880
 it is also necessary to separate your 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.850
 photos do you want to use to make a 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.860
 video to make a book on a page 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.350
 in a forgiveness folder 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.050
 So you're into a folder with all 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.000
 your photos you want them to have 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.090

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 made it come mexico environments 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.820

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:00.329
 a leaf for us 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.710
 click on Mexico here on this tab let you 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.500

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.840
 click here to add pef pf 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.030
 would then have where where my 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.970
 images I need to show folder that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.010
 are all my pictures 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.450
 so today I found a click here 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:23.310
 it has not been created a book yet 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.110
 so here comes a create country pages 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.360
 So you realize that he has already created 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.579
 various materials for us and these 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.390
 materials are already applied to mexico and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.170
 book 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.420
 every material of this c is ours 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.610
 page then if it starts the law of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.210
 left to right then page here 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.840
 123 4 and so on 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.869
 beauty done that we were still here in the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.700
 doctor and book in the raw create tab we have 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.920
 here the width and height I'm going to put 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.719
 the size about the size it is 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.270
 my picture because you realize it here 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:06.979
 that it is stretched and can not 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:10.430
 this happens I'm going to put 1,800 per 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.180
 1200 which is the size of my page 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.140
 right now 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.040
 years of water let's stop the animation here 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.040
 the animation we have fish that is then in 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.510
 0% your have been increasing you will 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.189
 notice that it will change page 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.230
 for us then it's very simple a lot 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.420
 simple and very useful to do 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.019
 various animations 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.889
 Come on let's cheer up so I'll do it. 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:45.099
 this animation with five seconds 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:48.579
 I just leave the needle on 10 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:52.720
 seconds press the control and click 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:56.859
 here in this circus takes needle to five 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.639
 seconds increase value to 100% and repeat the 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:09.189
 process against the click beauty then 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:13.629
 now we have our animation right you 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:17.379
 they perceive that they have 19 materials 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.870
 nine photos however each photo is one 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:24.250
 behind the other I do not want it to be 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.040
 just a photo face I do not want 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.349
 have different front and back photos 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.650
 so I'm going to click here mexico and book well 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:36.609
 the client point here so that the original 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:40.599
 I'm going to lay from then on you go 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.759
 realize that I'm going to go home and I go 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.419
 change to 9 because I have nine photos 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:48.879
 now right thominhas go pages 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:51.970
 increase here is a chaos would be so much of 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.639
 pages you want for your book 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.629
 now the images are only showing 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:00.280
 on the right side of the left here 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.949
 you will realize that all images 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.319
 you flag canada why why 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:08.549
 It's the first picture so I want it 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.889
 a solid color such as gray 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:16.079
 drag creates a new material 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:19.690
 drag to 1st 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.779
 so there you will be all left 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.010
 it will be gray then having my pictures 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:28.740
 just the right right 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.960
 there is still how you can modify a 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.710
 little else eg flip 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.700
 You realize that before you get there 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:42.330
 already raises another page 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:48.170
 so here you control the fip so flip 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.170
 will lippi at 0% 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.170
 another page hit the ground it goes 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.270
 pull another already if the man such flip him 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.460
 will not even let it go 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.710
 start pulling the other sheets then 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.290
 it will depend on your animation if you 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:10.010
 want a quick animation in one only increases 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:13.170
 Finally twist let the stronger text is 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.800
 this curvature he makes 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.930
 so you can choose a twist 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.980
 horrendous is it will vary the farmer goes 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.220
 leave a varied even crazy animation 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.220
 huh 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:39.900
 and we have the ruben flip left only the good 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.110
 flip is that crazy curvature right there 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:47.360
 so I always leave more or less in 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:50.880
 15 percent of normal 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.880
 according to yours with your taste 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:58.700
 Alright then, this is what I hope I have. 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.140
 helped you hope to be a useful tip 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.260
 against the avaÃ­ with the help of you in 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:08.480
 the video and you see yourself in a 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.480
 Next time, thanks guys more
