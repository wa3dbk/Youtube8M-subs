safety feature there's a little piece of
metal<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:36.970> this<00:03:37.360> will<00:03:37.720> stick<00:03:38.110> out<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.650> will

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
metal here this will stick out and will

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.920 
metal here this will stick out and will
not<00:03:38.980> let<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.370> put<00:03:39.580> it<00:03:39.700> into<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.940> receiver<00:03:40.330> if

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
not let you put it into the receiver if

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.620 
not let you put it into the receiver if
the<00:03:41.380> bolt<00:03:41.740> head<00:03:41.890> isn't<00:03:42.130> put<00:03:42.460> in<00:03:42.580> correctly<00:03:43.090> as

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
the bolt head isn't put in correctly as

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:52.890 
the bolt head isn't put in correctly as
soon<00:03:43.900> as<00:03:44.020> that's<00:03:44.170> flush<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:49.860> just<00:03:51.750> put<00:03:52.750> my

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
soon as that's flush I just put my

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.990 
soon as that's flush I just put my
action<00:03:53.440> in<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:54.460> then<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:54.700> throw<00:03:55.030> my<00:03:55.210> scope<00:03:55.480> on

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
action in and then I throw my scope on

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.310 
action in and then I throw my scope on
so<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.090> can<00:03:58.210> see<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.660> was<00:03:58.750> a<00:03:58.810> pretty<00:03:59.080> quick

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
so you can see that was a pretty quick

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.100 
so you can see that was a pretty quick
transition<00:03:59.980> going<00:04:00.610> from<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:01.420> 300<00:04:01.990> Win<00:04:02.050> Mag

again into a 22-250 nice and clean all I

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.430 
again into a 22-250 nice and clean all I
needed<00:04:06.400> was<00:04:06.580> one<00:04:06.700> hex<00:04:07.180> wrench<00:04:07.510> it's<00:04:08.020> super

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
needed was one hex wrench it's super

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.090 
needed was one hex wrench it's super
simple<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:09.640> few<00:04:10.630> features<00:04:10.990> about<00:04:11.350> this<00:04:11.590> rifle

simple a few features about this rifle

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.480 
simple a few features about this rifle
that<00:04:12.490> are<00:04:12.610> pretty<00:04:12.850> different<00:04:13.090> than<00:04:13.450> most

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
that are pretty different than most

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.460 
that are pretty different than most
bolt-action<00:04:15.490> rifles<00:04:15.850> out<00:04:15.970> there<00:04:16.239> is<00:04:16.470> number

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
bolt-action rifles out there is number

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.350 
bolt-action rifles out there is number
one<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.860> action<00:04:18.280> on<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:19.620> when<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:22.060> run

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
one the action on it when you to run

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360 
one the action on it when you to run
this<00:04:22.570> action<00:04:23.020> it's<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.320> straight<00:04:23.680> slide<00:04:23.950> so<00:04:24.250> the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
this action it's a straight slide so the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.190 
this action it's a straight slide so the
bolt<00:04:24.610> handle<00:04:24.820> will<00:04:25.120> rotate<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.870> slide<00:04:26.170> back

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
bolt handle will rotate and slide back

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.280 
bolt handle will rotate and slide back
and<00:04:26.830> then<00:04:27.190> go<00:04:27.370> forward<00:04:27.820> what<00:04:28.630> this<00:04:28.810> really

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
and then go forward what this really

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.080 
and then go forward what this really
helps<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.710> do<00:04:29.890> is<00:04:30.220> when<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.640> take<00:04:30.850> your

bolt action rifles another feature on

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.040 
bolt action rifles another feature on
this<00:04:47.980> is<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> cocking<00:04:48.760> mechanism<00:04:48.910> so<00:04:49.660> unlike

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
this is the cocking mechanism so unlike

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.500 
this is the cocking mechanism so unlike
a<00:04:50.080> traditional<00:04:50.320> safety<00:04:51.130> what<00:04:51.850> this<00:04:52.060> does<00:04:52.330> is

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
a traditional safety what this does is

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.750 
a traditional safety what this does is
actually<00:04:53.050> engages<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.830> firing<00:04:54.250> pin<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:54.640> it's

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
actually engages the firing pin so it's

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.760 
actually engages the firing pin so it's
ready<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.090> go<00:04:55.210> off<00:04:55.540> so<00:04:56.050> as<00:04:56.140> soon<00:04:56.290> as<00:04:56.380> you<00:04:56.530> cock

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
ready to go off so as soon as you cock

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.300 
ready to go off so as soon as you cock
that<00:04:57.010> forward<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.700> it<00:04:58.420> locks<00:04:59.010> ready<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.160> go

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
that forward and it locks ready to go

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.360 
that forward and it locks ready to go
when<00:05:00.880> you<00:05:00.910> this<00:05:01.450> charge<00:05:02.350> that<00:05:02.710> there's<00:05:03.040> no

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
when you this charge that there's no

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
pressure on the firing pin so you don't

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.379

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
have to worry about

don't discharge anything like that a lot

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.700 
don't discharge anything like that a lot
