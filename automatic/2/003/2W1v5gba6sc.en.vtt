but this has got the kind of thing that
I<00:00:16.379> wore<00:00:16.680> during<00:00:17.010> my<00:00:17.100> time<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.609> never<00:00:17.760> got

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
I wore during my time and I never got

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.340 
I wore during my time and I never got
told<00:00:18.180> off<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.690> hopefully<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.199> ain't

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
either and this is the lip right now so

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.849 
either and this is the lip right now so
hopefully<00:00:21.990> you're<00:00:22.080> thinking<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.619> doesn't

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
hopefully you're thinking but doesn't

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.200 
hopefully you're thinking but doesn't
look<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.100> you're<00:00:23.310> wearing<00:00:23.400> any<00:00:23.670> makeup<00:00:24.060> at

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
look like you're wearing any makeup at

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.609 
look like you're wearing any makeup at
all<00:00:24.359> that's<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> kind<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.199> thing<00:00:25.380> we're<00:00:25.500> going

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
all that's the kind of thing we're going

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.939 
all that's the kind of thing we're going
for<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.430> soon<00:00:27.090> you'll<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.869> before<00:00:28.230> moved

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
for but soon you'll see the before moved

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.769 
for but soon you'll see the before moved
with<00:00:29.130> no<00:00:29.279> makeup<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.119> think<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> much

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
with no makeup so I think this is a much

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.720 
with no makeup so I think this is a much
prettier<00:00:31.140> look<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.460> feel<00:00:32.700> like

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
prettier look and if you feel like

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.120 
prettier look and if you feel like
you're<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.600> bit<00:00:33.780> naked<00:00:34.050> without<00:00:34.410> makeup<00:00:34.860> school

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you're a bit naked without makeup school

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.770 
you're a bit naked without makeup school
and<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.120> something<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.630> try

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and this is something you can try

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.270 
and this is something you can try
obviously<00:00:37.440> I'm<00:00:37.530> not<00:00:37.620> saying<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.070> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
obviously I'm not saying you have to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.580 
obviously I'm not saying you have to
wear<00:00:38.399> makeup<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.790> school<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:39.210> all<00:00:39.410> they<00:00:40.410> feel

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
wear makeup to school at all they feel

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.290 
wear makeup to school at all they feel
like<00:00:40.710> me<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.160> didn't<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.520> regular<00:00:41.850> skin

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
like me and you didn't have regular skin

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180 
like me and you didn't have regular skin
then<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.290> something<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.770> use<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
then this is something you can use to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.330 
then this is something you can use to
kind<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.460> cover<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> little<00:00:45.300> bit<00:00:45.480> also

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
kind of cover that up a little bit also

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.410 
kind of cover that up a little bit also
if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.489> want<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.730> look<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.270> better

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
if you want to look a little bit better

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.700

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
now um so let's get started

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.490 
now um so let's get started
one<00:01:09.600> thing<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.900> gives<00:01:09.990> people<00:01:10.200> lots<00:01:10.409> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
one thing that gives people lots of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500 
one thing that gives people lots of
confidence<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.159> having<00:01:11.430> clear<00:01:11.640> skin<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.150> know

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
confidence is having clear skin I know

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.880 
confidence is having clear skin I know
that's<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:12.960> always<00:01:13.020> possible<00:01:13.320> when<00:01:13.740> you're<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that's not always possible when you're a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.740 
that's not always possible when you're a
teenager<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:14.610> school<00:01:14.909> because<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
teenager and at school because the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.929 
teenager and at school because the
hormones<00:01:16.110> do<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.470> kinds<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.830> crazy<00:01:17.100> stuff<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
hormones do all kinds of crazy stuff and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.429 
hormones do all kinds of crazy stuff and
you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.360> break<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.080> that's<00:01:19.229> kind<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
you can break out and that's kind of

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.719 
you can break out and that's kind of
hard<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> cover<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:20.040> school<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:20.580> not

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
few times and this is just going to get

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.520 
few times and this is just going to get

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:20.170 
that you are wearing mascara eyeliner is
that<00:06:19.160> kind<00:06:19.280> of<00:06:19.340> tricky<00:06:19.610> one<00:06:19.760> because<00:06:19.940> it's

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
that kind of tricky one because it's

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.000 
that kind of tricky one because it's
definitely<00:06:20.510> more<00:06:20.630> noticable<00:06:21.200> but<00:06:21.740> if<00:06:21.800> you<00:06:21.890> do

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
definitely more noticable but if you do

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.290 
definitely more noticable but if you do
want<00:06:22.160> to<00:06:22.220> wear<00:06:22.370> them<00:06:22.580> I'd<00:06:22.729> recommend<00:06:23.150> going

want to wear them I'd recommend going

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.850 
want to wear them I'd recommend going
for<00:06:23.630> a<00:06:23.660> brown<00:06:23.990> because<00:06:24.260> it's<00:06:24.500> much<00:06:24.620> softer

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
for a brown because it's much softer

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.370 
for a brown because it's much softer
than<00:06:25.220> a<00:06:25.490> black<00:06:25.970> which<00:06:26.210> can<00:06:26.419> look<00:06:26.570> quite<00:06:27.080> harsh

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
than a black which can look quite harsh

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.560
