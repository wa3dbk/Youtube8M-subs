can see better when I change my pitch
the<00:00:37.469> camera<00:00:37.860> stays<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.579> its<00:00:38.850> current<00:00:39.120> pitch<00:00:41.030> if

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the camera stays in its current pitch if

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.350 
the camera stays in its current pitch if
I<00:00:43.520> go<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:45.469> like<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:47.180> doesn't<00:00:48.180> move

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
I go like this go like that doesn't move

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
I go like this go like that doesn't move
either<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:49.590> there's<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> button<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> back

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
either now there's a button on the back

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
either now there's a button on the back
here<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.809> press<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> twice<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:53.930> can<00:00:54.930> now

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
here if I press that twice I can now

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.720 
here if I press that twice I can now
have<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:57.239> follow<00:00:57.770> my<00:00:58.770> pitch<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.520> change

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
have it follow my pitch so if I change

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.670 
have it follow my pitch so if I change
my<00:01:02.879> pitch<00:01:03.120> it'll<00:01:03.390> follow<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.719> pitch<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
my pitch it'll follow my pitch if I

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.170 
my pitch it'll follow my pitch if I
change<00:01:04.949> my<00:01:05.010> heading<00:01:05.430> it'll<00:01:05.880> follow<00:01:06.000> my

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
change my heading it'll follow my

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.600 
change my heading it'll follow my
heading<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.659> following<00:01:06.930> heading<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
heading so it's following heading and

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.289 
heading so it's following heading and
pitch<00:01:08.869> but<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.320> also<00:01:10.470> lock<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.299> into

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
pitch but then I can also lock it into

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.469 
pitch but then I can also lock it into
an<00:01:12.510> orientation<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.060> pitched

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
an orientation like this so it's pitched

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.410 
an orientation like this so it's pitched
over<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:16.080> press<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> button<00:01:17.159> again<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.670> it's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
over I press the button again now it's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.810 
over I press the button again now it's
locked<00:01:18.659> into<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.049> pitch<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.520> it'll<00:01:20.700> follow

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
locked into that pitch so it'll follow

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.899 
locked into that pitch so it'll follow
my<00:01:21.060> heading<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.900> heading<00:01:22.200> follow<00:01:22.560> mode

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
my heading it's in heading follow mode

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.240 
my heading it's in heading follow mode
but<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> pitch<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.299> locked<00:01:24.600> into<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.710> new<00:01:25.979> pitch

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
but the pitch is locked into a new pitch

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.980 
but the pitch is locked into a new pitch
that<00:01:26.460> I've<00:01:26.580> set

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.870 

so<00:01:29.560> see<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:29.860> no<00:01:29.979> matter<00:01:30.010> what<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.310> do<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.640> not

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
so see that no matter what I do it's not

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.690 
so see that no matter what I do it's not
going<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.510> change<00:01:35.200> pitch<00:01:35.470> anymore<00:01:35.740> but<00:01:36.610> it

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
going to change pitch anymore but it

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:46.680 
going to change pitch anymore but it
will<00:01:36.790> follow<00:01:37.030> my<00:01:37.210> heading<00:01:45.270> phone<00:01:46.270> which<00:01:46.540> is<00:01:46.659> a
