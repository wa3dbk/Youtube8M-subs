00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
like an exotic than some cutesy toy but

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.469 
like an exotic than some cutesy toy but
that<00:01:39.170> does<00:01:39.500> raise<00:01:39.830> a<00:01:40.070> bit<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.369> a<00:01:40.430> problem<00:01:40.700> the

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
that does raise a bit of a problem the

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.810 
that does raise a bit of a problem the
Boxster<00:01:42.110> now<00:01:42.320> looks<00:01:42.619> faster<00:01:43.280> than<00:01:43.700> it

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
Boxster now looks faster than it

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.190 
Boxster now looks faster than it
actually<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:45.880> now<00:01:46.880> don't<00:01:47.300> get<00:01:47.420> me<00:01:47.570> wrong<00:01:47.600> the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
actually is now don't get me wrong the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.280 
actually is now don't get me wrong the
Boxster<00:01:48.710> is<00:01:48.740> plenty<00:01:49.700> quick<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:51.110> really

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
Boxster is plenty quick but it really

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.770 
Boxster is plenty quick but it really
feels<00:01:51.619> that<00:01:51.979> once<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:52.580> approach<00:01:53.060> redline<00:01:53.750> and

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
feels that once you approach redline and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.330 
feels that once you approach redline and
once<00:01:54.200> you've<00:01:54.350> got<00:01:54.500> your<00:01:54.650> throttle<00:01:55.130> pretty

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
once you've got your throttle pretty

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.760 
once you've got your throttle pretty
much<00:01:55.520> all<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:56.000> way<00:01:56.090> down<00:01:56.330> there's<00:01:56.900> not<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.440> lot

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
much all the way down there's not a lot

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.700 
much all the way down there's not a lot
of<00:01:58.010> difference<00:01:58.520> between<00:01:58.880> say<00:01:59.180> 85%<00:01:59.900> throttle

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
of difference between say 85% throttle

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.790 
of difference between say 85% throttle
and<00:02:00.860> going<00:02:01.400> all<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.970> way<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.390> floor<00:02:02.800> now

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
and going all the way to the floor now

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.469 
and going all the way to the floor now
some<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.460> might<00:02:04.790> have<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.119> do<00:02:05.240> with<00:02:05.390> the

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
some of that might have to do with the

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.630 
some of that might have to do with the
fact<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.200> base<00:02:06.560> Boxster's<00:02:07.190> engine<00:02:07.490> is

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
fact that the base Boxster's engine is

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.210 
fact that the base Boxster's engine is
now<00:02:07.850> actually<00:02:08.300> smaller<00:02:09.019> than<00:02:09.200> before<00:02:09.709> it's

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
now actually smaller than before it's

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.810 
now actually smaller than before it's
now<00:02:10.459> at<00:02:10.670> 2.7<00:02:11.360> liter<00:02:11.390> as<00:02:11.720> opposed<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.769> 2.9<00:02:13.580> on

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
now at 2.7 liter as opposed to a 2.9 on

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.850 
now at 2.7 liter as opposed to a 2.9 on
the<00:02:13.880> previous<00:02:14.209> generation<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.410> car<00:02:15.620> still

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
the previous generation so the car still

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.280 
the previous generation so the car still
makes<00:02:16.160> 265<00:02:17.060> horsepower<00:02:17.209> which<00:02:17.630> is<00:02:17.660> identical

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
makes 265 horsepower which is identical

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.500 
makes 265 horsepower which is identical
to<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.530> old<00:02:18.560> car<00:02:18.950> but<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:19.459> lost<00:02:19.790> about<00:02:20.150> ten

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
to the old car but it's lost about ten

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.320 
to the old car but it's lost about ten
foot<00:02:20.870> pounds<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.290> torque<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.920> make<00:02:22.070> just<00:02:22.430> 206

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
foot pounds of torque to make just 206

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.820 
foot pounds of torque to make just 206
foot-pounds<00:02:23.870> which<00:02:23.989> isn't<00:02:24.260> really<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.650> very

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
foot-pounds which isn't really a very

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.490 
foot-pounds which isn't really a very
big<00:02:24.920> number<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.610> sports<00:02:25.850> car<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:27.260> can't

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
big number for a sports car you can't

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.660 
big number for a sports car you can't
just<00:02:27.680> look<00:02:27.739> at<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.010> number<00:02:28.190> though<00:02:28.430> there

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
just look at that number though there

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.509 
just look at that number though there
are<00:02:28.790> other<00:02:29.030> factors<00:02:29.630> here<00:02:29.900> now<00:02:30.350> because<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
are other factors here now because the

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.430 
are other factors here now because the
boxer<00:02:31.910> rides<00:02:32.120> on<00:02:32.300> an<00:02:32.390> all-new<00:02:32.690> platform<00:02:32.840> that

boxer rides on an all-new platform that

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.350 
boxer rides on an all-new platform that
platform<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.010> lighter<00:02:34.400> than<00:02:34.640> ever<00:02:34.850> before

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
platform is lighter than ever before

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.180 
platform is lighter than ever before
they've<00:02:35.750> actually<00:02:35.900> managed<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.350> shed<00:02:36.620> 50

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
they've actually managed to shed 50

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.270 
they've actually managed to shed 50
pounds<00:02:37.610> from<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.850> car<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.239> it's<00:02:38.630> under<00:02:39.280> 3,000
