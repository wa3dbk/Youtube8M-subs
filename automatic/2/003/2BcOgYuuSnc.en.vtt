something<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.230> probably<00:00:13.469> will<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.950> more

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
something we probably will have more

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.740 
something we probably will have more
unboxing<00:00:14.880> than<00:00:15.059> reviews<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:15.540> for<00:00:15.690> the

unboxing than reviews just for the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.240 
unboxing than reviews just for the
simple<00:00:16.020> fact<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.410> it's<00:00:16.529> much<00:00:16.740> easier<00:00:17.130> just

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
simple fact that it's much easier just

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.250 
simple fact that it's much easier just
to<00:00:17.369> get<00:00:17.520> something<00:00:17.760> unboxing<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.630> when<00:00:19.170> I'm

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
to get something unboxing it when I'm

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.810 
to get something unboxing it when I'm
doing<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.529> review<00:00:19.770> actually<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.189> take<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.580> take

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
doing the review actually I take it take

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.670 
doing the review actually I take it take
it<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.060> lab<00:00:21.240> test<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.960> do<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> bunch<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> stuff

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
it the lab test it do a bunch of stuff

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.320 
it the lab test it do a bunch of stuff
crunch<00:00:23.039> all<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> numbers<00:00:23.310> make<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> graphs

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
crunch all the numbers make the graphs

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.700 
crunch all the numbers make the graphs
all<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> rest<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> stuff<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.380> there's

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
all the rest of the stuff so there's

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.439 
all the rest of the stuff so there's
always<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.250> probably<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.000> more<00:00:27.359> of

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
always going to be probably a more of

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.109 
always going to be probably a more of
influx<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.400> unboxings<00:00:29.400> there's<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.880> lot<00:00:30.029> of

influx of unboxings there's a lot of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.250 
influx of unboxings there's a lot of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
today it's one of the very nice

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.450 
today it's one of the very nice
motherboards<00:00:43.020> has<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.770> features<00:00:43.920> has

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
motherboards has a lot of features has

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.639 
motherboards has a lot of features has
their<00:00:44.700> digi<00:00:44.969> vrm<00:00:45.450> their<00:00:45.629> EPU<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.200> their<00:00:46.289> TPU

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
their digi vrm their EPU and their TPU
all<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.460> stuff<00:00:47.700> actually<00:00:48.090> helps<00:00:48.300> keep<00:00:48.420> your

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
all this stuff actually helps keep your

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.819 
all this stuff actually helps keep your
motherboard<00:00:48.750> running<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> lot<00:00:49.320> better<00:00:49.559> and

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
motherboard running a lot better and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
motherboard running a lot better and
makes<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> over<00:00:50.219> clock<00:00:50.550> much<00:00:50.940> better<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.510> well

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
makes it over clock much better as well

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
makes it over clock much better as well
so<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.620> today<00:00:52.739> we're<00:00:52.920> gonna<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:53.190> ahead<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
so but today we're gonna go ahead and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.490 
so but today we're gonna go ahead and
just<00:00:53.579> jump<00:00:53.879> into<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> box<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:55.289> thing

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
just jump into the box this thing

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.490 
just jump into the box this thing
supports<00:00:55.890> all<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> new<00:00:56.460> am3+<00:00:57.149> CPUs<00:00:57.930> it'll

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
supports all of the new am3+ CPUs it'll

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.830 
supports all of the new am3+ CPUs it'll
support<00:00:58.739> both<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:58.980> bulldozer<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.239> then

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
support both the bulldozer and then

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240 
support both the bulldozer and then
whatever<00:01:00.989> else<00:01:01.230> comes<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> Alana<00:01:02.100> will

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
whatever else comes out the Alana will

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.740 
whatever else comes out the Alana will
actually<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.969> these<00:01:03.030> unboxing<00:01:03.660> today

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
actually that we do these unboxing today

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.719 
actually that we do these unboxing today
actually<00:01:04.229> supports<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> different<00:01:05.129> socket

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
actually supports a different socket

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.469 
actually supports a different socket
altogether

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
altogether

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.789 
altogether
I<00:01:06.510> thought<00:01:06.930> these<00:01:07.110> boards<00:01:07.409> would<00:01:07.500> support

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
I thought these boards would support

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.410 
I thought these boards would support
both<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.310> no<00:01:08.460> Pam<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.030> actually<00:01:09.299> have

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
both but no Pam do you can actually have

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.969 
both but no Pam do you can actually have
a<00:01:09.450> couple<00:01:09.630> different<00:01:09.900> chipsets<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.650> their

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
a couple different chipsets for their

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.969 
a couple different chipsets for their
CPUs<00:01:11.549> well<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.240> actually<00:01:12.360> ones<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.020> CPU<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
CPUs well it's actually ones a CPU and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
CPUs well it's actually ones a CPU and
Wednesday<00:01:14.280> 8pu<00:01:15.000> actually<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> guess<00:01:15.900> that's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
Wednesday 8pu actually so I guess that's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.749 
Wednesday 8pu actually so I guess that's
why<00:01:16.170> they're<00:01:16.320> changing<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> anyways<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> back

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
why they're changing it anyways the back

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.830 
why they're changing it anyways the back
of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.909> box<00:01:18.890> photo<00:01:19.890> box<00:01:20.600> can<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.630> go<00:01:21.750> ahead

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
of the box photo box can you go ahead

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.480 
of the box photo box can you go ahead
and<00:01:22.020> pop<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> top<00:01:22.470> off<00:01:25.100> we're<00:01:26.100> off<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> back

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and pop the top off we're off the back

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.620 
and pop the top off we're off the back
on<00:01:26.759> top<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> user's<00:01:27.990> manual<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.630> go

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
on top we have the user's manual and go

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.999 
on top we have the user's manual and go
ahead<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.020> set<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.229> down<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.680> table<00:01:31.950> here

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
ahead and set that down the table here

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.130 
ahead and set that down the table here
there's<00:01:35.009> also<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.490> driver<00:01:35.880> CD

back of the motherboard a lot of you

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.860 
back of the motherboard a lot of you
guys<00:04:57.550> ask<00:04:57.820> questions<00:04:58.210> about<00:04:58.300> handling<00:04:58.750> the

myself out before I touching this stuff
you<00:05:01.990> really<00:05:02.229> don't<00:05:02.380> need<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.560> grind<00:05:02.740> yourself

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
you really don't need to grind yourself

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.290 
you really don't need to grind yourself
out<00:05:03.190> with<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.310> permanent<00:05:03.760> thing<00:05:03.789> as<00:05:04.090> long<00:05:04.210> as

a<00:05:06.669> fixated<00:05:07.150> position<00:05:07.510> it's<00:05:07.720> okay<00:05:08.669> gonna<00:05:09.669> flip

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
a fixated position it's okay gonna flip

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:11.490 
a fixated position it's okay gonna flip
it<00:05:09.970> around<00:05:10.060> take<00:05:10.720> a<00:05:10.750> look<00:05:10.960> or<00:05:11.050> look<00:05:11.260> at<00:05:11.410> the

it around take a look or look at the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.080 
it around take a look or look at the
rear<00:05:11.650> i/o<00:05:13.139> we<00:05:14.139> have<00:05:14.320> legacy<00:05:15.250> ps2<00:05:15.820> keyboard

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
rear i/o we have legacy ps2 keyboard

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.760 
rear i/o we have legacy ps2 keyboard
port<00:05:16.510> right<00:05:16.660> here<00:05:16.900> have<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:17.889> couple<00:05:18.160> of<00:05:18.400> two

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
port right here have a couple of two

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.110 
port right here have a couple of two
four<00:05:21.419> six<00:05:22.419> eight<00:05:22.660> of<00:05:23.139> your<00:05:23.680> standard<00:05:23.979> USB<00:05:24.280> 2.0

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
four six eight of your standard USB 2.0

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.710 
four six eight of your standard USB 2.0
then<00:05:25.840> we<00:05:25.990> have<00:05:26.139> two<00:05:26.470> of<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.710> USB<00:05:26.919> 3.0<00:05:27.729> we<00:05:28.599> have

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
then we have two of the USB 3.0 we have

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.110 
then we have two of the USB 3.0 we have
a<00:05:28.750> powered<00:05:29.200> eSATA<00:05:29.710> right<00:05:29.950> here<00:05:30.220> we<00:05:30.820> also<00:05:31.000> have

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
a powered eSATA right here we also have

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.790 
a powered eSATA right here we also have
another<00:05:31.330> combination<00:05:31.750> port<00:05:32.320> right<00:05:32.470> here<00:05:32.500> my

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
another combination port right here my

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.440 
another combination port right here my
texture<00:05:33.039> exactly<00:05:33.550> what<00:05:33.700> it<00:05:33.789> is<00:05:33.820> I<00:05:34.060> looked<00:05:34.389> at

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
texture exactly what it is I looked at

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.940 
texture exactly what it is I looked at
when<00:05:34.599> we<00:05:34.630> do<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:34.960> actual<00:05:35.229> full<00:05:35.410> review<00:05:35.740> but

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
when we do the actual full review but

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.200 
when we do the actual full review but
that's<00:05:36.099> definitely<00:05:36.250> a<00:05:36.490> combination<00:05:36.669> port<00:05:37.150> of

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
that's definitely a combination port of

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.060 
that's definitely a combination port of
one<00:05:37.389> type<00:05:37.599> probably<00:05:37.960> either<00:05:38.050> USB<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:38.830> SATA

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
one type probably either USB and SATA

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.250 
one type probably either USB and SATA
that's<00:05:39.639> probably<00:05:39.940> what<00:05:40.090> it<00:05:40.120> is<00:05:40.300> and<00:05:40.570> then

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
that's probably what it is and then

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.050 
that's probably what it is and then
right<00:05:41.289> here<00:05:41.440> we<00:05:41.680> have<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.830> s/pdif<00:05:42.190> connection

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
right here we have the s/pdif connection

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.870 
right here we have the s/pdif connection
we<00:05:43.960> have<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.169> I<00:05:44.200> Triple<00:05:44.560> E<00:05:44.800> there's<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.130> 1394

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
we have the I Triple E there's the 1394

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.620 
we have the I Triple E there's the 1394
firewire<00:05:45.930> connection<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.979> lamb<00:05:48.220> and<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:49.000> 7.1

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
firewire connection the lamb and the 7.1

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.540 
firewire connection the lamb and the 7.1
digital<00:05:50.349> audio<00:05:50.680> so<00:05:51.039> that<00:05:51.190> pretty<00:05:51.340> much<00:05:51.460> wraps

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
digital audio so that pretty much wraps

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.839 
digital audio so that pretty much wraps
it<00:05:51.940> up<00:05:52.120> this<00:05:53.110> is<00:05:53.199> everything<00:05:53.590> here<00:05:53.860> let<00:05:54.820> me
