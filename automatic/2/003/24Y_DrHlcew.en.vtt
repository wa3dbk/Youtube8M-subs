00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.349 
like twenty percent off or ten percent
off<00:00:22.199> or<00:00:22.380> something<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.359> sephora

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
what this is is just a liquid I think

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.580

it's<00:00:44.040> highlighter<00:00:44.820> type<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.750> thing<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.410> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
it's highlighter type of thing you just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.630 
it's highlighter type of thing you just
take<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> little<00:00:46.950> bit<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.969> has

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
take a little bit like this this has

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.470 
take a little bit like this this has
let's<00:00:50.640> check<00:00:54.739> 1.1<00:00:55.739> ounces<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.390> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
let's check 1.1 ounces this what it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.319 
let's check 1.1 ounces this what it
looks<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.199> my<00:00:59.100> hand<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> then<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.180> just

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
looks like on my hand and then you just

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.160 
looks like on my hand and then you just
blend<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.899> now<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> don't<00:01:02.430> love<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
blend it in now I don't love this I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
blend it in now I don't love this I
don't<00:01:04.650> find<00:01:04.799> myself<00:01:04.890> using<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.580> very<00:01:05.610> often<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
don't find myself using it very often so

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.810 
don't find myself using it very often so
I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.990> waste<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.950> did<00:01:08.280> buy<00:01:08.760> this

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
I think it's a waste that I did buy this

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.170 
I think it's a waste that I did buy this
because<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.960> full<00:01:10.140> size<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:11.280> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
because this is the full size but it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.010 
because this is the full size but it
does<00:01:12.450> give<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.840> very<00:01:13.140> nice<00:01:13.799> dewy<00:01:14.610> glow<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.540> just

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
does give a very nice dewy glow I just

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.770 
does give a very nice dewy glow I just
feel<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.390> good

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
feel that it's not really that good

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
feel that it's not really that good
because<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.290> can't<00:01:19.590> use<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.220> full

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
because you can't use it as a full

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.140 
because you can't use it as a full
bronzer<00:01:21.090> because<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.630> too<00:01:22.790> shimmery<00:01:23.790> for

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
bronzer because it's too shimmery for

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.510 
bronzer because it's too shimmery for
that<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.960> looks<00:01:25.259> kind<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> muddy<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.310> like

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that and it looks kind of muddy and like

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.030 
that and it looks kind of muddy and like
weirdly<00:01:26.909> place<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> use<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.040> your

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
weirdly place if you use it as your

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
weirdly place if you use it as your
highlighter<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.670> cheekbones<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.689> this

the entire set because I did

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.500 
the entire set because I did
a<00:01:54.570> beautiful<00:01:55.460> milky<00:01:56.460> baby<00:01:56.760> pink<00:01:57.120> color<00:01:57.360> I

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
a beautiful milky baby pink color I

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.940 
a beautiful milky baby pink color I
don't<00:01:57.690> think<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.900> can<00:01:57.960> see<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.650> I

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
don't think you can see that but I

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.430 
don't think you can see that but I
really<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.730> feel<00:01:59.940> of<00:01:59.970> this<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.990> very

really like the feel of this it's very
very<00:02:01.740> nice<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.970> actually<00:02:03.590> contemplated<00:02:04.590> on

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
very nice so I actually contemplated on

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.400 
very nice so I actually contemplated on
getting<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:06.450> full<00:02:06.690> size<00:02:06.720> of<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.140> because<00:02:07.290> I

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
getting the full size of this because I

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
the only thing I really don't like about

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.320 
the only thing I really don't like about
it<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.950> has<00:02:59.160> very<00:02:59.519> big<00:02:59.820> chunks<00:03:00.269> of

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
it it's that it has very big chunks of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.960 
it it's that it has very big chunks of
litter<00:03:00.989> but<00:03:01.860> other<00:03:02.190> than<00:03:02.459> that<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:04.850> hope<00:03:05.850> you

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
litter but other than that I hope you

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.880 
litter but other than that I hope you
can't<00:03:06.180> do<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.510> because<00:03:06.720> my<00:03:07.050> camera

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
can't do that because my camera

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.150 
can't do that because my camera
ok<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.490> those<00:03:10.850> are<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.150> four<00:03:11.330> items<00:03:12.160> overall

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160

ok so those are the four items overall
for<00:03:13.400> forty<00:03:13.730> nine<00:03:13.880> dollars<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.420> honestly<00:03:14.810> don't

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
for forty nine dollars I honestly don't

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.050 
for forty nine dollars I honestly don't
think<00:03:15.230> it's<00:03:15.590> worth<00:03:15.800> it<00:03:16.040> only<00:03:16.370> reason<00:03:16.490> why<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:16.760> do

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060
