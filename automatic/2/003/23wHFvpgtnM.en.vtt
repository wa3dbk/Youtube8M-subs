yeah<00:03:49.329> it<00:03:49.750> was<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.989> first<00:03:50.230> try<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.620> went<00:03:50.829> on

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
yeah it was the first try that I went on

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.150 
yeah it was the first try that I went on
the<00:03:50.950> ground<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.579> I<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.769> just<00:03:53.769> hid<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.130> a

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
the ground and I I just hid like a

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.490 
the ground and I I just hid like a
little<00:03:54.459> girl<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:54.970> hit<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.810> all<00:03:55.900> he<00:03:56.019> told<00:03:56.319> me<00:03:56.440> I

little girl I hit it all he told me I

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.410 
little girl I hit it all he told me I
could<00:03:56.709> run<00:03:56.890> so<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.730> was<00:03:57.819> our<00:03:57.910> plan<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.329> whole

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
could run so that was our plan the whole

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.830 
could run so that was our plan the whole
time<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:59.669> we<00:04:00.669> actually<00:04:00.699> we<00:04:01.540> didn't<00:04:01.690> really

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
time and we actually we didn't really

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.240 
time and we actually we didn't really
have<00:04:02.019> much<00:04:02.049> trouble

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
have much trouble

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.340 
have much trouble
for<00:04:03.460> this<00:04:03.580> entire<00:04:03.910> mission<00:04:04.330> until<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.050> end

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
for this entire mission until the end

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.450 
for this entire mission until the end
which<00:04:05.710> is<00:04:05.860> coming<00:04:06.100> up<00:04:07.860> just<00:04:08.860> getting<00:04:09.070> past

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
which is coming up just getting past

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.190 
which is coming up just getting past
this<00:04:09.670> in<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.060> actually<00:04:10.210> getting<00:04:10.600> into<00:04:11.080> the

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
spot where the where the circle is you

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.530 
spot where the where the circle is you
know<00:04:15.340> for<00:04:15.460> the<00:04:15.580> mission<00:04:15.700> success<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.450> was

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
know for the mission success that was

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.289 
know for the mission success that was
the<00:04:16.600> hardest<00:04:16.870> part<00:04:17.109> oh<00:04:17.790> I've<00:04:18.790> noticed<00:04:19.180> on<00:04:19.269> a

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
the hardest part oh I've noticed on a

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.819 
the hardest part oh I've noticed on a
lot<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.630> these<00:04:19.690> spec<00:04:19.959> op<00:04:20.140> missions<00:04:20.380> when<00:04:20.709> you

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
lot of these spec op missions when you

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.530 
lot of these spec op missions when you
see<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.250> exit<00:04:21.670> or<00:04:21.790> when<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.120> see<00:04:22.270> like<00:04:22.420> the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
see the exit or when you see like the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.260 
see the exit or when you see like the
mission<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:23.170> run<00:04:23.380> like<00:04:23.410> hell<00:04:24.270> it's

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
mission and you run like hell it's

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.240 
mission and you run like hell it's
basically<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:26.020> like<00:04:26.440> there's<00:04:26.830> no<00:04:27.010> there's

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
basically it like there's no there's

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.460 
basically it like there's no there's
there's<00:04:27.850> nothing<00:04:28.300> more<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:28.660> do<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:29.050> run<00:04:29.290> like

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
there's nothing more to do you run like

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.870 
there's nothing more to do you run like
hell<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:30.040> in<00:04:30.160> our<00:04:30.280> last<00:04:30.430> episode<00:04:30.640> of

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
hell like in our last episode of

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.630 
hell like in our last episode of
breaching<00:04:31.330> clear<00:04:31.570> like<00:04:31.890> you<00:04:32.890> you<00:04:33.280> see<00:04:33.490> that

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
breaching clear like you you see that

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.900 
breaching clear like you you see that
mission<00:04:33.970> end<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.720> run<00:04:34.930> like<00:04:34.960> hell<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:36.370> know

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
mission end and you run like hell I know

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.909 
mission end and you run like hell I know
because<00:04:37.060> once<00:04:37.360> once<00:04:37.810> both<00:04:38.110> teammates<00:04:38.530> are<00:04:38.770> in

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
because once once both teammates are in

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.830 
because once once both teammates are in
the<00:04:39.040> circle<00:04:39.430> it's<00:04:39.730> over<00:04:40.180> doesn't<00:04:40.510> matter<00:04:40.660> if

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
the circle it's over doesn't matter if

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.150 
the circle it's over doesn't matter if
you're<00:04:40.900> getting<00:04:41.080> shot<00:04:41.169> at<00:04:41.590> or<00:04:41.740> something<00:04:42.070> that

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
you're getting shot at or something that

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.090 
you're getting shot at or something that
automatically<00:04:42.580> ends<00:04:42.820> it<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:44.110> and<00:04:44.500> we<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.980> know

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
automatically ends it so and we you know

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.610 
automatically ends it so and we you know
we<00:04:45.250> definitely<00:04:45.610> found<00:04:45.730> that<00:04:45.940> out<00:04:46.120> of<00:04:46.530> after<00:04:47.530> it

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
we definitely found that out of after it

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.250 
we definitely found that out of after it
took<00:04:47.770> us<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.890> few<00:04:47.980> tries<00:04:48.400> of<00:04:48.700> slowly<00:04:49.600> creeping

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
took us a few tries of slowly creeping

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.200 
took us a few tries of slowly creeping
