00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
which is 90 to see and this is obviously

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.890 
which is 90 to see and this is obviously
a<00:03:48.160> bit<00:03:48.370> more<00:03:48.580> pink<00:03:48.850> here<00:03:49.030> where<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:49.420> is<00:03:49.480> more

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
a bit more pink here where this is more

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.190

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
is but neutral at the same time if that

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.199 
is but neutral at the same time if that
makes<00:03:56.019> sense<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.160> do<00:03:57.280> really<00:03:57.519> like<00:03:57.730> this<00:03:57.970> and

finish brand just because these are my
favorites<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.609> tend<00:04:12.820> to<00:04:12.880> pick<00:04:13.060> up<00:04:13.180> more<00:04:13.359> of<00:04:13.510> them

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
favorites I tend to pick up more of them

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.279 
favorites I tend to pick up more of them
and<00:04:13.989> this<00:04:14.650> next<00:04:14.859> one<00:04:15.130> is<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.700> shade<00:04:16.390> 14<00:04:16.959> and

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
and this next one is in the shade 14 and

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.610 
and this next one is in the shade 14 and
this<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:17.919> by<00:04:18.039> the<00:04:18.100> kate<00:04:19.030> moss<00:04:19.269> collection<00:04:19.900> so

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
this is by the kate moss collection so

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.270 
this is by the kate moss collection so
here<00:04:21.100> is<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.880> swatch<00:04:22.419> of<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:25.800> it's<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:26.979> ma<00:04:27.220> vie

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
here is a swatch of it and it's a ma vie

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:36.489 
here is a swatch of it and it's a ma vie
neutral<00:04:27.820> color

00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:36.499 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.230 

so<00:04:37.499> this<00:04:37.740> is<00:04:37.949> very<00:04:38.159> similar<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.669> be<00:04:38.939> a<00:04:38.969> bottle

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
so this is very similar to be a bottle

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.059 
so this is very similar to be a bottle
of<00:04:39.300> which<00:04:39.569> kind<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:39.930> explains<00:04:40.050> why<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.830> like

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
of which kind of explains why I like

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.860 
of which kind of explains why I like
that<00:04:41.219> one<00:04:41.400> so<00:04:41.460> much<00:04:41.669> because<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.270> do<00:04:42.419> wear<00:04:42.719> this

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
that one so much because I do wear this

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.040 
that one so much because I do wear this
on<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.080> daily<00:04:43.259> basis<00:04:44.240> bebot<00:04:45.240> love<00:04:45.419> looks<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:45.960> bit

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
on a daily basis bebot love looks a bit

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.709 
on a daily basis bebot love looks a bit
darker<00:04:46.529> but<00:04:46.800> on<00:04:47.129> the<00:04:47.550> lips<00:04:47.759> I<00:04:48.060> can't<00:04:48.479> really

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
darker but on the lips I can't really

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.899 
darker but on the lips I can't really
tell<00:04:48.900> much<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.229> difference<00:04:49.590> this<00:04:50.340> next<00:04:50.639> one

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
tell much of a difference this next one

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:56.059 
tell much of a difference this next one
is<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.800> mm<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:54.180> is<00:04:54.240> 0<00:04:54.689> 50<00:04:55.110> this<00:04:55.409> is<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.830> shade

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
is a mm this is 0 50 this is the shade

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.760 
is a mm this is 0 50 this is the shade
paradise<00:04:56.819> and<00:04:57.150> it's<00:04:57.930> just<00:04:58.259> the<00:04:58.409> regular

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
paradise and it's just the regular

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:06.140 
paradise and it's just the regular
elastic<00:04:59.219> finish<00:04:59.550> line<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:05.729> don't<00:05:05.909> know<00:05:05.999> if

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
elastic finish line and I don't know if

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:17.820 
elastic finish line and I don't know if
you<00:05:06.240> guys<00:05:06.360> are<00:05:06.419> seeing<00:05:06.719> a<00:05:06.930> pattern<00:05:07.139> here<00:05:07.379> but

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.760 

so<00:05:18.340> this<00:05:18.520> is<00:05:18.670> a<00:05:18.700> dark<00:05:19.000> Mavi<00:05:19.390> color<00:05:19.900> it's

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
so this is a dark Mavi color it's

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.920 
so this is a dark Mavi color it's
absolutely<00:05:20.950> beautiful<00:05:21.460> though<00:05:21.910> I<00:05:22.180> love<00:05:22.750> to

wear<00:05:23.080> it<00:05:23.230> I<00:05:23.380> would<00:05:23.890> wear<00:05:24.040> it<00:05:24.130> with<00:05:24.220> something

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
wear it I would wear it with something

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.220 
wear it I would wear it with something
like<00:05:24.670> this<00:05:25.120> where<00:05:25.480> it<00:05:25.600> goes<00:05:25.750> really<00:05:25.930> well<00:05:26.170> with

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.500 
like this where it goes really well with

swatch and maybe even go out and buy it
which<00:06:28.690> probably<00:06:28.930> isn't<00:06:29.200> a<00:06:29.410> good<00:06:29.530> thing<00:06:29.590> but

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580
