 from almería called elected is a town 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.500
 that does not achieve people with very 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.960
 peculiar and I am with many many

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.610
 it depends on the space it's awesome I 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.070
 it seems that he does not have much money so 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.289
 that is, they had to work a lot 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.619
 so I had to spend the majority of 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.869
 my childhood put in a daycare by 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.909

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.110
 since childhood he always has enough 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.260
 concerns about many things because the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.700
 what how to give things I do not know but 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.770
 typical of the child my mother is experience 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.280
 I was very good as a child 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.280
 very well 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.020
 good everything very good in quotes 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.370
 because it was once a day pretty 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.620
 yes 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.360
 always had enough friends and the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.930
 truth that I can not only get married but 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.299
 there is one that I can give my best 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.760
 friend that has always been my cousin 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.909
 samuel with the ability to share many 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.159
 things and we've had quite a few things in 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.230
 common and the truth that brings me feels 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.629
 very well because with him I will be able to leave 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.849
 house is the life that down is not 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.159
 people in the area is grace has always 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.049
 been a very shy person and follows 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.819
 being at the beginning with people who do not 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.099
 I know and but good when he entered 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.430
 Trust the truth is that it can be very 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.430
 heavy 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.459
 very small this little thing here was my 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.110
 sister named patricia and although 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.840
 it will take us with enough damage the truth 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.400
 that has always taken us very well and yes 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.400
 I love love her very much 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.739
 during the transition institute the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.420
 truth is I can say it was a year 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.040
 magic 1 years that you will never be able to forget 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.569
 I had a good time 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.280
 pretty friends and the truth wants to take out 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.660
 also a point the notes I loved 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.080
 especially the geography and although this 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.060
 map is coming out a bit 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.580
 I knew almost all the capitals of 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.170
 world I do not know I like to look at the maps and 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.830
 ask me what could be happening 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.830
 right now 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.670
 I spent a lot of good time, it happened a lot 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.650
 time listening to music was a 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.960
 exaggeration good I do not know if it's time 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.920
 but it was all listen to the music of 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.050
 fruits like green day fighting from simple 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.820
 flat will be very roll for not American 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.280
 but there is a group that calls me quite 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.230
 the attention when it and for me this 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.330
 group has been like this will be better than 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.280
 I discovered in that time of weeks 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.770
 1182 and the truth that I loved 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.810
 listen to their records watch their videos 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.570
 PC loss and I do not know I think this group 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.190
 It motivated me to start playing the guitar 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.980
 an argument that my uncle has reached and that 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.800
 I will never forget and I spent a lot of time 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.710
 with her I remember even forming a group 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.040
 blood a disc and said with a 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.410
 life's unique experience 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.329
 will keep the university the truth that 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.489
 I was not sure which way from here 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.490
 I went to the university I went to the capital 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.139
 and that for someone 18 years old take a 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.120
 decision so sometimes it's complicated 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.100
 because it 's a decision that ends 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.590
 I wait for your life and although the little one had 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.180
 dreamed of being a football player when 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.280
 football is all done because he does not 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.440
 It was very good I carry a sentence jones 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.360
 we also put a lot of attention people 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.820
 who worked at home may 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.330
 experience things in the space to command 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.330
 advice here 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.580
 a kind of alien because if I am 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.940
 of those people who believe that there is life 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.940
 beyond 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.940
 not 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.030
 so a friend told me that I was 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.889
 focus more and other friends ready me 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.590
 I also do it to get them out and 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.810
 another friend told me 'not so almost everything 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.849
 the group of friends we ended up doing in 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.009
 Seaweed house at first satisfied me 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.410
 the idea of assembling the type of company 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.180
 another form of company because I do not know but 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.620
 then in the middle the race had 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.650
 subjects proportions that I do not 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.330
 It motivated me a lot and I had a really bad time 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.729
 there were some naturals who did not get 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.250
 take out and not just to depress 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.740
 quite and I was even with phone 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.960
 but good in the end I ended up in 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.960
 salnés also known good less than 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.210
 a blonde girl and 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.889
 to sprout love too 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.030
 the sea ​​and enjoy for my husband is for 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.030
 past there 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.530
 I can also say that I fell in love 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.969
 before that I also fell in love 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.969
 also from the heart 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.660
 well you know how the thing works 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.770
 love no and these guys is the story of 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.770
 how I met your mother 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.320
 It gives me life 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:20.180
 this formulation has studied 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.289
 lately he devoted a lot of time to 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.289
 clean because I know it's going 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.240
 he is not a person who cares much 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.820
 for its future the truth I do not know with 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.310
 who answers how it will end 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.380
 I like to be those people who believe that 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.080
 what they have to go through will pass without further 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.750
 I do not know what the life of sex is not 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.980
 to be surprised 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.980
 so you 're not paying 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.509
 Many people will think that I have very little 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.400
 time what I really do not think that 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:56.819
 I was from the people who uploaded a video 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:59.099
 of the first the video avoiding the 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:02.069
 six in that it appears as guys in the 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:02.759
 which we danced if we do a little 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:04.289
 play gas 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.720
 the video was recorded on the roof of the 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:08.759
 floor of one of them and started to catch 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.159
 constant form so I had to 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:12.659
 remove because to 10 of obiglio I think that 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:14.759
 that video is because all more than one 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:17.180
 million reproductions and we left 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:19.270
 you already know 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.410
 inside because I would like to visit usa 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.900
 do things like this is even raising 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.610
 to cancún and I'm not because I never 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.289
 right have I have not had a life 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.270
 perfect and I think if I had had 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.610
 nor the life that I say because everyone 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.949
 you know I already know the interceptions are 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.320
 really life always tried to be 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:38.539
 a happy positive person and there is a 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.660
 phase that always tried to see with me that 

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:43.070
 says live as if you were going to die tomorrow 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.860
 learn as if you were going to live forever 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.160
 from friend mahatma gandhi so now 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.160
 you know 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.190
 do not
