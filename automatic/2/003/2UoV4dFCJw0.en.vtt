00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.160
 When Celso Borges came to the national team 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.020
 greater the 8 was his favorite but in 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.730
 that moment does not capture a cacique of 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.700
 the tricolor as it was walter rye 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.740
 He had to leave with 5 because he was confessed 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.560
 admirer of zinedine zidane and the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.600
 French marked his career the use of 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.410
 numbers is a privilege for seniority 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.410
 of the players 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:32.689
 this selection is coming to great 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.120
 number of numbers hoarded in the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.130
 selection the soccer players who own them 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.910
 it is an antiquity and hierarchy in the 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.310
 team 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.260
 yunior díaz always used the 15 because so 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.690
 it was instilled by the props 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.920
 want to match him with his father but in the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.120
 number also 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.120
 we like why not 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.940
 is common to duarte giancarlo gonzález 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.460
 júnior díaz and the synth that gives celso 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.400
 borges marco ureña joel changed to the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.860
 Saurians have a fixed number some 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.320
 new ones like david guzmán found the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.830
 lucky to find your favorite number 20 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.810
 but deyver vega could not say the same 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.660
 again, I preferred 15 but now 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.000
 juniors genes 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.909
 experiences his shirt already obviously 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.369
 they put to fight the swiss of quiet children 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.170
 oscar duarte step by the same of vega 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.869
 when I came to the selection in the era of 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.030
 ricardo volpe at the end the 6 that I use 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.759
 many years wilber lopez finished him 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.240
 pleasing for good in the years and every 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.720
 one is having his number 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.300
 always in each team each player 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.300
 that he has been living for years 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.060
 You have the number when I arrived 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.060
 they gave 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.460
 as well as in any company the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.649
 seniority also weighs in the selection 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.649
 and there's whoever touches a banned number
