see<00:01:50.510> all<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.750> time<00:01:50.930> tell<00:01:51.140> us<00:01:51.229> what<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.500> is

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
see all the time tell us what that is

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.980 
see all the time tell us what that is
well<00:01:52.250> probably<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.940> most<00:01:53.120> common<00:01:53.330> mistake

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
well probably the most common mistake

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.960 
well probably the most common mistake
think<00:01:54.380> it's<00:01:54.530> made<00:01:54.740> is<00:01:55.010> not<00:01:55.220> lining<00:01:55.580> up<00:01:55.820> the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
think it's made is not lining up the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.480 
think it's made is not lining up the
tail<00:01:56.180> piece<00:01:56.650> for<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.800> instrument<00:01:58.310> if<00:01:58.400> you

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
tail piece for the instrument if you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.480 
tail piece for the instrument if you
don't<00:01:58.640> get<00:01:58.729> them<00:01:58.850> aligned<00:01:59.270> perfectly<00:02:00.490> they're

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
don't get them aligned perfectly they're

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.390 
don't get them aligned perfectly they're
not<00:02:01.610> going<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.850> function<00:02:02.240> as<00:02:02.420> they<00:02:02.720> should<00:02:03.400> but

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
not going to function as they should but

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.150 
not going to function as they should but
you<00:02:04.520> know<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:05.390> came<00:02:05.780> all<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.770> kids<00:02:06.950> who<00:02:07.070> do

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
you know it came all the kids who do

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.889 
you know it came all the kids who do
come<00:02:07.310> with<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.610> string<00:02:07.910> as<00:02:08.090> well<00:02:08.300> which<00:02:08.630> helps

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
come with the string as well which helps

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.260 
come with the string as well which helps
to<00:02:09.259> line<00:02:09.500> them<00:02:09.709> up<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.580> can<00:02:10.789> be<00:02:10.970> done<00:02:11.060> very

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
to line them up so it can be done very

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.120 
to line them up so it can be done very
very<00:02:11.959> easily<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.830> take<00:02:12.980> your
