part<00:00:59.020> right<00:00:59.200> to<00:00:59.380> our<00:01:00.010> game<00:01:00.190> is<00:01:00.340> very<00:01:00.489> dynamic

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
part right to our game is very dynamic

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.150 
part right to our game is very dynamic
we<00:01:01.180> have<00:01:01.300> a<00:01:01.329> lot<00:01:01.540> of<00:01:01.570> things<00:01:01.809> going<00:01:02.020> on<00:01:02.230> and<00:01:02.500> our

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
we have a lot of things going on and our

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.679 
we have a lot of things going on and our
goal<00:01:03.489> was<00:01:03.520> to<00:01:03.700> have<00:01:03.820> very<00:01:04.089> large<00:01:04.269> draw

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
goal was to have very large draw

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.749 
goal was to have very large draw
distances<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.439> also<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.770> lot<00:01:05.979> of<00:01:06.100> details<00:01:06.490> up

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
distances and also a lot of details up

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.489 
distances and also a lot of details up
close<00:01:07.119> because<00:01:07.539> of<00:01:07.840> all<00:01:07.960> of<00:01:08.079> those<00:01:08.200> things

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:08.499 
close because of all of those things

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:09.840 
close because of all of those things
sometimes<00:01:09.039> we<00:01:09.340> have<00:01:09.429> to<00:01:09.549> make<00:01:09.670> some

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
sometimes we have to make some

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.370 
sometimes we have to make some
trade-offs<00:01:10.090> in<00:01:10.359> the<00:01:10.450> configuration<00:01:10.960> that<00:01:11.259> we

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
trade-offs in the configuration that we

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.679 
trade-offs in the configuration that we
run<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.679> game<00:01:11.859> on<00:01:12.039> with<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.609> GTX<00:01:13.090> 280<00:01:13.420> we're

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
run the game on with the GTX 280 we're

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.179

while testing out the GTX 280 for the
first<00:01:32.890> time<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.190> was<00:01:33.400> amazed<00:01:34.150> by<00:01:34.360> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
first time I was amazed by the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.480 
first time I was amazed by the
performance<00:01:35.530> we<00:01:35.650> had<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.890> our<00:01:35.979> game<00:01:36.190> I<00:01:36.369> mean

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
performance we had in our game I mean

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.550 
performance we had in our game I mean
almost<00:01:36.880> double<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.420> frame<00:01:37.630> rate<00:01:37.869> the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
almost double the frame rate the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.770 
almost double the frame rate the
incredible<00:01:39.550> performance<00:01:40.030> enables<00:01:40.600> us<00:01:40.720> to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
incredible performance enables us to

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.020 
incredible performance enables us to
implement<00:01:41.610> anti-aliasing<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:42.909> know

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030
