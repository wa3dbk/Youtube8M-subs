either<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.439> hey<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.340> guess<00:01:38.880> that's<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.270> one

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
either but hey I guess that's just one

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.330 
either but hey I guess that's just one
of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> pitfalls<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.159> deal

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
of the pitfalls of what we have to deal

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.190 
of the pitfalls of what we have to deal
with<00:01:41.549> as<00:01:41.790> far<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.509> other<00:01:42.689> things<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> can

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
with as far as other things you can

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.889 
with as far as other things you can
control<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.189> turn<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> flash<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:45.509> off

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
control you can turn the flash on or off

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.520 
control you can turn the flash on or off
or<00:01:46.200> set<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.590> auto<00:01:47.180> okay<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> self

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
or set to auto okay you can do a self

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.460 
or set to auto okay you can do a self
timer<00:01:49.799> two<00:01:50.579> seconds<00:01:51.509> or<00:01:51.600> 10<00:01:51.630> seconds<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
timer two seconds or 10 seconds and you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.639 
timer two seconds or 10 seconds and you
can<00:01:53.430> change<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.880> picture<00:01:54.090> size<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.200> instead

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
can change the picture size so instead

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.889 
can change the picture size so instead
of<00:01:55.710> doing<00:01:55.890> 12<00:01:56.280> megapixels<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.659> down<00:01:57.869> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
of doing 12 megapixels I can go down to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.910 
of doing 12 megapixels I can go down to
2<00:01:58.560> megapixels<00:01:59.450> alright<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.710> take<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
2 megapixels alright and then it take a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.960 
2 megapixels alright and then it take a
picture<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> just

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
picture I just

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.930 
picture I just
snap<00:02:04.870> a<00:02:04.900> button<00:02:05.230> and<00:02:05.410> you<00:02:05.620> see<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
snap a button and you see it to the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.389 
snap a button and you see it to the
picture<00:02:07.120> let<00:02:07.390> me<00:02:07.680> give<00:02:08.680> you<00:02:08.770> another<00:02:08.800> look<00:02:09.220> at

okay<00:02:17.490> pretty<00:02:18.490> cool<00:02:18.670> huh<00:02:18.900> it's<00:02:19.900> called<00:02:20.140> a

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
okay pretty cool huh it's called a

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.110 
okay pretty cool huh it's called a
remote<00:02:20.470> viewfinder<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.280> just<00:02:21.460> how<00:02:21.550> remote<00:02:21.910> can

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
remote viewfinder so just how remote can

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.910 
remote viewfinder so just how remote can
you<00:02:22.210> get<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.630> put<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.080> camera<00:02:23.410> on<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.560> Android

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
you get I put the camera on the Android

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.080 
you get I put the camera on the Android
on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.100> other<00:02:24.280> side<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.580> room<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.030> I'm

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
on the other side of the room so I'm

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.440 
on the other side of the room so I'm
gonna<00:02:25.240> zoom<00:02:25.570> in<00:02:25.750> now<00:02:26.610> okay<00:02:27.610> see<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:27.940> moves

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
gonna zoom in now okay see this moves

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.260 
gonna zoom in now okay see this moves
I'll<00:02:28.990> take<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> picture<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:30.820> might<00:02:30.970> not<00:02:31.120> have

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
I'll take a picture you might not have

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.940 
I'll take a picture you might not have
heard<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.570> shutter<00:02:31.810> speed<00:02:32.230> but<00:02:32.620> as<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:32.830> can

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
heard the shutter speed but as you can

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.400 
heard the shutter speed but as you can
see<00:02:33.100> from<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.340> screen<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.850> saving<00:02:34.570> as<00:02:34.720> far

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
see from the screen it is saving as far

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.170 
see from the screen it is saving as far
as<00:02:35.560> distance<00:02:35.950> goes<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.520> have<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.850> be<00:02:37.000> within

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
as distance goes you have to be within

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.760 
as distance goes you have to be within
close<00:02:37.510> range<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:38.110> not<00:02:38.230> going<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.410> work<00:02:38.500> long

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
close range it's not going to work long

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.120 
close range it's not going to work long
range<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.250> was<00:02:39.640> able<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.970> get<00:02:40.090> about<00:02:40.650> 40<00:02:41.650> feet<00:02:41.920> to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
range I was able to get about 40 feet to

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.490 
range I was able to get about 40 feet to
give<00:02:42.310> or<00:02:42.430> take<00:02:42.780> for<00:02:43.780> those<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.110> not<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:44.470> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
give or take for those of you not on the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.680 
give or take for those of you not on the
imperial<00:02:45.010> system<00:02:45.250> it's<00:02:45.820> going<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.180> be<00:02:46.360> about

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
imperial system it's going to be about

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.949 
imperial system it's going to be about
12<00:02:47.230> meters<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.709> think<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.640> try<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.390> out<00:02:49.690> as<00:02:49.930> long

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
12 meters I think so try it out as long

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.540 
12 meters I think so try it out as long
as<00:02:50.140> you're<00:02:50.350> within<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.830> reasonable<00:02:51.040> amount<00:02:51.310> of

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
as you're within a reasonable amount of

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.400 
as you're within a reasonable amount of
distance<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:52.120> should<00:02:52.420> be<00:02:52.600> able<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.959> continue

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
distance you should be able to continue

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.949 
distance you should be able to continue
to<00:02:53.709> use<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.220> remote<00:02:54.520> viewfinder<00:02:54.959> otherwise

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
to use the remote viewfinder otherwise

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.690 
to use the remote viewfinder otherwise
you're<00:02:56.380> going<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.590> fall<00:02:56.800> out<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.070> range<00:02:57.430> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
you're going to fall out of range and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.990 
you're going to fall out of range and
the<00:02:57.820> connection<00:02:58.209> will<00:02:58.330> drop<00:02:59.190> now<00:03:00.190> as<00:03:00.520> far<00:03:00.940> as

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
the connection will drop now as far as

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.060 
the connection will drop now as far as
practicality<00:03:01.780> goes<00:03:01.990> you<00:03:02.410> know<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.770> might<00:03:02.950> be

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
practicality goes you know this might be

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.590 
practicality goes you know this might be
good<00:03:03.220> for<00:03:03.280> family<00:03:03.970> portraits<00:03:04.420> or

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
good for family portraits or
