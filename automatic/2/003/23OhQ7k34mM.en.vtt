Friends engines we were impressed that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.650 
Friends engines we were impressed that
smaller<00:02:45.160> children<00:02:45.700> will<00:02:45.880> be<00:02:46.030> able<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.360> pick

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
smaller children will be able to pick

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.290 
smaller children will be able to pick
these<00:02:46.900> units<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.830> without<00:02:48.550> having<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.030> worry

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
these units up without having to worry

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.960 
these units up without having to worry
about<00:02:49.480> damaging<00:02:49.959> or<00:02:50.440> smaller<00:02:50.799> pieces<00:02:51.130> falling

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
about damaging or smaller pieces falling

about damaging or smaller pieces falling
apart<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:53.110> tender<00:02:53.500> fits<00:02:53.769> on<00:02:54.010> just<00:02:54.430> with<00:02:54.610> a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
apart the tender fits on just with a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.210 
apart the tender fits on just with a
metal<00:02:55.030> pole<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:56.110> goes<00:02:56.170> into<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.799> hole<00:02:56.980> and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
metal pole that goes into the hole and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.920 
metal pole that goes into the hole and
then<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.880> course<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.299> tender<00:02:58.569> can<00:02:58.750> just

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
then of course the tender can just

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.890 
then of course the tender can just
easily<00:02:59.260> sit<00:02:59.590> on<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.799> track<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:01.239> tender<00:03:01.660> looks

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
easily sit on the track the tender looks

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.339 
easily sit on the track the tender looks
great<00:03:02.410> right<00:03:03.010> behind<00:03:03.610> Emily<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.569> if<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.110> take

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
great right behind Emily and if you take

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.809 
great right behind Emily and if you take
a<00:03:05.380> good<00:03:05.650> look<00:03:06.010> at<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.430> can<00:03:06.580> see<00:03:06.790> that

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
a good look at it you can see that

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.759 
a good look at it you can see that
they've<00:03:07.150> added<00:03:07.510> appropriate<00:03:08.019> detail<00:03:08.410> for<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
they've added appropriate detail for the

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.470 
they've added appropriate detail for the
wheels<00:03:09.040> now<00:03:09.670> one<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.060> things<00:03:10.269> I've<00:03:10.450> done

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
wheels now one of the things I've done

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.839 
wheels now one of the things I've done
here<00:03:11.200> like<00:03:11.530> they<00:03:11.709> did<00:03:11.950> with<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.190> Emily

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
here like they did with the Emily

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.720 
here like they did with the Emily
coaches<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:14.680> if<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:14.890> take<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.250> look<00:03:15.610> at

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
coaches is that if you take a look at

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.850 
coaches is that if you take a look at
the<00:03:15.880> wheels<00:03:16.209> on<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.750> bottom<00:03:17.019> you'll<00:03:17.470> see<00:03:17.709> that

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
the wheels on the bottom you'll see that

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.800 
the wheels on the bottom you'll see that
the<00:03:18.010> middle<00:03:18.370> wheel<00:03:18.549> does<00:03:18.819> not<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.299> flange

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
the middle wheel does not have a flange

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.380 
the middle wheel does not have a flange
and<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.769> allows<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.400> unit<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.790> go<00:03:22.030> around

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
and this allows the unit to go around

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.630 
and this allows the unit to go around
tighter<00:03:22.810> curves<00:03:23.290> without<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.400> possibility

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
tighter curves without the possibility

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.750 
tighter curves without the possibility

that are added are nice because they

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.509

interested<00:04:01.570> in<00:04:02.260> large-scale<00:04:02.620> this<00:04:03.610> would<00:04:03.790> be

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
interested in large-scale this would be

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.670 
interested in large-scale this would be
one<00:04:04.150> of<00:04:04.240> the<00:04:04.360> units<00:04:04.750> that<00:04:04.840> would<00:04:05.050> really<00:04:05.320> turn

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
one of the units that would really turn

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:16.550 
one of the units that would really turn
their<00:04:06.010> heads

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.069 

let's<00:04:17.190> take<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.430> for<00:04:17.670> a<00:04:17.730> test<00:04:18.060> run<00:04:18.299> inside<00:04:18.900> our

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
let's take it for a test run inside our

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.990 
let's take it for a test run inside our
studio<00:04:19.380> as<00:04:21.590> we<00:04:22.590> do<00:04:22.800> with<00:04:23.100> a<00:04:23.130> lot<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.639> units

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
studio as we do with a lot of the units

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.300 
studio as we do with a lot of the units
let's<00:04:24.210> take<00:04:24.480> this<00:04:24.660> up<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.930> six<00:04:25.290> volts<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.740> then

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
let's take this up to six volts and then

00:04:26.310 --> 00:05:32.380 
let's take this up to six volts and then
to<00:04:26.460> 12<00:04:26.760> volts<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.300> then<00:04:27.990> higher

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.480 

we<00:05:33.390> thought<00:05:33.630> we<00:05:33.870> would<00:05:34.200> run<00:05:34.710> it<00:05:34.860> again<00:05:35.250> this

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
we thought we would run it again this

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.700 
we thought we would run it again this
time<00:05:35.760> going<00:05:36.060> very<00:05:36.570> slow<00:05:36.990> to<00:05:37.050> see<00:05:37.380> how<00:05:37.530> it

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
time going very slow to see how it

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.920 
time going very slow to see how it
started<00:05:38.160> and<00:05:38.280> then<00:05:38.730> to<00:05:38.850> see<00:05:39.030> how<00:05:39.210> well<00:05:39.450> it<00:05:39.600> ran

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
started and then to see how well it ran

00:05:39.930 --> 00:06:35.850 
started and then to see how well it ran
going<00:05:40.530> slow<00:05:41.100> as<00:05:41.430> it<00:05:42.030> started<00:05:42.540> to<00:05:42.600> stop

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.189 

and<00:06:36.090> the<00:06:37.090> part<00:06:37.330> that<00:06:37.389> you've<00:06:37.629> been<00:06:37.780> waiting

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
and the part that you've been waiting

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.920 
and the part that you've been waiting
for<00:06:38.229> let's<00:06:38.919> take<00:06:39.159> a<00:06:39.189> look<00:06:39.430> at<00:06:39.550> Emily<00:06:39.969> and<00:06:40.270> her

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
for let's take a look at Emily and her

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.409 
for let's take a look at Emily and her
