00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
now the key to feeding is definitely a

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.580 
now the key to feeding is definitely a
variety<00:00:11.469> of<00:00:11.980> various<00:00:12.969> pellets<00:00:13.389> flakes<00:00:14.139> and

variety of various pellets flakes and

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.070 
variety of various pellets flakes and
frozen<00:00:15.309> foods<00:00:15.610> now<00:00:16.150> the<00:00:16.209> high-end<00:00:16.689> protein

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
frozen foods now the high-end protein

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.839 
frozen foods now the high-end protein
foods<00:00:17.410> do<00:00:17.650> make<00:00:17.890> the<00:00:18.040> fish<00:00:18.220> grow<00:00:18.490> very<00:00:18.759> quickly

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
foods do make the fish grow very quickly

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.910 
foods do make the fish grow very quickly
but<00:00:19.720> it<00:00:19.810> does<00:00:19.990> tend<00:00:20.230> to<00:00:20.349> increase<00:00:20.680> their

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
but it does tend to increase their

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.620 
but it does tend to increase their
aggression<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.820> last<00:00:22.029> thing<00:00:22.240> you<00:00:22.330> want<00:00:22.509> is

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
aggression the last thing you want is

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.940 
aggression the last thing you want is
something<00:00:22.840> that's<00:00:22.960> really<00:00:23.349> going<00:00:23.470> to<00:00:23.560> spark

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
something that's really going to spark

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.889 
something that's really going to spark
the<00:00:24.130> aggression<00:00:24.580> in<00:00:24.730> them<00:00:24.880> makes<00:00:25.540> them<00:00:25.630> turn

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:25.899 
the aggression in them makes them turn

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.200 
the aggression in them makes them turn
on<00:00:26.110> each<00:00:26.259> other<00:00:26.439> more<00:00:26.739> regularly<00:00:27.189> so<00:00:27.520> if<00:00:27.939> we

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
on each other more regularly so if we

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.109 
on each other more regularly so if we

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.540 
feed all-purpose foods and veggie based
foods<00:00:31.480> we're<00:00:31.869> in<00:00:32.050> better<00:00:32.290> stead<00:00:32.680> than<00:00:33.160> feeding

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
foods we're in better stead than feeding

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.430 
foods we're in better stead than feeding
the<00:00:33.640> high-protein<00:00:34.090> ones<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.899> fish<00:00:35.079> tend<00:00:35.320> to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
the high-protein ones the fish tend to

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.440 
the high-protein ones the fish tend to
grow<00:00:35.620> quickly<00:00:35.920> anyway<00:00:36.460> so<00:00:37.030> I<00:00:37.059> wouldn't<00:00:37.300> be<00:00:37.420> too

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
grow quickly anyway so I wouldn't be too

the way to go for selections of food now
the<00:01:25.750> amounts<00:01:26.350> of<00:01:26.470> foods<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:26.979> next<00:01:27.340> thing

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
the amounts of foods is the next thing

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.490 
the amounts of foods is the next thing
the<00:01:27.820> thirty<00:01:28.180> second<00:01:28.630> rule<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:28.960> good<00:01:29.229> guide

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
the thirty second rule is a good guide

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.590 
the thirty second rule is a good guide
feed<00:01:30.310> your<00:01:30.490> fish<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.880> put<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.090> little<00:01:31.270> bit<00:01:31.450> of

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
much in good stead you usually feed your

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.340 
much in good stead you usually feed your

fish five or six times a week

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.140 
fish five or six times a week
generally<00:01:48.250> better<00:01:48.430> to<00:01:48.549> feed<00:01:48.820> them<00:01:49.000> in<00:01:49.119> the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
generally better to feed them in the

generally better to feed them in the
morning<00:01:49.479> because<00:01:49.840> they<00:01:50.049> use<00:01:50.260> most<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.740> their

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
morning because they use most of their

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.740 
morning because they use most of their
energy<00:01:51.220> during<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.580> day<00:01:51.700> so<00:01:52.330> you<00:01:52.390> pretty<00:01:52.659> much

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
energy during the day so you pretty much

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.780 
energy during the day so you pretty much
go<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.049> feed<00:01:53.290> them<00:01:53.439> every<00:01:53.560> day<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.100> if<00:01:54.700> you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
go to feed them every day and if you

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.310 
go to feed them every day and if you
forget<00:01:55.090> once<00:01:55.299> or<00:01:55.450> twice<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.659> week<00:01:55.930> then<00:01:56.080> that's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
forget once or twice a week then that's

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.590 
forget once or twice a week then that's
fine<00:01:56.590> if<00:01:57.010> you<00:01:57.280> see<00:01:57.520> your<00:01:57.700> fish<00:01:57.939> are<00:01:58.119> getting<00:01:58.390> a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
fine if you see your fish are getting a

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.300 
fine if you see your fish are getting a
little<00:01:58.720> bit<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.110> belly<00:01:59.320> then<00:01:59.830> definitely

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
little bit of a belly then definitely

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.859 
little bit of a belly then definitely
reduce<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.880> amount<00:02:01.119> of<00:02:01.210> food<00:02:01.420> that's<00:02:01.600> going

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
reduce the amount of food that's going

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.050 
reduce the amount of food that's going
into<00:02:01.990> your<00:02:02.170> aquarium<00:02:02.439> if<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:03.280> see<00:02:03.580> that

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
into your aquarium if you see that

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.730 
into your aquarium if you see that
they're<00:02:04.270> getting<00:02:04.299> thin<00:02:04.930> then<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.560> definitely

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
they're getting thin then you definitely

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.499 
they're getting thin then you definitely
want<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.159> increase<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.759> amount<00:02:06.939> of<00:02:07.090> food<00:02:07.299> that

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
want to increase the amount of food that

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.119 
want to increase the amount of food that
going<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.930> aquarium<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.439> you<00:02:08.830> really

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
going in the aquarium and you really

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.309 
going in the aquarium and you really
want<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.369> take<00:02:09.549> that<00:02:09.849> by<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.330> average<00:02:10.929> fish

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
want to take that by the average fish

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.170 
want to take that by the average fish
