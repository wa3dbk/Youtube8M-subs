down<00:01:01.469> onto<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.039> modeling<00:01:02.430> clay<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:04.379> just

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
down onto the modeling clay and I'm just

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.660 
down onto the modeling clay and I'm just
going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> check<00:01:05.100> he's<00:01:05.400> nice<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.970> secure<00:01:06.420> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
then we're going to get the jar and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.800 
then we're going to get the jar and
we're<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> fill<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.310> halfway<00:01:12.119> with

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
we're going to fill it halfway with

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.249 
we're going to fill it halfway with
glycerine<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> pour<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:16.020> there

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
glycerine so pour all of that in there

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.730 
glycerine so pour all of that in there
and<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.460> will<00:01:17.640> make<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> glitter<00:01:18.439> float<00:01:19.439> in

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and this will make the glitter float in

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.880 
and this will make the glitter float in
the<00:01:19.830> jar<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.229> then<00:01:22.229> you're<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> fill

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the jar and then you're going to fill

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.130 
the jar and then you're going to fill
the<00:01:23.009> rest<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> jar<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.090> water<00:01:24.420> now

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the rest of the jar up with water now

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
the rest of the jar up with water now
grown-ups<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> might<00:01:25.979> need<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.549> help<00:01:26.759> with

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
this because you want to fill it up

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.600 
this because you want to fill it up
until<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.329> full<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.950> there's<00:01:32.159> no<00:01:32.340> air

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
until it's full so there's no air

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.910 
until it's full so there's no air
bubbles<00:01:33.060> at<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.210> top<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.439> see<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
bubbles at the top and you can see the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.069 
bubbles at the top and you can see the
water's<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.490> slightly<00:01:35.939> murky<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.869> this

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
water's going slightly murky but this

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.640 
water's going slightly murky but this
will<00:01:37.380> clear<00:01:37.979> very<00:01:38.549> shortly<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> next

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
will clear very shortly so the next

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.310 
will clear very shortly so the next
thing<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.340> pour<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.509> glitter<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.049> the

thing to do is pour the glitter and the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.580 
thing to do is pour the glitter and the
sparklies<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.329> about<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.570> teaspoon<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.439> each

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
sparklies in so about a teaspoon of each

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.679 
sparklies in so about a teaspoon of each
I'm<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.460> put<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> glitter<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.270> first

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
I'm going to put the glitter in first

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.499 
I'm going to put the glitter in first
and<00:01:49.200> pour<00:01:49.799> about<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.009> teaspoon<00:01:50.670> into<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> jar

and it goes and then get about the same
amount<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.340> sparklies

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
amount of sparklies
