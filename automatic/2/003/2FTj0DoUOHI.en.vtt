booted down the bargain bin and the good

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.210 
booted down the bargain bin and the good
solid<00:02:38.070> games<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.450> system<00:02:39.930> will<00:02:40.410> stay<00:02:41.010> at

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
solid games for that system will stay at

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.340 
solid games for that system will stay at
a<00:02:41.280> higher<00:02:41.430> price<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:42.150> think<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> orange<00:02:43.080> box

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
a higher price like think the orange box

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.490 
a higher price like think the orange box
for<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.709> xbox<00:02:44.280> 360<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:44.970> still<00:02:45.180> 40<00:02:45.510> bucks<00:02:45.720> where

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
for the xbox 360 is still 40 bucks where

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.280 
for the xbox 360 is still 40 bucks where
you<00:02:46.770> can<00:02:46.890> get<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> pc<00:02:47.490> version<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.330> for

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
you can get the pc version of it for

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.750 
you can get the pc version of it for
about<00:02:49.440> 25<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.760> saw<00:02:51.390> at<00:02:51.600> best<00:02:51.810> buy<00:02:52.020> on<00:02:52.050> sale<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.920> I

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
about 25 I saw at best buy on sale and I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.380 
about 25 I saw at best buy on sale and I
know<00:02:53.910> it's<00:02:54.209> cheaper<00:02:54.600> at<00:02:54.690> other<00:02:54.810> places<00:02:55.110> so

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
know it's cheaper at other places so

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.990 
know it's cheaper at other places so
that's<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.480> brand<00:02:57.750> new<00:02:57.990> still<00:02:58.800> got<00:02:59.760> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
that's a brand new still got the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.760 
that's a brand new still got the
cellophane<00:03:00.390> wrapping<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.080> not<00:03:01.200> everything

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
cellophane wrapping on it not everything

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.050 
cellophane wrapping on it not everything
game<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.080> think<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:05.520> all<00:03:05.730> depends

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
game and so I think that it all depends

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.240 
game and so I think that it all depends
on<00:03:06.209> where<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.450> want<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.690> make<00:03:06.900> your<00:03:07.250> trade

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
on where you want to make your trade

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.920 
on where you want to make your trade
offs<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.670> how<00:03:09.000> long<00:03:09.330> you're<00:03:09.480> willing<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.780> wait

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
offs and how long you're willing to wait

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.120 
offs and how long you're willing to wait
for<00:03:10.110> games<00:03:10.290> like<00:03:12.470> console<00:03:13.470> gamers<00:03:13.769> tend<00:03:13.980> to

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
for games like console gamers tend to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.070 
for games like console gamers tend to
pay<00:03:14.310> more<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.330> long<00:03:15.540> run<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:16.910> well<00:03:18.080> more

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
pay more in the long run and well more

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.870 
pay more in the long run and well more
overtime<00:03:20.180> no<00:03:21.180> not<00:03:21.450> mr.<00:03:21.570> more<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.320> they<00:03:22.410> pay

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
overtime no not mr. more but they pay

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.150 
overtime no not mr. more but they pay
more<00:03:23.880> incrementally<00:03:24.239> over<00:03:24.600> time<00:03:25.019> then<00:03:25.650> pc

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
more incrementally over time then pc

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.100 
more incrementally over time then pc
gamers<00:03:26.580> probably<00:03:27.030> do<00:03:27.120> on<00:03:27.330> one<00:03:27.750> big<00:03:27.930> lump

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
gamers probably do on one big lump

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.710 
gamers probably do on one big lump
because<00:03:28.440> pc<00:03:28.739> gamers<00:03:29.010> pay<00:03:29.519> for<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.030> entire<00:03:30.150> pc

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
because pc gamers pay for the entire pc

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.800 
because pc gamers pay for the entire pc

stuff all in one big lump where as or as
console<00:03:39.630> gamers<00:03:39.930> by<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.470> system<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.250> then<00:03:41.820> by

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
console gamers by the system and then by

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.580 
console gamers by the system and then by
have<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.420> buy<00:03:42.570> all<00:03:42.600> these<00:03:42.870> peripherals<00:03:43.470> like

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
have to buy all these peripherals like

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.290 
have to buy all these peripherals like
the<00:03:44.010> extra<00:03:44.280> controllers<00:03:44.820> if<00:03:44.970> they<00:03:45.090> want<00:03:45.269> to

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
the extra controllers if they want to

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.380 
the extra controllers if they want to
put<00:03:46.050> friends<00:03:46.500> one<00:03:46.680> spot<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.790> probably<00:03:48.209> going

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
put friends one spot it probably going

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.030 
put friends one spot it probably going
to<00:03:48.450> bind<00:03:48.630> upgrade<00:03:48.989> TV<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.560> then<00:03:49.890> they<00:03:50.010> are

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
to bind upgrade TV and then they are

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.220 
to bind upgrade TV and then they are
always<00:03:50.370> going<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.030> pay<00:03:51.330> a<00:03:51.360> higher<00:03:51.840> price<00:03:52.170> for

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
always going to pay a higher price for

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.710 
always going to pay a higher price for
games<00:03:52.709> i<00:03:53.010> know<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.820> when<00:03:54.000> games<00:03:54.420> come<00:03:54.600> out

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
games i know that when games come out

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.210 
games i know that when games come out
there<00:03:54.870> probably<00:03:55.110> about<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.380> same<00:03:55.590> price<00:03:55.920> for

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
there probably about the same price for

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.820 
there probably about the same price for
both<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.209> pc<00:03:57.720> games<00:03:57.959> turn<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.560> value

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
both a pc games turn to the value

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.710 
both a pc games turn to the value
quickly<00:03:59.190> quicker<00:03:59.820> so<00:04:00.120> if<00:04:00.180> you're<00:04:00.330> willing<00:04:00.690> to

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
quickly quicker so if you're willing to

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.560 
quickly quicker so if you're willing to
wait<00:04:00.900> for<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.110> game<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:02.010> really<00:04:02.340> doesn't<00:04:02.820> make

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
wait for the game it really doesn't make

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.020 
wait for the game it really doesn't make
much<00:04:03.810> sense<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:04.410> buy<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.739> on<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> console<00:04:05.610> versus

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
much sense to buy it on a console versus

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.640 
much sense to buy it on a console versus
the<00:04:06.120> pc<00:04:06.450> because<00:04:06.810> we<00:04:06.900> can<00:04:07.019> plan<00:04:07.200> on<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.380> pc

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
the pc because we can plan on the pc

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.610 
the pc because we can plan on the pc
ain't<00:04:07.799> no<00:04:07.890> run<00:04:08.160> on<00:04:08.310> your<00:04:08.430> system<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.060> mean<00:04:09.720> it's

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
ain't no run on your system I mean it's

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.420 
ain't no run on your system I mean it's
going<00:04:11.250> to

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
going to

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.640 
going to
be<00:04:12.000> just<00:04:12.269> fine<00:04:12.510> it's<00:04:13.109> going<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.319> be<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:13.469> same

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
be just fine it's going to be the same

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.830 
be just fine it's going to be the same
experience<00:04:14.159> except<00:04:14.969> for<00:04:15.150> me<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.420> multiplayer

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840

aspect<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.759> that's<00:04:17.759> something<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.239> can<00:04:18.539> be

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
aspect and that's something that can be

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.450
