00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
with any type of ziploc bag we found was

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.060 
with any type of ziploc bag we found was
the<00:01:50.159> extraction<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.880> arrows<00:01:51.330> it<00:01:51.509> block<00:01:51.720> bag

wouldn't<00:01:53.070> hold<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.580> vacuum<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:54.990> we

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
wouldn't hold a vacuum but what we

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.040 
wouldn't hold a vacuum but what we
discovered<00:01:55.649> was<00:01:55.680> if<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.729> air<00:01:56.970> was<00:01:57.180> evacuated

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
discovered was if the air was evacuated

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.870 
discovered was if the air was evacuated
in<00:01:58.200> conjunction<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.270> oil<00:02:00.270> being<00:02:00.810> applied<00:02:01.880> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
in conjunction with oil being applied to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.440 
in conjunction with oil being applied to
the<00:02:03.060> zipper<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:04.460> oil<00:02:05.460> would<00:02:05.880> prevent<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.299> air

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the zipper the oil would prevent the air

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.870 
the zipper the oil would prevent the air
molecules<00:02:07.080> from<00:02:07.259> escaping<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> bag

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
molecules from escaping and in the bag

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.710 
molecules from escaping and in the bag
and<00:02:09.090> hold<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.390> vacuum<00:02:10.220> also<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:14.720> on

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and hold the vacuum also to on this on

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720

the<00:02:15.930> vacuum<00:02:16.260> sealing<00:02:16.739> device<00:02:17.370> what<00:02:17.610> we

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
the vacuum sealing device what we

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.100 
the vacuum sealing device what we
actually<00:02:18.420> took<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.810> can<00:02:19.080> over<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.760> housed<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
actually took a can over and housed the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.440 
actually took a can over and housed the
switch<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.040> motor<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:24.060> know<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.239> pump

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450

and everything within a can opener which

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.580 
and everything within a can opener which
got<00:02:26.700> me<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.940> thinking<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.480> it's<00:02:28.050> possible

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
got me to thinking that it's possible

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.949 
got me to thinking that it's possible
that<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:28.920> could<00:02:29.209> incorporate<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.810> them

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
that you could incorporate it to them

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.360 
that you could incorporate it to them
one<00:02:31.140> product<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.010> out<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
one product if it's it out on the
