all<00:02:53.879> right<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.599> here<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:54.840> what<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.319> ended<00:02:55.620> up

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
all right so here is what we ended up

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.899 
all right so here is what we ended up
with<00:02:56.629> it<00:02:57.629> was<00:02:57.840> actually<00:02:58.200> pretty<00:02:58.409> darn<00:02:58.950> easy<00:02:59.459> I

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
with it was actually pretty darn easy I

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.490 
with it was actually pretty darn easy I
mean<00:03:00.090> considering<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:01.049> never<00:03:01.260> used

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
mean considering that I have never used

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.069 
mean considering that I have never used
the<00:03:01.709> tailoring<00:03:02.159> square<00:03:02.489> before<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.810> had<00:03:03.930> to

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
the tailoring square before and I had to

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.380 
the tailoring square before and I had to
look<00:03:04.230> at<00:03:04.409> the<00:03:04.530> differently<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.099> 2/3<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.000> 1/3

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
look at the differently like 2/3 and 1/3

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.170 
look at the differently like 2/3 and 1/3
1/6<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.470> force<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.010> everything

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
1/6 and force and everything

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.420 
1/6 and force and everything
it<00:03:09.480> actually<00:03:09.720> was<00:03:10.109> pretty<00:03:10.440> intuitive<00:03:11.099> in<00:03:11.220> fact

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
it actually was pretty intuitive in fact

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.160 
it actually was pretty intuitive in fact
there<00:03:11.579> was<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.730> couple<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.150> thing<00:03:12.299> I<00:03:12.420> noticed

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
there was a couple of thing I noticed

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.869 
there was a couple of thing I noticed
that<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.379> can<00:03:13.560> do<00:03:13.739> with<00:03:14.040> tailoring<00:03:14.549> square

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
that you can do with tailoring square

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.750 
that you can do with tailoring square
that<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.150> can't<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:16.620> illustrator<00:03:17.190> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
that you can't do with illustrator and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.250 
that you can't do with illustrator and
vice<00:03:18.209> versa<00:03:18.569> which<00:03:18.959> I'll<00:03:19.140> get<00:03:19.290> into<00:03:19.470> later<00:03:19.680> but

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
vice versa which I'll get into later but

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.069 
vice versa which I'll get into later but
it<00:03:22.260> came<00:03:22.500> out<00:03:22.680> pretty<00:03:22.920> pretty<00:03:23.549> precise<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.480> used

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
it came out pretty pretty precise I used

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.369 
it came out pretty pretty precise I used

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
newest revision the the hardest part was

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.400 
newest revision the the hardest part was
coming<00:03:53.970> up<00:03:54.090> with<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.389> side<00:03:54.629> body<00:03:54.900> panel

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
coming up with the side body panel

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.250 
coming up with the side body panel
actually<00:03:56.150> because<00:03:57.150> not<00:03:57.510> only<00:03:57.540> do<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.900> have<00:03:58.139> to

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
actually because not only do I have to

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.759 
actually because not only do I have to
use<00:03:58.440> fractions<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.609> the<00:04:00.299> waist<00:04:00.930> surplus<00:04:01.530> which

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
use fractions of the waist surplus which

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.569 
use fractions of the waist surplus which
is<00:04:01.919> in<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.160> front<00:04:02.389> but<00:04:03.389> also<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.340> curves<00:04:05.340> were

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
is in the front but also the curves were

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.909 
is in the front but also the curves were
a<00:04:05.879> little<00:04:06.209> bit<00:04:06.389> interesting<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.109> do<00:04:07.260> freehand

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
a little bit interesting to do freehand

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.430 
a little bit interesting to do freehand
in<00:04:08.340> Illustrator<00:04:09.060> I'm<00:04:09.299> able<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.599> get<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.199> pin

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
in Illustrator I'm able to get the pin

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.949 
in Illustrator I'm able to get the pin
tool<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.010> move<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.849> arc<00:04:12.090> back<00:04:12.419> and<00:04:12.690> forth

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
tool and move the the arc back and forth

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.349 
tool and move the the arc back and forth
and<00:04:13.230> pivot<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:13.859> get<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.489> precise<00:04:14.910> but<00:04:15.150> here

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
and pivot it and get it precise but here

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.879 
and pivot it and get it precise but here
I<00:04:15.389> had<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:15.900> actually<00:04:16.139> you<00:04:16.349> know<00:04:16.560> draw<00:04:16.829> it

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
I had to like actually you know draw it

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.770 
I had to like actually you know draw it
so<00:04:18.620> but<00:04:19.620> honestly<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.760> was<00:04:21.120> really<00:04:21.419> easy<00:04:21.570> it

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
so but honestly it was really easy it

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.659 
so but honestly it was really easy it
took<00:04:21.900> about<00:04:22.049> an<00:04:22.289> hour<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.740> half<00:04:22.919> but<00:04:23.550> that's

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
took about an hour and a half but that's

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.270 
took about an hour and a half but that's
ok<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.120> mean<00:04:24.389> this<00:04:24.539> is<00:04:24.660> my<00:04:24.750> first<00:04:24.990> time<00:04:25.199> it<00:04:26.010> came

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
ok I mean this is my first time it came

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.129 
ok I mean this is my first time it came
out<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.690> made<00:04:28.050> one<00:04:28.289> small<00:04:28.590> mistake<00:04:29.250> here

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
out the I made one small mistake here

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.050 
out the I made one small mistake here
which<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.349> was<00:04:31.740> able<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.070> rub<00:04:32.610> out<00:04:32.789> pretty

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
which I was able to rub out pretty

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.839 
which I was able to rub out pretty
easily<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.720> put<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.349> number<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.740> point<00:04:35.190> number<00:04:35.430> 19

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
easily I put a number a point number 19

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.450 
easily I put a number a point number 19
a<00:04:36.090> little<00:04:36.419> bit<00:04:36.510> too<00:04:36.659> far<00:04:36.870> back<00:04:37.340> other<00:04:38.340> than

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
a little bit too far back other than

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.770 
a little bit too far back other than
that<00:04:38.820> pretty<00:04:39.599> straightforward<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:41.090> yeah<00:04:42.090> I'd

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
that pretty straightforward so yeah I'd

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.860 
that pretty straightforward so yeah I'd
say<00:04:43.139> it's<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.409> success<00:04:43.909> I'd<00:04:44.909> say<00:04:45.300> it's<00:04:45.570> a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
say it's a success I'd say it's a

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.990 
say it's a success I'd say it's a
success<00:04:45.930> that's<00:04:46.830> how<00:04:47.070> I'm<00:04:47.280> supposed<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.729> say

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
success that's how I'm supposed to say

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.159 
success that's how I'm supposed to say
these<00:04:48.180> words<00:04:48.449> when<00:04:48.720> I'm<00:04:48.840> talking<00:04:49.530> on<00:04:49.880> video

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
these words when I'm talking on video

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.990 
these words when I'm talking on video
and<00:04:52.169> I<00:04:52.289> noticed<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:52.860> have<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.219> tendency<00:04:53.760> of

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
and I noticed I have a tendency of

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.940 
and I noticed I have a tendency of
blinking<00:04:54.630> my<00:04:54.840> eye<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:55.050> lot

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
blinking my eye a lot

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.020 
blinking my eye a lot
I'm<00:04:56.010> wondering<00:04:56.250> if<00:04:56.370> that's<00:04:56.580> because<00:04:56.700> I<00:04:56.850> need

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
I'm wondering if that's because I need

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.140 
I'm wondering if that's because I need
glasses<00:04:57.240> but<00:04:57.690> anyway<00:04:58.470> so<00:04:58.530> yeah<00:04:59.000> it<00:05:00.000> was

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150
