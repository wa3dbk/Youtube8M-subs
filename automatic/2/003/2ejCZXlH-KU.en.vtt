charisma kermit ma the 15 in the sixteen

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.469 
charisma kermit ma the 15 in the sixteen
will<00:04:19.739> go<00:04:19.949> into<00:04:20.099> dexterity<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:20.880> intelligence

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
will go into dexterity and intelligence

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.300 
will go into dexterity and intelligence
and<00:04:21.690> dexterity<00:04:21.989> is<00:04:22.289> helpful<00:04:22.800> for<00:04:22.979> warriors

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
and dexterity is helpful for warriors

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.500 
and dexterity is helpful for warriors
since<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.699> does<00:04:23.849> make<00:04:24.060> dodging<00:04:24.419> attacks

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
since it does make dodging attacks

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.629 
since it does make dodging attacks
easier<00:04:25.139> but<00:04:25.620> intelligence<00:04:26.160> is<00:04:26.310> good<00:04:26.460> for

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
easier but intelligence is good for

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.040 
easier but intelligence is good for
skills<00:04:26.910> which<00:04:27.270> are<00:04:27.449> what<00:04:27.660> you<00:04:27.780> use<00:04:28.020> when

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050

rulebook<00:06:05.160> because<00:06:05.910> remember<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.720> role<00:06:07.020> in

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
rulebook because remember the role in

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.650 
rulebook because remember the role in
roleplay<00:06:07.800> is<00:06:08.070> when<00:06:08.400> you<00:06:08.550> roll<00:06:08.790> the<00:06:09.000> dice<00:06:09.270> and

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
roleplay is when you roll the dice and

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.840 
roleplay is when you roll the dice and
the<00:06:10.140> play<00:06:10.440> is<00:06:10.470> where<00:06:10.920> you<00:06:11.070> add<00:06:11.250> or<00:06:11.400> subtract

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
the play is where you add or subtract

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.610 
the play is where you add or subtract
modifiers<00:06:12.390> to<00:06:12.720> those<00:06:12.870> roles

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
modifiers to those roles

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.620 
modifiers to those roles

played and the play was playing that

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.430 
played and the play was playing that
