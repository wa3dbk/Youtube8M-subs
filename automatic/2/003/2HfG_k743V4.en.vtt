00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
something but in a lot of ways I can

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.960 
something but in a lot of ways I can
tell<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.439> it's<00:00:25.619> very<00:00:25.830> important<00:00:26.730> and

tell you that it's very important and
maybe<00:00:27.240> more<00:00:27.689> important<00:00:28.289> than<00:00:28.410> some<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.830> those

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
maybe more important than some of those

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.250 
maybe more important than some of those
flashy<00:00:30.060> concepts<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:33.329> basic<00:00:33.930> premise

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
flashy concepts so the basic premise

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.010 
flashy concepts so the basic premise
here<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.730> there's<00:00:35.969> two<00:00:36.300> sides<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
here is that there's two sides of the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.270 
here is that there's two sides of the
spectrum<00:00:37.489> with<00:00:38.489> left<00:00:39.180> hand<00:00:39.450> position<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:41.010> is

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
spectrum with left hand position one is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.900 
spectrum with left hand position one is
the<00:00:41.640> square<00:00:42.300> hand<00:00:42.780> position<00:00:43.469> with<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.610> thumb

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the square hand position with the thumb

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.520 
the square hand position with the thumb
behind<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:46.320> neck<00:00:47.149> fingers<00:00:48.230> parallel<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
behind the neck fingers parallel to the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.170 
behind the neck fingers parallel to the
frets<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.160> front<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> neck<00:00:51.649> curled<00:00:52.649> and

frets in front of the neck curled and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.939 
frets in front of the neck curled and
pressing<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.329> their<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:54.780> tips<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
pressing on their very tips as if the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.720 
pressing on their very tips as if the
bones<00:00:56.219> extended<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:58.050> swatting<00:00:58.770> flat<00:00:59.190> and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.840 

nice<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> curled<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.719> said<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> lot

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
nice and curled as I said that to a lot

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.719 
nice and curled as I said that to a lot
of<00:01:05.880> people<00:01:06.450> would<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:07.080> sort<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.860> classical

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
of people would be sort of classical

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.969 
of people would be sort of classical
hand<00:01:08.970> position<00:01:09.540> although<00:01:09.810> they're<00:01:10.590> certainly

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
hand position although they're certainly

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.700 
hand position although they're certainly
our<00:01:11.189> players<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:13.049> classical

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
our players that are not classical

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.310 
our players that are not classical
players<00:01:13.950> per<00:01:14.340> se<00:01:14.580> including<00:01:15.119> myself<00:01:15.689> that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
players per se including myself that

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
players per se including myself that
that<00:01:16.710> sometimes<00:01:17.280> lean<00:01:17.970> towards<00:01:18.360> playing<00:01:18.689> this

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
that sometimes lean towards playing this

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.640 
that sometimes lean towards playing this
way<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.890> saying<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> always<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.650> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
way not saying that I always do but the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.249 
way not saying that I always do but the
other<00:01:22.890> extreme<00:01:23.640> if<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.810> were<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> compare

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
other extreme if we were to compare

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.170 
other extreme if we were to compare
would<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> blues<00:01:26.759> hand

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
would be more like the blues hand

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.359 
would be more like the blues hand
position<00:01:27.689> or<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> rock<00:01:28.140> hand<00:01:28.530> position<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
position or the rock hand position and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.660 
position or the rock hand position and
in<00:01:30.210> popular<00:01:30.720> styles<00:01:31.290> I'm<00:01:31.560> quite<00:01:31.860> sure<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
in popular styles I'm quite sure that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.690 
in popular styles I'm quite sure that
most<00:01:33.479> people<00:01:33.930> play<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.439> way<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:35.369> more

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
most people play this way right more

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.420 
most people play this way right more
with<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> thumb<00:01:36.240> over<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:38.189> fingers

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
with the thumb over and the fingers

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.600 
with the thumb over and the fingers
angled<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> France<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:41.100> gives<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> lot

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
angled to the France it gives you a lot

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.789 
angled to the France it gives you a lot
of<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:41.790> strength<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.750> bending<00:01:43.200> especially

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
of good strength for bending especially

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.710 
of good strength for bending especially
if<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.399> playing<00:01:44.579> electric<00:01:45.240> which<00:01:45.420> I'm<00:01:45.570> not

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
if I was playing electric which I'm not

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.460 
if I was playing electric which I'm not
right<00:01:45.960> now<00:01:46.399> but<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.869> guess<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.049> very<00:01:49.229> natural

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
right now but I guess it's very natural

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.670 
right now but I guess it's very natural
to<00:01:49.950> grab<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.970> neck<00:01:51.149> from

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
to grab on to the neck from

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.330 
to grab on to the neck from
people<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:53.050> that<00:01:54.050> works<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.590> an<00:01:54.680> extent<00:01:55.070> to

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
people and that works to an extent to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.460 
people and that works to an extent to
there's<00:01:55.820> fabulous<00:01:56.450> players<00:01:56.750> of<00:01:56.990> course<00:01:57.260> that

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
there's fabulous players of course that

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.800 
there's fabulous players of course that
play<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:57.950> way<00:01:58.190> so<00:01:58.850> this<00:01:59.060> series<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.600> going<00:01:59.690> to

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
play that way so this series is going to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.560 
play that way so this series is going to
be<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.960> little<00:02:00.230> bit<00:02:00.440> about<00:02:00.970> or<00:02:01.970> really<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.390> lot

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
be a little bit about or really a lot

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.350 
be a little bit about or really a lot
bit<00:02:02.810> about<00:02:03.190> leaving<00:02:04.190> out<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.360> advantages

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
bit about leaving out the advantages

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.639 
bit about leaving out the advantages
between<00:02:05.990> one<00:02:06.170> hand<00:02:06.440> position<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.340> another<00:02:08.149> as

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
between one hand position and another as

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.010 
between one hand position and another as
usual<00:02:09.649> there<00:02:09.830> is<00:02:09.950> no<00:02:10.130> one<00:02:10.580> firm<00:02:11.060> 100%

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
usual there is no one firm 100%

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.320 
usual there is no one firm 100%
conclusion<00:02:12.680> about<00:02:12.770> what<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.250> do<00:02:13.520> but

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
conclusion about what to do but

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.940 
conclusion about what to do but
hopefully<00:02:14.720> by<00:02:14.900> thinking<00:02:15.350> about<00:02:15.680> these

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
hopefully by thinking about these

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.640 
hopefully by thinking about these
aspects<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.850> left<00:02:17.090> hand<00:02:17.360> position<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.440> will

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
aspects of left hand position it will

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.240 
aspects of left hand position it will
help<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.930> form<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.080> foundation<00:02:21.260> for<00:02:21.740> becoming

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
help you form a foundation for becoming

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.360 
help you form a foundation for becoming
a<00:02:22.430> better<00:02:22.580> player<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.380> being<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:25.040> first

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
a better player so this being the first

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.840 
a better player so this being the first
in<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.270> series<00:02:26.650> about<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.709> left<00:02:27.980> hand<00:02:28.280> position

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
in the series about a left hand position

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.970 
in the series about a left hand position
I<00:02:29.060> thought<00:02:29.900> we<00:02:30.110> would<00:02:30.230> start<00:02:30.380> with<00:02:30.739> something

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
I thought we would start with something

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.430 
I thought we would start with something
very<00:02:31.310> much<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.880> proper<00:02:32.540> classical<00:02:33.290> ish

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
very much on the proper classical ish

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.820 
very much on the proper classical ish
side<00:02:33.770> but<00:02:34.489> it's<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.700> very<00:02:34.730> cool<00:02:35.180> exercise<00:02:35.830> for

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
side but it's a very cool exercise for

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.710 
side but it's a very cool exercise for
everyone<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.310> think<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:38.000> get<00:02:38.180> their<00:02:38.360> fingers

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
everyone I think to get their fingers

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.380 
everyone I think to get their fingers
working<00:02:39.020> better<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.790> need<00:02:40.970> named<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
working better and I need named it the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:03:11.030 
working better and I need named it the
spider<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.230> think<00:02:42.560> you'll<00:02:42.739> see<00:02:42.980> why

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.700 

so<00:03:12.040> what<00:03:12.250> was<00:03:12.460> I<00:03:12.640> doing<00:03:12.900> well<00:03:13.900> you'll<00:03:14.320> notice

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
so what was I doing well you'll notice

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.430 
so what was I doing well you'll notice
that<00:03:14.910> every<00:03:15.910> finger<00:03:16.360> was<00:03:16.570> staying<00:03:16.840> one<00:03:17.170> per

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
that every finger was staying one per

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.650 
that every finger was staying one per
fret<00:03:17.770> we're<00:03:18.130> in<00:03:18.370> what's<00:03:18.730> called<00:03:19.120> open

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
fret we're in what's called open

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.050 
fret we're in what's called open
position<00:03:20.200> which<00:03:20.380> is<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:21.070> first<00:03:21.310> four<00:03:21.640> frets

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
position which is the first four frets

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.510 
position which is the first four frets
plus<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.690> open<00:03:23.050> strings<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.770> I'm<00:03:24.310> just

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
plus the open strings and I'm just

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.940 
plus the open strings and I'm just
lining<00:03:24.700> up<00:03:24.970> one<00:03:25.360> finger<00:03:25.660> per<00:03:25.960> fret<00:03:26.110> with<00:03:26.680> no

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
lining up one finger per fret with no

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.140 
lining up one finger per fret with no
shifting<00:03:27.490> at<00:03:27.640> all<00:03:27.990> so<00:03:29.310> within<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.760> what<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.030> am

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
shifting at all so within that what I am

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.920 
shifting at all so within that what I am
doing<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.930> chromatic<00:03:32.740> octaves<00:03:33.930> basically

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
doing is chromatic octaves basically

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.110 
doing is chromatic octaves basically
octaves<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.800> each<00:03:36.100> consecutive<00:03:36.610> note

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
octaves of each consecutive note

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.840 
octaves of each consecutive note
starting<00:03:37.660> from<00:03:37.870> low<00:03:38.080> E<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.800> working<00:03:39.550> all<00:03:39.730> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
that I'm creating is the same as if I

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.790 
that I'm creating is the same as if I
just<00:03:58.330> took<00:03:58.540> these<00:03:58.690> octaves<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.320> went<00:03:59.560> up<00:03:59.680> a

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
just took these octaves and went up a

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.740 
just took these octaves and went up a
string<00:04:00.130> like<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.370> actually<00:04:01.300> helped<00:04:01.690> a

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
string like this actually helped a

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.410 
string like this actually helped a
couple<00:04:01.960> strings<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:03.580> odds<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.910> shape<00:04:04.150> looks

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
couple strings the odds of shape looks

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.510 
couple strings the odds of shape looks
like<00:04:04.600> two<00:04:04.840> strings<00:04:05.260> over<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.920> two<00:04:06.070> frets<00:04:06.340> up

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
like two strings over and two frets up

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.850 
like two strings over and two frets up
for<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.850> higher<00:04:07.030> note<00:04:07.420> of<00:04:08.140> course<00:04:08.410> doing<00:04:08.650> it

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
for the higher note of course doing it

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.920 
for the higher note of course doing it
that<00:04:09.010> way<00:04:09.040> doesn't<00:04:09.520> have<00:04:09.850> that<00:04:10.060> much<00:04:10.300> exercise

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
that way doesn't have that much exercise

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.340 
that way doesn't have that much exercise
value<00:04:11.530> this<00:04:12.340> exercise<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:12.970> about<00:04:13.390> making<00:04:14.230> the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
value this exercise is about making the

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.580 
value this exercise is about making the
fingers<00:04:14.709> move<00:04:14.920> efficiently<00:04:15.550> and

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
fingers move efficiently and

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.740 
fingers move efficiently and
independently<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.830> all<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.730> motion<00:04:19.630> is

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
independently and all the motion is

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.270 
independently and all the motion is
supposed<00:04:20.020> to<00:04:20.169> come<00:04:20.350> from<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.799> four<00:04:21.010> fingers

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
supposed to come from the four fingers

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.860 
supposed to come from the four fingers
not<00:04:22.240> from<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.440> hand<00:04:23.740> or<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.070> hand<00:04:24.400> moving<00:04:25.210> so

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
not from the hand or the hand moving so

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.020 
not from the hand or the hand moving so
let<00:04:26.020> me<00:04:26.140> show<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:26.770> one<00:04:27.100> more<00:04:27.310> time<00:04:27.370> a
