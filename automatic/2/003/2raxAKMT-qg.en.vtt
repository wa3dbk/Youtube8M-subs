 remember that every time we cook 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.830
 we must have our hands clean and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.100
 do it in the company of an adult we are going to 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.170
 start by taking a slice of bread 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.570
 and with the help of an adult because 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.630
 we will use a knife and knives 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.140
 they are not toys we are going to remove the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.140
 shores 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.700
 already without the edges we are going to choose one of 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.360
 the ingredients that our 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:54.750
 slice I chose honey 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:59.110
 so I'm going to spread my slice of bread with 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.390

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.740
 Many options 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.830

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:41.110
 always with the help of an adult because 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.110
 we are using the knife 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.069
 I'm going to put them very carefully 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.860

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.980

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:57.359

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.359
