00:00:01.529 --> 00:00:07.230
 started from here to those who doubted there that 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.580
 that keyboard can be used here 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.490
 I was showing you here now. 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.590
 really works like this 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.939
 it comes with an adapter is that you 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:26.229
 put in the usb and then you browse 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:29.130
 normally the mouse function and choose 

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:35.650
 Where do you want to press enter? 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:40.480
 the video can see in the course is that it will have 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 to run on having again will 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:50.220
 descending very clearly that the function that 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.220
 Come to Samsung 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:59.800
 You do not have to stay behind the keyboard. 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:06.809
 of them that is very expensive and clear symbol 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.809
 computer will do all the service 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:18.050
 objective I'm not zooming away 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:30.470
 it will not work out 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:30.470
 come back also who knows our 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.390
 summoning here in the corner 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.680
 It's up to you, it 's very simple. 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.120
 the defender can come here to type 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:56.310
 also you want up there you want 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:04.979
 type your your search 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:13.280
 He does not go in now, just type in the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:19.610
 movies already gave the tip to complete movies 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.610
 and more complete 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.970
 had not applied there to do it again 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.920
 the staff has a hard time here because 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.470
 It's a hand, it's just hard to hold the 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.970
 cell phone and do but when you are 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.910
 the two hands available is more 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.910
 Not practical in this one. 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:00.890
 in rome so the complete blog team 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.890
 You would when you can see here. 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:15.870
 Select this video not to have a 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:19.409
 pity not being able to watch this movie is 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.150
 that about 11 in the ten minutes she goes 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.730
 to brake 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.739
 I do not know if it's because of the memory 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:33.209
 reason that is but now the question of use 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.959
 the quiet keyboard can buy as 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:43.069
 use quiet I do not know that they are brand 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:43.069
 and if the brand clone drop can see here 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.900
 he rode in peace because there he recognized 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.049
 hour 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.049
