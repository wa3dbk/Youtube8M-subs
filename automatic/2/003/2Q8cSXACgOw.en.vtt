couple of different things

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.210 
couple of different things
the<00:00:18.750> squeaks<00:00:19.140> can<00:00:19.350> happen<00:00:19.740> between<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the squeaks can happen between the

head or a nail shank is is squeaking
right<00:00:26.609> here<00:00:26.939> or<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.960> can<00:00:28.170> happen<00:00:28.380> from<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
right here or it can happen from the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.950 
right here or it can happen from the
toenails<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.490> held<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.000> hardwood<00:00:30.390> floor<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960

toenails that held the hardwood floor to
the<00:00:31.080> subfloor<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:33.149> start<00:00:33.570> by<00:00:33.780> eliminating

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the subfloor so start by eliminating

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.720 
the subfloor so start by eliminating
this<00:00:34.860> squeak<00:00:35.219> first<00:00:36.800> drive<00:00:37.800> shims<00:00:38.190> between

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the subfloor and floor joists and then

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.940 
the subfloor and floor joists and then
put<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> bead<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.850> construction<00:00:42.480> adhesive

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
put a bead of construction adhesive

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
put a bead of construction adhesive
underneath<00:00:43.950> here<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.670> bridge<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.120> gap

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
underneath here to bridge the gap

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
if the shims and the construction

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.850 
if the shims and the construction
adhesive<00:00:47.910> didn't<00:00:48.539> work<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.020> means<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
adhesive didn't work that means the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.100 
adhesive didn't work that means the
problem<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.550> squeak<00:00:51.120> between<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> hardwood

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
problem is a squeak between the hardwood

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.350 
problem is a squeak between the hardwood
and<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.649> subfloor<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:54.059> we're<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
and the subfloor so what we're going to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.029 
and the subfloor so what we're going to
do<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.780> drill<00:00:55.020> pilot<00:00:55.289> holes<00:00:55.500> from<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
do is drill pilot holes from the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.229 
do is drill pilot holes from the
basement<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.960> run<00:00:57.960> screws<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:59.730> pull<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
basement and run screws up to pull that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.250 
basement and run screws up to pull that
down<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.899> eliminate<00:01:01.590> those<00:01:01.920> floor<00:01:02.280> squeaks

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
down and eliminate those floor squeaks

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.479 
down and eliminate those floor squeaks
before<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.369> know

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
before you can do that you have to know

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.250 
before you can do that you have to know
how<00:01:05.670> thick<00:01:05.939> your<00:01:06.119> floor<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> last

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
how thick your floor is because the last

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020 
how thick your floor is because the last
thing<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.280> screws<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.700> coming

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
thing you want is for screws to coming

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.820 
thing you want is for screws to coming
up<00:01:09.119> through<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.420> finished<00:01:09.780> floor<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.619> kind

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
up through your finished floor it's kind

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.700 
up through your finished floor it's kind
of<00:01:10.920> hard<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.369> feet<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.900> you've<00:01:13.530> got

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
of hard on your feet so if you've got

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.830 
of hard on your feet so if you've got
heat<00:01:14.010> registers<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.210> figure<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
heat registers we can figure out the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.660 
heat registers we can figure out the
floor<00:01:16.080> thickness<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.799> way<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.549> have

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
floor thickness that way or if you have

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.210 
floor thickness that way or if you have
radiators<00:01:18.390> there's<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.810> escutcheon<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:20.040> you

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
radiators there's an escutcheon that you

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.249 
radiators there's an escutcheon that you
can<00:01:20.400> remove<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.820> look<00:01:21.540> down<00:01:21.750> through<00:01:22.020> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
can remove and look down through that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.990 
can remove and look down through that
rough<00:01:22.560> hole<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.009> figure<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.430> how<00:01:23.580> thick<00:01:23.850> your

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
rough hole to figure out how thick your

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.539 
rough hole to figure out how thick your
floor<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.560> this<00:01:25.560> case<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> heat

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
floor is this case we have a heat

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.810 
floor is this case we have a heat
register<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.320> peel<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.040> metal<00:01:29.460> aside

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
register you can peel this metal aside

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.490 
register you can peel this metal aside
sometimes<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> nail<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.259> pop

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
sometimes there's a nail you have to pop

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.950 
sometimes there's a nail you have to pop
but<00:01:32.369> most<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.790> time<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.570> at<00:01:33.750> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
but most of the time you can get at this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
but most of the time you can get at this
thing<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.590> down<00:01:34.829> into<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.280> basement<00:01:35.520> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
thing and see down into the basement and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.630 
thing and see down into the basement and
figure<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.600> how<00:01:36.840> thick<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:38.520> what

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
figure out how thick this is then what

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.010 
figure out how thick this is then what
you<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.329> take<00:01:39.509> an<00:01:39.689> eighth<00:01:39.840> inch

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
you want to do is take an eighth inch

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.200 
you want to do is take an eighth inch
drill<00:01:40.350> bit<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.680> Mark<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.579> you're<00:01:41.729> not<00:01:41.880> over
