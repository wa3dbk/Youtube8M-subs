just<00:00:12.480> by<00:00:12.660> my<00:00:12.870> observations<00:00:13.680> and<00:00:13.860> what<00:00:14.010> I've

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
just by my observations and what I've

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.940 
just by my observations and what I've
seen<00:00:14.720> many<00:00:15.720> times<00:00:16.049> you'll<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.350> following<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
seen many times you'll be following a

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.440 
seen many times you'll be following a
vehicle<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.580> could<00:00:17.790> swear<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.180> they

vehicle and you could swear that they

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.150 
vehicle and you could swear that they
were<00:00:18.510> impaired<00:00:19.110> because<00:00:19.530> they're<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:19.860> over

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
were impaired because they're all over

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.190 
were impaired because they're all over
the<00:00:20.279> road<00:00:20.460> drifting<00:00:21.029> from<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.480> lane<00:00:21.720> into<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
the road drifting from one lane into the

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.890 
the road drifting from one lane into the
next<00:00:22.529> almost<00:00:22.980> sight<00:00:23.460> swiping<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> car<00:00:24.360> beside

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
next almost sight swiping the car beside

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.929 
next almost sight swiping the car beside
them<00:00:25.110> and<00:00:25.619> when<00:00:26.040> you<00:00:26.130> pull<00:00:26.340> them<00:00:26.490> over<00:00:26.670> you

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
them and when you pull them over you

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.490 
them and when you pull them over you
find<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> was<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.440> were

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
find out what it was is they were

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.800 
find out what it was is they were
looking<00:00:29.070> down<00:00:29.280> at<00:00:29.880> their<00:00:30.180> cell<00:00:30.390> phone<00:00:30.630> in

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
looking down at their cell phone in

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.280 
looking down at their cell phone in
their<00:00:30.990> lap<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> they're<00:00:33.720> not<00:00:33.840> even<00:00:33.900> paying

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
their lap so they're not even paying

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.160 
their lap so they're not even paying
attention<00:00:34.470> to<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> vehicles<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.690> front<00:00:37.050> of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
attention to the vehicles in front of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.110 
attention to the vehicles in front of
them<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.559> something<00:00:37.890> stops<00:00:38.160> suddenly<00:00:39.000> in

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
them so if something stops suddenly in

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.700 
them so if something stops suddenly in
front<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.449> them<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:40.080> know<00:00:40.230> what's<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
front of them you know what's going to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.960 
front of them you know what's going to
happen<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.280> they're<00:00:41.400> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.610> drive<00:00:41.760> right

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
happen is they're going to drive right

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.060 
happen is they're going to drive right
into<00:00:42.150> the<00:00:42.239> back<00:00:42.449> end<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.900> them<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
into the back end of them and that's the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.460 
into the back end of them and that's the
majority<00:00:44.220> of<00:00:44.729> our<00:00:44.850> accidents<00:00:45.510> our<00:00:45.690> rear-end

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
majority of our accidents our rear-end

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.960 
majority of our accidents our rear-end
collisions<00:00:48.769> but<00:00:49.769> now<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.519> I<00:00:50.550> find<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
collisions but now what I find the

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.390 
collisions but now what I find the
problem<00:00:51.269> is<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.050> they're<00:00:52.530> hiding<00:00:53.040> it<00:00:53.220> and

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
problem is is they're hiding it and

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.469 
problem is is they're hiding it and
they're<00:00:53.519> texting<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:54.239> they're<00:00:54.330> checking

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
they're texting and they're checking

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.810 
they're texting and they're checking
their<00:00:54.720> messages<00:00:55.350> by<00:00:56.040> keeping<00:00:56.400> their<00:00:56.549> cell

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
their messages by keeping their cell

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.520 
their messages by keeping their cell
phone<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.239> their<00:00:57.390> lap<00:00:59.960> which<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.140> even<00:01:01.409> more

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
phone at their lap which is even more

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
phone at their lap which is even more
dangerous<00:01:01.739> than<00:01:02.370> having<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.330> up<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:03.809> ear

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
dangerous than having it up to your ear

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.780 
dangerous than having it up to your ear
because<00:01:04.409> your<00:01:04.620> eyes<00:01:04.799> are<00:01:05.040> no<00:01:05.159> longer<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
because your eyes are no longer on the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.219 
because your eyes are no longer on the
road<00:01:07.700> recently<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.060> Ministry<00:01:09.450> released<00:01:09.869> some

road recently the Ministry released some

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.440 
road recently the Ministry released some
stats<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.430> they're<00:01:11.549> fine<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.420> just

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
stats on that and they're fine they just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.250 
stats on that and they're fine they just
found<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.260> more<00:01:14.659> accidents<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.780> deaths<00:01:15.930> are

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
found that more accidents and deaths are

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.250 
found that more accidents and deaths are
caused<00:01:16.470> by<00:01:16.880> distracted<00:01:17.880> driving<00:01:18.330> than<00:01:19.020> by

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
caused by distracted driving than by

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.020 
caused by distracted driving than by
impaired<00:01:19.650> driving

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.570 

an<00:01:23.510> intersection<00:01:24.050> like<00:01:24.260> Appleby<00:01:25.010> line<00:01:25.250> and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
an intersection like Appleby line and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.600 
an intersection like Appleby line and
Dundas<00:01:26.210> an<00:01:27.050> apple<00:01:27.470> beeline<00:01:27.800> an<00:01:28.010> upper-middle

both<00:01:29.000> high-volume<00:01:30.460> fair<00:01:31.460> number<00:01:31.790> of

accidents

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.390 
accidents
so<00:01:33.410> we'll<00:01:33.590> target<00:01:33.890> those<00:01:34.280> areas<00:01:38.950> I've<00:01:39.950> noticed

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
so we'll target those areas I've noticed

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.040 
so we'll target those areas I've noticed
a<00:01:40.490> decrease<00:01:40.970> in<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.300> number<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.570> cell<00:01:41.810> phones

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
a decrease in the number of cell phones

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.200 
a decrease in the number of cell phones
being<00:01:42.260> used<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.770> year<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:43.700> harder<00:01:44.090> to

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
being used to the year so it's harder to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.540 
being used to the year so it's harder to
find<00:01:44.240> those<00:01:44.750> ones<00:01:45.050> but<00:01:45.950> when<00:01:46.130> we're<00:01:46.280> stopped

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
find those ones but when we're stopped

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.520 
find those ones but when we're stopped
at<00:01:46.729> an<00:01:46.850> intersection<00:01:47.000> like<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:47.869> this<00:01:48.350> is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
at an intersection like this this is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.960 
at an intersection like this this is
when<00:01:48.680> I'll<00:01:48.830> see<00:01:49.010> somebody<00:01:49.400> in<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.640> next

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
when I'll see somebody in the next

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.930 
when I'll see somebody in the next
vehicle<00:01:50.450> over<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:51.560> their<00:01:52.430> cell<00:01:52.670> phone

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
vehicle over on their cell phone

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.960 
vehicle over on their cell phone
checking<00:01:53.330> their<00:01:53.540> messages<00:01:54.080> or<00:01:54.290> texting<00:01:54.970> which

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
checking their messages or texting which

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.139 
checking their messages or texting which
is<00:01:56.180> against<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.570> law<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:58.030> part<00:01:59.030> of

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
is against the law that is part of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.370 
is against the law that is part of
distracted<00:01:59.780> driving

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.430 

so<00:02:06.380> every<00:02:07.219> time<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:08.060> can<00:02:08.300> get<00:02:08.539> one<00:02:08.929> person<00:02:08.959> to

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
so every time you can get one person to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.140 
so every time you can get one person to
stop<00:02:09.769> using<00:02:10.099> their<00:02:10.459> cell<00:02:10.700> phone<00:02:10.970> while

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
stop using their cell phone while

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.339 
stop using their cell phone while
they're<00:02:11.390> driving<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:13.420> one<00:02:14.420> less<00:02:14.690> potential

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
they're driving is one less potential

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.690 
they're driving is one less potential
accident<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.129> could<00:02:16.280> occur

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.210 

it<00:02:20.180> says<00:02:20.390> he<00:02:20.629> just<00:02:20.870> picked<00:02:21.110> up<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.379> phone<00:02:21.410> just

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
it says he just picked up the phone just

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.150 
it says he just picked up the phone just
to<00:02:22.280> tell<00:02:22.760> them<00:02:22.879> he'd<00:02:23.060> be<00:02:23.209> phoning<00:02:23.599> them<00:02:23.780> back

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
to tell them he'd be phoning them back
