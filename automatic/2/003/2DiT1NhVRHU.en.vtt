00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
you guys go about deciding on

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.730 
you guys go about deciding on
implementing<00:00:26.480> battle<00:00:26.840> points<00:00:27.200> instead<00:00:27.439> of<00:00:27.619> a

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
implementing battle points instead of a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.500 
implementing battle points instead of a
more<00:00:27.920> traditional<00:00:28.100> way<00:00:28.580> of<00:00:28.610> upgrading<00:00:29.330> the

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
more traditional way of upgrading the

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.080 
more traditional way of upgrading the
player<00:00:30.020> characters<00:00:30.500> in<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.740> game<00:00:30.849> so<00:00:31.849> battle

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
player characters in the game so battle

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.340 
player characters in the game so battle
points<00:00:32.360> really<00:00:32.570> came<00:00:32.720> about<00:00:32.840> from<00:00:33.170> this

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
points really came about from this

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.290 
points really came about from this
desire<00:00:33.710> for<00:00:34.010> us<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.280> get<00:00:34.430> give<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:34.850> player<00:00:35.060> all

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
desire for us to get give the player all

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.990 
desire for us to get give the player all
these<00:00:35.540> really<00:00:35.930> expensive<00:00:36.770> you<00:00:37.550> know<00:00:37.579> big

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
these really expensive you know big

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.060 
these really expensive you know big
impact<00:00:38.510> weapons<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.200> vehicles<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.650> game<00:00:39.829> and

impact weapons and vehicles the game and

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.350 
impact weapons and vehicles the game and
so<00:00:40.160> we<00:00:40.250> sat<00:00:40.430> down<00:00:40.460> we're<00:00:40.700> like<00:00:40.850> how<00:00:41.060> can<00:00:41.270> we

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
so we sat down we're like how can we

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.580 
so we sat down we're like how can we
balance<00:00:41.510> this<00:00:41.780> how<00:00:41.960> can<00:00:42.110> we<00:00:42.200> give<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.440> player

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
balance this how can we give the player

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.470 
balance this how can we give the player
access<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:42.980> these<00:00:43.070> really<00:00:43.520> cool<00:00:43.670> toys<00:00:43.940> they

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
access to these really cool toys they

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.330 
access to these really cool toys they
can<00:00:44.660> do<00:00:44.750> a<00:00:44.780> lot<00:00:45.020> of<00:00:45.050> damage<00:00:45.320> in<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.560> game<00:00:45.739> but

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
can do a lot of damage in the game but

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.069 
can do a lot of damage in the game but
make<00:00:46.640> sure<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:46.850> those<00:00:47.210> things<00:00:47.420> are<00:00:47.600> not<00:00:47.780> you

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
make sure that those things are not you

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.250 
make sure that those things are not you
know<00:00:48.199> like<00:00:48.769> to<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.969> overpower<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.750> imbalance

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
know like to to overpower to imbalance

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.259 
know like to to overpower to imbalance
so<00:00:51.920> we<00:00:52.100> came<00:00:52.219> up<00:00:52.250> with<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.519> system<00:00:52.850> which<00:00:53.149> I'm

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
so we came up with the system which I'm

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:54.639 
so we came up with the system which I'm
calling<00:00:53.539> Battle<00:00:53.809> Points<00:00:53.929> it's<00:00:54.230> basically<00:00:54.500> an

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
calling Battle Points it's basically an

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
all the toys within the game and so we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.120 
all the toys within the game and so we
didn't<00:01:35.720> want<00:01:35.870> a<00:01:35.930> rich<00:01:36.140> get<00:01:36.410> richer<00:01:36.800> scheme

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
didn't want a rich get richer scheme

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.100 
didn't want a rich get richer scheme
where<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:38.090> get<00:01:38.240> battle<00:01:38.540> points<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.020> they're

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
where you get battle points and they're

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.600 
where you get battle points and they're
so<00:01:39.260> powerful<00:01:39.440> that<00:01:39.800> it<00:01:40.070> just<00:01:40.250> makes<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.490> get

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
so powerful that it just makes to get

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.240 
so powerful that it just makes to get
more<00:01:40.730> battle<00:01:41.090> points<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:42.530> there's<00:01:42.770> been<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:42.950> lot

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
more battle points so there's been a lot

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.550 
more battle points so there's been a lot
of<00:01:43.280> work<00:01:43.580> in<00:01:43.820> balance<00:01:44.210> in<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:44.540> system<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.500> the

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
of work in balance in that system so the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.690 
of work in balance in that system so the
main<00:01:45.710> goal<00:01:45.830> is<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.040> try<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.280> create<00:01:46.580> a

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
main goal is to try and create a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.280
