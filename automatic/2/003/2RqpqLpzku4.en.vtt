00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.549
 in the aztec stadium america faced 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.400
 to veracruz the master reinoso a man 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.430
 much loved in America came this 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.970
 played for me for me for me is not 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.590
 I do not know what the best ones think 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.510
 totally and recklessly swept 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.580
 unnecessary that can be marked as 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.960
 pee in that area you know that if you're going to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.820
 remember the risk of you getting ahead in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 the ball and I think all the value 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.020
 burst of verbania I think it touches the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.869
 ecuador de veracruz advances the ball and 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.610
 then comes the and this player 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.280
 Colombian which is his second stage in 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.090
 america laughs at jaguars the rifle cited 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.480
 now the rifle is back 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.700
 the rifle was open maze of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.620
 sangüesa do not know this already could not 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.940
 good play charges the penalty so 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.890
 added then makes a good play 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.809
 for the two by zero and they surprise him a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.000
 madruguete and good because it was when better 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.460
 when he reacted from the cross, but he did not 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.110
 very wrong here too I go yes I think that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.730
 I go in the veracruz goalball no case 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.320
 not even a true veracruz bearing 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.180
 with imponderables from the beginning not 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.460
 because it was andrade it would be e 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.280
 start the game and suddenly I entered 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.560
 crown for 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.360
 I suppose after that timid criminal 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.540
 discussed but america demonstrating that 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.860
 Balance 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.360
 what makes sangüesa and andrade de 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.880
 they are simply worthy of 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.619
 highlight because they help a lot to the part 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.180
 defensive and they give possibilities to 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.040
 peralta already comes from this to stay 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.990
 there and it will always be to combine the luxury that 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.240
 has america in the sense that it has to 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.940
 michael arroyo to darwin quintero without that 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.890
 I sack without that sacrifice of course 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.659
 the civilized but it puts andrade to 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.310
 sangüesa that are equal talents with the 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.820
 ball forward 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.289
 does not have anything better than the rifle like 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.229
 compared to the creek that you but 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.610
 spectacular but have more sacrifice 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.190
 and it gives you the freedom of what the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.350
 yayo let two kill each other 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.659
 as benedetto and peralta that they do and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.060
 that the two from where they receive the ball 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.340
 you can hit the soul the goal 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.289
 with really danger if today we have to 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.119
 give the merit not to nacho as you 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.190
 criticized many times already sticking to his 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.960
 head when it was very early today has 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.610
 achieved a very solid team you already see your 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.259
 hand in defensive zone in the routes 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.179
 very well what what already says that already 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.430
 I will not see several times those 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.940
 mixed flyers that you have with sangüesa and 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.860
 with the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.050
 the one that had been very questioned his 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.500
 arrival in america and today it shows us 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.760
 because the type 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.760
 - like they sent him 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.630
 álex was refined now bazooka 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.280
 today is a rifle rifle now but a lot 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.560
 has to see this the great work that 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.320
 has güemes and warrior because it allows 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.150
 that sangüesa and the other band nothing more 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.730
 have defensive work simply 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:56.200
 Attack Attack Attack and that sometimes 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:58.330
 mete is fundamental because if it allows and 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.400
 they also support a lot down one was 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.730
 golf and inside there will be two it looked very good 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.290
 because america america beats veracruz 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.360
 says he likes the proposal to 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.950
 reigning teacher 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.080
 what is going to tell you he left 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.450
 expelled reynoso like reynoso fire 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.740
 and something he put on his twitter and he says he could 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.069
 Do as a golden when you leave 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.640
 the team of nations won us well 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.540
 9 not born in Mexico from outside punishment 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.519
 obviously referring to our 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.019
 Reynoso to the amount of foreigners and 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:33.969
 naturalized that have the eagles of the 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:36.459
 america no 8 029 here I tell you if 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:39.159
 you want now no longer villa not me to the teacher 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.219
 to the master villalba furch of joe benny 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.950
 crown is North American albín peñalba 9 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:46.750
 also very good Panamanian team 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.249
 about vitoria the Chilean menezes and the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.989
 team of nations as he called him 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.760
 I want to remember with affection and respect 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.669
 because he talks to me on the radio and I 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.769
 scolds the reigning teacher that when 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.419
 emilio azcárraga founded the america 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.280
 he put america because he said it was the 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.409
 American continent team are 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.419
 these nine players to me either 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.129
 like not only in america in no 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:11.310
 miki team but you also goes 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.310
 the hand came out annoying 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.700
 and his proposal to wash very well 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.870
 of life advanced to peñalba a bit of 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.180
 Chaves boy as only contention 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.820
 by bands with menezes tried 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.200
 press higher pressure to the america to 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.310
 home what happens is that america is 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.660
 doing this as a pretext 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.370
 justification because I believe that if the 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.050
 height if you ended up weighing especially 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.430
 see salt it was also clear that it came to 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.780
 the height of the sea always when better 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.300
 I played Veracruz the second 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.980
 we are going to reactions after match what 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.980
 that the third one happened to listen 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.700
 a very good team the big life 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.950
 great professional people who have 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.710
 put in a lot to reverse a bit 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.420
 things like they started the demand for 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.520
 this team is always me always 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.440
 He commented that the only dove that they give you 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.110
 this team to be champion we have to 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.460
 still improve many aspects if you do not 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.740
 I will deny that I do not like I like the 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.030
 order the intensity the quality that 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.710
 have the players for the moments 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.760
 difficult to solve the party in favor of 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:17.180
 us but there is always a dog not and 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.300
 that but already in the week or the Monday that 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.380
 we started training in the afternoon 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.720
 we'll talk with a coaching staff 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.580
 review the videos where we have to 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.530
 improve and take advantage of this long week 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.770
 what will allow us to work from another 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.480
 way then lose with the america or 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.410
 losing any game is not what 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.200
 we want this one we wanted to get a good 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.480
 result we came for something else but the 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.880
 first time the first couple at 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.310
 principle the equipment was not found and 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.080
 this one was costing us 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.130
 and then come from behind I think that at 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.490
 principle we do not enter plugged 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:57.620
 we did not find the marks and the ball 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.890
 we did not have it if it hit hard more than 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.630
 nothing for how it got lost I think the 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.430
 Our mistakes cost us dearly 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.190
 party we do not like to talk about the 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.020
 arbitrators he does his job as 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.990
 we within the field of the game there are 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.020
 sometimes you also have to assume 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.960
 when when mistakes are made 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.930
 but we lost the match lost it 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.139
 Veracruz because he played us as usual 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.139
 to play 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.430
 what comes for the eagles for the 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:35.050
 sharks next Saturday visit the 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:37.480
 good game Blue Cross Blue Cross 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.660
 but tighten the calendar that visit 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.890
 blue cross receives tigers 1 to morelia and 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.890
 the classic
