00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and your files stay optimized we have a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.920 
and your files stay optimized we have a
couple<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.969> questions<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.630> kind<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
couple of questions so it's kind of a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.910 
couple of questions so it's kind of a
double<00:01:55.200> header<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
double header here and this is the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.350 
double header here and this is the
reason<00:01:56.040> why<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> bring<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.850> idea<00:01:56.880> of

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
reason why I bring up the idea of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.560 
reason why I bring up the idea of
defragging<00:01:57.750> from<00:01:58.409> Nick<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.799> YouTube<00:01:59.360> I'd<00:02:00.360> like

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
defragging from Nick on YouTube I'd like

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.209 
defragging from Nick on YouTube I'd like
to<00:02:00.689> know<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:00.990> defrag<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:01.890> likely<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
to know if defrag is more likely to

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.920 
to know if defrag is more likely to
cause<00:02:02.430> problems<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.420> done<00:02:03.630> several

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
cause problems if it's done several

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
at that point it can't do anything you

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.270 
at that point it can't do anything you

constantly<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.940> worst<00:02:37.120> thing<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.420> could<00:02:37.540> do

doesn't need to be optimized this I will

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
go back to and I realize this is a it is

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.100 
go back to and I realize this is a it is
a<00:02:43.870> shameless<00:02:44.380> plug<00:02:44.440> but<00:02:45.030> there<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.270> have<00:02:46.600> yet<00:02:46.989> to

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
a shameless plug but there I have yet to

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.570 
a shameless plug but there I have yet to
find<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.470> know<00:02:47.590> other<00:02:47.739> people<00:02:48.070> are<00:02:48.310> probably

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
find I know other people are probably

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.060 
find I know other people are probably
mentioning<00:02:49.090> other<00:02:49.410> defragging<00:02:50.410> utilities

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
mentioning other defragging utilities

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.949 
mentioning other defragging utilities
but<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.520> my<00:02:51.820> mind<00:02:51.850> I've<00:02:52.269> got<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.690> running<00:02:52.900> on

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
but in my mind I've got it running on

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.710 
but in my mind I've got it running on
this<00:02:53.080> system<00:02:53.850> executives<00:02:54.850> software's

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
this system executives software's

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.290 
this system executives software's
diskeeper<00:02:56.459> they've<00:02:57.459> got<00:02:57.640> all<00:02:57.850> sorts<00:02:57.880> of

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300

versions from a basic version to an

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.370 
versions from a basic version to an
advanced<00:03:00.489> version<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.690> now<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.140> should

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
advanced version and now I should

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.600 
advanced version and now I should
probably<00:03:02.530> send<00:03:02.890> them<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.280> link<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.519> this

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
probably send them the link to this

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.100 
probably send them the link to this
video<00:03:03.760> they'll<00:03:04.120> be<00:03:04.239> very<00:03:04.360> happy<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.840> run<00:03:04.989> it

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
video they'll be very happy to run it

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.030 
video they'll be very happy to run it
well<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.590> ringing<00:03:05.800> endorsement

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
well this is a ringing endorsement

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.030 
well this is a ringing endorsement
because<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.970> is<00:03:07.570> it<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.590> does<00:03:08.739> things<00:03:08.920> the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
because it is it just does things the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.380 
because it is it just does things the
background<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.489> just<00:03:09.670> don't<00:03:09.820> worry<00:03:10.060> about<00:03:10.300> it

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
background you just don't worry about it

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.790 
background you just don't worry about it
and<00:03:10.450> that's<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.720> idea<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.110> good<00:03:11.290> defragging

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
and that's the idea of a good defragging

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.199 
and that's the idea of a good defragging
utilities<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.550> don't<00:03:12.760> have<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.000> worry

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
utilities that you don't have to worry

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.449 
utilities that you don't have to worry
about<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:14.230> could<00:03:14.410> stick<00:03:14.680> with<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.100> defrag

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
about it you could stick with the defrag

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.240 
about it you could stick with the defrag
utility<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.150> Windows<00:03:16.570> and<00:03:16.780> most<00:03:17.080> likely<00:03:17.470> be

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
utility in Windows and most likely be

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.949 
utility in Windows and most likely be
fine<00:03:18.519> this<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.060> how<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.239> get<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.780> by<00:03:19.900> the

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959

anyway<00:04:50.070> my<00:04:50.220> question<00:04:50.580> is<00:04:50.610> about<00:04:50.729> defragging

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
anyway my question is about defragging

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.240
