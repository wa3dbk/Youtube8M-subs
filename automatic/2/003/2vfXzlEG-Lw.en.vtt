00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
Craigslist purchase so I thought I would

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.550

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
use it to recirculate chilling water so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.580 
use it to recirculate chilling water so
I<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:31.769> myself<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.250> rolling<00:00:32.550> garbage<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
put some ends on it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.819 
put some ends on it
and<00:00:41.540> what<00:00:42.540> I'll<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.410> water

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
so I'm going to load test it for a while

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.730 
so I'm going to load test it for a while
and<00:01:45.369> make<00:01:45.520> sure<00:01:45.700> it's<00:01:45.850> okay<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.590> other
