Peach writes from Atlanta how well do
the<00:00:30.029> double<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.480> triple<00:00:30.810> band<00:00:31.050> ring<00:00:31.349> spin

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the double and triple band ring spin

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
the double and triple band ring spin
let's<00:00:32.340> take<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> look<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:33.890> you<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.040> see<00:00:35.309> each

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
let's take a look as you can see each

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.299 
let's take a look as you can see each
band<00:00:36.149> has<00:00:36.329> its<00:00:36.630> own<00:00:36.750> groove<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.800> each<00:00:38.010> band

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
band has its own groove so each band

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.310 
band has its own groove so each band
spins<00:00:38.700> independently<00:00:38.879> without<00:00:39.809> affecting

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
spins independently without affecting

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.080 
spins independently without affecting
the<00:00:40.410> other's<00:00:40.620> outcome

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.630 

here's<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.870> awesome<00:00:49.080> triple<00:00:49.710> band<00:00:49.860> ring<00:00:50.100> just

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
here's the awesome triple band ring just

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.610 
here's the awesome triple band ring just
like<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.970> double<00:00:51.270> band<00:00:51.450> ring<00:00:51.720> each<00:00:52.140> spins

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
like the double band ring each spins

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:03.660 
like the double band ring each spins
independently
