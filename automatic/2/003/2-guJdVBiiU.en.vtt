00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.330
 cock fights there are in all 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.420
 parties if there are more parties in xochimilco 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.670
 what days of the year in each of them and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.280
 in each of the neighborhoods they take 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.550
 they carry out 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.380
 cockfighting cockfight is 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.320
 a tradition that has been present for 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.510
 more than four centuries in Mexico 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.850
 practically the fight is this to death 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.850
 are the fights are human 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.620
 when in any case they are given 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.820
 determined time they are called 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.370
 boards 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.810
 the first combat in mexico goes back to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.050
 the arrival of the Spaniards in america 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.090
 with conquistador Hernán Cortés from 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.760
 then it has been sought to train these 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.980
 birds for the fight to practically 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.070
 to train a cock for combat 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.170
 are around 30 days are months like 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.080
 Boxers must have a diet 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.250
 balanced in mineral proteins 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.650
 amino acids 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.840
 [Music] 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.220
 the xochimilco delegation has highlighted 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.740
 for being one of the areas with greater 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.960
 tradition in this activity only in 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.400
 in 2008 they had registered more than 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.100
 1000 bird breeders combat 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.600
 who sell the 37 thousand pesos a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.070
 exemplary depending on the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.210
 and nationality 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.210
 [Music] 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.380
 However, the death of the birds has 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.570
 motivated that protective groups 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.119
 raise your voice against this 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.030
 practice those who support or encourage 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.710
 cock fights as with bullfighting 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.380
 they argue that they are traditions that are 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.210
 local and popular customs but 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.920
 our argument as defenders of the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.140
 rights of animals is that it does not 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.179
 because something is a tradition has to 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.250
 continue to exist and much less when 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.620
 there is suffering and death of a being with 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.570
 ability to feel pleasure and pain 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.490
 they argue that cockfights are 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.710
 a sample of abuse that ends 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.780
 [Music] 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.909
 that is, the main idea of the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.580
 rights of animals is that they do not 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.590
 are resources or objects for us 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.420
 we are justified to have fun at your
