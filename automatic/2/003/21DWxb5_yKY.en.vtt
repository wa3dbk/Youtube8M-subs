kill<00:00:56.670> frenzies<00:00:57.030> work<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.989> open<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
kill frenzies work is that you open up a

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
kill frenzies work is that you open up a
special<00:01:00.120> crate<00:01:00.539> within<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> city<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:03.680> this

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
special crate within the city and this

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.950 
special crate within the city and this
part<00:01:04.920> has<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.250> seven<00:01:05.820> crates<00:01:06.420> seven<00:01:06.810> co

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
part has I think seven crates seven co

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.640 
part has I think seven crates seven co
frenzies<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.750> with<00:01:09.750> each<00:01:10.020> kill<00:01:10.350> friends<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
frenzies and with each kill friends that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.350 
frenzies and with each kill friends that
you<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.950> rack<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.820> maybe<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you have to rack up maybe like a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.999 
you have to rack up maybe like a
thousand<00:01:12.840> points<00:01:12.990> 3,000<00:01:13.740> points<00:01:14.330> within<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
thousand points 3,000 points within a

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.649 
thousand points 3,000 points within a
pretty<00:01:17.009> short<00:01:17.189> time<00:01:17.460> limit<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.509> that's

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
pretty short time limit so like that's

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.749
