00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
sleep talk actually which is a don't

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.480 
sleep talk actually which is a don't
think<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.990> smoking<00:02:25.380> set<00:02:25.620> i<00:02:25.860> think<00:02:26.430> they

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
think it's a smoking set i think they

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.150 
think it's a smoking set i think they
tell<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.820> carry<00:02:27.030> rock<00:02:27.240> slide<00:02:27.540> instead<00:02:27.840> of

tell you to carry rock slide instead of

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
tell you to carry rock slide instead of
sleep<00:02:29.160> talk<00:02:29.400> or<00:02:29.580> something<00:02:29.670> weird<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.060> that

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
sleep talk or something weird like that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.390 
sleep talk or something weird like that
but<00:02:30.530> actually<00:02:31.530> works<00:02:31.860> pretty<00:02:31.920> well<00:02:32.100> for<00:02:32.220> me

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
but actually works pretty well for me

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.740 
but actually works pretty well for me
because<00:02:32.550> i<00:02:32.670> get<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.940> sleep<00:02:33.150> talk<00:02:33.330> off<00:02:33.540> and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
because i get the sleep talk off and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.320

with<00:02:33.840> rocks<00:02:34.140> up<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.830> be<00:02:34.920> pretty<00:02:35.070> effective

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
with rocks up it can be pretty effective

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.850 
with rocks up it can be pretty effective
to<00:02:36.330> get<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> woman<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:37.020> unfortunately<00:02:37.740> he

scare<00:03:29.340> him<00:03:29.520> um<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:30.150> know<00:03:30.600> he's<00:03:30.810> afraid<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.080> the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
scare him um I know he's afraid of the

ice<00:03:31.320> punch<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:31.770> don't<00:03:31.920> carry<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.280> i<00:03:32.370> can't

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
ice punch but I don't carry it i can't

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.310 
ice punch but I don't carry it i can't
drain<00:03:32.790> punch<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.209> psycho<00:03:33.420> cut<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.870> should

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
drain punch and psycho cut I should

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.110 
drain punch and psycho cut I should
probably<00:03:34.500> replace<00:03:35.100> drain<00:03:35.489> punch<00:03:35.700> with<00:03:35.910> close

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
probably replace drain punch with close

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.699 
probably replace drain punch with close
combat<00:03:36.420> after<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:36.930> battle<00:03:37.110> you'll<00:03:37.410> see<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.650> a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
combat after this battle you'll see in a

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.820 
combat after this battle you'll see in a
little<00:03:37.800> bit<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:39.110> figured<00:03:40.110> what<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.230> SD<00:03:40.590> train

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
little bit I figured what the SD train

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.470 
little bit I figured what the SD train
punch<00:03:41.070> would<00:03:41.190> be<00:03:41.310> doing<00:03:41.550> enough<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.150> I'd<00:03:42.390> be

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
punch would be doing enough and I'd be

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.729 
punch would be doing enough and I'd be
getting<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.750> substantial<00:03:43.290> amount<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.590> HP

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
getting a substantial amount of HP

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.580 
getting a substantial amount of HP
recovery<00:03:44.130> but<00:03:44.670> uh<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:45.120> guess<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.170> slow<00:03:46.380> king

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
recovery but uh I guess the slow king

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.350 
recovery but uh I guess the slow king
was<00:03:46.739> defense<00:03:47.070> isn't<00:03:47.220> really<00:03:47.520> that<00:03:47.670> high<00:03:47.910> you

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
was defense isn't really that high you

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.390 
was defense isn't really that high you
know<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> damn<00:03:48.720> axe<00:03:48.959> attack<00:03:49.080> +<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:50.100> drain

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
know a damn axe attack + to that drain

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.640 
know a damn axe attack + to that drain
punch<00:03:50.610> didn't<00:03:51.060> even<00:03:51.239> do<00:03:51.360> half<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.440> was<00:03:52.590> like

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
punch didn't even do half so I was like

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.350

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
have killed him but it would have at

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.449 
have killed him but it would have at
