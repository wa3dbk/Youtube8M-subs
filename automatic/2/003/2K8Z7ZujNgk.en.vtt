00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:08.850
 Hi guys, now I'm going to make you a 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:11.550
 boxing of the monster tron daft punk ya 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.450
 obviously special edition edition 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.480
 limited already compatible in what is 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.989
 contract with all mac devices 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.390
 you can already see the box in some 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:29.399
 specifications on the direction of 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:35.329
 noise on the LEDs and some content 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:35.329
 from the box and the toilets cables and case 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 how can you see the box 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.070
 is special 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.490
 because so great and we will study 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.960
 Let's see 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.960
 strange cleaning 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:06.460
 the monsters service of canada since I 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.460
 I do not bring all against them 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.050
 the auxiliary cable cables and the cable 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.190
 control such and move because they are so the 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.190
 user manual 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.830
 under the world 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.070
 let's go over the cable bridge I'm not going to 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.110
 leave since a common auxiliary cable and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.800
 current 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.500
 this has a little more specifications 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.500
 since it is only for this hearing aid 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.650
 3 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.750
 since they are only said no 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:53.540
 because I carry a battery because it activates the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.000
 noise cancellation and activates a detail 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.820
 that anime fascinates in the hearing aid there 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.770
 we have the most in less for the volume 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.700
 and the one to carry the call 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.940
 in this way in the hearing aid use of 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.050
 forgiveness cable already brings all together to 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.010
 the direction of light 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.170
 we go 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.909
 by the hearing aid is a pretty bag 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.930
 Well the truth is that a backpack or 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.849
 it is bringing us in the hand but this is 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.760
 basically recommended for for 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.180
 children and they work either between the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.180
 night 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.909
 because they are special I tell them because 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.000
 This hearing aid can not be enlarged or 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:44.820
 reduce 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.820
 other hearing aids you already 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.600
 there's the funk edition 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.989
 it's a futuristic style 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.070
 already 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.400
 it's like it 's already there if it were clothes 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.909
 it would be like this 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.280
 and well you can put there is the 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.510
 auxiliary input that can be put in 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.560
 both hearing aids 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.560
 that 's the special entrance 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.500
 everything combines with a tone 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.790
 in a cable is much more than better 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.710
 quality meeting I want another 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.840
 hearing aids that had a kind of much more 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:38.060
 thick more complete completions 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.010
 also obviously bathed black every 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.840
 connector 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.770
 and they will see what I meant by 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.350
 who can I and were so special 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.310
 I do not know if under pressure that has 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.310
 Backlight 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.300
 and really like making chili 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.300
 listen on the low 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.950
 this is sound that has this is a 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.860
 cleaner sound than other 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.660
 hearing aids monsters is enough 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:19.350
 light so it's much more comfortable than 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.420
 the same studies or the pros and the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.420
 noise cancellation is very good very 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.620
 good feeling 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.620
 rather lighter 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.940
 well obviously you can not hear the 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.930
 noise but the music but you hear 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.930
 fairly good 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.190
 this is because I recommend it more than 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.920
 nothing for people is that they enjoy the 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.720
 music 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.920
 for people who told them to work 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.650
 the night or this is in the night that 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.270
 it draws attention but km then for 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.190
 people who are more dedicated to what is 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.160
 the music or else how simple you 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:04.470
 they have the economic capacity to be able 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:07.950
 acquire one of these hearing aids already if 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.110
 they listen as a very clean sound no longer 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.880
 they have their exclusive characteristic as 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.990
 listen to them only with hip hop 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.180
 like the beats that are exclusively 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.060
 materos, so to speak, is already a 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.860
 hearing aid 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.440
 as I was really saying to people 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.590
 who knows how to enjoy music so 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.300
