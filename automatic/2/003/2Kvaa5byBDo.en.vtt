00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.540
 and let me remember today Castro's July 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:46.010
 what it said will be that everything 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:50.260
 we write does not have repercussion will be that 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.559
 everything falls into an empty bag 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.660
 we have two activities in 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.120
 relationship and in conjunction with the 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.710
 primary council and the ned is the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.680
 school construction time 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.199
 complete training in services for 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.630
 full- time teachers and teachers 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.950
 in this moment of common schools we 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.080
 we based on a pedagogical project that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.729
 from full-time schools and 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.950
 good through interpretation 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.009
 our of this project we try to 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.830
 transmit it in the spaces with the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.740
 concept that all spaces are for 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.039
 learn is a school of 12 classrooms in 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.530
 two levels and what is the pose 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.140
 general implementation was taken into 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.289
 account the issue of guidance for 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.270
 that all spaces were good 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.819
 illuminated and heated 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.520
 naturally even though there are 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.380
 artificial heating but that was the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.869
 idea then why all the classrooms 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.450
 they are oriented towards the patio all 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.590
 the spaces are to learn then 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.560
 Extensions are generated and generated 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.869
 which of the classrooms outwardly do not 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.359
 only on the ground floor but on the floor 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.700
 high where spaces were also generated 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:09.759
 within the circulations 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.010
 with a slightly lower scale to with 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.870
 the idea of ​​children finding 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.870
 places where they are contained 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.970
 teacher did not fall in empty sack everything 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.970
 that you said we are suffering
