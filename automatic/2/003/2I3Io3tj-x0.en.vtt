00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
gonna do a high volume lower weight kind

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.010 
gonna do a high volume lower weight kind
of<00:00:31.980> program<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:33.120> about<00:00:33.210> six<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.719> eight<00:00:33.780> weeks

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
of program for about six to eight weeks

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.110 
of program for about six to eight weeks
and<00:00:34.680> I'll<00:00:35.010> be<00:00:35.040> doing<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.340> pretty<00:00:35.520> low<00:00:35.700> volume

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
and I'll be doing a pretty low volume

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
and I'll be doing a pretty low volume
and<00:00:36.510> I'll<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.809> maxing<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.559> I'm<00:00:37.800> trying

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and I'll be maxing out a lot I'm trying

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.530 
and I'll be maxing out a lot I'm trying
to<00:00:38.100> get<00:00:38.219> as<00:00:38.340> heavy<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.120> often<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.480> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
to get as heavy as I can as often as I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.450 
to get as heavy as I can as often as I
can<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> next<00:00:40.230> 16<00:00:40.530> weeks<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.370> we'll

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
can for the next 16 weeks and then we'll

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.410 
can for the next 16 weeks and then we'll
see<00:00:41.640> where<00:00:41.730> we're<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:41.910> man

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
see where we're at man

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.720 
see where we're at man
yeah<00:00:42.570> well<00:00:42.750> juxtapose<00:00:43.290> both<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.800> our<00:00:43.950> training

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
yeah well juxtapose both of our training

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.490 
yeah well juxtapose both of our training
programs<00:00:45.059> we'll<00:00:45.210> look<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.450> our<00:00:45.570> reps<00:00:46.230> for

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
programs we'll look at our reps for

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.900 
programs we'll look at our reps for
today<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.039> we'll<00:00:47.160> come<00:00:47.340> back<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.550> we'll<00:00:47.850> see

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
today and we'll come back and we'll see

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.500 
today and we'll come back and we'll see
how<00:00:48.539> both<00:00:48.750> programs<00:00:49.320> affected<00:00:49.950> our<00:00:50.309> max<00:00:51.239> reps

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
how both programs affected our max reps

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.930 
how both programs affected our max reps
with<00:00:51.690> 225<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> flat<00:00:53.039> bench<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.610> let's<00:00:53.820> head

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
with 225 on the flat bench so let's head

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:09.550 
with 225 on the flat bench so let's head
over<00:00:53.969> there

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:23.780 

good<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> good<00:01:11.840> there<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> go

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.539 

yes<00:01:24.790> that's<00:01:25.119> int<00:01:25.299> nice<00:01:26.049> breaths<00:01:26.409> good<00:01:27.310> push

yes that's int nice breaths good push

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:34.039 
yes that's int nice breaths good push
drive

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.180 

don't<00:01:34.649> go<00:01:35.369> away

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:02:03.450 

yes

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.150 

we<00:02:04.460> go<00:02:07.569> alright<00:02:08.569> vixen<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.349> we<00:02:09.649> did<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:09.890> a

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
we go alright vixen so we did it a

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.150 
we go alright vixen so we did it a
little<00:02:10.759> rough<00:02:10.910> with<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:12.080> outside<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.709> this<00:02:12.860> as

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
little rough with the outside of this as

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.530 
little rough with the outside of this as
we<00:02:13.580> had<00:02:13.849> this<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.180> number<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.510> think

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
we had this a number I think

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.540 
we had this a number I think
right-handed<00:02:15.260> eight<00:02:15.380> reps<00:02:15.620> eight<00:02:16.010> reps<00:02:16.280> not

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
right-handed eight reps eight reps not

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.030 
right-handed eight reps eight reps not
bad<00:02:16.790> considering<00:02:17.239> we<00:02:17.510> don't<00:02:17.720> bench<00:02:18.020> rarely<00:02:18.920> at

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
bad considering we don't bench rarely at

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.830 
bad considering we don't bench rarely at
all<00:02:19.160> in<00:02:19.310> fact<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:20.270> great<00:02:20.480> thing<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.720> that

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
all in fact the great thing is that

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.750 
all in fact the great thing is that
we're<00:02:21.080> both<00:02:21.200> hitting<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.620> level<00:02:22.310> playground

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
we're both hitting a level playground

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.270 
we're both hitting a level playground
playground<00:02:23.300> start<00:02:23.690> with<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.380> we<00:02:25.069> both

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
playground start with so that we we both

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.790 
playground start with so that we we both
do<00:02:25.459> our<00:02:25.519> training<00:02:26.060> sessions<00:02:26.480> my<00:02:27.170> high<00:02:27.349> volume

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
do our training sessions my high volume

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.000 
do our training sessions my high volume
or<00:02:27.890> weight<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.760> then<00:02:29.360> my<00:02:29.540> maxing<00:02:30.319> out<00:02:30.380> all<00:02:30.830> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
or weight and then my maxing out all the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.640 
or weight and then my maxing out all the
time<00:02:31.130> basically<00:02:31.540> should<00:02:32.540> be<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> it'll<00:02:33.590> be

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
time basically should be a it'll be

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.410 
time basically should be a it'll be
great<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.920> see<00:02:34.040> how<00:02:34.310> those<00:02:34.459> how<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.120> training

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
great to see how those how the training

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.080 
great to see how those how the training
style<00:02:35.720> expose<00:02:36.470> our<00:02:36.700> attempts<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.910> next

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
style expose our attempts on the next

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.090 
style expose our attempts on the next
time<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.269> come<00:02:38.450> back<00:02:38.680> when<00:02:39.680> we<00:02:39.769> went<00:02:39.950> through

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
time to come back when we went through

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.820 
time to come back when we went through
our<00:02:40.310> series<00:02:40.610> there<00:02:40.970> we<00:02:41.150> did<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:42.019> bar<00:02:42.260> for<00:02:42.650> 15

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
our series there we did the bar for 15

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
our series there we did the bar for 15
reps<00:02:43.310> yep<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.060> then<00:02:44.239> we<00:02:44.690> did<00:02:44.810> 135<00:02:45.380> for<00:02:45.680> 8<00:02:46.040> find
