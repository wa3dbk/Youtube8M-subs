00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
 yes these are all percent beautiful snapshot 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.130
 the hip bands and game to game we saw something last year 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.399
 everything is possible, percent can go 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.599
 Opponents insist new coaches take the lead that he endured well 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.449
 our will be as before 4 million in the 4 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.060
 and since I learned a lot about you last summer and around 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.710
 the supernatural all that, of course, take volume with me now 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.650
 will give me a lot of self-confidence because 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.929
 under the hood 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.919
 of course, think game by game and 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.449
 hitherto held percent of HR managers in a row I do not look 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.280
 as much as the the table the internet is not at all 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.460
 I know that we 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.000
 the 96's have 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.180
 these six are 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.430
 To be very hard to reach but not undeserved I have to be clear 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.010
 say today may be 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
 only once percent 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.250
 now I think 18 8 clear scoring chance of the year a broken hand 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.060
 chance 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.590
 but it was still very difficult b 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.060
 now only one topic was in parenthesis to the US 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.340
 and for Speedo we know a little bit about the two now 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.080
 this concert 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 That's why we have up to 1 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 their team is as good as the table space says 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.080
 heated once again choose 10% so working very very focused 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.530
 stay and 4 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.259
 every game is Hermann looks very 2 1 for Dortmund in Mainz 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.479
 yes, they are not from the sink today 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.960
 «We could do more 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.110
 at goal but at the end of 2 1 0 and that means taking game after game 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.760
 Friborg Schreiber we very very difficult 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.890
 and percent 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.270
 We are very satisfied 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.630
 is the Borussia Mönchengladbach as good as the table space currently says 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.350
 do not get into it 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.900
 with the better play facility, second 10 15 have no chance to play 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.060
 below 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.120
 before we want to try to win new game always wants to play and then 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.120
 later you wanted to have so much together 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.050
 this had to be done 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.249
 who do not remember 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.059
 who does not like how long you win the games then you hold 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:12.219
 Naldo mouth 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.389
 That's always right 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.939
 we have time 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.649
 I've seen a lot so far 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:21.809
 That's certainly no, but I think so 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.259
 she explains 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.949
 I was not the driver at the time of Le Mérite left whom with six of his 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:29.799
 the edge 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.309
 because format will 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.309
 For the truly well received 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.259
 I was there but I have a feeling 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.989
 yes everything already over no doubt it deserved defeat there 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.799
 we will not play what we do 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:46.969
 have made with us 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.059
 Although succeeds to compliment Toseland Apache compliment they have it 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:54.189
 Perceived to put us in danger that they have already done and 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:54.829
 it should 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.549
 Paris 1 0 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.269
 the guardsmen enforcement is relocated
