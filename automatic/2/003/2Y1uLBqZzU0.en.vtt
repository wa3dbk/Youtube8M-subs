 hello everyone today is a very 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.820
 special to me because we have come to 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.099
 5 thousand subscribers and to celebrate it 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.490
 we prepare a pumpkin cake 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:26.400
 accompanied by my daughter daughter carla 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.690
 my Alvaro son decided the time that what 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.670
 It always helps me when we do the 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.770
 sweets at home the ingredients that 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.560
 we need are 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.350
 160 grams of pumpkin and I have cooked the 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.030
 you can steam or with water if the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.300
 cross isconahua you have to be afraid of 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.160
 drain then very well 150 grams of 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.200
 flour 150 grams of sugar 2 eggs 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.820
 half a glass of milk half a glass of oil 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.680
 of sunflower a teaspoon of yeast 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.070
 a little vanilla and a little 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.070
 cinnamon 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.820
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.259
 pumpkin with a pandora fork and 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.259
 these to load the click Alvaro 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.740
 and the following 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.050
 Separate the yolks from the whites 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.050
 we think of a clear goal 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.360
 then clear 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.950
 and we do it 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.630
 carefully that there was no shell 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:44.970
 and this the yolks along with the sugar 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.330
 we're going to beat it until I double its 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.330
 volume 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.359
 for the already 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.359
 you look and we have it well beaten 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.230
 Well now here I am going to add 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.230
 all the pumpkin 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.090
 everything perfect is already 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.629
 and we will continue to beat 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.629
 tacit 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.900
 apart from health also all 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.519
 once they have mixed well you 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.519
 let's add the half glass of oil 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.120
 in the half glass of milk 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.800
 and a spoonful of this 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.050
 and we will continue to beat everything 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.799
 slowly 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.600
 he went back to tell them one important thing 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.350
 and is that you have to put to preheat 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.860
 the oven at 180 degrees 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.960
 then on the right flour 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.310
 a spoonful 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.700
 of yeast 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.700
 the fridge 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.459
 I'm going to mix everything well 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.130
 and this we are going to sift 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.260
 in two rounds on the preparation that 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.890
 We already had the sugar and the egg 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.890
 milk 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.620
 we are a little 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.790
 and we mix 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.520
 we add the rest 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.200
 and those balls that help us do not 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.220
 turn this up we do not just throw 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.220
 and we mix well 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.660
 The last thing we have left to prepare are 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.430
 the whites that we had reserved 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.539
 we have to beat the antlers that we 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.539
 is the point of good refers 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.099
 I already have clear ones riding like this already 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.239
 what we are going to do is incorporate the 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.099
 the previous mixture 

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:03.310
 we have to do it twice and 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:05.530
 slowly we have to tend a little 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.230
 and we are going to do it with beige movement 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.510
 envelope 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.510
 trying not to lower the egg whites 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.610
 ah 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.580
 this requires a little bit of time 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.810
 select rible that you do it slowly 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.630
 because that's what's going to make the 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.630
 sponge cake is very fluffy 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.070
 when i am 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.420
 enjoy most of the clear 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.420
 we add the rest 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.000
 and we keep seeing 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:53.700
 as i said you see 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.700
 in and out of tea 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.960
 now in a mold that we can put at 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.880
 What I have done has been shaped 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.650
 with aluminum foil I have thrown a 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.300
 little oil and a little bit of flour 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.210
 and with that we're going to prevent ourselves 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.020
 paste and we can dismantle it much better 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.020
 and all the mixture 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.260
 all right 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.219
 about nothing 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:33.360
 and we're going to put it in the oven about 40 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.760
 minutes at 180 degrees depends on your 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.770
 oven seals I always say to know 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.390
 what is made very easy , click it with 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.130
 a little knife or with a stick in the 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.030
 medium and if it comes out clean is that it is already 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.030
 prepared the sponge cake 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.530
 the time we waited for the sponge cake to 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.530
 cool completely before unmolding what 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.530
 we want 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.500
 here it is 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.700
 and we will have the cake ready 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.700
 to taste it 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.900
 I want to miss this opportunity 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.970
 to thank all 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.000

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:24.410
 I hope we can continue sharing 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.410
