surprised me and then has like a lot of

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.920 
surprised me and then has like a lot of
good<00:01:08.549> natural<00:01:08.850> extracts<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.840> was

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
good natural extracts but it was

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.500 
good natural extracts but it was
surprising<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.680> me<00:01:10.799> because<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.880> actually

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
surprising to me because this actually

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.330 
surprising to me because this actually
was<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:13.049> bit<00:01:13.170> harsh<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.740> me<00:01:13.799> maybe<00:01:14.100> it's

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
was a little bit harsh for me maybe it's

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
was a little bit harsh for me maybe it's
just<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:15.030> usually<00:01:15.479> conditioner<00:01:16.350> wash

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
just because I usually conditioner wash

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.980 
just because I usually conditioner wash
which<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.979> really<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:17.520> gentle<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.840> was

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
which is really really gentle but it was

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.550 
which is really really gentle but it was
just<00:01:19.200> kind<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.470> harsh<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.950> me<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.790> probably

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
just kind of harsh for me so I probably

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.460 
just kind of harsh for me so I probably
wouldn't<00:01:22.560> repurchase<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.259> want

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
wouldn't repurchase this but if you want

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.749 
wouldn't repurchase this but if you want
something<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> little<00:01:26.280> more<00:01:26.549> kick

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
something with like a little more kick

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.130 
something with like a little more kick
and<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.150> cleanser<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.600> would<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> really

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140

thumbs<00:03:56.980> up<00:03:57.130> too<00:03:57.310> but<00:03:57.490> I<00:03:57.700> probably<00:03:58.150> won't<00:03:58.450> use

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
thumbs up too but I probably won't use

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.300 
thumbs up too but I probably won't use
this<00:03:58.780> up<00:03:58.930> just<00:03:59.170> because<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.560> smell<00:03:59.890> really

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
this up just because the smell really

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.410 
this up just because the smell really
lingers<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.720> yeah<00:04:01.860> in<00:04:02.860> summation<00:04:03.490> I<00:04:03.910> think

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
lingers so yeah in summation I think

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.720 
lingers so yeah in summation I think
that<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:05.080> like<00:04:05.500> conditioner<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.400> they<00:04:06.580> might

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
that I like conditioner and they might

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.920 
that I like conditioner and they might
be<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:06.940> only<00:04:07.090> one<00:04:07.390> that<00:04:07.570> I<00:04:07.600> would<00:04:07.780> repurchase

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
be the only one that I would repurchase

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.680 
be the only one that I would repurchase
just<00:04:08.560> because<00:04:08.800> they<00:04:08.980> smell<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.580> like<00:04:09.970> smell

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
just because they smell and like smell

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.150 
just because they smell and like smell
if<00:04:11.020> I<00:04:11.140> really<00:04:11.470> just<00:04:11.560> like<00:04:11.709> something<00:04:12.040> as<00:04:12.130> a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
if I really just like something as a

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.070 
if I really just like something as a
deal-breaker<00:04:12.459> for<00:04:12.820> me<00:04:13.030> because<00:04:13.810> like<00:04:13.959> the

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
deal-breaker for me because like the

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.310 
deal-breaker for me because like the
kinky<00:04:14.350> curly<00:04:14.500> custard<00:04:15.040> was<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.550> good<00:04:15.820> product

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
kinky curly custard was a good product

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.500

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
but over time I just got so sick of the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.420 
but over time I just got so sick of the
smell<00:04:18.720> that<00:04:18.960> I<00:04:19.170> just<00:04:19.470> stopped<00:04:19.680> using<00:04:19.860> it<00:04:20.100> but
