00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello everybody and hello to all this video 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560
 is to tell you about the origins of 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.700
 spinotto in italy with the term spinotto 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.009
 we mean cosmetic self-production 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.379
 we are in 2000 and as I told you in 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.050
 an audio preceding the forum by 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.230
 promiseland hosts a dedicated section 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.869
 a fabrizio zago and the biodizionario in 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.210
 this section talks about ingredients 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.840
 cosmetics and therefore of what is there 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.590
 let's spread on this a few years later 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.710
 forum also arrives lola so there is lola 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.780
 and there are other people who continue to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.010
 write both on the forum of nola and on 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.559
 mine and at one point one appears 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.730
 person who calls himself a workshop 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.280
 saluzzo nickname 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.170
 it was little bones who knows if this person 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.780
 then he changed his nickname 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.300
 and keep following these forums us 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.000
 we have never seen it again and take advantage of it 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.399
 for that in the very remote eventuality 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.320
 I can listen to this audio I send 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.290
 a greeting to the workshop without knowing it 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.650
 has started a process 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.930
 unstoppable of madness spurs teska that 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.290
 still goes on today 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.229
 what he did bone bone began 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.320
 to ask Fabrizio for advice for 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.290
 produce cosmetics at home and not gods 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.689
 cosmetics as simple as can be a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.509
 oil for the body but true e 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.850
 own emulsions then something 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.000
 which involved the use of certain 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.409
 chemicals such as 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.590
 emulsifiers and preservatives especially a 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.710
 that point I remember that lola remained 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.090
 lola I can say that all you have is 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.770
 remained flashed by this workshop 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.659
 because a light bulb came on e 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.320
 I think but trade is really possible 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.100
 make a cosmos at home 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.370
 and from there the parts this curiosity 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.640
 unstoppable that still carries on 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.479
 in fact things went this way 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.420
 in 2005 there was a server crash 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.300
 promiseland the forums were blacked out for 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.910
 a few weeks and at that moment I 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.340
 open the forum you know what you shed that 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.330
 actually I wanted to open for a while is 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.860
 but take advantage of that moment because 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.610
 we say out of necessity in the sense that of 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.070
 yes va well we open a forum where 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.780
 people who write about big prizes that 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.000
 no more center awards are found 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.670
 moment they can continue to exchange 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.720
 information may actually the forum has 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.570
 taken his own way we say 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.720
 an individual characteristic e 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.780
 so it has remained and and if it has also 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.900
 however expanded at that time we say is 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.610
 was a platform on which to host 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.170
 discussions that could no longer be 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.890
 on chrome and you know why it was there 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.920
 this crash and lola followed me then 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.340
 at the beginning lola wrote on the forum of 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.310
 you know what to smear incidentally the term 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.940
 spinotto was coined by the dermatologist 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.450
 Dottoressa Riccarda Serri I greet 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.880
 because he called this self-production one 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.690
 racy homemade cosmetic and from there the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:29.739
 sponged term is continued to yes 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.459
 continues to use what happens that 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:36.220
 in 2006 or at least this is the date 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.940
 which I found but maybe later 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.549
 ask or rather in 2006 now comes off 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.390
 from the forum, you know what you are about to open 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.820
 a forum 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.610
 precisely because the passion of the 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.670
 for that had really become 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.760
 we say important and therefore ours 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.819
 forum's streets that split into 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.359
 how much I am most interested in 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.030
 an information activity 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:07.150
 disclosure of awareness to 360 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.760
 degrees and I am not very interested in 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.889
 sponged in detail while you instead 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.040
 has a scientific mind of its own 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.780
 like to research information study 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.750
 the chemistry of components such as 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.930
 react between them is clearly has 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.449
 all another type of setting for 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.430
 which although one in my forum has remained 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.759
 section on the barbed wire because they are there 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.789
 so many registered girls who like it 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.800
 spignpat in but is carried on by 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.389
 these same girls tease pignataro e 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.900
 the main reference remains 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:45.280
 the corner of lola because she is because she has 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.639
 given life all this is that knows that 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.690
 that does 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.810
 let's say so then here in the 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:57.099
 2006 is the forum lola corner lola e 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.889
 she continues to spit on that forum 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:03.960
 they pass the flower of professionals of the 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.490
 sector I believe there are still e 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.740
 it becomes very big so let's say that 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.560
 the passion for the jack pin wins 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:17.560
 more and more people in fact from there then 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.229
 other realities are born, for example in 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.690
 2010 enrolls in the sweet Carlita forum 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.539
 of the sweet Carlita channel and frequents it 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.960
 until 2012 therefore remained there two years 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.759
 that at some point he thinks maybe 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.280
 can bring what you are learning 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.900
 on making a lola on youtube and then 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.909
 opens the youtube channel 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.639
 but there are also many other realities 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.740
 for example the friend hulk cauldron 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.080
 always starts from the corner of 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.930
 lola and then go ahead on his own 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.820
 or the cosmetics of the patti or 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.719
 channels like that of black jean for 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.930
 example 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.550
 let's say those who want to spignatta 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:58.060
 seriously in Italy can not ignore 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.740
 in my opinion but also in the opinion of the 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.199
 history in the sense that it is what it is 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.740
 really happened from the loria forum 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.710
 from the corner of lola what the situation is 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.690
 now 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.510
 the situation has expanded so much there 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.330
 there are so many people who conquer the 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.300
 blog where you can yes recipes 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.580
 they are multiplied and consequently 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.770
 let's say it's an activity you enjoy 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.900
 a lot in the meantime they are also born 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.500
 lots of sites selling materials 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.270
 first prime while in the period referred to 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:33.320
 I refer to that of 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.540
 origins we say in 2006 2007 was a lot 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.460
 difficult to get the raw materials 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.160
 you need to order them necessarily 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.870
 from abroad with shipping costs 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.520
 also quite consistent because it is 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.130
 in the last years that you are also 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.700
 I clearly lower you imagine 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.010
 by increasing the demand you are able to be 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.590
 managed to decrease expenses too and 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.400
 so let's say it's something you are 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.920
 widening 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.310
 there are clearly pros and cons 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.920
 in this activity and in the next audio 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.620
 which I will record will give some indication 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.350
 for those who want to start spignment on 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:12.320
 things to keep very well in mind and 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:15.350
 therefore on possible dangers of 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.510
 this activity we remember there 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.090
 it's about something that ends up on 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.550
 our skin and on our hair and that 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.980
 so in my opinion it cannot be done 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:28.810
 too lightly and then to the 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.810
 next audio and a greeting to all
