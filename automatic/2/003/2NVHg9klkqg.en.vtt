00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
you're like this the lever drag system

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.600 
you're like this the lever drag system
and<00:00:25.960> this<00:00:26.050> is<00:00:26.110> definitely<00:00:26.410> something<00:00:27.130> to

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
and this is definitely something to

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.599 
and this is definitely something to
check<00:00:27.670> out<00:00:28.029> this<00:00:28.690> is<00:00:28.900> a<00:00:28.930> half<00:00:29.740> graphite<00:00:30.310> half

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
check out this is a half graphite half

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.720 
check out this is a half graphite half
half<00:00:31.359> metal<00:00:31.800> real<00:00:32.800> you<00:00:33.100> know<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.280> frame<00:00:33.550> is

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
half metal real you know the frame is

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.430 
half metal real you know the frame is
all<00:00:33.850> graphite<00:00:34.359> the<00:00:34.390> spool<00:00:34.809> is<00:00:34.930> aluminum

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
all graphite the spool is aluminum

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.529 
all graphite the spool is aluminum
you've<00:00:35.979> got<00:00:36.069> some<00:00:36.249> aluminum<00:00:36.609> accents<00:00:37.210> on<00:00:37.510> it

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
you've got some aluminum accents on it

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.169 
you've got some aluminum accents on it
and<00:00:38.100> pen<00:00:39.100> did<00:00:39.249> a<00:00:39.309> good<00:00:39.399> job<00:00:39.460> putting<00:00:39.789> this<00:00:39.969> reel

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
and pen did a good job putting this reel

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.000 
and pen did a good job putting this reel
together<00:00:40.539> they<00:00:41.319> really<00:00:41.469> thought<00:00:41.769> it<00:00:41.920> out

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
together they really thought it out

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.379 
together they really thought it out
you've<00:00:42.249> got<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.519> it's<00:00:42.909> kind<00:00:43.030> of<00:00:43.120> a<00:00:43.210> low

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.389 
you've got the it's kind of a low

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:46.049 
you've got the it's kind of a low
profile<00:00:43.899> rail<00:00:44.170> for<00:00:44.379> being<00:00:44.589> this<00:00:45.190> size<00:00:45.519> it

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
profile rail for being this size it

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.389 
profile rail for being this size it
might<00:00:46.239> be<00:00:46.359> hard<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.539> see<00:00:46.659> in<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.839> video<00:00:46.929> but

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
might be hard to see in the video but

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.430 
might be hard to see in the video but
everything<00:00:48.399> is<00:00:48.489> low-profile<00:00:49.089> the<00:00:49.299> the<00:00:50.199> lever

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
everything is low-profile the the lever

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.289 
everything is low-profile the the lever
is<00:00:50.649> low-profile<00:00:51.309> so<00:00:51.579> you're<00:00:51.999> not<00:00:52.089> going<00:00:52.239> to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
is low-profile so you're not going to

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.090 
is low-profile so you're not going to
get<00:00:52.449> line<00:00:52.659> caught<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.139> there<00:00:53.379> if<00:00:53.859> something

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
get line caught on there if something

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.639 
get line caught on there if something
happens<00:00:54.549> it's<00:00:54.789> they<00:00:55.690> use<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:55.929> same<00:00:56.079> system<00:00:56.139> or

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
happens it's they use the same system or

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.289 
happens it's they use the same system or
similar<00:00:56.920> system<00:00:57.219> to<00:00:57.249> they<00:00:57.429> that<00:00:57.850> they<00:00:57.969> have<00:00:58.149> in

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
similar system to they that they have in

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.389 
similar system to they that they have in
their<00:00:58.420> big-game<00:00:58.600> reels<00:00:59.019> you<00:00:59.199> could<00:01:00.159> see<00:01:00.280> the

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
their big-game reels you could see the

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.910 
their big-game reels you could see the
plastic<00:01:01.139> knotch<00:01:02.139> system<00:01:03.269> for<00:01:04.269> resistance

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
plastic knotch system for resistance

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.010 
plastic knotch system for resistance
it's<00:01:05.920> nice<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.369> smooth<00:01:06.610> it's<00:01:07.180> got<00:01:07.450> six<00:01:07.810> ball

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
it's nice and smooth it's got six ball

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.320 
it's nice and smooth it's got six ball
bearings<00:01:08.380> in<00:01:08.500> it<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.610> weighs<00:01:09.790> in<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.060> twenty

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
bearings in it it weighs in a twenty

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.930 
bearings in it it weighs in a twenty
eight<00:01:10.420> point<00:01:10.630> one<00:01:10.750> ounces<00:01:11.320> holds<00:01:12.040> you<00:01:12.850> know

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
eight point one ounces holds you know

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.670 
eight point one ounces holds you know
nine<00:01:13.180> hundred<00:01:13.540> yards<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:13.960> 80<00:01:14.080> pound<00:01:14.320> braid

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
nine hundred yards of 80 pound braid

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.800 
nine hundred yards of 80 pound braid
it's<00:01:15.640> got<00:01:15.760> a<00:01:15.790> four<00:01:15.970> point<00:01:16.180> three<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.420> one<00:01:16.570> gear

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
it's got a four point three to one gear

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.900 
it's got a four point three to one gear
ratio<00:01:17.200> and<00:01:17.410> puts<00:01:17.770> out<00:01:17.920> thirty<00:01:18.280> pounds<00:01:18.610> of<00:01:18.700> drag

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
ratio and puts out thirty pounds of drag

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.450 
ratio and puts out thirty pounds of drag
so<00:01:19.720> probably<00:01:20.470> more<00:01:20.680> drag<00:01:20.920> than<00:01:20.950> you<00:01:21.130> need<00:01:21.250> but

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
so probably more drag than you need but

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.890 
so probably more drag than you need but
it's<00:01:21.580> always<00:01:21.760> good<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.030> have<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:22.330> another

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
it's always good to have it another

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.050 
it's always good to have it another
feature<00:01:23.230> of<00:01:23.350> these<00:01:23.530> pen<00:01:24.040> squall<00:01:24.340> reels<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.820> the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
feature of these pen squall reels is the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.240 
feature of these pen squall reels is the
the<00:01:25.510> handle<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.470> can<00:01:26.500> actually<00:01:26.860> there's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
the handle you can actually there's

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.770 
the handle you can actually there's
another<00:01:27.310> setting<00:01:28.300> here<00:01:28.480> where<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.660> can

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
another setting here where you can

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.150 
another setting here where you can
actually<00:01:28.900> take<00:01:29.200> this<00:01:29.350> handle<00:01:29.680> off<00:01:29.830> and<00:01:29.860> make

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
actually take this handle off and make

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.540 
actually take this handle off and make
it<00:01:30.310> longer<00:01:30.520> if<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.300> can<00:01:31.480> see<00:01:31.720> on<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.550> right

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
it longer if you can see on the right

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.590 
it longer if you can see on the right
there<00:01:33.790> on<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.150> on<00:01:34.510> the<00:01:34.990> back<00:01:35.200> end<00:01:35.470> is<00:01:35.680> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
there on the on the back end is the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.090 
there on the on the back end is the
second<00:01:37.600> notch<00:01:37.750> which<00:01:37.990> is<00:01:38.110> obscure<00:01:38.830> just<00:01:38.980> by

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
second notch which is obscure just by

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.860 
second notch which is obscure just by
the<00:01:39.160> way<00:01:40.120> it<00:01:40.210> is<00:01:40.300> right<00:01:40.480> now

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
the way it is right now

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.830 
the way it is right now
