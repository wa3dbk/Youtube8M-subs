00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.780
 the billboard for this restel men is already 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.420
 see interesting clear is also not the best 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.130
 billboard in a long time but you have to 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.170
 recognize that the fucking company of the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.700
 Glen has gotten it to be rester men 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.980
 it's worth it 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.960
 for example mic art titles will form 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.660
 part of the event and more importantly 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.399
 they have formed interesting stories by 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 one side and oak and rousseff by the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.420
 championship of the USA and on the other 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.329
 side the stairs struggle for the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.309
 intercontinental championship is also 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.589
 Terrestrial Men will also have the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.719
 real battle in memory before the giant 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.789
 a fantastic idea since at least 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.469
 fighters may participate who never 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.769
 are considered for fighting 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.559
 individual but apart from all that there 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.719
 something that does not convince me if friends the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.460
 star event where roman reigns is 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.920
 face the beast for the championship 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.350
 maximum one combat with a lot of potential 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 but the way in which double-double we 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.150
 is taking the rivalry this fight 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.510
 is destined to fail why it happens 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.270
 this 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.670
 good are many reasons why 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.439
 this rivalry goes through the floor 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.100
 the main culprit will not be a 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.570
 surprise for many the creative team 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.189
 these people in charge of the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.080
 stories and rivalries are the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.960
 main guilty that this fight 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.030
 have such a low reception first 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.000
 try to push a fighter with 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.979
 little experience on whether reigns did not have 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.649
 why winning the royal rumble is 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.180
 Another story what I want to express here 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.880
 is that they have given a great weight on 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.770
 his shoulders it is obvious that the main 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.500
 reigns problem is your handling of 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.690
 microphone that we all know the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.310
 company has been pushing the Samoan 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.429
 when giving segments with the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.409
 microphone that instead of helping what 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.810
 press and that's why there is not a connection 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.390
 with the fans or the vast majority if 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.369
 they are not all the company presses it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.649
 too much thinking that he will get to 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.500
 make promos like the rock let me 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.539
 tell them something roman reigns will never have 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.970
 the ability nor the charisma to perform 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.100
 promos just like his cousin does 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.890
 type has charisma but does not express it 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.450
 with words but with actions I think 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.610
 that they should do the same thing 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.890
 double-double made with goldberg 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.990
 if we compare them, they have many 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.240
 similarities goldberg was won to the public 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.160
 not for its handling of the microphone 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.690
 simply with a spear and a jack 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.820
 hammer became one of the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.460
 most popular fighters at the time 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.350
 basically it was the same as they were 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.870
 doing with reigns until this one won 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.910
 the royal rumble that was not the place nor 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.280
 the moment for the Samoan to have 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.380
 your moment of glory but the way so 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.390
 cruel as the creatives built the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.730
 combat made the popularity of 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.590
 reigns out nosed the main 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.750
 problem that there was that night was not that 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.120
 reigns will win the fight but the form 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.010
 in which he did after this he 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.140
 engaged in a rivalry with Daniel 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.450
 Bryan putting his opportunity at stake 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.730
 holder this time there was a remarkable 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.470
 improvement since reigns could develop 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.260
 his ability in the quadrilateral to the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.300
 time to give extensive fighting that fight 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.130
 that he held against brian in faslane is 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.230
 the best individual fight of roman 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.690
 reigns so far from there in 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.480
 ahead the fight was already scheduled 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.910
 now the Samoan would start the rivalry 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.890
 against the beast and here we go to 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.610
 next problem the construction of the 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.040
 rivalry 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.290
 this is one of the worst rivalries to 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.570
 a star fight that I've seen and the 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.090
 blame falls on both Roman reigns and with 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.100
 brock lesnar we already know that the handling 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.920
 of the microphone is not the fort of reims 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.100
 now it's the turn of the beast or better 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.050
 said his representative paul heyman the 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.690
 company thinks that with having a game and 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.910
 things are under clear control that 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.520
 not the problem here is that the company 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.470
 he presses in such a way to reigns believing 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.050
 that he can face a god 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.640
 in promos as is Mr. German the 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.530
 absence of lesnar in many of the 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.050
 shows are big culprits for the 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.180
 which rivalry has not worked the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.400
 Last raw show on his route to rest the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.230
 already with the entire audience booing 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.290
 No mercy has left me more than clear 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.000
 that this rivalry has no hope if 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.070
 they ask me why reigns receives 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.290
 so many boos is simple people 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.359
 he prefers to see a fight between daniel 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.910
 Bryan confronting Brock Lesnar by 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.919
 your coveted belt a fight that's 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.530
 by itself sells much more than what we 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.570
 are currently offering me neither 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.590
 come to accuse me of being a fan I 'm going 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.570
 bryant 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.520
 I'm a realist and you have to accept that 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.130
 many of us expected to see this fight in a 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.110
 stellar event in rest the men already clarified 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.390
 also that I do not dislike roman reigns 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.520
 despite not being my favorites 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.410
 currently the company has inadvertently 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.320
 caused that many hate the Samoan 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.050
 The reasons for this are obvious but great 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.270
 part of the fault does not fall in reims yet 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.550
 so I think the Samoan is shitting it 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.530
 especially with that video where he asks 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.110
 to the public that are not so bad with him 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.480
 this ladies and gentlemen is the most 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.480
 pathetic that a fighter has done in 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.490
 serious is not wrong to express yourself on the internet 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.580
 but if you ask someone to stop 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.960
 fuck you are prompting more 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.940
 I honestly do not know what they're going to go out with 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.520
 so that this combat ends in something 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.740
 surprising and at the same time satisfactory with 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.440
 reigns taking the glory believe me that 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.510
 It will be a bittersweet ending quite well 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.000
 I find it very difficult for someone like 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.250
 reigns can beat the beast months 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.590
 I had uploaded a video about who 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.360
 could beat the beast in that 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.180
 moment it was fashionable to upload videos 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.340
 having as reference to brock lesnar 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.380
 in that video I gave my reasons for the 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.210
 which I find very difficult to find 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.160
 currently a fighter who is at 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.280
 level of lesnar and this is when 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.830
 we arrived at my prediction so is this 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.080
 video comes with prediction included by 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.449
 much that surprises them the beast must 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.270
 retain the belt and the reasons are 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.160
 the following understand that the company 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.160
 has tried to boost roman reigns 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.680
 thing they have done half-baked but still 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.360
 it's not enough to beat someone 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.699
 that has been blocked in such a way 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.699
 monstrous even to star in a 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.919
 Restel men already in case they did not know 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.780
 Lesnar renewed his contract and announced his 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.780
 definitive retirement of martial arts 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.550
 mixed this means that we will see 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.830
 the beast in the fucking company of the 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.289
 Glen until it is no more or is 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.509
 I left for misunderstandings what I try to 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:29.849
 to say is that if Lesnar continues in the 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:32.039
 good vince company I think they are going to 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.320
 leave more time with the belt even 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.780
 that follow their rivalry with reigns for 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.880
 later on and if there is hope 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.830
 that linz finally can 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.569
 redeem your money bag at the bank 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.879
 the truth I see difficult 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.770
 something like that happen but I do not rule out that 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:49.740
 idea and at least try to make a 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.689
 surprise final yet I consider that 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.539
 lesnar should retain the rest on average 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:56.729
 and if the anger to be harmed continues with its 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.610
 satellite reign but I think it's 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.499
 the right thing to do 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.619
 now what happens if the Samoan takes the 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:06.509
 fight then believe me if it was a decision 

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:08.969
 risky that this one will win the battle 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:11.490
 real give him the maximum championship what would 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:14.099
 even more and more with the negative fanaticada 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.779
 that this one has been won and well I hope that 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:18.479
 at least the combat does not disappoint 

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:20.729
 logistically speaking although in what 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:22.259
 personal the fight that I most expect is 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:24.180
 the stairs for the championship 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:27.209
 intercontinental struggle that promises 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.749
 take the show good friends that's 

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:29.399
 all 

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:31.589
 I really did not feel like doing 

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:33.629
 predictions for this reste in Menia 

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:35.639
 I brought you this brief opinion 

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:37.889
 of this fight that the truth had 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:40.110
 many things to say with a rivalry 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:43.589
 poorly told and whose hopes 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:45.539
 they fall in the fight good I say goodbye and 

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:47.929
 Enjoy this rester men already so much 

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:47.929
 like me
