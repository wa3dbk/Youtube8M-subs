00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.640
 my nerves then I focus only

 breathe well to concentrate more no longer 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.339
 make good mistakes not so much would be the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.199
 Ecuador reached the ladies final with 4 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.570
 climbers while venezuela 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.970
 classified two of them 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.390
 the tricolor reached two positions in the 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.579
 podium with gold and bronze plus get 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.879
 the fourth and fifth place as between 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.570

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.010
 good is my first medal 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.500
 international so I'm pretty 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.689
 happy and I am proud to be able 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.189
 represent my country the truth I feel 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.240
 that I have improved the level for some 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.470
 two or three months and that's how I came to 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.510
 compete here also for 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.490
 to confirm it because I felt strong 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.620
 but I had nothing to prove it in 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.200
 men the final was very complicated 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.540
 by the layout of the wall however 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.280
 Ecuador won the silver medal 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.680
 and now it's a very important achievement I 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.130
 I believe for myself and for the country and it reflects 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.300
 everything we have been working on and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.490
 obviously also congratulations to 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.170
 all of the organization 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.270
 the competition was held at the end 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.119
 maybe a little hard the problems of 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.040
 the final but the great level that goes 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.289
 Obtaining the Ecuadorian escalation is 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.060
 recognized by own and strangers 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.789
 I believe that it kept no very good 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.289
 road at other times five years ago 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.170
 back venezuela was impossible to beat 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.000
 and now we are losing very at the same 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.740
 level or much better not good I the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.929
 I've known for a long time and 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.160
 true that they have increased their level and 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.110
 girls are not very strong really 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.970
 that there is a lot of level in which the final 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.739
 of the sport climbing modality what 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.260
