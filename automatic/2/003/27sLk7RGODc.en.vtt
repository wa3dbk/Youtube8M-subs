00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 hua hai with you iwangai not with you before 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.730
 I want to talk to you about the release of gta 5 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.469
 because for someone it's a big event but 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.630
 I will not reason to analyze or 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.639
 I will tell you about this game about 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.060
 the biggest drawbacks of the game and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.150
 the first drawback is to remove dullness 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 go through the sessions will explain briefly you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.949
 go to gta 5 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.539
 and choose gta online and the game starts 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.300
 look for you a session is pretty 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.390
 lengthy process but you wait can 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.780
 go make a check principle anything 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.920
 5 per minute you have peace no matter 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.800
 where your game is stored and so you find 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.500
 session let you receive an invitation 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.670
 you accept this invitation through 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.890
 telephone and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.050
 the game spreads from you to this session 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.309
 where am i like this game 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.170
 and funny in that if in this session already 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.180
 maximum number of people then she 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.780
 will not return you to the former session, it you 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.489
 throw out 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.470
 and will look for a new one and very often she 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.460
 finding finding a new session she just 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.640
 throws you out 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.760
 single player and you need to go again 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.530
 in gta 5 and look for a new session second 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.570
 the disadvantage is still cheese from the very 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.250
 games 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.960
 when on April 24th I downloaded it to my 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.290
 peak 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.600
 I repeat the video card is r9 270 I 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.150
 I started all the high settings as 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.680
 I would not have hoped for me 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.659
 fourfold smoothing and got 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.549
 permissions everything else is basically not 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.390
 no I did not care well, more quality 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:46.020
 shadows and also important i went you stand on 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.149
 everything is fine on the construction site 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.170
 now if you look at this 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.470
 background gameplay 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.729
 and in the lower right corner you'll find 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.880
 strange artifact that is not fixed 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.789
 still 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.670
 that is, if I expose anti-aliasing 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.289
 even if not the maximum 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.390
 bottom right of the screen starts 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.939
 ruffle 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.849
 There are, in principle, all sorts of artifacts 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.269
 again the same departure from session 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.760
 even when there are few players on the servers 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.709
 there is also my personal conclusion 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.260
 the game is still the barn and yet 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.160
 updated updated third 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.080
 the disadvantage is the server load 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.980
 it happens of course not often it happens 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.900
 about twice a week but when you're at 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.400
 these days you get to play normally 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.900
 just will not give because again 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.620
 the duct is not the eye from which he spoke of 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.519
 go to session if you are logged in 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.620
 session you just got lucky if you decide 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.360
 there take quinto assignment in another session 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.430
 join your friends another 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.860
 session is not a fact that you are in this session 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.660
 you can simply get by loading 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.780
 to pull out session and about the return single 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.760
 player that's when you want to connect 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.200
 with any of you there they will already have 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.190
 maximum number of players because 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.920
 that to find a new session you need 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.400
 a lot of time here such here 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.150
 pies and 4 drawback is the selection 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.889
 random players you go in 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.750
 robbery is permissible or starts what 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:21.810
 task or some race 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.340
 you have 40 lvl and just start 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.680
 do either auto invitation or all 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.060
 on sessions usually agree on 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.200
 invitation players with little bummer i 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.180
 I'll tell you honestly 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.090
 players with small small main will 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.880
 quite often let you down 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.910
 There have been many times when I started 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.280
 robberies invited by session 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.540
 autorup is important to me an american korean 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.510
 and or Russian there are people who just 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.120
 merge at the very beginning 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.040
 I repeat once again you will not come back 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.379
 Your session will be looking for a new one. 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.209
 and it will not be killed just 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:05.310
 a sea of ​​time and even if man is not 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.530
 merges even if the person is in touch 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.900
 Again, I repeat about the cheese from the very 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.299
 product 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.170
 it often happens that you are just throwing out 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.260
 on the desktop 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.019
 This is a very frequent phenomenon probably from 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.019
 time period at 3:00 you will succeed 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.120
 normal real play 50 minutes not 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.030
 more all the rest of the time you will 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.250
 immerse session and wait for players for 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.130
 robbery or any city or 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.919
 of any other business here in general 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.960
 and all at the end of this video I wanted to ask 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.699

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.000

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.479

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.979
 time but he is literally two or three weeks 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.560

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.220
