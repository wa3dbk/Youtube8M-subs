00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.299 

experiment<00:00:54.320> I'm<00:00:55.320> gonna<00:00:55.469> hold<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> key<00:00:56.039> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
experiment I'm gonna hold the key and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.099 
experiment I'm gonna hold the key and
I'm<00:00:56.460> gonna<00:00:56.609> put<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> reverse<00:00:57.359> and<00:00:57.899> I'm<00:00:57.960> going

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
I'm gonna put it reverse and I'm going

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.840 
I'm gonna put it reverse and I'm going
to<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.500> back<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> cars

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to actually back up so I know the cars

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.189 
to actually back up so I know the cars
physically<00:01:00.390> running<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
physically running and not on the

so I know it works in here
so<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:09.659> key<00:01:10.430> running<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.640> time<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.940> got<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
so the key running this time I got a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.590 
so the key running this time I got a
dong<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.990> didn't<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.289> before<00:01:14.420> let<00:01:15.420> go
