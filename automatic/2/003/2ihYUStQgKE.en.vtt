going is going to be important from the
standpoint<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.480> use<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.690> clean<00:00:40.410> it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
with now in my case here the water is

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.200 
with now in my case here the water is
beating<00:00:43.980> up<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.520> tells<00:00:44.789> me<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
beating up it tells me that I have a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.729 
beating up it tells me that I have a
finished<00:00:45.629> leather<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.989> very<00:00:46.140> protected

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
opacity to the outside of it it tells me

also with that in mind that a most clean
is<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> work<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.430> well<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.850> us<00:00:56.910> if

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
is going to work really well with us if

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.510 
is going to work really well with us if
the<00:00:58.199> water<00:00:58.379> was<00:00:58.530> penetrating<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.219> making

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the water was penetrating and making

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.610 
the water was penetrating and making
dark<00:00:59.730> spots<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.510> leather<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:01.440> I'd<00:01:01.530> have

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
dark spots on the leather then I'd have

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.959 
dark spots on the leather then I'd have
to<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> bit<00:01:01.949> more<00:01:02.070> cautious<00:01:02.520> about<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> type

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
to be a bit more cautious about the type

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.399 
to be a bit more cautious about the type
of<00:01:03.090> cleaner<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.449> use<00:01:03.690> I'd<00:01:03.840> want<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.019> make<00:01:04.140> sure

of cleaner I use I'd want to make sure
that<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.460> compatible

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that it's it's going to be compatible

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
that it's it's going to be compatible
with<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.020> call<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:07.560> aniline
