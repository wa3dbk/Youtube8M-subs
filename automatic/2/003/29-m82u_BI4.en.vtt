 art people always things to say 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.770
 Well, no 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:10.070

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.060

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.290
 you could be come here not 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.290
 there must be a lot of 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.350
 because the artist's is always a 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.450
 depressed person we are not going to ask 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.350

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.340
 she is depressed 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:10.669
