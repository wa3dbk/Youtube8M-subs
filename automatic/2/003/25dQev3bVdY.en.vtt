is<00:01:27.979> an<00:01:28.070> old<00:01:28.219> wives<00:01:28.430> tale<00:01:28.670> here<00:01:29.090> in<00:01:29.119> Bermuda

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
is an old wives tale here in Bermuda

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.389 
is an old wives tale here in Bermuda
that<00:01:29.570> vinegar<00:01:30.079> will<00:01:30.290> neutralize<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.950> toxin

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
that vinegar will neutralize the toxin

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.690 
that vinegar will neutralize the toxin
this<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:32.060> not<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.450> case<00:01:33.130> vinegar<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.310> be<00:01:34.460> very

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
this is not the case vinegar can be very

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.120 
this is not the case vinegar can be very
dangerous<00:01:34.939> if<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.450> dog<00:01:35.689> is<00:01:35.930> convulsing<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:36.860> he
