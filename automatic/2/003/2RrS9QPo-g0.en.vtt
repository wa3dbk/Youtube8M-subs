right<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.330> right<00:02:33.360> way<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:35.450> now<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.569> just

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
right the right way so now it just

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.390 
right the right way so now it just
connects<00:02:37.080> tin<00:02:37.410> any<00:02:38.190> side<00:02:39.500> I'm<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:40.740> turned<00:02:41.280> it

well<00:02:44.760> right<00:02:44.940> away<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.150> could<00:02:45.360> feel<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:45.870> a

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
well right away I could feel that it's a

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.590 
well right away I could feel that it's a
lot<00:02:46.140> lighter<00:02:46.380> than<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.740> iPhone<00:02:47.130> 4<00:02:47.430> or<00:02:47.610> 4s<00:02:50.600> it

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
lot lighter than the iPhone 4 or 4s it

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.930 
lot lighter than the iPhone 4 or 4s it
feels<00:02:51.900> still<00:02:52.590> solid<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.190> was<00:02:53.310> worried<00:02:53.580> about<00:02:53.760> it

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
feels still solid I was worried about it

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.640 
feels still solid I was worried about it
not<00:02:54.120> feeling<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.510> solid<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.320> feeling

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
not feeling a solid and just feeling

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.930 
not feeling a solid and just feeling
kind<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.190> cheap<00:02:56.460> I<00:02:56.730> felt<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:58.670> iPhone<00:02:59.670> 4

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
