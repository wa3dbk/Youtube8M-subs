00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.189
 how do we use the software that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.779
 provides with the good end ratna mouse 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.689
 albeit after the mice harbor 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.400
 this will have three same this is the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.930
 same software in mode this is it is 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.610
 downloadable for free and without 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.170
 you did the little is on my 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.360
 chain so I had to put you the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.330
 link in the description so that you 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.760
 open your software you do 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.700
 profile editor here you are going to have 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.920
 the mad catz logo that will be displayed here 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.570
 you have power as we create them 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.110
 I wanted to show you do 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.940
 programming so in programming and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.940
 well it's simple we will finally program 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.489
 again already hop here so we're going to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.780
 program is on mode 1 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 so I'm going to make a profile for 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 battlefield 4 so here this button there but 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.000
 I 'm going to put the x button 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.369
 that's going to serve me worse 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.890
 here is hammock or worse so here I have 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:24.599
 marked squatting I 'll be at what she 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:29.220
 serves is going to take squatting in front 

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:31.590
 m it does not matter you get here 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.319
 put to the touch so this is it going 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.450
 serve me to bed 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:40.849
 so you see you press either they 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.849
 believe up to sleep slap 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.010
 you press enter 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.330
 here I have scrolls but weapons 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.730
 then I have done but harm scroll 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:58.370
 its full keyboard than numeric keypad 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:05.200
 so 1 2 3 4 5 6 so here I like to be 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:05.200
 scroll to flat arms 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.070
 here you have seen I did a two 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.930
 three four five six so for the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.520
 climb and for the descent 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.810
 here it depends in what way I 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.680
 turn me I m 6 5 4 3 2 1 of the pavement 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:27.860
 digital here is felt very well on 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:33.950
 wants to fix a scroll weapons 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:37.010
 here you go, press enter 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.200
 there is no problem here so for example 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.650
 here it will serve me for the accuracy of 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.330
 tears 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.709
 well I'm not going to use it to 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.510
 the pressure of tears I 'm going to 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.250
 serve to run so I like to be the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.660
 hit b hop and I'll mark running 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.709
 up 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.720
 normally we knew it was the little 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.220
 special touch there that allows a kéké 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.739
 who equip their assets that allows 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.060
 precisely to be able to have a more 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.860
 great precision at the level of weapons 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.519
 actually slow down the dpi of the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.350
 mouse here is so here we go 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.850
 save it anyway we're going 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.400
 save it then me it'll be 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.140
 recorded me I did something 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.650
 on the hard drive ah if you want so 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.569
 here I am I will record here I 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.450
 makes a special folder for all 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.700
 profiles I had so here's profile 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:31.840
 miss nine here felt taking we're going 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:34.780
 mark battlefield 4 that's it 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.810
 save and our profile battlefield 4 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.410
 is here after there is way to test a 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.520
 is looming so we're going to support six 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.680
 sailboats on the keys of the mouse 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.150
 well it will put the x you press 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.380
 the key well the cm as I him 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.600
 asked I am relying on the touch of 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.050
 details it will mark me see the v 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.330
 Here it is 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.390
 but that's when I touch the little 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.269
 wheel it will put me what it takes 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.459
 here here is the mouse wheel the 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:07.110
 left button beats so we see that the 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:10.330
 profile works well it's nickel 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.950
 so that's after it's so simple when 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.269
 you will light your battlefield game 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.400
 four hands for the profile to be 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.700
 activated when you have multiple profiles 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.109
 one inevitably you go on open that's it 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.120
 it will put you in all your profiles 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.460
 a button will take battlefield 4 we have 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.620
 that this one de facto we will open it and 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.020
 after that you have to activate it so 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.620
 here see here your little mouse to 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.660
 northern lecco 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.380
 when you have activated the profile here is going 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.790
 there is a green square that will go 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.800
 here is the green square and there you do not have 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.630
 more than light your battlefield game 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.580
 4 or any other game on which you have 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.850
 does the profile and your mouse is going to be 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.140
 configured for this game so here is 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.700
 see it's software that still 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.090
 is simple that is walking 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.160
 relatively well and then that's who is 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.390
 nice enough if it's free and at the price 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.950
 of the mouse happily that they have 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.840
 done free but in any case this big 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.979
 it does not allow you to configure the mouse 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.930
 really like we want 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.520
 here is to listen I hope that this little 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.200
 tutorial you could forget no bikes and 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.669

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.160
 subscribe to the channel will be even better 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.930
 and see you soon for an upcoming tutorial 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.930
