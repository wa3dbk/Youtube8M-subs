to the Vita and one of those things that

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.170 
to the Vita and one of those things that
we're<00:04:13.260> talking<00:04:13.410> about<00:04:13.650> now<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.250> test<00:04:15.000> your

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
we're talking about now is test your

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.150 
we're talking about now is test your
balance<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:16.320> know<00:04:16.770> for<00:04:16.950> some<00:04:17.130> reason

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
balance you know for some reason

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.760 
balance you know for some reason
somebody<00:04:17.850> sadistically<00:04:18.750> decided<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.620> they

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
somebody sadistically decided that they

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.229 
somebody sadistically decided that they
would<00:04:19.859> have<00:04:20.040> you<00:04:20.160> bouncing<00:04:20.760> on<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.940> platform

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
would have you bouncing on a platform

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.740 
would have you bouncing on a platform
above<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.989> pit<00:04:22.229> that<00:04:22.440> has<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:23.240> bunch<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.360> numerous

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
above a pit that has a bunch of numerous

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.930 
above a pit that has a bunch of numerous
death<00:04:25.020> traps<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.590> there<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.490> goal<00:04:26.669> of<00:04:26.820> it

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
death traps in there and the goal of it

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.200 
death traps in there and the goal of it
is

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
is

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.879 
is
by<00:04:27.270> using<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.660> Vita's<00:04:27.930> accelerometer<00:04:28.710> is

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
by using the Vita's accelerometer is

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.830 
by using the Vita's accelerometer is
that<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.430> want<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:29.639> keep<00:04:29.819> your<00:04:30.030> character

number of time different missions has
different<00:04:36.150> objectives<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.870> believe<00:04:37.440> this

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
different objectives I believe this

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.129 
different objectives I believe this
mission<00:04:37.949> actually<00:04:38.520> has<00:04:38.729> a<00:04:39.030> body<00:04:39.539> parts<00:04:39.930> being

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
mission actually has a body parts being

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.510 
mission actually has a body parts being
thrown<00:04:40.410> at<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.889> kind<00:04:41.099> of<00:04:41.160> throw<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.430> a

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
thrown at you to kind of throw you a

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.779 
thrown at you to kind of throw you a
little<00:04:41.819> bit<00:04:41.940> off<00:04:42.120> kilter<00:04:42.419> so<00:04:43.490> yeah<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.729> mean

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
little bit off kilter so yeah I mean

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.270 
little bit off kilter so yeah I mean
it's<00:04:44.970> one<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.330> those<00:04:45.389> things<00:04:45.449> where<00:04:45.810> we<00:04:46.050> have

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
it's one of those things where we have

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.219 
it's one of those things where we have
numerous<00:04:47.280> different<00:04:47.849> death<00:04:48.060> traps<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.630> it's

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
numerous different death traps so it's

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.960 
numerous different death traps so it's
not<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.560> reward<00:04:50.009> that<00:04:50.190> you're<00:04:50.310> failing<00:04:50.520> but<00:04:50.819> we

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
not a reward that you're failing but we

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.370 
not a reward that you're failing but we
figure<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.360> people<00:04:51.630> are<00:04:51.750> going<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.990> want<00:04:52.110> to

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
figure that people are going to want to

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.779 
figure that people are going to want to
fail<00:04:52.620> missions<00:04:52.979> just<00:04:53.190> so<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.370> they<00:04:53.460> can<00:04:53.610> see

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
fail missions just so that they can see

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.490 
fail missions just so that they can see

on<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:00.990> Vita<00:05:01.169> we<00:05:01.440> thought<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.740> it<00:05:01.830> was

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
on the Vita we thought that it was

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.010 
on the Vita we thought that it was
actually<00:05:02.099> a<00:05:02.340> pretty<00:05:03.150> cool<00:05:03.240> addition<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:03.900> that

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
actually a pretty cool addition to that

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.300 
actually a pretty cool addition to that
as<00:05:04.169> well<00:05:04.199> it<00:05:04.440> kind<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.650> fits<00:05:04.860> in<00:05:05.039> the<00:05:05.130> whole

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
as well it kind of fits in the whole

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.189 
as well it kind of fits in the whole
lore<00:05:06.060> of<00:05:06.090> mortal<00:05:06.930> kombat<00:05:08.870> this<00:05:09.870> is<00:05:09.990> another

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
lore of mortal kombat this is another

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.439 
lore of mortal kombat this is another
mission<00:05:10.590> where<00:05:10.770> we<00:05:10.919> take<00:05:11.580> advantage<00:05:11.699> of<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
mission where we take advantage of the

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.260 
mission where we take advantage of the
touch<00:05:12.660> screen<00:05:12.810> as<00:05:13.380> you're<00:05:13.710> fighting<00:05:14.270> the

another<00:05:23.490> creative<00:05:23.970> way<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.330> we<00:05:24.419> can

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
another creative way that we can

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.659 
another creative way that we can
incorporate<00:05:24.870> kind<00:05:25.409> of<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.680> touchscreen<00:05:26.490> and

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669

incorporate kind of the touchscreen and
and<00:05:26.849> these<00:05:26.970> kind<00:05:27.180> of<00:05:27.300> intuitive<00:05:27.539> motions<00:05:28.169> into

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
and these kind of intuitive motions into

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.189 
and these kind of intuitive motions into
the<00:05:28.710> core<00:05:29.430> mortal<00:05:29.729> kombat<00:05:30.060> gameplay<00:05:30.509> so<00:05:30.720> it's
