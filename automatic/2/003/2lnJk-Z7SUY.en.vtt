00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.780 
hopefully I can't be heard by everyone
because<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:06.839> would<00:00:06.990> suck<00:00:07.230> but<00:00:07.580> anyway<00:00:08.580> I

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
because that would suck but anyway I

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.530 
because that would suck but anyway I
talked<00:00:09.570> about<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.900> during<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> campaign<00:00:10.349> of

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.690 
talked about it during the campaign of
black<00:00:12.540> ops<00:00:12.840> 2<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.130> wanted<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.460> do<00:00:14.519> some

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.490 
black ops 2 and I wanted to do some
multiplayer<00:00:15.120> but<00:00:15.420> when<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.230> played

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
multiplayer but when I played

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.689 
multiplayer but when I played
multiplayer<00:00:17.400> on<00:00:17.730> Xbox<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.480> didn't<00:00:18.840> go<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.140> well

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
multiplayer on Xbox it didn't go so well

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.580 
multiplayer on Xbox it didn't go so well
and<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.150> couldn't<00:00:21.720> really<00:00:21.900> figure<00:00:22.109> out<00:00:22.260> what<00:00:22.500> it

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
and I couldn't really figure out what it

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.470 
and I couldn't really figure out what it
was<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.949> seems<00:00:23.130> like<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.310> was<00:00:23.340> getting<00:00:23.580> what<00:00:24.449> I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
was it seems like I was getting what I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.570 
was it seems like I was getting what I
called<00:00:24.900> laser<00:00:25.289> beam<00:00:25.650> killed<00:00:26.039> from<00:00:26.340> around

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
called laser beam killed from around

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.450 
called laser beam killed from around
corners<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:28.050> would<00:00:28.680> shoot<00:00:28.859> someone<00:00:29.189> twice

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
corners or I would shoot someone twice

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.130 
corners or I would shoot someone twice
and<00:00:29.730> they<00:00:29.789> would<00:00:29.910> miraculously<00:00:30.060> turn<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:30.990> me

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and they would miraculously turn on me

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.830 
and they would miraculously turn on me
and<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:32.309> destroy<00:00:32.850> me<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.360> couldn't<00:00:33.660> figure

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and just destroy me so I couldn't figure

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.650 
and just destroy me so I couldn't figure
out<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.350> was<00:00:34.399> something<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.520> game<00:00:35.820> or

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
out if it was something with the game or

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.889 
out if it was something with the game or
if<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.500> my<00:00:38.370> own<00:00:38.520> skill<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:39.780> like

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
if it was my own skill and I was like

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.630 
if it was my own skill and I was like
fuck<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.260> I'm<00:00:40.440> not<00:00:40.590> playing<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.430> anymore

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
fuck this I'm not playing this anymore

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.119 
fuck this I'm not playing this anymore
because<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.480> very<00:00:43.469> inconsistent

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
because I was going very inconsistent

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.479 
because I was going very inconsistent
and<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.059> having<00:00:45.390> low<00:00:46.020> scoring<00:00:46.770> games<00:00:47.129> but

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and I was having low scoring games but

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.670 
and I was having low scoring games but
then<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.969> was<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.809> I'll<00:00:48.989> try<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> PC

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
then I was like you know I'll try the PC

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.240 
then I was like you know I'll try the PC
and<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.879> definitely<00:00:51.449> tried<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> PC<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.649> I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and I definitely tried the PC and I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.840 
and I definitely tried the PC and I
liked<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.840> feels<00:00:55.079> very<00:00:55.230> good<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.219> don't

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
liked it and it feels very good I don't

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
liked it and it feels very good I don't
exactly<00:00:57.090> know<00:00:57.270> how<00:00:57.750> I'm<00:00:57.809> gonna<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.079> with

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.650 
exactly know how I'm gonna do with
recording<00:00:58.680> because<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.100> has<00:00:59.219> been<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.730> very

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
recording because it has been a very

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.310 
recording because it has been a very
very<00:01:01.050> long<00:01:01.289> time<00:01:01.350> since<00:01:01.890> I've<00:01:02.070> recorded<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
very long time since I've recorded and

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.100 
very long time since I've recorded and
done<00:01:04.320> stuff<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:06.000> world<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.570> Call<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.780> Duty

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
done stuff in the world of Call of Duty

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.740 
done stuff in the world of Call of Duty
it's<00:01:07.950> been<00:01:08.130> quite<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> while<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.570> don't<00:01:09.630> even

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
it's been quite a while and I don't even

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.060 
it's been quite a while and I don't even
know<00:01:09.900> why<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.080> using<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.380> shotgun<00:01:10.619> because

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
know why I'm using a shotgun because

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.590 
know why I'm using a shotgun because
I'll<00:01:11.189> probably<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.790> really<00:01:12.030> shitty<00:01:12.299> but

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I'll probably do really shitty but

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.960 
I'll probably do really shitty but
figured<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.650> would<00:01:13.799> use<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.430> break<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
figured I would use this to break the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.660 
figured I would use this to break the
ice<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.479> bit<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.310> who<00:01:17.310> knows<00:01:17.460> how<00:01:17.610> that

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
ice a little bit and who knows how that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.870 
ice a little bit and who knows how that
would<00:01:17.909> go<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.549> we<00:01:20.549> shall<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:22.640> guy<00:01:23.640> just

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
figured I would do a couple couple

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.710 
figured I would do a couple couple
matches<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:54.979> see<00:04:55.729> how<00:04:55.880> people<00:04:56.180> liked<00:04:56.389> it<00:04:56.539> and

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
matches and see how people liked it and

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.000 
matches and see how people liked it and
if<00:04:57.050> they<00:04:57.169> liked<00:04:57.380> it<00:04:57.470> then<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.710> would<00:04:57.860> probably

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
if they liked it then I would probably

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.439 
if they liked it then I would probably
continue<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.580> do<00:04:58.699> stuff<00:04:58.940> is<00:04:59.090> probably<00:04:59.270> a

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
continue to do stuff is probably a

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.159 
continue to do stuff is probably a
pretty<00:04:59.830> terrible<00:05:00.830> place<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.520> put<00:05:02.419> this<00:05:02.600> but<00:05:02.960> oh
