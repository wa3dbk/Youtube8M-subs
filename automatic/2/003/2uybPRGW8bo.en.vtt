great<00:03:44.709> in<00:03:44.920> number<00:03:45.189> but<00:03:45.909> not<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.389> design<00:03:46.750> most

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
great in number but not in design most

when<00:04:02.620> playing<00:04:02.799> with<00:04:03.069> others<00:04:03.370> but<00:04:03.699> even<00:04:04.030> then

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
when playing with others but even then

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.869 
when playing with others but even then
it's<00:04:05.109> it's<00:04:05.409> hardly<00:04:05.709> exceptional<00:04:06.400> thanks<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:06.849> a

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
it's it's hardly exceptional thanks to a

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.780 
it's it's hardly exceptional thanks to a
bit<00:04:07.060> of<00:04:07.150> generic<00:04:07.540> design<00:04:07.719> and<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:08.919> lot<00:04:09.430> of

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
bit of generic design and a lot of

bit of generic design and a lot of
technical<00:04:10.269> issues<00:04:10.389> it's<00:04:11.079> a<00:04:11.139> game<00:04:11.319> that<00:04:11.349> feels

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129
