resting<00:00:04.650> state<00:00:04.920> functional<00:00:05.250> MRI<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:05.970> the

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
resting state functional MRI is the

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.680 
resting state functional MRI is the
hottest<00:00:06.810> new<00:00:07.020> thing<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.410> brain<00:00:07.649> imaging

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
hottest new thing in brain imaging

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.620 
hottest new thing in brain imaging
usually<00:00:09.690> functional<00:00:10.290> MRI<00:00:10.620> or<00:00:10.980> fMRI<00:00:11.630> measures

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
usually functional MRI or fMRI measures

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.360 
usually functional MRI or fMRI measures
how<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.870> brain<00:00:13.139> reacts<00:00:13.500> when<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.889> do<00:00:14.070> things

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
how the brain reacts when we do things

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.240 
how the brain reacts when we do things
like<00:00:14.610> watch<00:00:15.269> hockey<00:00:15.570> or<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> face<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
like watch hockey or see the face of a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.029 
like watch hockey or see the face of a
loved<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.779> but<00:00:18.779> resting<00:00:19.289> state<00:00:19.529> MRI<00:00:19.890> is

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
loved one but resting state MRI is

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.340 
loved one but resting state MRI is
beginning<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.609> answer<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.150> question<00:00:21.539> what

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
beginning to answer the question what

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.900 
beginning to answer the question what
does<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.710> brain<00:00:22.920> look<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.490> when<00:00:23.730> we're

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
does the brain look like when we're

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.630 
does the brain look like when we're
doing<00:00:24.090> nothing<00:00:24.900> at<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.170> you're<00:00:26.130> looking<00:00:26.310> at

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
doing nothing at all you're looking at

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.310 
doing nothing at all you're looking at
essentially<00:00:27.090> as<00:00:27.240> patterns<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.779> spontaneous

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
essentially as patterns of spontaneous

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.070 
essentially as patterns of spontaneous
activity<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> traditionally<00:00:30.269> when<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.510> look

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
activity so traditionally when you look

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.560 
activity so traditionally when you look
at<00:00:31.199> functional<00:00:31.529> imaging<00:00:32.090> you're<00:00:33.090> typically

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
at functional imaging you're typically

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.670 
at functional imaging you're typically
doing<00:00:33.800> some<00:00:34.800> sort<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.010> task<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.550> comparing<00:00:36.090> a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
doing some sort of task and comparing a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.680 
doing some sort of task and comparing a

to be with resting state approaches what
you're<00:00:42.329> doing<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.780> looking<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.140> spontaneous

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you're doing is looking at spontaneous

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.090 
you're doing is looking at spontaneous
or<00:00:43.950> intrinsic<00:00:44.510> activity<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> brain<00:00:46.100> dr.
