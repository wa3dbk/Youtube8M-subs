review<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.550> Graham<00:00:24.380> swordfish<00:00:25.380> booster

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
review of the Graham swordfish booster

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.519 
review of the Graham swordfish booster
iris<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> light<00:00:27.630> here<00:00:27.930> angled<00:00:28.410> in

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
iris and I have the light here angled in

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.500 
iris and I have the light here angled in
a<00:00:28.619> particular<00:00:29.099> way<00:00:29.279> because<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.849> this

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
a particular way because this this

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.500 
a particular way because this this
version<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> Graham<00:00:31.830> swordfish<00:00:32.430> has<00:00:32.669> what

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
version of the Graham swordfish has what

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.430 
version of the Graham swordfish has what
they<00:00:33.660> call<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.230> iridescent<00:00:34.860> case<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.989> that's

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
they call the iridescent case and that's

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.670 
they call the iridescent case and that's
why<00:00:37.590> they<00:00:37.710> called<00:00:37.920> iris<00:00:38.719> I<00:00:42.500> think<00:00:43.500> they<00:00:43.620> just

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
why they called iris I think they just

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.350 
why they called iris I think they just
should<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.219> called<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.489> iridescent<00:00:45.120> because

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
should have called it iridescent because

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.910 
should have called it iridescent because
iris<00:00:45.719> means<00:00:46.020> something<00:00:46.590> different<00:00:46.710> than

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
iris means something different than

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.010 
iris means something different than
iridescent<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.940> guess<00:00:48.450> that's<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.750> their

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
iridescent but I guess that's like their

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.479 
iridescent but I guess that's like their
short<00:00:49.320> way<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.500> saying<00:00:49.829> you're<00:00:50.039> add<00:00:50.129> essence

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
short way of saying you're add essence

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
short way of saying you're add essence
and<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> case<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.989> quite<00:00:52.110> interesting<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and the case is quite interesting and so

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.500 
and the case is quite interesting and so
I<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.340> reason<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.760> put<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> light<00:00:54.329> here

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
I the reason I put the light here

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.490 
I the reason I put the light here
because<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.750> want<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> show<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.230> some<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
because I want to show you some of the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.310 
because I want to show you some of the
reflectivity<00:00:56.210> if<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.140> is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
reflectivity if that kind of like is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
reflectivity if that kind of like is
able<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.859> go<00:00:59.309> over<00:00:59.640> well<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.059> video<00:01:00.390> but

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
able to go over well in this video but

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.319 
able to go over well in this video but
before<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.100> look<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.910> want<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
before you look at that I want you to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.410 
before you look at that I want you to
notice<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.899> has<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.199> really<00:01:04.260> nice

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
notice that it has this really nice

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.810 
notice that it has this really nice
black<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:06.840> call<00:01:07.020> Tahitian

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
black or what they call Tahitian

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.580 
black or what they call Tahitian
mother-of-pearl<00:01:08.820> dial<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.840> there

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
mother-of-pearl dial on there

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.880 
mother-of-pearl dial on there
you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.570> mostly<00:01:12.570> women's<00:01:13.140> watches<00:01:13.409> have

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
you know mostly women's watches have

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.490 
you know mostly women's watches have
mother-of-pearl<00:01:15.080> because<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.259> feminine

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
mother-of-pearl because it's feminine

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.140 
mother-of-pearl because it's feminine
but<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.729> what<00:01:17.909> they<00:01:18.000> call

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
but with this with this what they call

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.789 
but with this with this what they call
the<00:01:18.270> black<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.960> said<00:01:19.140> mother<00:01:19.320> pearl<00:01:19.650> I

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the black one like I said mother pearl I

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.050 
the black one like I said mother pearl I
think<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.100> looks<00:01:20.280> good<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:20.820> men's

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
think it looks good on some men's

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.570 
think it looks good on some men's
watches<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.720> hard<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.020> pull<00:01:22.229> off<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:23.189> when

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
watches it's hard to pull off it's when

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370 
watches it's hard to pull off it's when
you<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.850> an<00:01:24.000> otherwise<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.930> masculine

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you have an otherwise really masculine

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
you have an otherwise really masculine
sporty<00:01:25.920> look<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.729> dial<00:01:27.000> or

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
sporty look and you have like a dial or

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030 
sporty look and you have like a dial or
certain<00:01:27.600> sections<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.259> mother-of-pearl<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
certain sections and mother-of-pearl I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.280 
certain sections and mother-of-pearl I
think<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.579> looks<00:01:29.700> great<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.210> tend<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
think it looks great I tend to like it a

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.429 
think it looks great I tend to like it a
lot<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:32.220> gonna<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.259> but<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> think

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
lot it's gonna be up to you but I think

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.830 
lot it's gonna be up to you but I think
it's<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.740> cool<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.450> iridescent

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it's really cool so the the iridescent

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.899 
it's really cool so the the iridescent
case<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.470> apparently<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:37.979> incredibly

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
case is apparently like incredibly

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.960 
case is apparently like incredibly
difficult<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.570> make<00:01:39.750> why<00:01:40.340> how<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.520> found<00:01:41.759> out

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
difficult to make why how they found out

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.580 
difficult to make why how they found out
about<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.600> probably<00:01:43.140> through<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> lot<00:01:43.500> of

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
about it is probably through a lot of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.350 
about it is probably through a lot of
trial<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.040> error<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.490> part<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> PVD

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
trial and error and is part of the PVD

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.130 
trial and error and is part of the PVD
process

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
process

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.590 
process
so<00:01:46.939> basically<00:01:47.939> PVD<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.110> way<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:50.600> blasting

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
so basically PVD is a way of blasting

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.109 
so basically PVD is a way of blasting
molecules<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.619> steel<00:01:52.979> or<00:01:53.310> other<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.909> other

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
molecules to steel or other or other

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.450 
molecules to steel or other or other
metals<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> order<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> chemically<00:01:55.799> bond<00:01:56.189> them

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
metals in order to chemically bond them

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.940 
metals in order to chemically bond them
on<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.450> coating<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.049> there's<00:01:58.799> all

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
on so you have a coating and there's all

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.260 
on so you have a coating and there's all
these<00:01:59.100> different<00:01:59.159> ways<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.850> doing<00:02:00.000> with

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
these different ways of doing with

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.490 
these different ways of doing with
different<00:02:00.570> materials<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.170> things<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
different materials and things like that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.789 
different materials and things like that
and<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.159> after<00:02:02.939> doing<00:02:03.180> several<00:02:03.390> layers

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
and this one after doing several layers

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.889 
and this one after doing several layers
creates<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:05.219> kind<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.880> reflective<00:02:06.420> surface

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
creates a kind of reflective surface

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.130 
creates a kind of reflective surface
that<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.469> has<00:02:08.069> these<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.670> greens<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
that is has these like greens and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.220 
that is has these like greens and
Jews<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.830> purples<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.670> pinks<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.270> depending

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
Jews and purples and pinks and depending

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.260 
Jews and purples and pinks and depending
on<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> light<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:14.310> kind<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.610> has<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.940> Sheen

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
on the light it kind of has this Sheen

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.270 
on the light it kind of has this Sheen
about<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.990> which<00:02:16.110> which<00:02:16.350> changes<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.100> looks

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
about it which which changes and looks

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.520 
about it which which changes and looks
kind<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.120> nice<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.540> subtle<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.260> think

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
kind of nice it's subtle and I think

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.100 
kind of nice it's subtle and I think
it's<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.950> see<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.310> more<00:02:20.550> on<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.480> sides<00:02:21.780> here

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
it's you see it more on the sides here

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.630 
it's you see it more on the sides here
which<00:02:22.260> are<00:02:22.410> polished<00:02:22.920> versus<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
which are polished versus like the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.400 
which are polished versus like the
brushed<00:02:23.970> bezel<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.660> things<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.020> but

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
brushed bezel and things like that but

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.710 
brushed bezel and things like that but
it's<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.310> subtle<00:02:26.520> thing<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.120> cool<00:02:27.480> and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
it's a subtle thing and it's cool and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.810 
it's a subtle thing and it's cool and
what<00:02:28.320> they<00:02:28.440> were<00:02:28.500> able<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.800> do<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.250> because

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
what they were able to do is because

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.250 
what they were able to do is because
there's<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.030> lot<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.209> green<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.750> comes<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.110> of

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
there's a lot of green that comes out of

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.550 
there's a lot of green that comes out of
it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.370 
it
they<00:02:32.010> put<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> green<00:02:32.880> like<00:02:33.630> alligator<00:02:34.170> or

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
they put a green like alligator or

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.410 
they put a green like alligator or
crocodile<00:02:34.410> strap<00:02:35.250> here<00:02:35.520> which<00:02:36.030> looks<00:02:36.209> really

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
crocodile strap here which looks really

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.729 
crocodile strap here which looks really
nice<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:36.690> I'm<00:02:36.840> just<00:02:36.989> gonna<00:02:37.110> like<00:02:37.290> move<00:02:37.320> this

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
nice so I'm just gonna like move this

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.740 
nice so I'm just gonna like move this
light<00:02:38.010> back<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.580> little<00:02:39.030> bit<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.569> can<00:02:39.600> see

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
light back a little bit so you can see

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.220 
light back a little bit so you can see
the<00:02:40.080> watch<00:02:40.260> better<00:02:44.330> there<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.480> go<00:02:45.660> submit

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the watch better there you go submit

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.750 
the watch better there you go submit
maybe<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.739> can<00:02:46.950> see<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.340> little<00:02:47.370> bit

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
maybe now you can see it a little bit

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.250 
maybe now you can see it a little bit
differently<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.360> some<00:02:48.510> different<00:02:48.780> colors<00:02:49.050> on

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
differently and some different colors on

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.199 
differently and some different colors on
there<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.590> think<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.280> kind<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.550> cool<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.030> you

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
there I think it's kind of cool and you

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.229 
there I think it's kind of cool and you
know<00:02:51.330> what<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.510> told<00:02:51.810> Graham<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:53.400> even

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
know what I told Graham is that even

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.880 
know what I told Graham is that even
though<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.570> like<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.840> difficult<00:02:55.140> case<00:02:55.590> to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
though this is like a difficult case to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.560 
though this is like a difficult case to
make<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.340> think<00:02:56.640> they<00:02:56.730> should<00:02:56.790> definitely<00:02:57.390> put

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
make I think they should definitely put

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.410 
make I think they should definitely put
it<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:57.810> other<00:02:58.050> watches<00:02:58.560> as<00:02:58.680> well<00:02:58.860> because<00:02:59.420> this

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
it on other watches as well because this

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.940 
it on other watches as well because this
is<00:03:00.570> something<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.900> would<00:03:01.050> work<00:03:01.230> well<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.709> not

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
is something it would work well on not

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.470 
is something it would work well on not
just<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.250> swordfish<00:03:02.790> or<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.030> swordfish

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
just the swordfish or the swordfish

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.350 
just the swordfish or the swordfish
let's<00:03:03.810> just<00:03:03.989> talk<00:03:04.170> about<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.760> crazy

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
let's just talk about that is this crazy

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.870 
let's just talk about that is this crazy

guy I mean you have a watch with two

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.840 
guy I mean you have a watch with two
eyes<00:03:09.360> staring<00:03:09.930> at<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.590> on<00:03:10.800> there<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.760> they're

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
eyes staring at you on there and they're

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.070 
eyes staring at you on there and they're
supposed<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.239> be<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.600> chronograph

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
supposed to be like the chronograph

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.930 
supposed to be like the chronograph
subdials<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.800> what<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:14.280> did<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.640> they<00:03:14.760> put

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
subdials and what they did is they put

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.509 
subdials and what they did is they put
these<00:03:15.030> two<00:03:15.269> metal<00:03:15.600> sections<00:03:16.019> with<00:03:16.650> magnifiers

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
these two metal sections with magnifiers

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.009 
these two metal sections with magnifiers
that<00:03:17.670> magnified<00:03:18.329> 15<00:03:18.840> percent<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:21.570> there's<00:03:21.810> no

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
that magnified 15 percent and there's no

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.140 
that magnified 15 percent and there's no
other<00:03:22.170> watch<00:03:22.410> on<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.709> market<00:03:23.040> quite<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:23.970> it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
other watch on the market quite like it

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.729 
other watch on the market quite like it
I<00:03:24.239> mean<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.480> guess<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.780> could<00:03:24.810> say<00:03:25.110> like<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.500> M

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
I mean I guess you could say like with M

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.180 
I mean I guess you could say like with M
B<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.010> F<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.430> they're<00:03:27.060> hm3<00:03:27.480> frog<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.980> have<00:03:29.160> a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
B and F and they're hm3 frog you have a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.560 
B and F and they're hm3 frog you have a
little<00:03:29.489> bit<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.730> similar<00:03:29.970> look<00:03:30.390> whether

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
little bit of a similar look whether

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.620 
little bit of a similar look whether
it's<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> eyes<00:03:31.140> looking<00:03:31.530> at<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.799> but

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
it's like a eyes looking at you but

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.300 
it's like a eyes looking at you but
definitely<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.840> theirs<00:03:34.200> eyes<00:03:34.380> look<00:03:34.980> at<00:03:35.160> you

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
definitely in theirs eyes look at you

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.420 
definitely in theirs eyes look at you
and<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.519> case<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.690> think<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:37.920> 48

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
and the case is I think it's 48

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.240 
and the case is I think it's 48
millimeters<00:03:38.700> wide<00:03:39.320> again<00:03:40.320> this<00:03:40.500> version<00:03:40.709> is

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
millimeters wide again this version is

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.210 
millimeters wide again this version is
steel<00:03:41.820> with<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:42.390> special<00:03:42.900> application<00:03:43.650> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
steel with this special application the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.270 
steel with this special application the
movement<00:03:44.730> inside<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.540> essentially<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.739> base

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
movement inside is essentially a base

Perret<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.709> what<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.310> have<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.760> first<00:03:54.120> of

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
Perret and so what you have is first of

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.390 
Perret and so what you have is first of
all<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.450> movement<00:03:54.810> was<00:03:54.900> flipped<00:03:55.290> right<00:03:55.739> so

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
all the movement was flipped right so

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.210 
all the movement was flipped right so
the<00:03:56.519> pushers<00:03:56.910> are<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.239> this<00:03:57.450> side<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.220> then

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
the pushers are on this side and then

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.710 
the pushers are on this side and then
there<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.489> then<00:03:59.700> they<00:03:59.820> change<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.329> sub<00:04:00.570> down

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
there and then they change the sub down

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.660 
there and then they change the sub down
so<00:04:00.959> when<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.140> originally<00:04:01.410> saw<00:04:01.920> this<00:04:02.070> watch<00:04:02.370> I

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
so when I originally saw this watch I

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.069 
so when I originally saw this watch I
thought<00:04:03.510> all<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.959> was<00:04:04.170> was<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:05.720> 30<00:04:06.720> minute

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
thought all it was was a 30 minute

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.660 
thought all it was was a 30 minute
chronograph<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.859> they<00:04:07.920> took<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.250> seconds

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
chronograph and they took the seconds

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.870 
chronograph and they took the seconds
out<00:04:09.230> but<00:04:10.230> what<00:04:10.350> I<00:04:10.380> learned<00:04:10.769> was<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.609> actually

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
out but what I learned was that actually

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.640 
out but what I learned was that actually
in<00:04:12.359> this<00:04:12.510> style<00:04:12.750> right<00:04:13.049> here<00:04:13.230> there's<00:04:13.440> two

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
in this style right here there's two

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.259 
in this style right here there's two
hands<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.310> can<00:04:14.489> see<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.940> those<00:04:15.239> two

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
hands and you can see that those two

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.479 
hands and you can see that those two
hands<00:04:15.630> right<00:04:15.810> there<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.709> really<00:04:17.100> do<00:04:17.310> have

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
hands right there so you really do have

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.840 
hands right there so you really do have
a<00:04:17.549> full<00:04:17.910> 12<00:04:18.599> hour<00:04:18.870> chronograph

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
a full 12 hour chronograph

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.060 
a full 12 hour chronograph
and<00:04:19.940> then<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.210> seconds<00:04:20.720> hand<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:21.200> kind<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.830> put

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
and then the seconds hand is kind of put

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.670 
and then the seconds hand is kind of put
in<00:04:22.190> there<00:04:22.370> as<00:04:22.490> well<00:04:22.730> so<00:04:23.000> you<00:04:23.870> have<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.320> what

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
in there as well so you have that what

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.740 
in there as well so you have that what
you<00:04:24.770> don't<00:04:25.010> have<00:04:25.130> is<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.340> date<00:04:25.730> I<00:04:26.030> would<00:04:26.660> have

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
you don't have is the date I would have

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.060 
you don't have is the date I would have
liked<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:26.900> see<00:04:27.140> that<00:04:27.350> date<00:04:27.530> maybe<00:04:27.770> that<00:04:27.980> would

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
liked to see that date maybe that would

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.010 
liked to see that date maybe that would
have<00:04:28.160> cut<00:04:28.310> up<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.520> dial<00:04:28.790> but<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.750> date<00:04:29.930> would

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
have cut up the dial but the date would

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.830 
have cut up the dial but the date would
have<00:04:30.080> been<00:04:30.200> nice

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
have been nice

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.480 
have been nice
the<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.110> most<00:04:33.350> difficult<00:04:33.830> thing<00:04:34.040> about<00:04:34.070> this

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
the the most difficult thing about this

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
the the most difficult thing about this
watch<00:04:34.700> is<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.090> read<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.390> time<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:38.390> know

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
watch is to read the time and you know

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.300 
watch is to read the time and you know
this<00:04:38.750> watch<00:04:38.990> came<00:04:39.440> out<00:04:39.680> when<00:04:39.920> there<00:04:40.100> was<00:04:40.190> this

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
this watch came out when there was this

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.940 
this watch came out when there was this
predominate<00:04:41.000> theory<00:04:41.390> among<00:04:41.570> high-end<00:04:42.380> brands

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
predominate theory among high-end brands

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.950 
predominate theory among high-end brands
that<00:04:43.100> people<00:04:43.250> weren't<00:04:43.550> buying<00:04:43.820> watches<00:04:44.360> to

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
that people weren't buying watches to

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
that people weren't buying watches to
look<00:04:45.140> at<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.380> time<00:04:45.560> they<00:04:45.740> were<00:04:45.800> buying

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
look at the time they were buying

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.250 
look at the time they were buying
watches<00:04:46.430> for<00:04:46.640> like<00:04:46.880> status<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:47.840> things<00:04:48.110> like

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
watches for like status and things like

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.050 
watches for like status and things like
that<00:04:48.440> by<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.650> way<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:49.340> can<00:04:49.520> see<00:04:49.730> that<00:04:49.910> the

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
that by the way you can see that the

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.120 
that by the way you can see that the
movement<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.780> sapphire<00:04:51.230> crystal<00:04:51.680> case<00:04:51.860> back

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
movement the sapphire crystal case back

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.430 
movement the sapphire crystal case back
has<00:04:52.340> been<00:04:52.520> tinted<00:04:53.060> so<00:04:53.600> you<00:04:53.660> can<00:04:53.900> see<00:04:54.230> the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
has been tinted so you can see the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.800 
has been tinted so you can see the
movement<00:04:55.010> through<00:04:55.940> there<00:04:56.180> it's<00:04:56.330> kind<00:04:56.510> of<00:04:56.570> dark

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
movement through there it's kind of dark

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.360 
movement through there it's kind of dark
and<00:04:57.020> it's<00:04:57.110> actually<00:04:57.500> pretty<00:04:58.100> nicely

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
and it's actually pretty nicely

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.010 
and it's actually pretty nicely
decorated<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:59.210> shoe<00:04:59.360> parade<00:04:59.630> does<00:04:59.780> a<00:04:59.810> nice

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
decorated the shoe parade does a nice

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.870 
decorated the shoe parade does a nice
job<00:05:00.050> but<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.860> movements<00:05:01.250> all<00:05:01.340> like<00:05:01.490> tinted

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
job but the movements all like tinted

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.060 
job but the movements all like tinted
back<00:05:02.060> there<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.510> it's<00:05:03.380> kind<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:03.620> cool<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.890> see

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
back there and it's kind of cool to see

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.320 
back there and it's kind of cool to see
it<00:05:04.160> like<00:05:04.280> through<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.610> glass<00:05:04.790> and<00:05:04.820> different

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
it like through the glass and different

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.090 
it like through the glass and different
angles

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
angles

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.920 
angles
anyways<00:05:07.100> so<00:05:07.640> there's<00:05:07.820> this<00:05:07.970> like<00:05:08.180> theory<00:05:08.630> that

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
anyways so there's this like theory that

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.560 
anyways so there's this like theory that
like<00:05:09.080> people<00:05:09.500> weren't<00:05:10.160> weren't<00:05:11.000> really<00:05:11.420> like

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
like people weren't weren't really like

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.230 
like people weren't weren't really like
buying<00:05:11.930> watches<00:05:12.590> in<00:05:12.740> order<00:05:13.040> to<00:05:13.220> look<00:05:14.000> at<00:05:14.120> the

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
buying watches in order to look at the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.580 
buying watches in order to look at the
time<00:05:14.480> they<00:05:14.660> were<00:05:14.720> buying<00:05:14.930> it<00:05:15.140> just<00:05:15.290> to<00:05:15.410> wear

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
time they were buying it just to wear

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.750 
time they were buying it just to wear
them<00:05:15.740> and<00:05:15.860> have<00:05:15.980> these<00:05:16.070> cool<00:05:16.340> things<00:05:16.400> so

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
them and have these cool things so

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.800 
them and have these cool things so
people<00:05:17.450> started<00:05:17.840> designing<00:05:18.020> like<00:05:18.650> pretty

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
people started designing like pretty

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.410 
people started designing like pretty
wild<00:05:20.810> stuff<00:05:21.230> on<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.370> premise<00:05:22.880> that<00:05:22.910> like

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
wild stuff on the premise that like

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.510 
wild stuff on the premise that like
people<00:05:23.990> were<00:05:24.290> using<00:05:24.530> their<00:05:24.740> phones<00:05:25.040> to<00:05:25.370> like

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
people were using their phones to like

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.520 
people were using their phones to like
to<00:05:25.640> see<00:05:25.790> the<00:05:25.910> time<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:26.450> then<00:05:26.990> they<00:05:27.110> realized

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
to see the time and then they realized

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.470 
to see the time and then they realized
well<00:05:27.800> people<00:05:28.070> do<00:05:28.430> use<00:05:28.670> their<00:05:28.940> phones<00:05:29.180> and

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
well people do use their phones and

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.870 
well people do use their phones and
computers<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:30.020> see<00:05:30.170> the<00:05:30.320> time<00:05:30.560> they<00:05:31.400> also<00:05:31.580> use

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
computers to see the time they also use

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.700 
computers to see the time they also use
their<00:05:32.030> watches<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.110> is<00:05:33.290> like<00:05:33.500> an

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
their watches so this is like an

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.290 
their watches so this is like an
interesting<00:05:34.190> product<00:05:34.430> that<00:05:34.700> goes<00:05:34.850> between<00:05:35.030> me

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
interesting product that goes between me

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.490 
interesting product that goes between me
because<00:05:35.480> most<00:05:35.600> grand<00:05:35.900> watches<00:05:36.200> are<00:05:36.320> really

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
because most grand watches are really

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.910 
because most grand watches are really
vegetable<00:05:36.980> the<00:05:37.490> problem<00:05:38.210> is<00:05:38.420> one<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.650> hands

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
vegetable the problem is one the hands

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.830 
vegetable the problem is one the hands
blend<00:05:40.370> into<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:40.700> dye<00:05:40.880> a<00:05:40.910> little<00:05:41.270> bit<00:05:41.420> but<00:05:41.630> more

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
blend into the dye a little bit but more

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.720 
blend into the dye a little bit but more
of<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.080> problem<00:05:42.470> is<00:05:42.560> that<00:05:42.770> when<00:05:43.400> they're

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
of the problem is that when they're

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.040 
of the problem is that when they're
underneath<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:45.170> eyes<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:46.570> you<00:05:47.570> just<00:05:47.810> you

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
underneath the the eyes I you just you

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.080 
underneath the the eyes I you just you
can't<00:05:48.320> really<00:05:48.500> see<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:48.950> minute<00:05:49.250> hand<00:05:49.430> so<00:05:49.700> you

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
can't really see the minute hand so you

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.580 
can't really see the minute hand so you
can<00:05:50.120> I<00:05:50.390> mean<00:05:50.630> you'd<00:05:50.810> look<00:05:50.960> closely<00:05:51.230> you'll

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
can I mean you'd look closely you'll

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.160 
can I mean you'd look closely you'll
tell<00:05:52.130> the<00:05:52.250> time<00:05:52.520> but<00:05:53.210> it<00:05:53.390> makes<00:05:53.660> it<00:05:53.990> difficult

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
tell the time but it makes it difficult

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.420 
tell the time but it makes it difficult
to<00:05:54.470> see<00:05:54.560> it<00:05:54.770> at<00:05:54.830> a<00:05:54.950> glance

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430

movements come from the super ray and
they're<00:06:47.610> like<00:06:47.790> right<00:06:48.000> next<00:06:48.240> to<00:06:48.330> each<00:06:48.420> other<00:06:48.540> in

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
they're like right next to each other in

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.710 
they're like right next to each other in
Switzerland<00:06:49.260> so<00:06:49.760> the<00:06:50.760> price<00:06:51.060> for<00:06:51.270> this<00:06:51.390> watch

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
Switzerland so the price for this watch

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.720 
Switzerland so the price for this watch
is<00:06:53.330> it's<00:06:54.330> like<00:06:54.480> I<00:06:54.690> think<00:06:55.230> it's<00:06:55.470> about<00:06:55.730> 17,500

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
is it's like I think it's about 17,500

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.490 
is it's like I think it's about 17,500
which<00:06:57.390> is<00:06:57.570> a<00:06:57.600> lot<00:06:58.020> but<00:06:58.460> the<00:07:00.080> iridescent<00:07:01.080> case

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
which is a lot but the iridescent case

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.410 
which is a lot but the iridescent case
is<00:07:01.710> very<00:07:02.310> difficult<00:07:02.670> to<00:07:02.850> make<00:07:03.060> and<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:03.390> reason

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.420 
is very difficult to make and the reason

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.960 
is very difficult to make and the reason
is<00:07:03.870> is<00:07:04.020> that<00:07:04.200> you<00:07:04.770> can't<00:07:05.040> just<00:07:05.220> you<00:07:05.670> can't<00:07:05.700> just

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
is is that you can't just you can't just

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.820 
is is that you can't just you can't just
make<00:07:06.300> the<00:07:06.480> case<00:07:06.690> you<00:07:06.870> have<00:07:07.050> to<00:07:07.170> try<00:07:07.470> and<00:07:07.680> make

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
make the case you have to try and make

make the case you have to try and make
the<00:07:07.980> case<00:07:08.130> in<00:07:08.400> the<00:07:08.490> sense<00:07:08.700> that<00:07:08.760> there's<00:07:09.000> a

the case in the sense that there's a
high<00:07:09.210> failure<00:07:09.600> rate<00:07:10.020> so<00:07:10.650> when<00:07:10.800> they're<00:07:10.920> trying

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
high failure rate so when they're trying

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.710 
high failure rate so when they're trying
to<00:07:11.280> produce<00:07:11.460> the<00:07:11.850> case<00:07:12.060> like<00:07:12.300> a<00:07:12.390> lot<00:07:12.570> of<00:07:12.600> them

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 
to produce the case like a lot of them

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.300 
to produce the case like a lot of them
end<00:07:12.870> up<00:07:12.990> being<00:07:13.260> bad<00:07:13.440> or<00:07:13.500> there's<00:07:14.010> a<00:07:14.070> lot<00:07:14.190> of

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
end up being bad or there's a lot of

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.310 
end up being bad or there's a lot of
sections<00:07:14.700> that<00:07:14.850> are<00:07:15.030> blotchy<00:07:15.300> and<00:07:15.690> so<00:07:16.200> it

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.320 
sections that are blotchy and so it

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.960 
sections that are blotchy and so it
takes<00:07:16.470> a<00:07:16.650> lot<00:07:16.770> of<00:07:16.830> tries<00:07:17.220> in<00:07:17.460> order<00:07:17.640> to<00:07:17.730> get<00:07:17.850> the

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
takes a lot of tries in order to get the

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.120 
takes a lot of tries in order to get the
case<00:07:18.210> right<00:07:18.540> um<00:07:18.990> some<00:07:19.530> people<00:07:19.770> can<00:07:19.890> appreciate

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130 
case right um some people can appreciate

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.070 
case right um some people can appreciate
that<00:07:20.580> some<00:07:20.790> people<00:07:21.030> that<00:07:21.150> just<00:07:21.600> don't<00:07:21.810> I

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 
that some people that just don't I

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.370 
that some people that just don't I
believe<00:07:22.560> the<00:07:22.740> class<00:07:23.040> pier<00:07:23.430> is<00:07:23.580> ceramic<00:07:24.480> it's

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 
believe the class pier is ceramic it's

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.110 
believe the class pier is ceramic it's
shiny<00:07:25.680> and<00:07:25.860> I<00:07:26.010> think<00:07:26.190> they<00:07:26.280> said<00:07:26.490> ceramic<00:07:27.000> and

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 
shiny and I think they said ceramic and

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.170 
shiny and I think they said ceramic and
that<00:07:27.420> would<00:07:27.540> make<00:07:27.720> sense<00:07:28.490> very<00:07:29.490> unique<00:07:29.910> watch

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
that would make sense very unique watch

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.510 
that would make sense very unique watch
even<00:07:30.900> unique<00:07:31.350> for<00:07:31.620> Graham<00:07:31.860> which<00:07:32.100> is<00:07:32.220> a<00:07:32.250> unique

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 
even unique for Graham which is a unique

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.140 
even unique for Graham which is a unique
company<00:07:32.790> in<00:07:33.030> itself<00:07:33.330> these<00:07:34.170> are<00:07:34.320> very<00:07:34.560> rare

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
company in itself these are very rare

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.730 
company in itself these are very rare
it's<00:07:36.150> hard<00:07:36.540> to<00:07:36.660> find<00:07:36.930> these<00:07:37.110> and<00:07:37.380> I<00:07:37.500> doubt

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
it's hard to find these and I doubt

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.260 
it's hard to find these and I doubt
you'll<00:07:37.950> ever<00:07:38.010> see<00:07:38.340> anyone<00:07:38.520> that<00:07:38.670> has<00:07:38.910> one<00:07:39.150> of

you'll ever see anyone that has one of

you'll ever see anyone that has one of

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.130 
these things because swordfish watches

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.300 
these things because swordfish watches
are<00:07:41.370> not<00:07:42.240> super<00:07:42.690> common<00:07:43.110> and<00:07:43.290> this<00:07:43.770> swordfish

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310

Booster<00:07:45.030> iris<00:07:45.480> don't<00:07:45.810> ask<00:07:45.960> me<00:07:46.110> what<00:07:46.230> Booster

means because I don't know is it even

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.680 
means because I don't know is it even
more<00:07:49.500> rare<00:07:50.040> model<00:07:50.490> and<00:07:50.700> you<00:07:51.120> can<00:07:51.150> see<00:07:51.360> the<00:07:51.480> full
