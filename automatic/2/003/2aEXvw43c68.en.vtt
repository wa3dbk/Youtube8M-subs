00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
then there's only one place it can go

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.390 
then there's only one place it can go
it's<00:02:51.810> not<00:02:51.960> like<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.200> instantly<00:02:52.680> throw<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.190> or

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
