I<00:00:32.640> don't<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> think<00:00:33.000> call<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.170> maybe

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.819 
I don't know I think call it that maybe
it<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:34.860> doesn't<00:00:35.460> completely<00:00:36.239> explode<00:00:37.140> if

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it just doesn't completely explode if

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.280 
it just doesn't completely explode if
you<00:00:37.980> drop<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> be

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
you drop it but this is going to be

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.470 
you drop it but this is going to be
