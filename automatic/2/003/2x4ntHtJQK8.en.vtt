00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
denim-on-denim which is kind of a

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.099

popular<00:00:05.730> trend<00:00:06.089> that's<00:00:06.330> going<00:00:06.509> on<00:00:06.810> right<00:00:06.899> now

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
popular trend that's going on right now

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.350 
popular trend that's going on right now
cause<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.740> little<00:00:08.210> skeptical<00:00:09.210> at<00:00:09.330> first

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
cause a little skeptical at first

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.650 
cause a little skeptical at first
because<00:00:10.460> this<00:00:11.460> isn'ta<00:00:12.000> maybe<00:00:12.210> who<00:00:12.480> wears

because this isn'ta maybe who wears
denim<00:00:12.870> on<00:00:13.110> high<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.480> think<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.630> trick<00:00:15.990> is

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
denim on high I think the trick is

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.790 
denim on high I think the trick is
making<00:00:16.650> sure<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> denims<00:00:17.789> don't<00:00:18.180> match

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
making sure that the denims don't match

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.980 
making sure that the denims don't match
a<00:00:19.850> hundred<00:00:20.850> percent<00:00:22.189> washed<00:00:23.189> wise<00:00:23.600> so<00:00:24.600> if

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
a hundred percent washed wise so if

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.450 
a hundred percent washed wise so if
you're<00:00:25.140> watching<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.619> light<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.189> dark
