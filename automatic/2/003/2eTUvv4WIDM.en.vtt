00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.420
 well very good to everyone and today we visit 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.420
 a restaurant 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.890
 this abandonment is somewhat peculiar already 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.599
 that the entire structure of the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.079
 restaurants is also as if it were 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.329
 the castle both the facade and its 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.089
 interior is decorated as if it were a 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.100
 medieval castle and has a lot of 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.519
 small details that make it very interesting 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.519
 visit 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.800
 it's also quite strange because as 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.690
 I told you this was a restaurant but 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.750
 when we visited him we did not find the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.120
 kitchen some we do not know how they did 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.350
 for how he did it to serve the food 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.910
 to the customers that existed in that place 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.880
 now in the lower part of this had 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.030
 air made a soldier with everything from 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.300
 refrigerators and refrigerators where we assume 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.580
 who kept the food from the caterings 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.740
 that could be done there because it is that 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.200
 otherwise we do not understand as a restaurant 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.650
 I could serve food as I tell you without 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.650
 kitchen 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.079
 as you have seen is one more report 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.239
 short since the place is very small 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.930
 but I hope you liked it and 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.409
 until next time 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.409
 goodbye
