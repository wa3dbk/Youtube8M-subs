00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
she's reaching here and this lesson is

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.390 
she's reaching here and this lesson is

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.110 
going to be on playing pretty okay or
playing<00:00:06.270> major<00:00:07.069> so<00:00:08.069> we're<00:00:08.490> gonna<00:00:08.580> deal<00:00:08.880> with<00:00:08.910> a

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
playing major so we're gonna deal with a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.030 
playing major so we're gonna deal with a
scale<00:00:09.510> here<00:00:09.750> they<00:00:09.960> call<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.860> major

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
scale here they call the major

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.480 
scale here they call the major
pentatonic<00:00:11.429> which<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.740> smaller<00:00:13.740> version<00:00:14.009> of

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
pentatonic which is a smaller version of

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.109 
pentatonic which is a smaller version of
the<00:00:14.880> major<00:00:15.120> scale<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.430> let's<00:00:17.430> take<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> look<00:00:17.910> at

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the major scale and let's take a look at

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.590 
the major scale and let's take a look at
it<00:00:18.300> okay<00:00:18.890> so<00:00:19.890> first<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.430> all<00:00:20.580> let<00:00:21.270> me<00:00:21.300> tell<00:00:21.390> you

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
it okay so first of all let me tell you

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.120 
it okay so first of all let me tell you
one<00:00:21.779> thing<00:00:21.960> before<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.320> get<00:00:22.500> into<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.800> scale

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
one thing before we get into the scale

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.859 
one thing before we get into the scale
if<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.640> listen<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> these<00:00:24.480> three<00:00:24.750> notes<00:00:26.869> just

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
if you listen to these three notes just

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.980 
if you listen to these three notes just
to<00:00:28.109> draw<00:00:28.500> three<00:00:29.340> draw<00:00:29.449> natural<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.630> then<00:00:30.720> four

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
to draw three draw natural and then four

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.569 
to draw three draw natural and then four
draw<00:00:31.669> put<00:00:32.669> them<00:00:32.759> together<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.370> G

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
draw put them together you have a G

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.139 
draw put them together you have a G
chord<00:00:35.610> G<00:00:36.360> major<00:00:36.600> chord<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> now<00:00:41.879> we're<00:00:42.059> gonna

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
chord G major chord so now we're gonna

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.819 
chord G major chord so now we're gonna
learn<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> little<00:00:42.989> bit<00:00:43.110> about<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
learn like a little bit about that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.799 
learn like a little bit about that
so<00:00:44.610> triad<00:00:45.390> there<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.020> anyway<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.010> go<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
so triad there so anyway if we go up the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.900 
so triad there so anyway if we go up the
major<00:00:49.050> pentatonic<00:00:49.469> scale<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.670> we're<00:00:50.820> gonna

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
major pentatonic scale what we're gonna

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.290 
major pentatonic scale what we're gonna
do<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.329> go<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.230> draw

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
do is go from to draw

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.840 
do is go from to draw
two<00:00:55.079> three<00:00:55.320> draw<00:00:55.500> been<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.980> whole<00:00:56.280> step<00:00:56.579> it's

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
two three draw been a whole step it's

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.430 
two three draw been a whole step it's
hard<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.210> hit<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> middle<00:00:58.230> but

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
hard to hit it's right in the middle but

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.950 
hard to hit it's right in the middle but
once<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.040> you'll<00:00:59.160> get<00:00:59.309> used<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.610> it

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960
