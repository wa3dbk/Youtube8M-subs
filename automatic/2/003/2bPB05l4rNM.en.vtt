00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.480
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.830
 this new comment here up 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.000
 battlefield 3 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.470
 today I want to talk about a topic 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.509
 that on youtube has been treated 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.160
 quite but rather vague 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.840
 today, I don't want to focus 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.840
 only on this topic 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.550
 that is, I want to talk about graphics from 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.710
 graphics in video games especially in the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.570
 multiplayer games since I think it is 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.940
 a completely secondary aspect though 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.589
 from people to people in general or 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.690
 at least from what I hear from many 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.489
 my friends is always put first 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.930
 plan and from a wrong thing 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.540
 in fact being the developers 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.589
 aware of these things being 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.659
 aware of the fact that many people 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.159
 they look much more at the graphics than at 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.269
 gameplay that to the substance in my opinion 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.000
 they try a lot to work on appearance 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.920
 graphic however on the first impact that 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.010
 the graphics give you very often 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.890
 are video games that maybe offer a 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.390
 good first impact let's say looking at it 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.340
 so superficially that 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.259
 graphics can also look great 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.210
 perfect however they don't have to look into 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.220
 greater depth realizes there 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.740
 notices what the problems are with 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.270
 that technical department many games and 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.600
 this is happening recently 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.130
 phenomenon even in the most absurd series 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.040
 for example going to look at the series 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.530
 call of duty offering a good first 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.690
 impact in short, looking at it in a way 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.670
 hurried however looking more than the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.970
 landscape itself looks like a graphic 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.340
 excellent perfect but going to watch the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.690
 texture going to look at the polygons in 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.640
 general going to look at it in a manner 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.300
 more detailed that graphic section yes 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.740
 note that it is a graphic from many years ago 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.120
 while for example regarding 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.790
 battlefield 3 we say that 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.680
 developers have worked a lot on 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.240
 graphic sector especially for that 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.310
 concerning the trailers 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.140
 let's face it the graphic that came 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.700
 shown in the trailer is not the one 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.190
 actually we found ourselves in the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.099
 final version of the game especially 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.690
 as for the filters in the 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.940
 final version of battlefield 3 indeed 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.299
 wanted to insert this blue filter 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.640
 which tends increasingly to worsen the 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.860
 graphics were indeed 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.980
 in short, there has been much discussion in 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.830
 forum of the bar in the various forums from point of 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.030
 this problem of the problem that 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.520
 graphic of battlefield 3 gone to 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.780
 get worse after the alpha according to many e 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.970
 of the fact that precisely he went to 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.620
 create fx knows what is in fx 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.709
 let's talk about it for a moment for those who don't 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.140
 knew the fx has practically one 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.600
 let's call it color correction so 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.209
 try to improve try to take away 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.800
 this blue filter trying to show 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.590
 what is the true graphics of the game is 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.890
 already sure the improvement can be seen since 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.260
 immediately something absurd is something 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.930
 which I had never really seen second 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.239
 me 10 times even better than traders e 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.040
 the developers just searched 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.870
 in the trailers to bring up the graphics 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.930
 of battlefield 3 better than that 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.519
 actually many people are 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.680
 deceived they bought the 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.720
 game only for the graphics sector 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.370
 let's face it there are so many people 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.680
 who bought battlefield 3 is 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.420
 only for the graphics there are many 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.340
 people looking at a trader yes 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.860
 based solely on 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.510
 graphic because in the trailers what else 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.570
 they show you they show you the graphics 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.030
 an explosion two or three weapons so you 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.890
 they show some modalities and just don't 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.450
 they explain to you what the real ones are 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.340
 features of that game 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.380
 I could do the same example also for 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.209
 medal of honor warfighter game that you don't 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.269
 the game that many still have come out 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.040
 still many are judged 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.530
 people claim that medal of honor 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.049
 warfighter a beautiful game will be one 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.230
 cool, secure no matter how 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.150
 however, we will actually have 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.470
 evidence that it is a nice game we have 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.970
 showed all the weapons we have 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.890
 showed what the balance is but 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.150
 above all they showed us how many 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.120
 weapons are in the game 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.590
 because I remember medal of honor 2010 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.239
 game I bought game I have 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.310
 played both in singles persia in the 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.799
 multiplayer game that all in all 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.239
 liked, however, one of the things that I did not 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.160
 it was liked for nothing was the variety 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.510
 in fact it was an offer to the player 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.910
 only 13 and 14 weapons and for a game that 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.669
 I paid 50 euros sincerely too much 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.130
 however, coming back a little 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.139
 before the graphic speech I was talking about 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.020
 of filters 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.669
 vfx a blue filter and these things here 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.180
 but what are they actually gods 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.800
 filters 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.050
 let's say it's a filter can be 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.629
 compared to a color correction color 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.090
 correction that tries to make it appear in 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.740
 graphic level game better than 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.270
 what actually many 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.770
 developers in fact use the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.749
 gray filter filter which tends to render 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.689
 all much sharper from the textures 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:55.069
 to shadows to visibility in general 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.539
 it makes everything much sharper and makes 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.550
 look better than that 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.529
 that effectively or the filter 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.080
 green the filter that is used in 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.819
 crisis filter that tries to make everything 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.270
 the graphics of 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.620
 this game is very very one lit. 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.349
 graphic that tends to be a lot 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.719
 bright is very lively to see with 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.139
 very bright colors very beautiful from 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:16.879
 to see 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.110
 or beats filter using the 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.210
 blue filter let's say you can 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.800
 use multiple search filters 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.189
 to make the graphics look better than 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.860
 what is the ingenious use of 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:30.229
 this filter does render a graphic 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.150
 really much better than what of 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.069
 what we originally said 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.949
 that in every game we play 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:39.199
 there is a filter on a visual level a filter 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.810
 that we don't immediately see a filter 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.909
 than just looking carefully 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.319
 we realize that there is 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:50.120
 indeed indeed in many fashions 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:53.659
 comes for example for the so-called ecu 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.000
 mt crazy they are not done anything else 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.860
 if not use a gray filter al 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.479
 place of the green filter that renders 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.490
 really much better to the graphics 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.930
 anyway boys too 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.430
 comment is now at the end 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.319
 I hope this comment is there 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.419
 liked in general that this video 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:10.189
 it was to your liking 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.020
 I invite you to leave a comment on that 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:14.270
 what do you think of the second graphic 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.800
 you are more important than the graphics in a 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.020
 video game is more important than the gameplay 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.569
 enter completely into the background 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.520
 the graphics to switch to watch 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.990
 what is the gameplay let me know 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.789
 I thank you for your attention 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.379
 for members because I like it 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.509
 especially for having crossed the threshold 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:32.860
 of the 2 thousand registered and goodbye to a 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.860
 next commentaries
