00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
fun faxes to and planners so I

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.900 
fun faxes to and planners so I
remembered<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.350> flex<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> had<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.820> I

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
remembered this flex that I had and I

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.450 
remembered this flex that I had and I
barely<00:00:48.809> barely<00:00:49.110> used<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.950> mean<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:52.460> some

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
barely barely used it I mean I have some

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.850 
barely barely used it I mean I have some
stuff<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> I've<00:00:54.449> written<00:00:55.110> notes<00:00:55.590> on

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
stuff in here that I've written notes on

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.910 
stuff in here that I've written notes on
and<00:00:56.840> I'm<00:00:57.840> thinking<00:00:58.260> about<00:00:58.350> trying<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
and I'm thinking about trying to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.290 
and I'm thinking about trying to
incorporate<00:00:59.250> more<00:00:59.760> sort<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:01.850> menu<00:01:02.850> planning

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
incorporate more sort of menu planning

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.880 
incorporate more sort of menu planning
in<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.750> way<00:01:04.010> making<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.280> little<00:01:05.580> bit<00:01:05.729> more

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
in a way making a little bit more

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
in a way making a little bit more
freestyle<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:10.189> then<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.220> realized<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.360> it's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
freestyle and then I realized like it's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.859 
freestyle and then I realized like it's
flex<00:01:13.770> actually<00:01:14.610> has<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> really<00:01:15.240> nice<00:01:15.420> cover

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
flex actually has a really nice cover

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.830 
flex actually has a really nice cover
and<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.159> Midori's<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:18.299> use<00:01:18.600> these

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and I know the Midori's they use these

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.050 
and I know the Midori's they use these
little<00:01:19.170> elastics<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:21.170> hold<00:01:22.170> notebooks<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
little elastics to hold notebooks in so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.530 
little elastics to hold notebooks in so
I<00:01:24.090> thought<00:01:24.390> well<00:01:24.689> why<00:01:25.140> could<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.710> not<00:01:26.540> put

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
I thought well why could I not put

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.840 
I thought well why could I not put
ribbon<00:01:28.530> or<00:01:29.009> elastic<00:01:30.000> around<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.890> get

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
ribbon or elastic around here and get

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.830 
ribbon or elastic around here and get
notebooks<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:34.880> find<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.780> do

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
notebooks I just find it like if they do

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.140 
notebooks I just find it like if they do
with<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> Midori<00:01:37.920> notebook<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.970> could

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
with the Midori notebook so then I could

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.080 
with the Midori notebook so then I could
write<00:01:39.530> have<00:01:40.530> different<00:01:41.250> notebooks<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.820> here

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
write have different notebooks in here

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.410 
write have different notebooks in here
all<00:01:42.270> together<00:01:43.070> now<00:01:44.070> obviously<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.149> does

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
all together now obviously this one does

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
all together now obviously this one does
not<00:01:45.630> fit<00:01:46.790> but<00:01:47.790> I'm<00:01:48.720> sure<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.409> find

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
not fit but I'm sure that I can find

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
not fit but I'm sure that I can find
notebooks<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.549> fit<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.869> could

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
notebooks that fit in here that I could

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.910 
notebooks that fit in here that I could
bind<00:01:53.119> with<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.299> elastic<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.590> with

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
bind with the elastic like they do with

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.340 
bind with the elastic like they do with
the<00:01:55.979> Midori<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.969> right<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the Midori and right now I just have a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.580 
the Midori and right now I just have a
thin<00:01:58.649> ribbon<00:01:58.890> doing<00:01:59.430> it<00:02:00.049> binding<00:02:01.049> that's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
thin ribbon doing it binding that's

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.410 
thin ribbon doing it binding that's
notebook<00:02:01.979> together<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.579> they<00:02:03.149> definitely

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
notebook together but they definitely

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.050 
notebook together but they definitely
could<00:02:03.750> buy<00:02:04.469> some<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.920> those<00:02:05.009> elastics<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
could buy some of those elastics and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.880 
could buy some of those elastics and
find<00:02:07.099> more<00:02:08.099> notebooks<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.500> I'm

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
find more notebooks in it so I think I'm

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.440 
find more notebooks in it so I think I'm
gonna<00:02:11.039> try<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.580> out<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.000> see

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
gonna try that out and see

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.830 
gonna try that out and see
how<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.690> works<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.330> way<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> have

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
how that works and then that way I have

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.800 
how that works and then that way I have
a<00:02:15.900> place<00:02:16.170> for<00:02:16.250> multiple<00:02:17.390> notebooks<00:02:18.390> and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
a place for multiple notebooks and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.860 
a place for multiple notebooks and
note-taking<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.800> journaling<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.569> pink
