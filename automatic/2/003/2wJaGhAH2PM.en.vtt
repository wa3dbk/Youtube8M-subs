00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.309
 this is the new fujifilm and 2 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.200
 evolution of x1 that proposes a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.059
 trans hicks sensor and a bit of a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.060
 second generation processor and xr 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.340
 therefore improved in quality and also 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.109
 improved in computing power 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.420
 this translates into having a 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.070
 faster autofocus a sequence of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.349
 shooting up to 7 frames 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.309
 per second a continuous focus 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.840
 also in the sequence shot in lcd 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.969
 has been improved and in the cd with 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.559
 higher resolution and has been 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.980
 also introduced a new technology 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.530
 the lens ModNation optimiser in practice 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.600
 a film in fir makes and communicates with the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.860
 goals firmware and correct 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.660
 any defects 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.850
 however the complete presentation of 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.100
 you can find this machine on the site 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.629
 see in overlay 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.030
 all of us are now down 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.800
 features in practice and let's see 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.340
 what we can get with this 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.340
 new camera 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.069
 all
