00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.350 
used in the famous film Brighton rock
and<00:00:40.440> when<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:41.010> came<00:00:41.280> here<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.940> weather<00:00:42.149> was

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and when we came here the weather was

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
and when we came here the weather was
absolutely<00:00:42.570> hideous<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.040> cold<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910

absolutely hideous it was so cold and so
wet<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.360> rainy<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.410> think<00:00:46.680> although

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
wet and so rainy but I think although

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.620 
wet and so rainy but I think although
there's<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.250> atmospheric<00:00:47.790> feeling<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.420> the

photo it doesn't particularly come

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.680 
photo it doesn't particularly come
across<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.760> important<00:00:51.180> from<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> model<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
across it's important from the model to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.940 
across it's important from the model to
remember<00:00:52.020> no<00:00:52.200> matter<00:00:52.320> how<00:00:52.590> uncomfortable
