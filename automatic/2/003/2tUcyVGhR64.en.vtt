doing the profile on the outside now
with<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.099> bead<00:02:30.459> lock<00:02:30.670> we<00:02:31.420> have<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> lip<00:02:32.110> there's

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
with a bead lock we have a lip there's

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.350 
with a bead lock we have a lip there's
your<00:02:32.890> bead<00:02:33.069> lock<00:02:33.250> these<00:02:33.519> are<00:02:33.700> bolt<00:02:33.849> holes<00:02:34.090> but

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
your bead lock these are bolt holes but

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.330 
your bead lock these are bolt holes but
if<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.599> look<00:02:34.720> at<00:02:34.840> its<00:02:34.959> side<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.200> we've<00:02:36.040> got<00:02:36.310> a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
if you look at its side on we've got a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.130 
if you look at its side on we've got a
step<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.599> where<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> tire

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
step here and this is where the tire

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.100 
step here and this is where the tire
goes<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:39.340> what<00:02:39.519> I'm<00:02:39.610> about<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.849> do<00:02:40.060> now<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.870> put

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
goes so what I'm about to do now is put

00:02:41.110 --> 00:03:13.380 
goes so what I'm about to do now is put
that<00:02:41.290> step<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.860> this

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.210

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
barely making the outer cover to down

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.740 
barely making the outer cover to down
the<00:03:16.400> inner<00:03:16.670> for<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.940> big<00:03:17.120> lock<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:17.630> I've<00:03:17.720> just

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
the inner for the big lock so I've just

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.440 
the inner for the big lock so I've just
cut<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.230> center<00:03:18.440> out<00:03:18.560> done<00:03:19.460> the<00:03:19.580> relief<00:03:19.880> now

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
cut the center out done the relief now

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.930 
cut the center out done the relief now
I'm<00:03:20.510> just<00:03:20.690> about<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.900> do<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.230> outside<00:03:21.820> what<00:03:22.820> we

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
I'm just about to do the outside what we

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.370 
I'm just about to do the outside what we
want<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.180> try<00:03:23.300> and<00:03:23.390> do<00:03:23.630> is<00:03:23.840> get<00:03:24.020> it<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.260> look

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
want to try and do is get it to look

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
so what we want to try and do is we're

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.560 
so what we want to try and do is we're
just<00:03:31.860> gonna<00:03:31.950> make<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.190> duplicate<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.030> so

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
just gonna make a duplicate of this so

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.120 
just gonna make a duplicate of this so
it's<00:03:33.690> all<00:03:33.780> holes<00:03:33.990> this<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.530> little<00:03:34.680> reset

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
it's all holes this is the little reset

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.220 
it's all holes this is the little reset
so<00:03:35.940> from<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.330> billet<00:03:36.600> we're<00:03:36.750> gonna<00:03:36.870> try<00:03:37.110> and

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
so from the billet we're gonna try and

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.840 
so from the billet we're gonna try and
get<00:03:37.350> one<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:40.370> now<00:03:41.370> we've<00:03:41.550> got<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
get one like this so now we've got the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.240 
get one like this so now we've got the
inner<00:03:42.000> piece<00:03:42.300> here<00:03:42.630> we've<00:03:43.080> gone<00:03:43.350> round<00:03:43.620> we've

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
inner piece here we've gone round we've

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.220 
inner piece here we've gone round we've
sent<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.640> popped<00:03:44.910> all<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.240> holes<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:46.110> now

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
sent it popped all the holes so now

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.390 
sent it popped all the holes so now
we're<00:03:46.380> gonna<00:03:46.470> go<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.800> drill<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.130> tap<00:03:47.160> them

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
we're gonna go and drill and tap them

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.170 
we're gonna go and drill and tap them
out<00:03:48.770> so<00:03:49.770> now<00:03:49.920> we've<00:03:50.070> got<00:03:50.190> our<00:03:50.220> 14-inch<00:03:50.940> rim

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
out so now we've got our 14-inch rim

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.090 
out so now we've got our 14-inch rim
it's<00:03:51.810> all<00:03:51.930> been<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.440> rims<00:03:52.740> all<00:03:52.890> being

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
it's all been the rims all being

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.130 
it's all been the rims all being
machined<00:03:53.460> ready<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.910> lock<00:03:54.090> we've<00:03:54.900> got

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
machined ready for the lock we've got

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.920 
machined ready for the lock we've got
our<00:03:55.290> inner<00:03:55.590> all<00:03:55.800> made<00:03:56.040> I've<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.640> smart<00:03:56.970> between

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
our inner all made I've to smart between

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.510 
our inner all made I've to smart between
here<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:58.380> we<00:03:58.470> can<00:03:58.590> make<00:03:58.710> sure<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:58.920> valve<00:03:59.220> stem

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
here so we can make sure the valve stem

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.450 
here so we can make sure the valve stem
goes<00:03:59.730> in<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.000> middle<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:01.230> when<00:04:02.040> we've<00:04:02.190> got<00:04:02.340> the

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
goes in the middle so when we've got the

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.980 
goes in the middle so when we've got the
outer<00:04:02.610> on<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.150> can<00:04:03.300> still<00:04:03.540> reach<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.690> valve

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
outer on you can still reach the valve

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.720 
outer on you can still reach the valve
Cup<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:05.370> now<00:04:05.520> we<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:05.790> gotta<00:04:06.120> centralize<00:04:07.730> now

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
Cup so now we just gotta centralize now

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.370 
Cup so now we just gotta centralize now
we<00:04:08.820> just<00:04:08.970> got<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.120> centralize<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.870> rim<00:04:10.080> and

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
we just got to centralize the rim and

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.640 
we just got to centralize the rim and
start<00:04:10.680> welding<00:04:11.840> so<00:04:12.840> we<00:04:12.959> go<00:04:13.110> around<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.470> rim

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
start welding so we go around the rim

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.590 
start welding so we go around the rim
now<00:04:13.860> then<00:04:14.280> we<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.520> make<00:04:14.790> sure<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.270> it<00:04:15.420> is

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
now then we just make sure that it is

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.310 
now then we just make sure that it is
even<00:04:16.609> all<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.730> way<00:04:17.850> around<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.780> then<00:04:19.049> we<00:04:19.140> can

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
even all the way around and then we can

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.580 
even all the way around and then we can
start<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.709> weld<00:04:20.450> so<00:04:21.450> now<00:04:21.750> we<00:04:21.810> just<00:04:22.109> swelled<00:04:22.380> the

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
start to weld so now we just swelled the

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.670 
start to weld so now we just swelled the
inner<00:04:22.800> piece<00:04:23.130> onto<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.180> outer<00:04:24.390> piece<00:04:24.750> now

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
inner piece onto the outer piece now

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.930 
inner piece onto the outer piece now
while<00:04:25.830> we<00:04:25.920> go<00:04:26.010> so<00:04:26.220> now<00:04:26.370> I'll<00:04:26.580> just<00:04:26.610> continue

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
while we go so now I'll just continue

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.200 
while we go so now I'll just continue
welding<00:04:27.420> around<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:29.370> there<00:04:29.520> we<00:04:29.670> have<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:29.910> we've

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
welding around so there we have it we've

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.210 
welding around so there we have it we've
got<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.570> inner<00:04:30.780> piece<00:04:31.170> all<00:04:31.500> welded<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.190> the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
got the inner piece all welded to the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.650 
got the inner piece all welded to the
rim<00:04:35.390> and<00:04:37.160> there's<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.460> outer<00:04:38.700> piece<00:04:39.150> it's

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
rim and there's the outer piece it's

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.810 
rim and there's the outer piece it's
ready<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.990> go<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.440> what<00:04:40.770> were<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:40.980> doing<00:04:41.010> is
