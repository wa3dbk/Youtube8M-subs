00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.640
 this time I have to tell a story 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.700
 sad unfortunately due to the man of 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.880
 there are too many such stories 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.929
 is the story of the radi speaks you see it 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.279
 we are in this beautiful blue parrot 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.320
 1990 Well this is the last one 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.250
 documented sighting of a wing of 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.650
 speaks in nature sad true 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.240
 it was a male and being 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.000
 probably the last example 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.340
 wild for not being alone was 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 forced poor to join a group 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.530
 of area of blue parrots of another 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.450
 especially since then no other radis peak 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.399
 has been more sighted and the species is 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.340
 been declared try for a moment 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.079
 identify yourself no human being can 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
 never understand what it feels like to be the last 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.520
 of his own species not to find 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.079
 no one to share life with e 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.199
 for monogamous birds like the areas of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.270
 speaks this is particularly tragic 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.829
 a sad sad distress that man 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.829
 revealed to thousands of animal species 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.769
 as far as I'm concerned it's terrible 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.420
 think that an entire animal species 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.090
 can be erased from the face 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.150
 of the earth by man is horrible to me 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 think of this wonderful creature 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.220
 can not slip discharging candles of the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.220
 Brazil 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.470
 but let's get his name in order 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.659
 scientific and there were psita speaks in 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.799
 literally blue parrot of speaks 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.390
 this bird in fact takes its name 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.820
 by the German naturalist johann baptist 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.570
 phone speaks who first discovered it in the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.640
 1817 is the only representative of the genus 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.890
 cyan psita belongs to the order of i 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.289
 psychotropic drugs family of hitachi ips 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.119
 di looks like an ara from 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.030
 size not very big but anyway 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:14.190
 respectable having a length of 55 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:18.299
 57 cm a wingspan of about 64 cm e 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.069
 a weight that is around 250 300 grams 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.410
 the head is almost clear blue 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.910
 whitish that goes darkening towards the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.360
 low becoming a wonderful blue 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.040
 the lower parts are brilliant on the tail 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.470
 wings are even darker while 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.540
 beak and legs are black near 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.000
 eyes has an area of â€‹â€‹hairless skin 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.700
 black in adults and clear in young people 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.470
 the light silver iris 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.860
 in short, summarizing it is a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.810
 Stunning parrot is a very species 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.030
 long lived like almost all the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.220
 parrots unfortunately not much is known 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.810
 of his habits in nature except that 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.790
 a copy often remained a unit for the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.530
 life and used as a shelter cavity 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.220
 natural trees in which the female 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.690
 which generally placed two or three eggs 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.120
 lara of speaks fed on fruit and 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.430
 seeds and populated some areas of Brazil 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.980
 characterized by karting to a 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.569
 this arid forest habitat 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.459
 parrot was tied a species 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.739
 particular of trees la cara and beira 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.560
 in whose natural ravines it was usual 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.150
 nest lara of speaks is never 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.889
 was widespread but already at the beginning 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.410
 of the twentieth century its population 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.310
 it was rather small and confined to 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.310
 brazilian state of bahia 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.250
 the main reason was the 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.569
 massive destruction of forests 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.389
 systematically operated by man for 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.040
 create pastures and crops lara ha 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.600
 seen its habitat disappear 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.829
 in short, as if someone started 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.540
 destroy our homes and ours 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.370
 palaces and me we no longer had a place 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.780
 where to live 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.940
 not pleased the man introduced into 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.109
 that area the bees Africanized one 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.200
 hybrid species that in nature does not 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.700
 it would exist particularly aggressive 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.319
 these weapons unfortunately built the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.569
 hives just not used cavities 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.960
 from areas to change and pulse a 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.420
 death 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.610
 in adventurous parrots the blow of 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.400
 thanks to the aradi speaks however he came with 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.960
 direct withdrawals in kind which 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.450
 translated into plain words means 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.320
 continuous capture purpose of 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.880
 marketing 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.350
 in short, the poor areas came 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.900
 caught in large numbers and in a manner 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.810
 pitiless from poachers to come later 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.130
 some rich men sold for gold 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.530
 after all, even today it is very fashionable 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.970
 for some idiots exhibit animals 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.190
 exotic endangered at home 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.910
 own and before in the past it was still 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.520
 worse 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.990
 you know that satisfaction, in short, already towards 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.500
 the eighties to the areas of speaks in 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.060
 nature were few tens in 1990 came 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.210
 spotted the last free specimen 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.760
 male who then die 2000 a female 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.170
 released in 1995 it caused the loss of 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.880
 own tracks 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.180
 as I said in 2001 the most species 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.490
 declared extinct in the wild 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.050
 today only a hundred remain 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.040
 area of living speaks on the face 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.830
 of the earth 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.270
 all in captivity and are all used 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.580
 for reproduction programs 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.230
 most of them are in a 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.730
 specialized center in qatar where 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.920
 some scientists are doing 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.270
 literally everything to increase the 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.800
 number 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.390
 unfortunately when the population of one 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.100
 species is decimated and falls 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.440
 below a certain threshold a threshold 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.170
 criticism we say occurs on 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.670
 so-called bottleneck effect 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.380
 there is a drastic impoverishment of the 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.600
 genetic material available to the 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.340
 species that makes it less adaptable to 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.570
 environmental changes and that makes a lot 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.820
 more likely crosses between 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.470
 consanguineous with the consequent 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.480
 possible manifestation of diseases 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.760
 genetics relegated to excessive gender or 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.870
 if all goes well, the birth of specimens 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.870
 weak or weak 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.740
 in short, under a certain threshold the species 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.300
 is practically doomed 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.430
 yet these scientists are 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.830
 trying all crossing with the 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.690
 assisted reproduction specimens with DNA 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.460
 the more different the more compatible 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.460
 possible to reduce these risks 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.460
 the purpose would be to be able to 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.110
 introduce some tens in nature 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.680
 areas in the coming years presumably 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.900
 by 2030 yet it was once 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.400
 introduced spitz areas in nature 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.070
 how much time will pass before they come 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.690
 destroyed other forests how much time 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.860
 will pass before they are captured by 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.340
 new to other poachers without 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.520
 scruples 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.680
 polini is the head of the breed 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.330
 human that must change and until not 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.370
 we will realize that other creatures 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.690
 they are more important than money 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.960
 many other animals will come to an end 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.790
 of the radi speaks I am skeptical about 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.710
 human race but it is also true that it exists 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.600
 a pressure with a heart as big as 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.820
 these scientists who are dedicating 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.060
 all their lives to save a species 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.740
 put in grave danger by other men 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.690
 I really hope you enjoy it 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.020
 aradis peak may return one day to 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.190
 fly free 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.190
 but we will never learn the lesson
