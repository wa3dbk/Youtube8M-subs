00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.589
 yes how good is the sony x100 at low 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.940
 light here I am in the nocturnal forest 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.550
 Do you have some cups of lamps? 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.540
 set me up and in the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.700
 first video we had already shown 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.020
 how the wlan control works and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.699
 I want this now at night 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.710
 So demonstrate the same 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.660
 So you can per smart device annually 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.609
 an ipad mini is synonymous with android 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.830
 devices 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.400
 yes the x100 but only control 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:36.300
 looking for and now go 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.739
 I once a wide angle so maximum 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.989
 wide angle and now again in the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.090
 order has already shown me but 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.219
 works well at night 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.420
 autofocus does not have to be sharp now either 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.579
 I'm not like that either 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.660
 dark but still, after all, 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.100
 works quite well exposure can 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.629
 Unfortunately, I do not continue to change it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.649
 I can start the recording and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.420
 of course I stop them now 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.890
 started but how good is the sony then 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.870
 me only at night but in the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.540
 dusk for example i go there 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.250
 now an elbstrand to 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.610
 sunset and let's have a look 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.100
 how sony works from 1 yes and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.759
 here at sunset little light and 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.780
 Here's the x100 a super and her 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.780
 Direction sun to the downfall of the swivel 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.189
 Here I would like to start with the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.450
 imagine image effects he will 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:41.149
 not done so there is here 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:44.719
 Bildeffekten menu and there are 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:50.270
 various pens camera head have a reputation 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:52.610
 terry station retro photo and camera 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.429
 internal image effects and the part 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.259
 maybe that's how the effect can be 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.509
 So that is now without picture effect and 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.209
 listen effect pay attention to it 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.630
 bit replace perhaps by 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.630
 camera 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:17.900
 Hop have very fleeting effect 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.900
 I only find that in San Pedro Foto 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.910
 it does not burn too hard from the rocky 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.670
 Part phase 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.670
 that may well now a bit on the 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.700
 Building site 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.220
 and now the direct comparison 100% 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.570
 excerpt from the kika video and her 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.600
 pedro foto has a nice tradition like 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.700
 I think so and here I am at one 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.310
 lighthouse and there is one 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.240
 cross spider caught or in the net 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.890
 So I built up very little light 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.630
 Last dusk simply the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.650
 sun is already set 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.709
 So we have blue hour here and yes 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:10.280
 that works very well, I think 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:14.700
 here with the sony as 100 extreme 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.970
 Close range and here 100 percent seen 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.880
 every breeze changes the sharpness 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.650
 Of course, this is easy to do here 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.070
 active citizen built door machine i 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.570
 times at a boat left and see the same 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.660
 74 kw / 100 corp here I am at 18 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.870
 the triple is about iso 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:41.340
 3.200 so at 100% view already begins 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.300
 to rush and here without impression 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.989
 from the bank of the Elbe 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.390
 so has seen live on the spot and around 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.220
 now a healthy it will be brightened up as 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.950
 is brighter than I saw on the spot 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.390
 and at 100 percent you can see the 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.160
 autofocus is already a bit on 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.060
 points 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:03.020
 that's about 6400 iso 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.390
 so I draw with the ise but I design 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.460
 I see more here than I live 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.720
 On the spot I saw something like that 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.520
 glory then in the shade 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.330
 now it's time to go into the 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.489
 city which says again small city 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:23.450
 The car now has the zone 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:26.020
 atomic on it and think that 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.600
 Everything was very beautiful 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.070
 on takes focus has turned on here 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.430
 no problem 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.320
 all character also still this 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.320
 very good in terms of what the budget 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.050
 then I'm on a fast road 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.050
 here 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.570
 and let the autofocus workers so 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.930
 the light circles seen personnel 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.050
 blur circles and hero autofocus yet 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.860
 a whole while until he is like that 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.180
 has reasonably asked with sharp 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.900
 but also the blur parts have fallen 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.270
 me very good 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:10.910
 we are very harmonious we 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:13.370
 of course, but with open aperture now 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.160
 times a direct comparison between the 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:21.560
 eos 5d mark three which see directly with 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:25.190
 the sole 1 100 on a round motive and 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:29.000
 now at the bottom left the 5.3 in iso final value 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:33.759
 and right-handed sony x100 also in iso 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:39.050
 final value and 53 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:43.099
 6400 52 talk now in 6400 a 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.250
 screen and here I am now in 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.840
 decibel misses that corresponds approximately 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.569
 6,400 and here I should have a few 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.349
 decibel values ​​and now the 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:06:01.340
 direct comparison here the sony x100e so 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:04.610
 So you have 33 mates and you have here 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:08.090
 the five theme violence is 25,600 and 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.710
 children can be directly compared this 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.710
 without him very well paid as I think 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.720
 and the four carl court the rush 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.600
 of course a bit but if you want that 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.430
 escalating to full-hd looks the same 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.170
 out and the crime surprised me 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.170
 so clearly planned today 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.850
 less than a 5.3 but that 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.680
 Noise is not essential 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.500
 worse 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.920
 that is, that is so sorry to behave 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.760
 comparable to a full-format sensor 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.950
 and here again in the nature 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.010
 100% kropp this with prematurely 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:49.910
 Flashlights lit up well at 100 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:52.580
 had a pond here again 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.160
 or waidsee scene with 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.520
 grasses and here a direct comparison 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.100
 to the camcorder canon g10 a very 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.140
 more popular and also very bright and 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:09.440
 here the direct comparison left the 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:12.220
 sony canon hf g10 since the canon cuts 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.440
 camcorder not so bad off so here 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:18.500
 identical values 40 and right now 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.860
 again the Sony Ericsson hundred mark 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.050
 Two , it is not so bad 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.090
 has the same sensor in principle and 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.740
 Do not rush too chooses me more like this 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.260
 and now at the end of it out here 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.850
 smart device control that i can use 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.130
 for example not at night in 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.360
 wide with flashlights work there 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.100
 of course I have the super 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.460
 image control when I here the 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:43.010
 wlan function differently without x100 use 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.670
 The whole thing looks very good, I think 

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:51.190
 nice out question the sony x100 is so 

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.190
 Great for low light too
