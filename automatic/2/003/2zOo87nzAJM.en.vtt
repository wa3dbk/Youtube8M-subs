00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.350
 hi what terms youtube like is the 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.200
 this place is missing 90 with a new video 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.730
 same friends this time we bring a 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.160
 tweet said that the truth is very father 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.840
 I liked it very much until I shared it 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.820
 with the people of the canal as you can see 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.010
 what is the part of the mixed eye your 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.020
 bar I have another little bar that 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.910
 it shows a very different information 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.050
 this is called home display and it is mounted 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.910
 Well, what is the use ? 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.590
 they work and basically what he does is 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.570
 this nothing else is not created a bar more 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.160
 in the when it shows information like 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.970
 can appreciate what the date is like 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.100
 and it also shows us what is our 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.650
 Current temperature using the application 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.790
 native that can be updated and 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.530
 also what this one like they can 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.750
 appreciate the song that is playing in 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.430
 those moments that is in spotify that as 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.589
 can appreciate that is what I am 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.600
 reproducing and in this part of here not 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.220
 they can show it very easily when 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.900
 let's create a menu throughout the menu 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.089
 judge accede musician can see here 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.350
 it is called with display the functions 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.390
 the truth is very basic 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.340
 enable it is enable it to follow the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.560
 development of adventure in what is the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.810
 support or feedback of the application or 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.550
 tweet and if you want to donate something additional 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.710
 because it has a cost but it does not have 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.180
 configuration actions that's all 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.800
 as always you have to enter like this and there 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.120
 to wait for it to finish loading or 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.500
 that his girlfriend does not have to see if 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.850
 it's just going to walk looking for 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.530
 be on the bottom right and go 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.420
 to look for home display as it appears 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.190
 at the top this has a cost 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.260
 of 2 dollars in the re power and watts and of 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.760
 the breaststroke seems a high cost for what 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.050
 what it does but good as you want 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.340
 remember to always check the description 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.720
 of the video in the part of up down is 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.980
 very important to do so because 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.240
 I always leave some sources in you 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.070

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.570
 free and good you want to ensure 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.160
 correct operation or could the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.570

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.100
