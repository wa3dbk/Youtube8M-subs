the next step in technology is 120 Hertz
means<00:01:38.549> 120<00:01:39.329> frames<00:01:39.540> per<00:01:39.750> second<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.650> didn't<00:01:40.920> we

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
means 120 frames per second we didn't we

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.370 
means 120 frames per second we didn't we

240 now there are two ways to make 241
is<00:01:46.979> create<00:01:47.549> another<00:01:47.850> 120<00:01:48.720> frames<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:49.740> you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
is create another 120 frames so now you

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.649 
is create another 120 frames so now you
start<00:01:50.130> with<00:01:50.220> 60<00:01:50.549> frames<00:01:50.820> input<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.450> TV

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
start with 60 frames input but the TV

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.130 
start with 60 frames input but the TV
makes<00:01:52.070> 180<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.310> its<00:01:53.490> own<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:54.090> 240<00:01:54.780> frames<00:01:54.869> so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
makes 180 on its own for 240 frames so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.350 
makes 180 on its own for 240 frames so
75%<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> frames<00:01:56.399> are<00:01:56.549> made<00:01:56.610> by<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.939> TV

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
75% of the frames are made by the TV

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.060 
75% of the frames are made by the TV
well<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.170> method<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.799> really

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
well that's one method you can really

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.709 
well that's one method you can really
get<00:01:59.250> rid<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.430> motion<00:01:59.820> blur<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.149> way<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.600> if

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
get rid of motion blur that way but if

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.330 
get rid of motion blur that way but if
you<00:02:00.780> don't<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.170> properly<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.159> also

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
you don't do it properly you can also

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.819 
you don't do it properly you can also
add<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.729> artifacts<00:02:03.149> at<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.360> same<00:02:03.540> time

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
add in artifacts at the same time

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.069 
add in artifacts at the same time
another<00:02:04.829> method<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.460> create<00:02:06.030> 120<00:02:06.869> frames

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
another method is to create 120 frames

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.499 
another method is to create 120 frames
but<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:08.250> backlight<00:02:08.729> scanning<00:02:08.759> or<00:02:09.360> back

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
but then do backlight scanning or back

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.660 
but then do backlight scanning or back
like<00:02:09.690> blinking<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.560> creates<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.190> effect<00:02:11.280> in

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
like blinking this creates the effect in

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.430 
like blinking this creates the effect in
your<00:02:11.790> mind<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:12.690> are<00:02:12.780> two<00:02:12.930> frames<00:02:13.200> for

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
your mind that there are two frames for

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.880 
your mind that there are two frames for
every<00:02:13.650> act

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
every act

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.440 
every act
existing<00:02:14.460> frame<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.030> get<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> same

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
existing frame so you get the same

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.020 
existing frame so you get the same
motion<00:02:15.960> benefits<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.620> having<00:02:17.040> 240<00:02:17.730> actual

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
motion benefits of having 240 actual

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.490 
motion benefits of having 240 actual
frames<00:02:18.270> but<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.720> don't<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.900> any<00:02:19.050> risk<00:02:19.350> of

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
frames but you don't have any risk of

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.770 
frames but you don't have any risk of
any<00:02:19.590> motion<00:02:20.040> blur<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.850> basically<00:02:21.360> to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
any motion blur and it basically to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.240 
any motion blur and it basically to
anyone<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.319> going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.620> look<00:02:22.740> exactly<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.160> same

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
anyone is going to look exactly the same

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.240 
anyone is going to look exactly the same
either<00:02:24.120> way<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.420> try<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.810> do<00:02:24.990> 240<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:26.040> have

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
either way you try to do 240 so we have

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.490 
either way you try to do 240 so we have
the<00:02:26.490> full<00:02:26.940> matrix<00:02:27.150> local<00:02:27.660> dimming<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:28.319> have

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the full matrix local dimming we have

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.949 
the full matrix local dimming we have
the<00:02:28.650> clear<00:02:28.950> scan<00:02:29.250> 240<00:02:30.030> we<00:02:30.480> have<00:02:30.600> what<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:30.780> call

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
the clear scan 240 we have what we call

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.260 
the clear scan 240 we have what we call
crystal<00:02:31.440> coat<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.100> screen<00:02:32.310> crystal<00:02:33.090> coat

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
crystal coat on this screen crystal coat

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.370 
crystal coat on this screen crystal coat
means<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.810> don't<00:02:33.870> have<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.050> worry<00:02:34.260> about

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
means that you don't have to worry about

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.770 
means that you don't have to worry about
the<00:02:34.709> lighting<00:02:35.010> environment<00:02:35.280> for<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> TV<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.450> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the lighting environment for the TV in a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.930 
the lighting environment for the TV in a
dark<00:02:37.020> room<00:02:37.110> they<00:02:37.770> all<00:02:37.980> look<00:02:38.190> pretty<00:02:38.250> good<00:02:38.670> as

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
dark room they all look pretty good as

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.170 
dark room they all look pretty good as
far<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.410> contrast<00:02:40.410> but<00:02:41.310> if<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.580> get<00:02:41.970> into<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
far as contrast but if you get into a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.370 
far as contrast but if you get into a
bright<00:02:42.600> room<00:02:42.810> when<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.020> have<00:02:43.110> loved<00:02:43.260> an

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
bright room when you have loved an

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.080 
bright room when you have loved an
ambient<00:02:43.739> room<00:02:43.890> light<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.760> get<00:02:44.880> some

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
ambient room light you can get some

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.760 
ambient room light you can get some
amount<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.480> wash<00:02:45.690> out<00:02:45.959> not<00:02:46.170> as<00:02:46.260> much<00:02:46.410> as<00:02:46.470> plasma

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
amount of wash out not as much as plasma

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.040 
amount of wash out not as much as plasma
but<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.580> LCD<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.090> can<00:02:48.209> still<00:02:48.420> get<00:02:48.540> some<00:02:48.810> amount

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
but on LCD you can still get some amount

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.750 
but on LCD you can still get some amount
of<00:02:49.080> wash<00:02:49.320> out<00:02:49.530> from<00:02:49.709> ambient<00:02:50.010> light<00:02:50.310> with

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
of wash out from ambient light with

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.460 
of wash out from ambient light with
crystal<00:02:51.120> coat<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.510> light<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.810> reflected<00:02:52.290> off

the only TV around with Dolby volume so
if<00:03:10.980> you've<00:03:11.100> ever<00:03:11.190> been<00:03:11.280> annoyed<00:03:11.700> by<00:03:11.940> loud

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
if you've ever been annoyed by loud

if you've ever been annoyed by loud
commercials<00:03:12.750> or<00:03:13.260> what's<00:03:13.680> changing<00:03:14.040> stations

and you get very loud or very low
stations<00:03:17.880> Dolby<00:03:18.450> volume<00:03:18.780> takes<00:03:19.019> care<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.320> that

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
stations Dolby volume takes care of that

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.530 
stations Dolby volume takes care of that
for<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.920> if<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.430> station<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.820> too<00:03:20.940> loud<00:03:21.120> it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
for you if the station is too loud it

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.720 
for you if the station is too loud it
brings<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.900> down<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.650> station<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.040> too<00:03:23.130> low<00:03:23.340> it

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
brings it down the station is too low it

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.550 
brings it down the station is too low it
brings<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.180> up<00:03:24.329> but<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.110> not<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> simple

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
brings it up but it's not a simple

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.770 
brings it up but it's not a simple
attenuator<00:03:26.250> what<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.820> does<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.239> keeps<00:03:27.570> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
attenuator what it does is it keeps the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.780 
attenuator what it does is it keeps the
quality<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.410> sound<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.579> mix

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
quality of the sound so this is the mix

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.460 
quality of the sound so this is the mix
of<00:03:29.910> bass<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.299> treble<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.690> kept<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.049> any<00:03:31.230> given

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
of bass and treble is kept in any given

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.380 
of bass and treble is kept in any given
sound<00:03:31.950> level<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.489> really<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.850> only<00:03:32.970> system

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
sound level it's really the only system

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.880 
sound level it's really the only system
that<00:03:33.450> does<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.110> we're<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.500> only<00:03:34.590> TV

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
that does that and we're the only TV

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.069 
that does that and we're the only TV
that<00:03:35.190> has<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.670> we<00:03:36.030> have<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.209> full<00:03:36.480> complement

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
that has this we have a full complement

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.350 
that has this we have a full complement
of<00:03:37.170> inputs<00:03:37.590> not<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.250> do<00:03:38.610> we<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.820> four<00:03:39.030> hdmi

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
of inputs not just do we have four hdmi

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.340 
of inputs not just do we have four hdmi
s<00:03:39.600> but<00:03:40.200> but<00:03:40.530> they<00:03:40.709> are<00:03:40.860> fast<00:03:41.640> hdmis<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.260> you

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
s but but they are fast hdmis and so you

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.840 
s but but they are fast hdmis and so you
don't<00:03:43.410> have<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.650> worry<00:03:43.799> about<00:03:43.920> five<00:03:44.340> or<00:03:44.640> six

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
don't have to worry about five or six

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.880 
don't have to worry about five or six
second<00:03:45.360> switching<00:03:45.750> we<00:03:46.049> have<00:03:46.200> instant<00:03:46.560> port<00:03:46.739> so

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
second switching we have instant port so

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.229 
second switching we have instant port so
they're<00:03:47.040> almost<00:03:47.160> immediate<00:03:47.850> switching

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
they're almost immediate switching

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.220 
they're almost immediate switching
between<00:03:48.329> hdmi<00:03:49.170> ports<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:50.250> have<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.790> are<00:03:51.420> passed

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
between hdmi ports we have I are passed

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.780 
between hdmi ports we have I are passed
through<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.739> can<00:03:52.980> hide<00:03:53.130> your<00:03:53.280> components

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
through so you can hide your components

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.060 
through so you can hide your components

even better we have resolution plus so

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.120 
even better we have resolution plus so

super-resolution technology you have to

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.390 
super-resolution technology you have to
see<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.019> believe<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.890> don't<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:23.250> would

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
see it to believe it you don't you would

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.250 
see it to believe it you don't you would
think<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.729> content<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.270> actually<00:04:24.720> full<00:04:24.870> HD

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
think the content is actually full HD

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.830 
think the content is actually full HD
even<00:04:25.800> though<00:04:25.890> it's<00:04:26.039> coming<00:04:26.310> in

even though it's coming in

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.990 
even though it's coming in
level<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:27.590> super<00:04:27.919> resolution<00:04:28.040> is<00:04:28.550> is<00:04:28.699> really

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
level so super resolution is is really

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.790
