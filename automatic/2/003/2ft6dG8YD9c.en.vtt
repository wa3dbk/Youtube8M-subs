end up going anywhere actually it pretty

end up going anywhere actually it pretty
much<00:01:21.450> flopped<00:01:21.920> but<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.340> did<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:24.120> us<00:01:24.300> in<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
much flopped but it did get us in the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.990 
much flopped but it did get us in the
door<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.530> thinking<00:01:25.980> about<00:01:26.250> how<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.490> build<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
door and thinking about how to build a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.200 
door and thinking about how to build a
business<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:28.830> wasn't<00:01:29.070> until<00:01:29.340> Tim<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.150> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
business and it wasn't until Tim and I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
business and it wasn't until Tim and I
went<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> graduate<00:01:30.990> school<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.190> were

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
went to graduate school that we were

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.969 
went to graduate school that we were
able<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.550> focus<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:33.659> second<00:01:34.320> product<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
able to focus on a second product and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.610 
able to focus on a second product and
that<00:01:35.850> product<00:01:36.150> focused<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.409> three

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
that product focused on one of the three

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.320 
that product focused on one of the three
areas<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.190> are<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.729> important<00:01:39.180> reef

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
areas that are really important reef

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.380 
areas that are really important reef
aquariums<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.200> flow<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:42.150> need<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
aquariums and that's flow you need to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
aquariums and that's flow you need to
create<00:01:42.780> flow<00:01:43.200> within<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> aquarium<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.340> you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
create flow within the aquarium like you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.330 
create flow within the aquarium like you
have<00:01:44.640> currents<00:01:45.150> in<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> ocean<00:01:45.720> all<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.010> pumps

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
have currents in the ocean all the pumps

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.280 
have currents in the ocean all the pumps
and<00:01:47.520> reef<00:01:47.880> aquariums<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.659> aquariums<00:01:49.170> in

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
and reef aquariums and aquariums in

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.370 
and reef aquariums and aquariums in
general<00:01:49.710> had<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> motor<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.150> stator<00:01:51.510> inside

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
general had a motor and a stator inside

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.260 
general had a motor and a stator inside
of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> tank

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
of the tank

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.990 
of the tank
Justin<00:01:54.270> had<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.659> breakthrough<00:01:55.350> idea<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.159> okay

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
Justin had the breakthrough idea of okay

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030 
Justin had the breakthrough idea of okay
let's<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.479> put<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.930> motor<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> outside

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
let's just put the motor on the outside

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.460 
let's just put the motor on the outside
of<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.220> tank<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.760> that<00:02:00.450> allowed<00:02:00.990> us<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.200> try

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
of the tank and that allowed us to try

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.890 
of the tank and that allowed us to try
to<00:02:01.530> prototype<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.150> we<00:02:03.479> built<00:02:03.720> something

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
to prototype it so we built something

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.469 
to prototype it so we built something
called<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> vortex<00:02:04.560> propeller<00:02:05.159> pump<00:02:05.479> this

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
called the vortex propeller pump this

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.809 
called the vortex propeller pump this
pump<00:02:06.840> was<00:02:07.020> unique<00:02:07.350> because<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.950> works<00:02:08.369> through

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
pump was unique because it works through

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.330 
pump was unique because it works through
the<00:02:08.939> gramm<00:02:09.420> glass<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:10.799> have<00:02:10.979> here<00:02:11.250> is

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
the gramm glass so what we have here is

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.119 
the gramm glass so what we have here is
a<00:02:11.370> motor<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.599> propeller<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.290> there's<00:02:13.920> two

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
a motor and a propeller and there's two

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.070 
a motor and a propeller and there's two
magnets<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.849> each<00:02:15.060> side<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.659> have<00:02:15.870> two<00:02:16.049> poles

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
magnets on each side that have two poles

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.660 
magnets on each side that have two poles
and<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.260> clamps<00:02:17.680> on<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.010> aquarium<00:02:18.490> and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
and that clamps on to the aquarium and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.660 
and that clamps on to the aquarium and
allows<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.840> create<00:02:20.620> flow<00:02:21.070> within<00:02:21.520> the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
allows you to create flow within the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.200 
allows you to create flow within the
tank<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:23.260> pulsing<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.340> flow<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.910> going

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
tank that pulsing and that flow is going

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.450 
tank that pulsing and that flow is going
to<00:02:25.330> bring<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.960> corals<00:02:26.410> nutrients<00:02:27.190> and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
to bring the corals nutrients and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.040 
to bring the corals nutrients and
chemicals<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.970> they<00:02:28.240> need<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.690> take<00:02:28.810> away

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
chemicals that they need and take away

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.260 
chemicals that they need and take away
their<00:02:29.200> waste<00:02:29.580> that's<00:02:30.580> really<00:02:30.820> going<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.030> drive
