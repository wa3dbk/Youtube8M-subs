Crabtree he was was very you know he was
a<00:02:38.360> pioneer<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:39.319> well<00:02:39.530> they<00:02:40.040> were<00:02:40.099> they<00:02:40.400> were

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
a pioneer as well they were they were

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.550 
a pioneer as well they were they were
taking<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.299> ideas<00:02:41.720> from<00:02:41.840> America<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.470> I'd

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
taking the ideas from America that I'd

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.500 
taking the ideas from America that I'd
all<00:02:43.010> France<00:02:43.340> should<00:02:43.519> franchised<00:02:44.239> up<00:02:44.360> in<00:02:44.450> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
all France should franchised up in the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.690 
all France should franchised up in the
50s<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.930> 60s<00:02:45.349> and<00:02:45.590> then<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.430> don't<00:02:46.580> obviously

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
50s and 60s and then you don't obviously

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.040 
50s and 60s and then you don't obviously
it's<00:02:47.000> gone<00:02:47.180> full<00:02:47.420> circle<00:02:47.599> again<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.230> know<00:02:48.349> so
