 I noticed that kiko enamels I really like dark colors 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.810
 while I find it bad with the light colors that I think they tend to do those 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.399
 unsightly reading 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.570
 the fact that the politicians have made the enamels of the 

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:16.810
 kiko, however, I liked them 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.810

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.620
 I'm another color that I really like about this brand here 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.909

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.749
 when you pass here 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:48.979

 good part
