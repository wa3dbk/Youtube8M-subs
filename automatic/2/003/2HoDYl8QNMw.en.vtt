00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
audience than just maybe you know

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:40.539 
audience than just maybe you know
first-time<00:01:32.539> by<00:01:32.720> fire

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.920 

we

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:58.530 

you

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.810 

so<00:01:59.540> what<00:01:59.660> we've<00:01:59.810> done<00:01:59.900> here<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.350> complete<00:02:00.980> r1

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
so what we've done here is a complete r1

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.360 
so what we've done here is a complete r1

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
for an end it had to be lengthened so in

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.190 
for an end it had to be lengthened so in
the<00:02:04.520> end<00:02:04.640> we<00:02:05.060> only<00:02:05.240> dropped<00:02:05.510> two<00:02:05.780> inches<00:02:06.050> up

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
the end we only dropped two inches up

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.690
