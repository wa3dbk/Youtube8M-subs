00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.550 
what I hate a 68 overall card that
shouldn't<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> gold<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.750> stupid<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
shouldn't be a gold it's just stupid and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.249 
shouldn't be a gold it's just stupid and
it's<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> two<00:01:38.790> guys<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> get<00:01:39.659> now<00:01:39.930> get

tackle Andre Smith and he also has an 86
overall<00:04:04.440> elite<00:04:04.950> which<00:04:05.160> will<00:04:05.340> probably<00:04:05.610> drop

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
overall elite which will probably drop

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.880 
overall elite which will probably drop
in<00:04:06.210> price<00:04:06.480> but<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:06.900> andre<00:04:07.410> smith<00:04:07.680> is

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
in price but this andre smith is

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.610 
in price but this andre smith is
actually<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.280> nice<00:04:08.520> card<00:04:08.910> low<00:04:09.660> awareness<00:04:10.020> but

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
actually a nice card low awareness but

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.949 
actually a nice card low awareness but
it<00:04:10.740> means<00:04:10.950> he's<00:04:11.340> got<00:04:11.580> good<00:04:12.000> blocking<00:04:12.390> stats

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
it means he's got good blocking stats

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.160 
it means he's got good blocking stats
really<00:04:13.530> nice<00:04:13.740> run<00:04:14.070> blocker<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.940> pretty<00:04:15.930> nice

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
really nice run blocker and pretty nice

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
with pass blocking as well just good

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.870 
with pass blocking as well just good
strength<00:04:18.120> for<00:04:18.390> both<00:04:18.540> of<00:04:18.780> those<00:04:18.930> so<00:04:19.830> he<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.609> from

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
outsider which is a pretty nice guy he's

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.749 
outsider which is a pretty nice guy he's
just<00:04:48.379> balanced<00:04:49.379> all<00:04:49.530> around<00:04:49.889> nice<00:04:50.250> coverage

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
just balanced all around nice coverage

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.600 
just balanced all around nice coverage
stats<00:04:51.120> for<00:04:51.389> a<00:04:51.449> safety<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.379> pretty<00:04:52.949> good<00:04:53.250> speed

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
stats for a safety and pretty good speed

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.450 
stats for a safety and pretty good speed
for<00:04:53.639> him<00:04:54.060> being<00:04:54.680> pretty<00:04:55.680> old<00:04:55.949> at<00:04:56.219> this<00:04:56.340> point

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
for him being pretty old at this point

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.730 
for him being pretty old at this point
in<00:04:56.789> his<00:04:56.969> career<00:04:57.180> but<00:04:57.509> just<00:04:57.750> overall<00:04:58.289> he's<00:04:58.530> well

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
in his career but just overall he's well

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.390 
in his career but just overall he's well
rounded<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.669> not<00:05:00.240> a<00:05:00.539> great<00:05:01.110> tackler<00:05:01.469> but<00:05:02.370> i

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
rounded and not a great tackler but i

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.179 
rounded and not a great tackler but i
think<00:05:02.819> his<00:05:02.939> coverage<00:05:03.419> stats<00:05:03.779> make<00:05:04.740> up<00:05:04.949> for

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:05.189 
think his coverage stats make up for

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.730 
think his coverage stats make up for
that<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:05.610> he<00:05:06.060> is<00:05:06.360> pretty<00:05:06.810> nice<00:05:07.050> let's<00:05:07.469> see<00:05:07.650> if

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
that so he is pretty nice let's see if

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.700 
that so he is pretty nice let's see if
we<00:05:07.889> can<00:05:08.069> find<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:08.819> Eric<00:05:09.419> barrier<00:05:09.990> Darius

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
we can find that Eric barrier Darius

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.899 
we can find that Eric barrier Darius
