00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 do not 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.650
 Hi, I'm violet and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.870
 a with your self that is to say do it yourself 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.400
 very personal and that is going to give you a 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.060
 very special touch to you 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.060
 wedding invitations 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.110
 ah 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.850
 we start with the materials what 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.300
 we need to make this tweeter set 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.920
 they are the color papers that you choose the one that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.840
 More like you have to be a little 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.059
 thicker than a folio than the thickness 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.920
 of a folio but not much more because 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.510
 we need to make several folds and if 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.239
 It will not be weird too 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.610
 we will need a pair of scissors a pencil for 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.370
 mark and an eraser and a ruler 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.309
 a little long we take one of the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.110
 corners and we approach it until making it 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.560
 coincide 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.140
 exactly with the opposite side also 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.360
 has to match the corner and in this 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.390
 another side the same here also fold and 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.040
 we love this and it would be cut right by the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.620
 side on which we see that this 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.150
 piece and that would be a square I like 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.159
 I already did, I have my square here 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.710
 now we begin to fold 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.240
 we started by folding each of the sides 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.670
 matching the center point 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.539
 with each of the two corners of the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.549
 side and from the center and towards the 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.549
 sides we are folding 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 and with the other side the same 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.470
 we can leave a distance of as a 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.470
 millimeter or something 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.980
 so that the paper breathes a little 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.210
 once we have made these doubles 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.850
 let's mark the diagonals of each 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.090
 one of the four sides 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.569
 we make again match each of 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.569
 the sides 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.600
 A) Yes 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.460
 and we put it together until the part where 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:25.470
 we see that there is the fold right here 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.470
 and we mark 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.690
 this part 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.140
 and in the rest of the other three corners 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.140
 and white 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.569
 once we have done all four 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.670
 double diagonally from the corners will 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.620
 we have a way so what we are going to 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.209
 to do is to mark precisely the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.200
 two other laterals that are still left 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.200
 without making double 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.010
 we would close like this 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.940
 and what we are going to do is to mark it 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.150
 up to match 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.680
 the corners of each of the sides and 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.870
 also 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.560
 this double from here with this lauro of 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.560
 side 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.069
 on the other side the same 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.670
 the next step is to make some 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.710
 squares like marc returning these 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.920
 corners to the opposite side is 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.920
 tell 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.010
 It is very important that you see that it ends 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.390
 forming a square and this side 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.390
 matches this one here too 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.060
 A) Yes 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.190
 there has to be something like that 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.050
 and finally we are going to do the folds 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:06.190
 which are the ones that are going to give a 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.870
 flower look or something like this guy 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.410
 of invitation a little more original 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.780
 you have to match this side with 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.780
 this fold that we have here is to say 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.570
 bending out 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.380
 we have to match 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.380
 this way 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.520
 and ideally, this double from here 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.520
 also matches this line here 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.730
 and now you have to do the rest 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:58.670
 as you can see this is the final result 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.660
 a good idea would be to use this as 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.580
 surprise when delivering the 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.170
 invitations keep in mind that if 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.570
 you have many it takes a little bit in 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.230
 do it so much patience until the 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.230
 next advice
