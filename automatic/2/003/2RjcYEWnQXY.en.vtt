00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
let me give you a three step process in

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.110 
let me give you a three step process in
making<00:00:09.889> a<00:00:09.950> biblical<00:00:10.340> case<00:00:10.460> for<00:00:10.670> the<00:00:10.760> Trinity

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
making a biblical case for the Trinity

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.959 
making a biblical case for the Trinity
number<00:00:11.990> one<00:00:12.200> you<00:00:12.530> start<00:00:12.889> with<00:00:13.070> the<00:00:13.370> very<00:00:13.730> clear

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
number one you start with the very clear

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.970 
number one you start with the very clear
passages<00:00:14.660> that<00:00:15.020> suggest<00:00:15.469> that<00:00:15.530> there's<00:00:15.740> only

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
passages that suggest that there's only

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.430 
passages that suggest that there's only
one<00:00:16.160> God<00:00:16.369> this<00:00:17.090> is<00:00:17.150> kind<00:00:17.420> of<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:17.600> foundation

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
one God this is kind of the foundation

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.589 
one God this is kind of the foundation
if<00:00:18.530> you<00:00:18.650> will<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.550> Bible<00:00:19.940> clearly<00:00:20.240> teaches

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
if you will the Bible clearly teaches

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.779 
if you will the Bible clearly teaches
again<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:21.320> again<00:00:21.590> and<00:00:21.769> again<00:00:21.949> that<00:00:22.519> there<00:00:22.670> is

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
again and again and again that there is

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.220 
again and again and again that there is
only<00:00:22.970> one<00:00:23.210> God<00:00:23.420> so<00:00:23.779> you<00:00:23.839> look<00:00:24.019> at<00:00:24.109> Deuteronomy

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
only one God so you look at Deuteronomy

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.609 
only one God so you look at Deuteronomy
6:4<00:00:25.130> you<00:00:25.310> look<00:00:25.429> at<00:00:25.550> isaiah<00:00:25.910> 43:10<00:00:26.660> isaiah<00:00:27.109> 44:6

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
6:4 you look at isaiah 43:10 isaiah 44:6

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.489 
6:4 you look at isaiah 43:10 isaiah 44:6
and<00:00:28.009> 8<00:00:28.130> john<00:00:28.580> 17:3<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.570> on<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.169> on<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.439> on

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:30.499 
and 8 john 17:3 and on and on and on

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.460 
and 8 john 17:3 and on and on and on
clearly<00:00:31.490> the<00:00:32.150> old<00:00:32.330> and<00:00:32.660> new<00:00:32.750> testament<00:00:33.290> teach

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
clearly the old and new testament teach

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.130 
clearly the old and new testament teach
that<00:00:33.680> there's<00:00:33.829> only<00:00:34.070> one<00:00:34.610> God<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:35.450> so<00:00:35.930> here's

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
that there's only one God and so here's

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.710 
that there's only one God and so here's
the<00:00:36.290> oneness<00:00:36.710> part<00:00:37.340> of<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.550> Trinity<00:00:37.760> but<00:00:38.570> then

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
the oneness part of the Trinity but then

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.480 
the oneness part of the Trinity but then
the<00:00:38.810> next<00:00:39.050> step<00:00:39.200> would<00:00:39.350> be<00:00:39.410> looking<00:00:40.100> at<00:00:40.220> the

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
the next step would be looking at the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.390 
the next step would be looking at the
distinction<00:00:41.060> between<00:00:41.900> the<00:00:42.830> Father<00:00:43.070> Son<00:00:43.340> and

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
distinction between the Father Son and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.130 
distinction between the Father Son and
the<00:00:43.640> Holy<00:00:43.670> Spirit<00:00:43.850> there<00:00:44.330> is<00:00:44.540> a<00:00:44.570> distinction

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
the Holy Spirit there is a distinction

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.770 
the Holy Spirit there is a distinction
between<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:46.460> three<00:00:46.790> persons<00:00:47.120> Father<00:00:47.540> Son

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
between the three persons Father Son

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.260 
between the three persons Father Son
Holy<00:00:47.840> Spirit<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:49.010> have<00:00:49.310> you<00:00:49.730> know<00:00:49.790> the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
Holy Spirit and so you have you know the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.240 
Holy Spirit and so you have you know the
baptism<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:50.870> Jesus<00:00:51.290> Matthew<00:00:51.710> chapter<00:00:52.040> 3

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
baptism of Jesus Matthew chapter 3

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.030 
baptism of Jesus Matthew chapter 3
here's<00:00:52.700> a<00:00:52.790> great<00:00:53.030> example<00:00:53.630> that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
here's a great example that

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.920 
here's a great example that
distinguishes<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.330> father<00:00:56.630> who's

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
distinguishes the the father who's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.110 
distinguishes the the father who's
speaking<00:00:57.260> from<00:00:57.620> heaven<00:00:57.830> the<00:00:58.370> Holy<00:00:58.580> Spirit<00:00:59.030> who

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
speaking from heaven the Holy Spirit who

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.970 
speaking from heaven the Holy Spirit who
is<00:00:59.180> coming<00:00:59.540> down<00:00:59.720> in<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.050> form<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.530> dove<00:01:00.710> and

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
is coming down in the form of a dove and

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.880 
is coming down in the form of a dove and
Jesus<00:01:01.610> who<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:02.240> being<00:01:02.450> baptized<00:01:02.930> clearly<00:01:03.710> they

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
Jesus who is being baptized clearly they

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.100 
Jesus who is being baptized clearly they
are<00:01:04.040> distinct<00:01:04.519> persons<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:05.900> that<00:01:06.049> would

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
are distinct persons and so that would

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.200 
are distinct persons and so that would
be<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.380> second<00:01:06.770> step<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.189> third<00:01:07.759> step<00:01:08.030> would

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
be the second step the third step would

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.300 
be the second step the third step would
be<00:01:08.360> then<00:01:08.600> demonstrating<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.650> each<00:01:09.890> one<00:01:10.190> of

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
be then demonstrating that each one of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.190 
be then demonstrating that each one of
these<00:01:10.430> distinct<00:01:11.000> persons<00:01:11.480> is<00:01:11.630> actually

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
these distinct persons is actually

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.740 
these distinct persons is actually
divine<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.580> we<00:01:13.730> would<00:01:13.850> look<00:01:14.000> at<00:01:14.240> things

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
divine and so we would look at things

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.020 
divine and so we would look at things
like<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.290> deity<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:15.710> Christ<00:01:15.800> you<00:01:16.670> look<00:01:16.880> at

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
like the deity of Christ you look at

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.800 
like the deity of Christ you look at
passages<00:01:17.930> like<00:01:18.080> John<00:01:18.350> 1:1<00:01:18.800> or<00:01:19.280> John<00:01:20.150> 10:30

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
passages like John 1:1 or John 10:30

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.210 
passages like John 1:1 or John 10:30
where<00:01:21.110> Jesus<00:01:21.350> says<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.830> father<00:01:22.010> are

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
where Jesus says I and the father are

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.970 
where Jesus says I and the father are
one<00:01:22.370> you<00:01:23.090> have<00:01:23.240> these<00:01:23.390> clear<00:01:23.840> passages<00:01:24.560> that

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
one you have these clear passages that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.600 
one you have these clear passages that
demonstrate<00:01:25.580> that<00:01:25.940> Jesus<00:01:26.540> is<00:01:26.830> divine<00:01:27.830> you

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
demonstrate that Jesus is divine you

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.930 
demonstrate that Jesus is divine you
look<00:01:28.790> at<00:01:29.140> passages<00:01:30.140> on<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.290> Holy<00:01:30.530> Spirit<00:01:30.940> Acts

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
look at passages on the Holy Spirit Acts

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.050 
look at passages on the Holy Spirit Acts
chapter<00:01:32.150> 5<00:01:32.630> rites<00:01:33.470> lying<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.640> Holy<00:01:34.850> Spirit

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
chapter 5 rites lying to the Holy Spirit

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.200 
chapter 5 rites lying to the Holy Spirit
is<00:01:35.450> equated<00:01:36.229> with<00:01:36.260> lying<00:01:36.650> to<00:01:36.770> God<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.120> you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
is equated with lying to God and so you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.110 
is equated with lying to God and so you
have<00:01:38.450> these<00:01:39.200> arguments<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:40.220> demonstrate

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
have these arguments that demonstrate

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.290 
have these arguments that demonstrate
that<00:01:41.150> each<00:01:41.479> person<00:01:42.470> is<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.920> divine<00:01:43.400> person<00:01:43.880> so

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
that each person is a divine person so

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.180 
that each person is a divine person so
you<00:01:44.360> have<00:01:44.659> one<00:01:44.900> God<00:01:45.140> but<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.800> have<00:01:45.979> three

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
you have one God but you have three

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.740 
you have one God but you have three
distinct<00:01:46.670> persons<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.180> those<00:01:47.390> three

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
distinct persons and those three

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.810 
distinct persons and those three
distinct<00:01:48.080> persons<00:01:48.440> are<00:01:48.620> divine<00:01:49.310> the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
distinct persons are divine the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.649 
distinct persons are divine the
conclusion<00:01:50.570> is<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:52.250> Trinity<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:53.150> conclusion

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
conclusion is the Trinity the conclusion

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.600 
conclusion is the Trinity the conclusion
is<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.990> three<00:01:54.229> divine<00:01:54.620> persons<00:01:54.650> are

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
is that the three divine persons are

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.289 
is that the three divine persons are
together<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:57.140> one<00:01:57.350> God<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:57.890> that<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.460> one<00:01:58.820> way

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
together the one God and that is one way

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.730 
together the one God and that is one way
