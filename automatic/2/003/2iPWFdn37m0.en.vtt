00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.720 
you just touch them and they turn on ya
and<00:06:11.750> like<00:06:12.560> I<00:06:12.650> said<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:13.010> reason<00:06:13.130> that<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.490> got

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
and like I said the reason that I got

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.100 
and like I said the reason that I got
this<00:06:13.970> is<00:06:14.210> because<00:06:14.240> I<00:06:14.480> want<00:06:14.720> to<00:06:14.810> do<00:06:14.900> some

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
this is because I want to do some

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.490 
this is because I want to do some
hardware<00:06:15.500> mods<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:17.090> basically<00:06:18.020> what<00:06:18.410> I'm

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
hardware mods and basically what I'm

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.710 
hardware mods and basically what I'm
talking<00:06:18.920> about<00:06:19.070> is<00:06:19.250> I<00:06:19.370> want<00:06:19.400> to<00:06:19.700> water<00:06:20.390> cool

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
talking about is I want to water cool

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.230 
talking about is I want to water cool
this<00:06:21.040> I'm<00:06:22.040> going<00:06:22.190> to<00:06:22.250> take<00:06:22.400> out<00:06:22.550> the<00:06:22.670> stock<00:06:22.940> fan

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
this I'm going to take out the stock fan

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.300 
this I'm going to take out the stock fan
in<00:06:23.420> there<00:06:23.540> and<00:06:23.840> run<00:06:24.140> water<00:06:24.440> cooling<00:06:24.890> systems

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
in there and run water cooling systems

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.870 
in there and run water cooling systems
so<00:06:26.560> because<00:06:27.560> if<00:06:27.800> I<00:06:27.980> use<00:06:28.220> this<00:06:28.370> thing<00:06:28.430> for<00:06:28.850> a

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
so because if I use this thing for a

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.120 
so because if I use this thing for a
long<00:06:29.030> period<00:06:29.390> of<00:06:29.420> time<00:06:29.600> like<00:06:29.960> if<00:06:30.620> I<00:06:30.740> play<00:06:30.920> for<00:06:31.100> a

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
long period of time like if I play for a

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.520 
long period of time like if I play for a
whole<00:06:31.310> day<00:06:31.490> or<00:06:31.640> something<00:06:32.030> it<00:06:32.210> gets<00:06:32.390> it<00:06:33.170> I<00:06:33.380> mean

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
whole day or something it gets it I mean

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.920 
whole day or something it gets it I mean
it<00:06:33.650> doesn't<00:06:33.830> red<00:06:34.040> ring<00:06:34.280> but<00:06:35.150> you<00:06:35.270> can<00:06:35.420> feel<00:06:35.750> the

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
it doesn't red ring but you can feel the

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.030 
it doesn't red ring but you can feel the
hot<00:06:36.020> air<00:06:36.230> coming<00:06:36.440> out<00:06:36.620> of<00:06:36.650> it

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
hot air coming out of it

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.630 
hot air coming out of it
