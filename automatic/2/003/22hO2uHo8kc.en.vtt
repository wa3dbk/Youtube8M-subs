00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:14.090
 pistol thereto and presses an edge 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.310
 the crowd out when something stands out 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.130

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.750

 You can not do anything wrong if times 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.310
 What goes wrong then can 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.340
 you remove that again 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.580

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.890

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.900

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.720
