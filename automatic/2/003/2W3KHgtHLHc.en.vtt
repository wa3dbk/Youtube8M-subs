Dinosaurs on Earth
♫ Musical introduction ♫

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.719
Miss, how did human beings do to survive in the time of the dinosaurs?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.640
Whatever you may have seen on films, in the time of the dinosaurs men didn't exist.

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.079
We didn't exist?

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.759
We appeared in history after dinosaurs' extinction.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.560
A lot later?

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.820
Quite later. Millions of years passed between the dinosaurs and the men...

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.590
That's why it’s better to talk about geologic time.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.720
Geologic time?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.640
It means the time of the Earth.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.940
How come?

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.920
In order to make the understanding of long periods easier, the time is divided into eons.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.360
Eons?

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.600
Eons are the greatest geologic periods of time, and...

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.680
each one of them is divided into shorter periods called eras.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.340
Then on the one hand there are Eons and, on the other, Eras.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.420
Yes. We are going to talk about two Eons:

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.680
The Precambrian and the Phanerozoic.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.040
Most animals and plants appeared during the Phanerozoic Eon.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.980
What about the eras?

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.580
There are the Palaeozoic, the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic eras.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.960
Oh! I now understand better.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.480
At the same time, eras are divided into periods.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.600
When did the dinosaurs appear?

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.040
The dinosaurs appeared on Earth during the Triassic period,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.360
on the Mesozoic era of the Phanerozoic Eon.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.620
Where did they come from?

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.120
They came from a group of animals called Techodonts.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.430
That was a long time ago, wasn’t it?

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.510
A little. It was about 235 millions of years ago.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.729
Wow!

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:19.480
However, the greatest development of the dinosaurs wasn’t on the Triassic,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.180
it took place on the following period, when the biggest dinosaurs we know developed:

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.460
the sauropods.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.120
Their most splendorous time was on the Jurassic Period, wasn't it?

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.299
That's right.

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.019
I know one: the tyrannosaurus.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.540
The tyrannosaurus was the most famous, but it wasn’t the only one.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.180
What other kind of dinosaurs were there?

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.060
The Triceratops and the Velociraptors appeared on the following period: the Cretaceous.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.519
Is it true that the Velociraptors were fast and clever?

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.059
All that is known today about dinosaurs, as well as about other extinct animals,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.300
are theoretical speculations inferred from some data, because nobody lived at those times to see them.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.800
Hehe. It would be a very very old person.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.020
Theories about their way of living come from their fossilized skeletons

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.249
and sometimes only parts of the skeletons are found.

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:24.709
Just the skeletons?

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.920
Because their bone structure, the shape of the body and the environment where they lived...

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.920
...allow speculation regarding their food and their habits.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.260
Sure, from their features scientists can imagine their body functions, right?

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.980
That's right. I'll give you an example.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.750
The theory that states that these animals were fast hunters

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.409
derives from the fact that they had an aerodynamic body and very strong legs which enable them to run quickly.

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:58.769
Besides, the space inside the skull, where their brain was placed, was really huge.

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.109
Which leads us to think that they were clever animals that might have even prepared...

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:09.160
hunting strategies, the same as today's predators, the lions or the killer whales.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.979
When did men appear in history?

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:19.439
It is calculated that modern humans appeared about between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.259
on the late quaternary period.

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.029
When did the dinosaurs become extinct?

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:32.429
The dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago, on the late cretaceous period.

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:34.680
Why did they become extinct?

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.479
There isn’t a single theory about why they became extinct,

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:48.999
but the most accepted is that of the climate change that came after the hit of a meteor or a comet on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.319
Wow! A meteor?

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.219
It’s fascinating, isn’t it?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:02.100
To go on working on this subject you must look up information about evidence supporting one theory or another.
