00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:06.300 
shotgun but if you grab the bullseye
rifle<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.959> can<00:02:05.109> use<00:02:05.319> your<00:02:05.499> alternate<00:02:05.889> fire<00:02:06.099> to

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.679 
rifle you can use your alternate fire to
actually<00:02:06.579> draw<00:02:06.880> your<00:02:07.119> rounds<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.569> your

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
actually draw your rounds to your

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.240 
actually draw your rounds to your

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
initial target little things like this

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.190 
initial target little things like this
make<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.520> weapons<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.090> resistance<00:02:10.570> a<00:02:10.720> lot<00:02:11.080> of

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
make the weapons and resistance a lot of

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.570 
make the weapons and resistance a lot of
fun<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.440> play<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.830> gives<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.130> reason<00:02:12.490> to

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
fun to play and gives you reason to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.590

switch<00:02:12.670> between<00:02:12.940> them

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
switch between them

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.180 
switch between them
and<00:02:13.690> like<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.930> said<00:02:13.990> earlier<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.560> AI<00:02:14.710> is<00:02:14.860> just

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
and like I said earlier the AI is just

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.830 
and like I said earlier the AI is just
as<00:02:15.280> good<00:02:15.400> as<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.610> weapons<00:02:15.970> they<00:02:16.180> take<00:02:16.600> cover

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
as good as the weapons they take cover

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.630 
as good as the weapons they take cover
they<00:02:17.350> attack<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.830> groups<00:02:18.100> they<00:02:18.220> learn<00:02:18.460> your

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
they attack in groups they learn your

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.890 
they attack in groups they learn your
patterns<00:02:19.000> they<00:02:19.150> do<00:02:19.210> everything<00:02:19.660> you'd<00:02:19.780> expect

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
patterns they do everything you'd expect

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.510 
patterns they do everything you'd expect
an<00:02:20.410> opponent<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.860> do<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.310> were<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.460> an

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
an opponent to do if you were in an

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.310 
an opponent to do if you were in an
actual<00:02:21.640> firefight<00:02:22.270> with<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.570> very<00:02:23.080> impressive

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
actual firefight with it very impressive

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.290 
actual firefight with it very impressive
now<00:02:24.100> there's<00:02:24.340> many<00:02:24.490> different<00:02:24.550> shooters<00:02:25.030> as

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
now there's many different shooters as

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.580 
now there's many different shooters as
there<00:02:25.450> are<00:02:25.570> out<00:02:25.750> there<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.110> big<00:02:26.230> question<00:02:26.530> is

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
there are out there the big question is

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.470 
there are out there the big question is
what<00:02:26.800> kind<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.160> shooter<00:02:27.460> is<00:02:27.640> resistance<00:02:28.210> is<00:02:28.360> it

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
what kind of shooter is resistance is it

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.030 
what kind of shooter is resistance is it
a<00:02:28.510> twit<00:02:28.750> shooter<00:02:29.050> along<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.740> lines<00:02:29.890> of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
a twit shooter along the lines of

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.710 
a twit shooter along the lines of
somewhere<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.580> unreal<00:02:31.090> tournament<00:02:31.300> or<00:02:31.630> is

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
somewhere like unreal tournament or is

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.690 
somewhere like unreal tournament or is
it<00:02:31.810> more<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.080> tactical<00:02:32.560> thing<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:33.310> Rainbow

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
it more of a tactical thing like Rainbow

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.730 
it more of a tactical thing like Rainbow
six<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.510> truth<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.080> actually<00:02:35.350> leans<00:02:35.530> more

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
six the truth is it actually leans more

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.140 
six the truth is it actually leans more
towards<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.130> twit<00:02:36.340> shooter<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:36.970> kind<00:02:37.120> of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
towards the twit shooter it's kind of

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.000 
towards the twit shooter it's kind of
like<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.390> cross<00:02:37.630> between<00:02:37.660> call<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.350> duty<00:02:38.650> unreal

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
like a cross between call of duty unreal

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.650 
like a cross between call of duty unreal
tournament<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.760> first<00:02:40.000> person<00:02:40.360> shooter

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660

option<00:02:41.050> if<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.320> played<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.680> original

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
option if you played the original

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.740 
option if you played the original
Ratchet<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.460> Clank<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:43.060> stage<00:02:43.300> design<00:02:43.600> is

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
Ratchet and Clank the stage design is

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.570 
Ratchet and Clank the stage design is
actually<00:02:44.080> very<00:02:44.110> linear<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:45.040> can<00:02:45.250> do<00:02:45.400> some

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
actually very linear you can do some

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.160 
actually very linear you can do some
exploration<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.360> need<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.990> want

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
exploration and you need to if you want

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
to find the secrets but the game is

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.460 
to find the secrets but the game is
always<00:02:49.060> pushing<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.540> forward<00:02:49.810> in<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.200> straight

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
always pushing you forward in a straight

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.680 
always pushing you forward in a straight
path<00:02:50.710> so<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.340> understand<00:02:51.760> exactly<00:02:51.880> what<00:02:52.660> it

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
path so you understand exactly what it

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.330 
path so you understand exactly what it
is<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.900> have<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.260> do<00:02:53.380> next<00:02:53.620> it's<00:02:54.160> very

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
is you have to do next it's very

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.770
