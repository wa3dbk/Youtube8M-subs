going to have the right size of mate
what<00:04:52.220> should<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.490> be<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.700> size<00:04:52.880> of<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:54.490> deck<00:04:55.490> of

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
what should it be the size of a deck of

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.670 
what should it be the size of a deck of
cards<00:04:55.700> so<00:04:56.480> if<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.900> could<00:04:57.080> see<00:04:57.290> if<00:04:57.380> we<00:04:57.530> have

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
cards so if you could see if we have

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.770 
cards so if you could see if we have
this<00:04:57.830> large<00:04:58.190> plate<00:04:58.640> and<00:04:58.940> you're<00:04:59.270> putting<00:04:59.510> this

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
this large plate and you're putting this

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.180 
this large plate and you're putting this
for<00:05:00.110> your<00:05:00.230> child<00:05:00.530> it's<00:05:00.740> not<00:05:00.800> looking<00:05:01.160> like

for your child it's not looking like
it's<00:05:01.490> gonna<00:05:01.580> be<00:05:01.850> enough<00:05:02.390> for<00:05:02.420> them

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
it's gonna be enough for them

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.120 
it's gonna be enough for them
immediately<00:05:03.290> they're<00:05:03.410> gonna<00:05:03.530> think<00:05:03.740> this<00:05:03.980> is

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
immediately they're gonna think this is

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.830 
immediately they're gonna think this is
not<00:05:04.310> enough<00:05:04.550> food<00:05:04.760> but<00:05:05.270> if<00:05:05.390> we're<00:05:05.510> gonna<00:05:05.600> put

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
not enough food but if we're gonna put

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.870 
not enough food but if we're gonna put
it<00:05:05.930> on<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.080> little<00:05:06.320> bit<00:05:06.500> smaller<00:05:06.860> plate<00:05:07.190> that's

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
it on a little bit smaller plate that's

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.240 
it on a little bit smaller plate that's
also<00:05:08.330> gonna<00:05:08.480> make<00:05:08.660> a<00:05:08.690> big<00:05:08.930> difference<00:05:09.320> so<00:05:09.380> meat

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
also gonna make a big difference so meat

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.340 
also gonna make a big difference so meat
should<00:05:10.820> be<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:11.060> size<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.540> what<00:05:11.870> guys<00:05:12.080> a

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
should be the size of what guys a

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.280 
should be the size of what guys a
cognitive<00:05:13.310> card<00:05:13.610> so<00:05:13.850> that's<00:05:14.030> gonna<00:05:14.240> be<00:05:14.300> first

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
cognitive card so that's gonna be first

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.760 
cognitive card so that's gonna be first
a<00:05:15.530> helpful<00:05:15.919> thing<00:05:15.950> to<00:05:16.190> look<00:05:16.310> at<00:05:16.460> let's<00:05:17.120> look<00:05:17.450> at

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
a helpful thing to look at let's look at

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.990 
a helpful thing to look at let's look at
spaghetti<00:05:18.770> because<00:05:19.280> that's<00:05:19.490> another<00:05:19.640> thing

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
spaghetti because that's another thing

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.909 
spaghetti because that's another thing
when<00:05:20.180> we<00:05:20.300> have<00:05:20.510> pasta<00:05:21.110> a<00:05:21.260> lot<00:05:21.440> of<00:05:21.530> times<00:05:21.710> we're

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
when we have pasta a lot of times we're

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.920 
when we have pasta a lot of times we're
used<00:05:22.070> to<00:05:22.130> that<00:05:22.370> taking<00:05:22.880> up<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.210> whole<00:05:23.540> plate

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
used to that taking up the whole plate

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.870 
used to that taking up the whole plate
and<00:05:24.200> kind<00:05:24.620> of<00:05:24.650> having<00:05:24.890> our<00:05:25.010> noodles<00:05:25.370> fall<00:05:25.669> off

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
and kind of having our noodles fall off

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.050 
and kind of having our noodles fall off
over<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.360> plate<00:05:26.600> but<00:05:26.840> really<00:05:27.680> our<00:05:28.160> pasta

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
over the plate but really our pasta

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.940 
over the plate but really our pasta
should<00:05:29.120> kind<00:05:29.390> of<00:05:29.450> be<00:05:29.540> a<00:05:29.570> side<00:05:29.990> item<00:05:30.560> so<00:05:30.740> that<00:05:30.860> we

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
should kind of be a side item so that we

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.860 
should kind of be a side item so that we
have<00:05:31.040> plenty<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.370> room<00:05:31.669> for<00:05:31.700> salad<00:05:32.540> and<00:05:32.780> a

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
have plenty of room for salad and a

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.420 
have plenty of room for salad and a
whole<00:05:33.110> grain<00:05:33.380> bread<00:05:33.620> maybe<00:05:33.830> to<00:05:34.010> go<00:05:34.130> along<00:05:34.400> with

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
whole grain bread maybe to go along with

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.909 
whole grain bread maybe to go along with
that<00:05:34.850> so<00:05:35.350> spaghetti<00:05:36.350> really<00:05:36.620> should<00:05:36.800> be<00:05:36.890> a

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
that so spaghetti really should be a

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.380 
that so spaghetti really should be a
side<00:05:37.250> choice<00:05:37.550> well<00:05:37.760> if<00:05:37.820> we<00:05:37.910> have<00:05:38.060> it<00:05:38.180> on<00:05:38.270> this

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
side choice well if we have it on this
