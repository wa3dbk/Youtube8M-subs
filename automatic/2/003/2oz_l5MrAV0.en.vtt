00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
today is two days after Christmas now I

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.690 
today is two days after Christmas now I
did<00:00:09.690> not<00:00:09.870> get<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.260> for<00:00:10.469> Christmas<00:00:10.889> I've<00:00:11.099> been

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
did not get this for Christmas I've been

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.520 
did not get this for Christmas I've been
a<00:00:11.730> Rubik's<00:00:12.059> Cube<00:00:12.090> er<00:00:12.269> for<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.450> while<00:00:12.599> now<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.019> I

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
a Rubik's Cube er for a while now and I

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.259 
a Rubik's Cube er for a while now and I
just<00:00:13.740> wanted<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.009> post<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.370> video<00:00:14.549> because<00:00:15.059> I

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
just wanted to post this video because I

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.500 
just wanted to post this video because I
wanted<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.509> show<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.809> guys<00:00:16.910> how<00:00:17.910> fast<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.359> can

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
wanted to show you guys how fast I can

wanted to show you guys how fast I can
solve<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.750> Rubik's<00:00:19.050> Cube<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.640> little<00:00:20.640> background

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
solve a Rubik's Cube a little background

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.460 
solve a Rubik's Cube a little background
I<00:00:21.150> started<00:00:21.180> rubik's<00:00:21.750> cube<00:00:21.930> me<00:00:21.990> when<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.199> was<00:00:22.320> in

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
I started rubik's cube me when I was in

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.080 
I started rubik's cube me when I was in
seventh<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:22.980> eighth<00:00:23.039> grade<00:00:23.400> why<00:00:23.880> did<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> do

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
seventh and eighth grade why did I do

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.349 
seventh and eighth grade why did I do
that<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.390> don't<00:00:24.630> know<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.820> don't<00:00:26.849> know<00:00:27.029> it's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that I don't know and I don't know it's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.150 
that I don't know and I don't know it's
just<00:00:27.539> like<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> hidden<00:00:28.080> talent<00:00:28.410> or<00:00:28.650> whatever

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
just like a hidden talent or whatever

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.730 
just like a hidden talent or whatever
I'm<00:00:29.400> not<00:00:29.699> incredibly<00:00:30.510> fast<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.439> haven't

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
I'm not incredibly fast and I haven't

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.069 
I'm not incredibly fast and I haven't
done<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.040> probably<00:00:32.790> six<00:00:33.120> months<00:00:33.510> because

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
done it for probably six months because

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.270 
done it for probably six months because
I<00:00:34.410> don't<00:00:34.559> know<00:00:34.620> I've<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.739> been<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.250> busy

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
I don't know I've just been really busy

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.790 
I don't know I've just been really busy
and<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.270> haven't<00:00:36.540> gotten<00:00:36.719> into<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.260> since

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and I haven't gotten into it since

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.139 
and I haven't gotten into it since
seventh<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> eighth<00:00:38.430> grade<00:00:38.700> that's<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
seventh and eighth grade that's when I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.270 
seventh and eighth grade that's when I
was<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.450> into<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.230> without<00:00:41.070> further

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
was really into it so without further

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.479 
was really into it so without further
ado<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:42.780> put<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.469> face<00:00:43.860> down<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.370> I'm

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
ado I will put that face down and I'm

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.130 
ado I will put that face down and I'm
will<00:00:44.760> use<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> Scramble<00:00:45.510> algorithm<00:00:45.960> they've

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
will use the Scramble algorithm they've

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.700 
will use the Scramble algorithm they've
given<00:00:46.440> me<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.030> haven't<00:00:49.340> scrambled<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.690> a

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
given me so I haven't scrambled in a

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.970 
given me so I haven't scrambled in a
long<00:00:52.710> time<00:00:53.039> or<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.699> mean<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.719> haven't<00:00:55.500> used<00:00:55.710> like

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
long time or I mean I haven't used like

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.939 
long time or I mean I haven't used like
algorithms<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> long<00:00:57.120> time<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.770> I'm<00:00:58.770> not

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
algorithms in a long time so I'm not

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.920 
algorithms in a long time so I'm not
used<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.989> all<00:01:00.989> these<00:01:01.440> letters<00:01:02.780> getting<00:01:03.780> them

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
used to all these letters getting them

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.620 
used to all these letters getting them
the<00:01:04.049> right<00:01:04.229> way<00:01:04.549> because<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:08.450> memorize<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the right way because I memorize the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.679 
the right way because I memorize the
algorithms<00:01:10.080> at<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.010> point<00:01:11.240> with<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> letters

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
algorithms at one point with the letters

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.350 
algorithms at one point with the letters
and<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.470> memorized<00:01:13.799> how<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.299> do

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and then I just memorized how like I do

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
and then I just memorized how like I do
them<00:01:15.689> without<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.530> letter<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.100> didn't<00:01:17.400> need

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
them without the letter so I didn't need

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.120 
them without the letter so I didn't need
the<00:01:17.670> letters<00:01:17.909> anymore<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.799> but<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.950> looks

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the letters anymore and but that looks

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.289 
the letters anymore and but that looks
good<00:01:20.400> pretty<00:01:21.060> solid<00:01:21.270> scramble<00:01:22.970> I'm<00:01:23.970> not

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
good pretty solid scramble I'm not

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030 
good pretty solid scramble I'm not
really<00:01:24.540> sure<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.259> scramble<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.770> different

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
really sure I scramble it different

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.800 
really sure I scramble it different
every<00:01:26.189> time<00:01:26.220> there's<00:01:26.759> no<00:01:26.939> tricks<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.450> here<00:01:27.689> I'm

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
every time there's no tricks in here I'm

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.590 
every time there's no tricks in here I'm
not<00:01:27.960> gonna<00:01:28.049> speed<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.600> little

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
not gonna speed it up all have a little

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.980 
not gonna speed it up all have a little
clock<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:31.020> here<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.579> I'll<00:01:32.579> show<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.450> clock

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
clock up here and I'll show the clock

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.600 
clock up here and I'll show the clock
after<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.470> finished<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> time<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.670> yeah<00:01:37.610> all

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
after I finished the time so yeah all

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.520 
after I finished the time so yeah all
right<00:01:40.790> let<00:01:41.790> me<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.140> inspect<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> cube<00:01:44.119> get<00:01:45.119> a

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
right let me just inspect the cube get a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.460 
right let me just inspect the cube get a
good<00:01:46.530> look<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:47.009> what<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> want<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.470> then

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
good look at what I want to do and then

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:04.789 
good look at what I want to do and then
I'll<00:01:49.890> start<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> timer

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.410 

alright<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.119> gonna<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.600> tricky<00:02:07.759> but<00:02:08.759> why

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
alright this is gonna be tricky but why

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:49.650 
alright this is gonna be tricky but why
don't<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.599> go<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:10.019> it

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.880 

so<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:51.320> was<00:02:51.440> an<00:02:51.560> all<00:02:51.680> right<00:02:51.860> solve<00:02:52.160> time<00:02:52.870> 35

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
so that was an all right solve time 35

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.680 
so that was an all right solve time 35
seconds<00:02:54.890> let's<00:02:55.730> see<00:02:55.940> if<00:02:56.030> we<00:02:56.150> can<00:02:56.300> get<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.570> on

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
seconds let's see if we can get that on

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.830 
seconds let's see if we can get that on
the<00:02:56.810> screen<00:02:57.140> it's<00:02:58.100> backwards

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
the screen it's backwards

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.300
