00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 I saw a lot here but what about now 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.450
 back and well he's doing a 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.519
 little bit of cool and I finally 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.200
 I can put my wig my dearest 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.380
 wig one of my sponsor is me 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.900
 sending another wig on the way is a 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.340
 surprise because the one I asked for seems 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.460
 be that I was exhausted so I already 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.369
 we'll see what we have at tea time 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.439
 today and I want to tell you about the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.180
 back to school since good September 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 is around the corner and all the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 we know that September and return to 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.780
 classes usually mean the same thing this 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.210
 I am that my years of career returned 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.719
 classes in October classes end 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.579
 in July when I was younger a 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.750
 little bit younger when I was 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.579
 Studying between high school and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.050
 baccalaureate the truth is that I do not 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.539
 It was very funny that I went back to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.280
 classes but now that I'm older and not 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.379
 I have classes to go back to like 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.239
 I've missed it a little bit and well 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.129
 we all know that he returns to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.449
 class is always a time of stress because 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.010
 you will meet the teachers 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.740
 that you did not like colleagues that did not 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.840
 you liked homework exams 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.760
 etcetera etcetera all the mess but 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.500
 also the girls do not wear another 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.750
 kind of stress because we always have 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.210
 what we wear and how we 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.160
 make up and what we do the truth is 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.790
 that when I take to the institute not 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.650
 I thought 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.450
 very well very much in those things so 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.960
 I thought about what to wear but my 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.700
 sense of style and clothes you have to 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.400
 carry have nothing to do with the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.880
 now I was very don going too 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.010
 tomboy and the truth is that I think it's 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.350
 a time when I regret not 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.229
 have known all the tribes before 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.940
 urban women to refine my style 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.940
 of fashion and being able to go more 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 and I then good apart from the fact that 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.920
 days before school starts 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.570
 all the girls we remove and we put 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.460
 upside down in our closet that is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.980
 full of things I do not have anything that 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.250
 I always end up choosing one thing 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.950
 more comfortable or as uncomfortable as we can 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.750
 choose from my wardrobe my advice 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.610
 for all those girls that put in the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.940
 upside-down closet is that simply 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.830
 do not scratch your head and go for 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.510
 what they feel comfortable with and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.550
 with what they live every day that in 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.770
 reality is the best feeling you're going to 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.900
 to be able to give because when a woman 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.550
 demanding comfortable is when more confidence 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.100
 in itself store and then is when 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.100
 more transmit that confidence to others 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.850
 so I would go with clothes that I 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.710
 sit as if I were and 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.990
 also with clothes that I could wear 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.720
 every day of class for example not 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.520
 I would dress super extra guide or super 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.590
 you use and I will not be able to keep up 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.930
 every day of class because it would be 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.990
 for me a little weird that you start with a 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.940
 style and finish with a look completely 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.920
 first thing I asked in the closet and 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.720
 in terms of makeup exactly what 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.150
 I would fix myself a little bit for 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.640
 Of course, the foundation is 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.650
 powders correctors 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.350
 illuminations and so on etcetera 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.970
 all are very well in place and a 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.310
 little bit of rouge and a little 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.410
 mascara and eye stripe and the truth is that 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.390
 there was not much else because if I'm not going to 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.550
 to be able to keep up the pace of making me super 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.200
 makeup every day to go to the 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.150
 school is much better than 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.950
 comrades are going to see how you are going to go 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.680
 every day that you do not put on 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.640
 super yarur ulsÃ¡n or anything else 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.980
 the first days and then go 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.380
 even without makeup when you have before 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.590
 gone with three kilos of 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.300
 so my advice is relax does not pass 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.580
 nothing that first impressions are 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.310
 important is always important 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.770
 also show yourself as you are and go 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.500
 as long as the fact of how I behave 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.140
 never me I'm good relations 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.790
 social at first sight until about 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.460
 years when I started to let go and has 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.800
 been like no but I have to recognize 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.890
 that the institute years were very 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.250
 stick where I am I 'm going to eat no 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.670
 breathe 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.650
 I am invisible I am invisible I am if it is the 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.080
 it's true that it did not go well enough 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.510
 with this baccalaureate method I had a 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.520
 small appointment since the first day of 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.120
 classes when the presentation was already 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:18.650
 I knew one of my best friends 5 and 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.920
 our presentation was as if you 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.230
 you know where the class is if the 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.000
 I was looking to it to 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.750
 well then I will accommodate you 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.730
 and basically that was our great 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.890
 presentation then it turned out that we were 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.460
 in the same class other than taking the 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:41.300
 same high school and it was one of that 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.569
 I also like you, we are friends 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.729
 and so far so thanks to this 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:51.970
 small help and demonstration 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.970
 our seeing you well 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.970
 whatever it was was able to address other 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:04.139
 people of the bat of oh you are very hard 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.690
 my dad and basically like that I would approach 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.360
 people and I continue to address the 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.820
 true therefore already all this 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.700
 I would recommend that you never stand still 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.389
 in your seat and go out to meet people 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:21.330
 total and you do not already have it so what else 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:24.060
 gives and many thousands and already already but it is that 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.450
 I am shy and to which I respond already 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.210
 already I am also very timid I know a 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.430
 where it does not look like I'm shy 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.970
 timid hard for me to ask a glass of 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.970
 water instead 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:44.530
 but good the key of this is to sign 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.530
 your goal is to breathe deeply 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.600
 and the lack of the aforementioned dam and 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.550
 good as always to start school 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.650
 if we start good, full of good 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.620
 purposes as I'm going to study I'm not going to 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.660
 let me put everything to accumulate 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.050
 the last day I'm going to write down all my 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.050
 schedule 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:13.400
 Finally, as always, remember that these 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.319
 videos are a bit more interactive like this 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.909
 that you already know tell me what you think 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.669
 you go back to school if you are 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:21.919
 nervous you are not nervous what course 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.930
 you're going to start if you're going to start some 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.729
 of that or maybe some of 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.499
 baccalaureate or on the contrary you go to 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:30.259
 start your own career already if 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:32.659
 As I do not have more back to school 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.210
 what to do and how you live and lived and 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:37.099
 you the returns to classes and so on 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.319
 etcetera also that is what most 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.779
 like the laps classes me by 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:44.749
 example I loved the fact of 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:47.479
 be able to release material I am a crazy 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:49.610
 of the stationery and I always loved 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:51.289
 that they will buy me new file cabinets 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.509
 sheets of new notebooks 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:56.629
 new pencil football issa cases 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:58.370
 highlighters -submarking those that are not 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:02.240
 me all that world the truth is that it is 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:04.490
 as healthy, take me to a stationery store and 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.309
 I am happy so basically my 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.589
 back to school and my happiness depended 

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:13.210
 how much quantity of material 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:13.210
 stationery could not get 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.800
 and well that 's all rotten today 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:23.760

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.800
