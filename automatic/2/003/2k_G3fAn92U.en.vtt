closure<00:03:53.980> however<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.250> does<00:03:55.489> not<00:03:55.850> go<00:03:56.239> all<00:03:56.570> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
closure however it does not go all the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.540 
closure however it does not go all the
way<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.170> end<00:03:57.350> of<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.560> bag<00:03:57.739> there<00:03:58.010> is<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.190> gap

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
way to the end of the bag there is a gap

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.750 
way to the end of the bag there is a gap
here<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.720> little<00:03:59.900> gap<00:04:00.230> here<00:04:00.489> although<00:04:01.489> this

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
here and a little gap here although this

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.430 
here and a little gap here although this
gap<00:04:02.060> on<00:04:02.270> this<00:04:02.480> side<00:04:02.720> is<00:04:02.870> slightly<00:04:03.140> smaller

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
gap on this side is slightly smaller

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.949 
gap on this side is slightly smaller
because<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.160> end<00:04:04.489> of<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.700> zipper<00:04:05.060> is<00:04:05.300> sewn<00:04:05.690> to

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
because the end of the zipper is sewn to

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.290 
because the end of the zipper is sewn to
the<00:04:06.110> end<00:04:06.470> of<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:07.070> bag<00:04:07.250> as<00:04:07.520> you<00:04:07.550> can<00:04:07.820> see<00:04:08.060> there

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
the end of the bag as you can see there

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.210 
the end of the bag as you can see there

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
know it's hard to see because of the

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.710 
know it's hard to see because of the
pattern<00:05:11.950> one<00:05:12.310> here<00:05:12.790> and<00:05:13.110> one<00:05:14.110> here<00:05:14.140> and<00:05:15.600> one<00:05:16.600> of

pattern one here and one here and one of
probably<00:05:17.140> one<00:05:17.260> of<00:05:17.290> the<00:05:17.440> best<00:05:17.650> features<00:05:17.890> that<00:05:18.250> I

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
probably one of the best features that I

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.200 
probably one of the best features that I
like<00:05:18.640> is<00:05:19.090> that<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:19.570> actually<00:05:19.780> has<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:21.520> let<00:05:22.120> me

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
like is that it actually has to let me

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.780 
like is that it actually has to let me

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.650 
love i think that was great that they
added<00:05:41.230> that<00:05:41.560> in<00:05:41.800> there<00:05:42.220> now<00:05:42.850> of<00:05:43.090> course<00:05:43.360> this

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
added that in there now of course this

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.740 
added that in there now of course this
is<00:05:43.900> the<00:05:44.370> regular<00:05:45.370> fabric<00:05:45.669> lining<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.390> does<00:05:46.570> not

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
is the regular fabric lining it does not

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.750 
is the regular fabric lining it does not
have<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.200> quilted<00:05:47.590> fabric<00:05:47.620> lining<00:05:48.220> I<00:05:48.460> really

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
have the quilted fabric lining I really

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.340 
have the quilted fabric lining I really
don't<00:05:48.940> think<00:05:49.030> Vera<00:05:49.450> Bradley's<00:05:49.900> doing<00:05:50.200> that

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
don't think Vera Bradley's doing that

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.920 
don't think Vera Bradley's doing that
anymore<00:05:50.650> unfortunately<00:05:51.360> because<00:05:52.360> I<00:05:52.480> think<00:05:52.750> it

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
anymore unfortunately because I think it

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.990 
anymore unfortunately because I think it
lasted<00:05:53.590> longer<00:05:53.950> that<00:05:54.100> way<00:05:54.340> but<00:05:54.640> that's<00:05:54.820> just

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
lasted longer that way but that's just

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.270 
lasted longer that way but that's just
my<00:05:55.240> own<00:05:55.270> opinion<00:05:55.540> and<00:05:56.050> then<00:05:56.650> the<00:05:56.860> bottom<00:05:57.160> of

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
my own opinion and then the bottom of

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.570 
my own opinion and then the bottom of
the<00:05:57.340> bag<00:05:57.780> if<00:05:58.780> you<00:05:59.260> heard<00:05:59.500> that<00:05:59.740> it<00:05:59.980> does<00:06:00.220> have<00:06:00.550> a

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
the bag if you heard that it does have a

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.080 
the bag if you heard that it does have a
cardboard<00:06:01.560> lining<00:06:02.560> on<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:02.890> bottom<00:06:03.310> just<00:06:03.940> to

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
cardboard lining on the bottom just to

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.270 
cardboard lining on the bottom just to
give<00:06:04.240> it<00:06:04.270> more<00:06:04.419> support<00:06:05.169> and<00:06:05.380> structure<00:06:05.860> and

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
give it more support and structure and

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.460

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
pretty much it now like I did say before

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.040 
pretty much it now like I did say before
that<00:06:15.580> I<00:06:15.610> might<00:06:15.880> get<00:06:16.030> questions<00:06:16.450> on<00:06:16.570> some

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
that I might get questions on some

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.920 
that I might get questions on some
people<00:06:17.410> you<00:06:18.340> fit<00:06:18.850> their<00:06:19.030> laptops<00:06:19.510> in<00:06:19.720> here

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
people you fit their laptops in here
