00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.820
 the darkness bathed all the city that 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.469
 I was completely silent except 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.480
 by the sound of the fine drops of 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.690
 rain when hitting the roofs of 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.690
 buildings 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 Marc walked down the lonely street 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.509
 while looking at both sides the neighborhoods 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.340
 noc suspensions old man was 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.550
 maybe one of the most dangerous places 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.400
 of a whole land but marc was 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.140
 completely calm he was wearing more than 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.700
 20 years trading with the mafias of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.820
 nox and he had earned his trust 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.220
 after all it was marc the merchant 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.080
 of the west and the acquisitions that it brought 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.820
 after each trip they were fine 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.670
 valued by all the high powers of 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.950
 noc his among them the strategist and eriko 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.370
 swain 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.360
 marc stopped the usual tavern at 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.800
 enter sat down and ordered a beer 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.290
 the merchant noticed something uneasy about 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.690
 all customers and that's when 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.560
 the barkeep asked them 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.560
 reason for your concern 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.100
 they are killing one by one the tall ones 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.760
 charges of the low funds of noc sus 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.260
 said Josh the witnesses assure that the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.810
 guilty is a vagabond with clothes 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.720
 worn and a black hood that covers 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.020
 her face completely so has been 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.320
 said the merchant this is bad for 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.560
 all of us know him asked the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.350
 innkeeper 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.079
 there are only two rumors said marc but if 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.430
 are certain we are in danger and there is a 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.399
 story they found in painted see 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.890
 about him but I do not know if he should tell 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.420
 said one of the customers for very real 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.420
 that we should hear it 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.890
 where to start said the merchant 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.110
 I guess since the beginning nobody has 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.659
 never seen the face of the wanderer as 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.380
 They used to refer to the in painted see but its 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.549
 history goes back to 20 years ago 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.590
 it seems to come from a distant land 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.930
 of the south hit by hunger and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.970
 war when the coffee portal was 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.800
 open the solitudes of creatures that 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.200
 they left him were direct to this 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.660
 region because its inhabitants 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.310
 they have an old object that was capable of 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.420
 channeling dark energy and 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.420
 stabilize this portal 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.990
 although they protected something so powerful the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.600
 inhabitants of this region were not 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.760
 warriors but priests and men of 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.240
 peace so the dispute for this 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.580
 object was not a fight it was a massacre 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.670
 it is told that only elegant and another girl 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.670
 they both survived with seven years of 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.590
 age were found in the middle of a 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.820
 enormous mass of mincemeat and viscera 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.950
 what had been the people of the town 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.720
 children posed as dead 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.600
 and they hid under the corpses 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.370
 until the danger passed the person who 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.130
 he found them was not a monster or a 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.510
 priest but the only person who 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.000
 had survived that power 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.800
 previously the only one that was not 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.800
 consumed by the house dyn 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.550
 the vacuum magician was dedicated for two 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.470
 years to train these children preparing 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.230
 to one day face the 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.030
 beasts that snatched every house and 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.060
 I was worried above all about the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.250
 look of the empty errant devoid of 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.110
 any kind of feeling like 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.220
 I would have turned off their emotions for 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.920
 avoid suffering itself 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.320
 so the vacuum magician came up with 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.510
 something led the two apprentices to a 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.730
 island infested with beasts and left them 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.710
 there for a year if they wanted to continue 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.410
 their training had to survive 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.030
 both so the wanderer looked 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.880
 forced to take care of his partner and 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.100
 vice versa when home and back to the 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.470
 island not only had both survived 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.920
 but something else had been forged between 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.440
 them an unbreakable friendship with the 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.750
 over the years the friendship became 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.310
 love and thanks to that could 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.330
 complete numerous missions of es trenc 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.330
 child of said beasts 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.110
 Din house felt that their work had 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.900
 concluded and that the young vines 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.269
 They were moving in the right direction like this 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.450
 it was like the legend of the souls began 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.710
 twins the trust was full between 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.820
 both until one day everything changed 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.950
 while they faced a titanic 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.740
 enemy the young beloved of the wanderer 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.770
 he died and the warrior was forced to 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.410
 retire the loss of his love you 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.110
 he shattered inside and his soul was 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.150
 consumed by revenge has been dedicated 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.790
 from that day to eradicate any 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.590
 act of evil enre a land does not 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.990
 matter if it's a heinous crime or a mere 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.120
 theft if you meet him and discover 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.420
 your sin will purge you of them with the 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.420
 death 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.730
 nice old story said a voice to 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.980
 cavern background marc turned and he could 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.140
 see a figure in the dark sitting 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.030
 on a table he looked like a man of 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.610
 average constitution with ragged clothes 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.880
 and a hood that completely covered 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.210
 his face the merchant stepped back from 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.210
 scare 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.950
 pity that is not completely true is 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.290
 true that the wanderer lost his love 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.960
 before a powerful enemy but from 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.570
 that day he seeks and eradicates all 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.670
 those who are his followers the 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.590
 beast that faces has the power to 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.870
 steal human souls and shells 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.550
 voids left in their wake take advantage 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.850
 what evil heights like costumes 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.470
 for their abominable bodies so they can 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.780
 infiltrate the human world and 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.660
 control information about the islands 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.280
 of the shadow they give everything for their love to 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.530
 change of power and wealth 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.280
 but you know more than you count 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.139
 old 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.120
 continue the vagabond you know 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:03.430
 perfectly the name of the beast that 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.430
 elegant looks for your name 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.940
 suddenly a huge claw decapitated the 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.460
 figure of ragged clothes marc turned his 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.670
 head and he could see that they the barman 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.640
 he had become a monster but 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.670
 the clothes were hollow and a ray of 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.270
 light pierced their heads 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.730
 disintegrating it in the act 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.830
 all the residents of the tavern are 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.750
 had turned into monsters and a 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.960
 discharge of light shots gave to 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.150
 each goal in a matter of seconds 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.400
 marc completely terrified he 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.790
 hid behind the bar waiting 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.010
 that everything happened and that man left 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.420
 but someone grabbed him by the front and 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.170
 he slammed it against the bar of the tablet 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:52.200
 I gave her her name invokes what she said 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:55.050
 enraged the man Marc observed the 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:59.610
 dark complexion of his aggressor before saying 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:01.560
 with clear voice the name of his master 3 the 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.470
 aged face of marc started to 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.180
 transform and within a few seconds 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:10.350
 Greenish flames sprang from their 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.690
 eyes followed by loud laughter 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:16.020
 so you've come luciano said a voice 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:18.810
 dark the face of the purifier rubbed 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.570
 the flames of the devil remember me 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.510
 monster promise I will recover the soul of 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.600
 my wife regardless 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.950
 I wait for you in the islands of the shade uma 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:32.670
 but the sound of Lucia's gun 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:35.640
 it extinguished the voice of the entity begins the hunt 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:38.580
 He said he was wearing paint, he picked up his cloak and 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.510
 I was waiting, I'll be there soon 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.510
 Dinner
