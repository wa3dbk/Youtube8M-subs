00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.240
 hello i 'm from new hampshire from www 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.059
 denilson pizza at the com 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.929
 bringing more revenue to our good and 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.840
 old pizza recipe and today is pizza 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.820
 hot dog with ball in itself the fashion stuffed 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.279
 sausage ingredients are 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.610
 happening in a video and we will check 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.550
 plus a recipe and the step-by-step fills 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.820
 I'll show you the first thing you do. 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.649
 need is fresh pizza dough to 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.220
 you will have in the description of the 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.310
 video that is my mass recipe for 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.240
 It's a pizza just like that. 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.290
 Seems like video has full revenue 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.270
 position for that amount of 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.030
 pasta and let's go 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.810
 the first step should open this mass 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.150
 so that it is much larger than the 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.430
 which way you will use 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.290
 if you are going to use a tray you have 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.339
 let the open mass that it 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.010
 is larger than your tray because 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.530
 How are we going to make this ball closed? 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.770
 there must be a little mass left over 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.780
 around then you 'll roll the ball 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.670
 then it will stay the ideal size then 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.790
 now she's pretty big in my case 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.900
 about making a pizza from 35 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.180
 centimeters 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.140
 so I came back with about 40 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.350
 centimeters 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.020
 those incentives that you have left over there 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.600
 to wrap the edge of the pizza after 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.570
 pizza all open the ideal you open 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.930
 with the roll you can not see how what 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.299
 ends by tearing the dough with a non-roll 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.820
 they had clothes they could use a bottle or give 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.479
 way and now we 're going to spend a 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.150
 little sauce on my door to the edge 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.049
 pizza and that this sauce will help 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.659
 people aa close edge and it will help 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.780
 here also does not give it when the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.540
 people are in a hurry but first 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.330
 people do not have this mass then put 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.330
 the filling and return to the oven 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.429
 oven was homemade 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.749
 it is not as hot as a 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.859
 pizzeria 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:16.790
 then you will always leave the mass 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.650
 they are there 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.840
 can happen to the pizza dough stay 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.930
 a little dry then you will get these 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.230
 the sausages slice in half as is 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.419
 appearing on the video and putting a 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.900
 side by side and and will stay that 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:35.689
 The way the video is appearing now 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.059
 to close the fashion is very easy enough 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:42.769
 you pull from what's left of 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:46.340
 and cover the sausage by remembering 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:51.529
 aaa tightening tip and the mass 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.090
 what is it that is if this fashion does not open 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:55.700
 So you see, we're going to tighten it. 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.340
 will cover the mass covering the partner 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.079
 full and let's squeeze enough 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.879
 you can also use catupiry if you 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.249
 do not want to do it, just leave the chelsea if 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:07.129
 can use both created will also show 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:10.669
 However it will not be sliced ​​with sara atom 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:14.239
 read the grated Ceará also gives to do 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:15.260
 ham and cheese pepperoni your 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.909
 preference 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.249
 Now we make these little ones. 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.769
 with a bottle all over the edge 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:23.689
 of pizza when you think 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.150
 if the simone who is in here goes 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:29.930
 boil and will create several bubbles here 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.959
 leaving their pizza ugly good 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.569
 the aap that has already been seen, see 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.159
 It got a little white because like me 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.839
 I'm going to return to the oven. 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.900
 then there is no need left threatened 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:43.849
 if not when returning to the oven at 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.889
 finishing the baking will end up getting 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.589
 dry or who's in charge 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:51.439
 good now you spread the sauce all over 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:54.469
 pizza and you can pay a little sauce 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.809
 by the edge also that will give appearance 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:59.029
 cool if your track gets a little 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:02.659
 white the Mourinho will help a colleague 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:05.120
 a lady also in the description of the video 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:08.059
 the smart will ensure new 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.849
 chopped onion then half of it 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:13.309
 people will put underneath and also 12 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:17.120
 chopped tomatoes more or less without 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:20.480
 seed August site will put 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.030
 half the onion and half the tomato 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.130
 now we'll get all the chips 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.310
 that we had left to apply 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.910
 money and let's spread all over the 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.430
 center 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.640
 Your pizza's spreading well to stay there. 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.030
 you can use neat and 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.280
 on your pizza that the hot dog is good 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.530
 ordering hot dogs is very good too 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.120
 and now we'll put the rest 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.150
 two ingredients 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.550
 the kilo of the onion and what is left of the 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.890
 Tomatoes will also serve to give to 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.040
 give some moisture there 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.890
 our pizza did not get too dry and 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.710
 Now what's missing is just to cover it. 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.180
 with the girl she tried to use and 300 grams 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.450
 of sliced ​​mozzarella 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.870
 You can use grated mozzarella too. 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:11.000
 or you can use catupiry you will stay there 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.820
 criterion and your taste 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.190
 just cover the pizza all you wanted 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.660
 show it and I know that views and also 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.940
 It should feel good 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.010
 good theodore room usually in the 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.210
 hot dog in the food business to 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.340
 people can put corn can put 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.340
 mashed potatoes and I will also be your 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.120
 taste good as i had none 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.040
 Moment as I did not like it then. 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.760
 decide to be afraid of being a 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.010
 ball 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.550
 bake in oven tractor is to finish 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.340
 jazz the pizza and it's ready to 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.410
 hot dog pizza will only end there 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.960
 with straw potatoes 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.230
 you can also put oregano victory 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.060
 always good to put up claims on the pizza more 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.440
 lately even pixel averages have 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:03.290
 forgotten and put oregano 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.169
 so the tip for you is who you like 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.330
 of oregano pizza now without oregano 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.430
 for me not the pizza unfortunately I 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.070
 forgot to buy year in day and no 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.810
 put it but it's worth 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.200
 the people here at home really liked my 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:21.710

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.310
 whimsical 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.390
 I noticed on the edge of the pizza sausage 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.700
 how did it go 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.490
