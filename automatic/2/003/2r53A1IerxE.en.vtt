won't<00:02:34.980> work<00:02:35.190> though<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:35.580> raw<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:37.200> then

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
won't work though with raw and then

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.650 
won't work though with raw and then
you've<00:02:38.010> got<00:02:38.160> Auto<00:02:38.370> distortion<00:02:39.090> control<00:02:39.480> which

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
you've got Auto distortion control which

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.690 
you've got Auto distortion control which
is<00:02:39.690> very<00:02:39.989> good<00:02:40.230> if<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:41.099> especially<00:02:41.549> if<00:02:41.640> you

to<00:02:43.440> might<00:02:43.650> want<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:43.890> turn<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.610> you're

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
to might want to turn that on if you're

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.819 
to might want to turn that on if you're
taking<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.060> picture<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.569> flat<00:02:45.840> horizon<00:02:45.989> or

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.339 
taking a picture of a flat horizon or
distortion<00:02:47.459> would<00:02:47.610> be<00:02:47.730> obvious<00:02:48.180> color<00:02:48.989> space

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
distortion would be obvious color space

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.110 
distortion would be obvious color space
is<00:02:49.590> important<00:02:50.099> always<00:02:50.489> set<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:50.970> arrow

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
course is very useful and you can

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.349 
course is very useful and you can
definitely<00:03:01.950> turn<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.760> get<00:03:02.910> rid<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.090> a

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
definitely turn that on to get rid of a

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.720 
definitely turn that on to get rid of a

the HDR function is in the shooting menu
it<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.019> very<00:03:10.470> good<00:03:10.650> performer<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.310> actually

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
it is a very good performer it actually

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.030 
it is a very good performer it actually
works<00:03:11.760> really<00:03:12.269> well<00:03:12.540> basically<00:03:13.170> takes<00:03:13.739> two

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
works really well basically takes two

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.800 
works really well basically takes two
shots<00:03:14.370> at<00:03:14.730> different<00:03:15.060> exposures<00:03:15.180> and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
shots at different exposures and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.379 
shots at different exposures and
combines<00:03:16.290> them<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.769> make<00:03:16.919> one<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:18.090> got<00:03:18.239> your

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
combines them to make one you got your

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.479 
combines them to make one you got your
long<00:03:18.599> exposure<00:03:19.139> and<00:03:19.470> are<00:03:19.590> what<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:19.980> use<00:03:20.010> if

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
long exposure and are what you use if

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.190 
long exposure and are what you use if
you<00:03:20.519> want<00:03:20.819> to<00:03:20.970> get<00:03:21.090> rid<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.299> noise<00:03:21.660> for<00:03:21.840> longer

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
you want to get rid of noise for longer

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.220 
you want to get rid of noise for longer
exposures<00:03:22.739> high<00:03:23.489> ISO<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.269> honor<00:03:24.450> which<00:03:25.019> is

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
exposures high ISO and honor which is

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.259 
exposures high ISO and honor which is
basically<00:03:25.799> when<00:03:26.040> you're<00:03:26.160> using<00:03:26.340> higher<00:03:26.669> ISO

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
basically when you're using higher ISO

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.500 
basically when you're using higher ISO
so<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.510> helps<00:03:27.780> reduce<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.290> noise<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> bit<00:03:29.510> then

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
so it helps reduce the noise a bit then

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.809 
so it helps reduce the noise a bit then
you<00:03:30.599> got<00:03:30.750> your<00:03:30.870> ISO<00:03:31.260> sensitivities<00:03:32.010> setting

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
you got your ISO sensitivities setting

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.670 
you got your ISO sensitivities setting
you<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.150> set<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.419> to<00:03:33.450> auto<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.169> it'll<00:03:34.470> choose

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
you can set it to auto and it'll choose

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.650 
you can set it to auto and it'll choose
it<00:03:34.859> for<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.239> choose<00:03:36.480> it

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
it for you and you can choose it

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.000 
it for you and you can choose it
manually<00:03:37.079> as<00:03:37.380> well<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:39.290> then<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.709> got<00:03:40.859> your

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
manually as well and then you got your

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.710 
manually as well and then you got your
release<00:03:41.310> mode<00:03:41.639> which<00:03:41.819> is<00:03:41.970> important<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.690> can

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
release mode which is important you can

can't to take the picture it will bypass

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.420 
can't to take the picture it will bypass
the<00:04:33.840> focusing<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.500> still<00:04:34.710> take<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.070> picture

is<00:04:38.610> this<00:04:38.790> guy<00:04:39.030> right<00:04:39.300> here<00:04:39.350> that's<00:04:40.350> lights<00:04:40.860> up

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
is this guy right here that's lights up

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.190 
is this guy right here that's lights up
an<00:04:41.220> area<00:04:41.400> if<00:04:41.610> it's<00:04:41.730> dark<00:04:41.970> out<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.389> autofocus<00:04:42.840> I

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
an area if it's dark out to autofocus I

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.320 
an area if it's dark out to autofocus I
would<00:04:43.440> just<00:04:43.650> have<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:44.040> set<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.310> off<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:45.120> can

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
would just have that set to off it can

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.659 
would just have that set to off it can
really<00:04:45.600> slow<00:04:45.870> down<00:04:46.230> your<00:04:46.470> autofocus<00:04:47.460> when

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
really slow down your autofocus when

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.690 
really slow down your autofocus when
it's<00:04:47.820> light<00:04:48.030> out<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:49.160> then<00:04:50.160> you've<00:04:50.400> got<00:04:50.580> your

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
it's light out and then you've got your

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.350 
it's light out and then you've got your
evey<00:04:51.090> step<00:04:51.450> here<00:04:52.520> fairly<00:04:53.520> easy<00:04:53.700> to<00:04:53.970> control

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
evey step here fairly easy to control

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.390 
evey step here fairly easy to control
you<00:04:55.200> can<00:04:55.320> choose<00:04:55.500> between<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.830> third<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.220> half

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
you can choose between a third and half

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.650 
you can choose between a third and half
a<00:04:56.520> step<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:56.940> what<00:04:57.060> that<00:04:57.210> is<00:04:57.450> is<00:04:57.630> that

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
a step and what that is is that

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.300 
a step and what that is is that
basically<00:04:58.169> is<00:04:58.380> what<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.680> use<00:04:58.919> during

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
basically is what you use during

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.670 
basically is what you use during
aperture<00:04:59.760> priority<00:05:00.000> mode<00:05:00.390> you<00:05:01.080> use<00:05:01.290> that<00:05:01.470> to

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
aperture priority mode you use that to

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.409 
aperture priority mode you use that to
adjust<00:05:02.070> your<00:05:02.190> exposure<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:02.970> you<00:05:03.120> can<00:05:03.300> adjust

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
adjust your exposure and you can adjust

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.409 
adjust your exposure and you can adjust
it<00:05:03.750> by<00:05:03.780> third<00:05:04.230> steps<00:05:04.620> or<00:05:05.130> by<00:05:05.430> half<00:05:05.669> steps<00:05:06.060> most

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
it by third steps or by half steps most

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.980 
it by third steps or by half steps most
of<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.570> time<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:06.780> just<00:05:06.900> use<00:05:07.230> 3rd<00:05:07.500> steps<00:05:08.990> and

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
of the time I just use 3rd steps and

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.350 
of the time I just use 3rd steps and
then<00:05:10.290> you<00:05:10.320> can<00:05:10.560> choose<00:05:10.800> what<00:05:11.460> your<00:05:11.610> alt<00:05:12.150> button

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
then you can choose what your alt button

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.720 
then you can choose what your alt button
is<00:05:12.630> right<00:05:12.870> up<00:05:13.020> here<00:05:13.290> in<00:05:13.530> this<00:05:13.860> menu<00:05:14.130> here<00:05:14.490> and

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
is right up here in this menu here and

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.670 
is right up here in this menu here and
then<00:05:15.210> you<00:05:15.360> can<00:05:15.510> say<00:05:15.690> shutter<00:05:16.020> release<00:05:16.650> button

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
then you can say shutter release button

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.930 
then you can say shutter release button
for<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.370> AEL<00:05:17.790> one<00:05:18.000> so<00:05:18.270> if<00:05:18.360> you<00:05:18.510> put<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.720> on

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
for the AEL one so if you put that on

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.300 
for the AEL one so if you put that on
then<00:05:20.940> you<00:05:21.060> just<00:05:21.240> got<00:05:21.390> your<00:05:21.540> auto<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:22.800> rest<00:05:23.130> of

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
then you just got your auto the rest of

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.250 
then you just got your auto the rest of
these<00:05:23.430> are<00:05:23.640> just<00:05:23.820> timer<00:05:24.330> modes<00:05:24.570> which<00:05:25.020> aren't

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
these are just timer modes which aren't

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.040 
these are just timer modes which aren't
really<00:05:25.530> necessarily<00:05:26.040> important<00:05:26.790> this<00:05:27.419> is<00:05:27.870> the

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
really necessarily important this is the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.530 
really necessarily important this is the
beep<00:05:28.260> when<00:05:28.770> it's<00:05:28.919> in<00:05:29.070> focus<00:05:29.639> that's<00:05:30.120> that<00:05:30.330> beep

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
beep when it's in focus that's that beep

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.240 
beep when it's in focus that's that beep
you're<00:05:30.780> hearing<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:34.440> get<00:05:34.620> your<00:05:34.770> ISO

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
you're hearing and you get your ISO

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
one right here the F set you've got all

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.620 
one right here the F set you've got all
your<00:05:50.100> different<00:05:50.460> function<00:05:50.880> settings<00:05:51.360> and

your different function settings and

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.300 
your different function settings and
this<00:05:51.930> is<00:05:52.050> how<00:05:52.169> you<00:05:52.229> can<00:05:52.470> set<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:52.830> FN<00:05:53.280> button

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
this is how you can set the FN button

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.300 
this is how you can set the FN button
which<00:05:53.970> is<00:05:54.000> right<00:05:54.180> over<00:05:54.479> here<00:05:54.890> you<00:05:55.890> can<00:05:56.039> set<00:05:56.190> it

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
which is right over here you can set it

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.980 
which is right over here you can set it
to<00:05:56.400> do<00:05:56.520> all<00:05:56.820> sorts<00:05:57.210> of<00:05:57.270> different<00:05:57.330> things<00:05:57.600> as

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
to do all sorts of different things as

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.700 
to do all sorts of different things as
you<00:05:58.110> can<00:05:58.140> see<00:05:59.720> and<00:06:00.720> then<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:00.930> can<00:06:01.050> also<00:06:01.169> assign

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
you can see and then you can also assign

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.320 
you can see and then you can also assign
this<00:06:02.130> button<00:06:02.430> as<00:06:02.550> well<00:06:02.700> to<00:06:02.940> a<00:06:02.970> certain

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
this button as well to a certain

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.719 
this button as well to a certain
function<00:06:03.510> it's<00:06:04.169> mostly<00:06:04.560> for<00:06:04.800> AF<00:06:05.220> though<00:06:05.490> so

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
function it's mostly for AF though so

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.180 
function it's mostly for AF though so
it's<00:06:05.880> not<00:06:06.000> as<00:06:06.320> versatile<00:06:07.320> as<00:06:07.560> the<00:06:07.800> function

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
it's not as versatile as the function

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.440 
it's not as versatile as the function
button<00:06:08.460> but<00:06:08.640> it's<00:06:08.760> still<00:06:08.940> got<00:06:09.120> a<00:06:09.180> lot<00:06:09.330> of

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
button but it's still got a lot of

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.290 
button but it's still got a lot of
things<00:06:09.630> that<00:06:09.720> can<00:06:09.870> do<00:06:10.020> for<00:06:10.050> auto<00:06:10.440> focus<00:06:10.979> and

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
things that can do for auto focus and

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.990 
things that can do for auto focus and
then<00:06:12.560> that's<00:06:13.560> for<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.830> rest<00:06:13.979> of<00:06:14.190> these<00:06:14.280> I

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
then that's for the rest of these I

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.670 
then that's for the rest of these I
don't<00:06:15.810> really<00:06:16.020> think<00:06:16.110> they're<00:06:16.410> all<00:06:16.500> that

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
don't really think they're all that

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.010 
don't really think they're all that
important<00:06:17.190> to<00:06:17.250> talk<00:06:17.430> about<00:06:17.660> and<00:06:18.660> then<00:06:18.870> you've

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
important to talk about and then you've

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.520 
important to talk about and then you've
got<00:06:19.200> your<00:06:19.320> setup<00:06:19.680> menu<00:06:20.270> this<00:06:21.270> is<00:06:21.570> your<00:06:21.840> pretty

much the basic settings of your camera

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.880 
much the basic settings of your camera
you<00:06:24.510> don't<00:06:24.690> really<00:06:24.900> ever<00:06:24.930> have<00:06:25.229> to<00:06:25.350> go<00:06:25.500> in<00:06:25.680> here

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
you don't really ever have to go in here

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.190 
you don't really ever have to go in here

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
to adjust for taking pictures it's

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.980 
to adjust for taking pictures it's
mostly<00:06:28.860> for<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.340> monitor<00:06:29.850> in<00:06:30.090> the<00:06:30.510> memory

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
mostly for the monitor in the memory

this<00:06:43.590> is<00:06:43.740> where<00:06:43.920> you<00:06:44.040> would<00:06:44.220> set<00:06:44.460> up<00:06:44.490> your<00:06:44.700> GPS

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
this is where you would set up your GPS

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.320 
this is where you would set up your GPS
if<00:06:45.480> you<00:06:45.570> had<00:06:45.780> it<00:06:46.610> and<00:06:47.610> then<00:06:47.670> here<00:06:47.910> you<00:06:48.060> can<00:06:48.090> also

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
if you had it and then here you can also

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.150 
if you had it and then here you can also
adjust<00:06:48.540> your<00:06:48.840> monitor<00:06:49.050> brightness<00:06:49.770> you<00:06:50.070> can

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
adjust your monitor brightness you can

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.860 
adjust your monitor brightness you can
adjust<00:06:50.580> it<00:06:50.730> whether<00:06:50.910> if<00:06:51.150> it's<00:06:51.360> really<00:06:51.630> bright

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
adjust it whether if it's really bright

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.380 
adjust it whether if it's really bright
out<00:06:51.900> you<00:06:52.290> can<00:06:52.440> go<00:06:52.530> to<00:06:52.590> plus<00:06:52.860> three<00:06:53.220> it's<00:06:53.910> darker

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.390 
out you can go to plus three it's darker

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.000 
out you can go to plus three it's darker
out<00:06:54.510> minus<00:06:55.110> three<00:06:56.390> really<00:06:57.390> the<00:06:57.660> best

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
out minus three really the best

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.080 
out minus three really the best
situation<00:06:59.010> for<00:06:59.040> monitor<00:06:59.550> brightness<00:06:59.940> to

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
situation for monitor brightness to

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.370 
situation for monitor brightness to
adjust<00:07:00.360> that<00:07:00.570> is<00:07:00.720> when<00:07:00.870> it's<00:07:01.020> extremely

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
adjust that is when it's extremely

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
adjust that is when it's extremely
bright<00:07:01.800> out<00:07:02.130> and<00:07:02.460> put<00:07:02.820> it<00:07:02.940> two<00:07:03.060> plus<00:07:03.300> three<00:07:03.330> and

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
bright out and put it two plus three and

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.560 
bright out and put it two plus three and
then<00:07:05.400> that's<00:07:05.640> pretty<00:07:05.910> much<00:07:06.030> all<00:07:06.210> that<00:07:06.270> that

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
then that's pretty much all that that

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.240 
then that's pretty much all that that
does<00:07:06.810> there<00:07:07.110> and<00:07:07.410> then<00:07:07.530> you<00:07:07.590> got<00:07:07.740> your<00:07:07.770> retouch

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
does there and then you got your retouch

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.890 
does there and then you got your retouch
menu<00:07:08.640> which<00:07:08.820> to<00:07:09.000> me<00:07:09.150> honestly<00:07:09.540> I<00:07:09.600> would<00:07:09.780> just

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
menu which to me honestly I would just

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.230 
menu which to me honestly I would just
probably<00:07:10.590> never<00:07:10.830> use<00:07:11.220> because<00:07:11.760> you<00:07:12.000> can<00:07:12.120> do<00:07:12.210> a

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
probably never use because you can do a

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.060 
probably never use because you can do a
lot<00:07:12.450> of<00:07:12.480> these<00:07:12.660> things<00:07:12.960> with<00:07:13.260> simple<00:07:13.710> editing

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
lot of these things with simple editing

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.160 
lot of these things with simple editing
software<00:07:14.520> and<00:07:14.550> the<00:07:15.330> stuff<00:07:15.570> in<00:07:15.810> editing

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.170 
software and the stuff in editing

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.840 
software and the stuff in editing
software<00:07:16.620> and<00:07:16.740> software<00:07:16.980> is<00:07:17.310> a<00:07:17.340> lot<00:07:17.580> better

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850 
software and software is a lot better

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.110 
software and software is a lot better
and<00:07:18.230> then<00:07:19.230> here<00:07:19.650> this<00:07:20.460> will<00:07:20.670> show<00:07:20.820> you<00:07:20.880> all<00:07:21.090> the
