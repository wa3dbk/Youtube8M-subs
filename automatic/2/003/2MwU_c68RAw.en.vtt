00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.369
 if I want to return, the coach remains 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.119

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.850
 to the team 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.760

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.350

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.579

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.050

 William of Wii HD 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.500
 that sounds good because we wrote it 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.990
 together if everything is better working 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.149
 together I know 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.430
 I'm sorry I ruined the club but 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.730
 when you were captain how to say it 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.120
 nice you were a boring controller 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.250
 that's nice I'm sorry but it's 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.630
 I'm sorry 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.900
 controller that wanted everything my way and 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.230
 I did not hear the ideas of others 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.080

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.530

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.390
 you know why I'm crazy because the club is the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.649
 only place where I should do all the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.939
 music the choreography everything is mine 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.280

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.380
 concerts alone that I'm not a 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.270
 bored driver 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.270
