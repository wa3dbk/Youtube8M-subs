00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
I like about this I used to have

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.920 
I like about this I used to have
everything<00:02:41.630> color-coordinated<00:02:42.630> because<00:02:42.840> I

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
everything color-coordinated because I

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.450 
everything color-coordinated because I
was<00:02:43.020> always<00:02:43.200> really<00:02:43.440> anal<00:02:43.800> about<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.130> colors

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
was always really anal about the colors

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.310 
was always really anal about the colors
being<00:02:44.730> together<00:02:44.820> but<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.720> realized<00:02:46.170> that

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
being together but I realized that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.050 
being together but I realized that
that's<00:02:46.560> actually<00:02:46.740> kind<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.250> pointless<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.970> me

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that's actually kind of pointless for me

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.270 
that's actually kind of pointless for me
because<00:02:48.420> then<00:02:48.570> sometimes<00:02:49.380> I'm<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:50.010> looking

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
because then sometimes I'm just looking

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.190 
because then sometimes I'm just looking
for<00:02:50.430> like<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.580> type<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:51.030> clothing<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.420> wear<00:02:51.720> um

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
for like a type of clothing to wear um

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.980 
for like a type of clothing to wear um
not<00:02:52.950> necessarily<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.790> color<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:54.870> is

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
not necessarily a color and this is

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.050 
not necessarily a color and this is
actually<00:02:55.350> way<00:02:55.560> more<00:02:55.590> handy<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.520> I'm<00:02:56.880> not

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
actually way more handy so I'm not

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.420 
actually way more handy so I'm not
