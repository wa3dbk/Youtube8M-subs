00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.429 
falls when superb I think if he's grown
from<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.909> top<00:01:12.240> he<00:01:12.689> got<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> chance<00:01:13.080> he<00:01:13.260> didn't

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
from the top he got a chance he didn't

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.870 
from the top he got a chance he didn't
play<00:01:13.500> well<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> first<00:01:14.100> test<00:01:14.369> match<00:01:14.460> by<00:01:14.729> his

own admission and mind as well so i'll

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.560

most<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> fact<00:01:17.670> he<00:01:17.790> didn't<00:01:18.000> play<00:01:18.090> well<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.390> he

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
most the fact he didn't play well but he

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.880 
most the fact he didn't play well but he
come<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.869> age<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.409> Torah<00:01:19.650> against

superb<00:03:09.660> since<00:03:10.170> our<00:03:10.320> scare<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.770> we<00:03:10.860> gave<00:03:11.040> them

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
superb since our scare that we gave them

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.949 
superb since our scare that we gave them
over<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.820> mel's<00:03:12.060> Britain<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.480> summer<00:03:12.720> I

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
over and mel's Britain the summer I

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.600 
over and mel's Britain the summer I
think<00:03:13.530> their<00:03:13.650> forms<00:03:13.920> mean<00:03:14.100> wonderful<00:03:14.520> of

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
think their forms mean wonderful of

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.740 
think their forms mean wonderful of
interesting<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.060> say<00:03:15.209> they<00:03:15.390> go<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.630> next

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
interesting to say they go the next

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.000 
interesting to say they go the next
couple<00:03:16.050> of<00:03:16.140> weeks<00:03:16.350> i<00:03:16.530> think<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.800> have<00:03:16.890> been

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
couple of weeks i think that have been

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.490 
couple of weeks i think that have been
probably<00:03:17.269> largely<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.420> form<00:03:18.690> team<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.290> the

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
probably largely the form team of the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.110 
probably largely the form team of the
the<00:03:19.769> championship<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.610> way<00:03:20.760> they're<00:03:20.940> playing

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
the championship the way they're playing

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.420 
the championship the way they're playing
a<00:03:21.390> combination<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.080> brute<00:03:22.739> force<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.250> bit

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
a combination of brute force and a bit

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.790 
a combination of brute force and a bit
more<00:03:23.459> Flair<00:03:23.940> says<00:03:24.540> they're<00:03:24.720> dangerous<00:03:25.200> and

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
more Flair says they're dangerous and

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.620 
more Flair says they're dangerous and
obviously<00:03:26.100> i<00:03:26.280> was<00:03:26.550> at<00:03:26.760> disappointing<00:03:27.420> change

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
obviously i was at disappointing change

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.180 
obviously i was at disappointing change
of<00:03:27.780> coaches<00:03:28.019> they've<00:03:28.530> had<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.680> disappointing

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
of coaches they've had a disappointing

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.100 
of coaches they've had a disappointing
lion<00:03:29.610> series<00:03:30.120> but<00:03:30.330> they've<00:03:30.450> got<00:03:30.480> some<00:03:30.780> potent

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
lion series but they've got some potent

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.199 
lion series but they've got some potent
see<00:03:31.260> if<00:03:31.320> they<00:03:31.500> actually<00:03:31.530> get<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.220> right<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.700> can

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
see if they actually get it right I can

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.780 
see if they actually get it right I can
put<00:03:33.390> sides<00:03:33.660> any<00:03:34.019> side<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.560> bed<00:03:34.739> now<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.040> think<00:03:35.190> if

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
put sides any side to bed now I think if

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.520 
put sides any side to bed now I think if
they<00:03:36.180> get<00:03:36.420> their<00:03:36.540> part<00:03:36.870> right<00:03:37.140> there<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.410> most

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
they get their part right there the most

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.250 
they get their part right there the most
dangerous<00:03:37.980> side<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.370> world<00:03:38.550> from<00:03:38.700> points

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
dangerous side in the world from points

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.810 
dangerous side in the world from points
but<00:03:40.260> they're<00:03:40.920> having<00:03:41.010> trouble<00:03:41.190> out<00:03:41.519> front<00:03:41.760> a

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
but they're having trouble out front a

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.360 
but they're having trouble out front a
little<00:03:41.850> bit<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.420> it'll<00:03:42.750> be<00:03:43.019> it'll<00:03:43.440> be<00:03:43.620> an

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
little bit so it'll be it'll be an

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.009 
little bit so it'll be it'll be an
interesting<00:03:44.790> summer<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.660> will<00:03:45.750> be<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.840> good

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
interesting summer and it will be a good

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.400 
interesting summer and it will be a good
test<00:03:46.080> for<00:03:46.380> us<00:03:46.530> because<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.190> shows<00:03:47.610> us<00:03:47.850> that

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
test for us because it it shows us that

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.630 
test for us because it it shows us that
very<00:03:49.410> installs<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:50.070> we<00:03:50.160> have<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.489> play

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
very installs that we have to play

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.160 
very installs that we have to play
against<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.060> how<00:03:51.150> we<00:03:51.209> come<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.510> come<00:03:52.049> up

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
against and how we come a come up

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.600 
against and how we come a come up
against<00:03:52.590> them<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:52.739> it'll<00:03:53.040> be<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.160> good<00:03:53.280> test<00:03:53.459> for

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
against them so it'll be a good test for

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.480 
against them so it'll be a good test for
us

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.550
