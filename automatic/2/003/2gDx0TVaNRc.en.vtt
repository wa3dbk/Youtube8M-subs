fifa at this point it's kind of tough um

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.830 
fifa at this point it's kind of tough um
and<00:04:57.760> you<00:04:57.820> know<00:04:57.850> I<00:04:57.940> tried<00:04:58.180> doing<00:04:58.450> something

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
and you know I tried doing something

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.090 
and you know I tried doing something
like<00:04:58.960> that<00:04:59.110> with<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.350> breakdown<00:04:59.770> and<00:04:59.890> I<00:04:59.920> think

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
like that with the breakdown and I think

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.770 
like that with the breakdown and I think
it<00:05:00.220> works<00:05:00.400> but<00:05:00.640> it's<00:05:00.760> not<00:05:00.910> you<00:05:01.510> know<00:05:01.540> it's<00:05:01.630> not

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
it works but it's not you know it's not

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.450 
it works but it's not you know it's not
something<00:05:02.170> that<00:05:02.200> everybody<00:05:02.950> cares<00:05:03.160> about

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
something that everybody cares about

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.400 
something that everybody cares about
because<00:05:03.700> I<00:05:03.790> try<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.030> take<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:04.570> guess<00:05:05.260> an

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
because I try to take I guess an

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.200 
because I try to take I guess an
intelligent<00:05:06.040> approach<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.640> looking<00:05:06.760> at<00:05:07.030> some

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
intelligent approach to looking at some

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.400 
intelligent approach to looking at some
of<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.330> stuff<00:05:07.540> in<00:05:07.690> FIFA<00:05:08.020> that<00:05:08.140> people<00:05:08.350> don't

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
of the stuff in FIFA that people don't

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.810 
of the stuff in FIFA that people don't
like<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.830> people<00:05:08.980> I<00:05:09.250> think<00:05:09.430> just<00:05:09.670> like

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
like and people I think just like

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.120 
like and people I think just like
yelling<00:05:10.240> at<00:05:10.480> FIFA<00:05:10.900> more<00:05:11.620> than<00:05:11.830> they<00:05:11.950> actually

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
yelling at FIFA more than they actually

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.160 
yelling at FIFA more than they actually
like<00:05:12.580> looking<00:05:12.970> at<00:05:13.060> what<00:05:13.240> they<00:05:13.390> did<00:05:13.450> or<00:05:13.870> didn't

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
like looking at what they did or didn't

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.560 
like looking at what they did or didn't
do<00:05:14.290> wrong<00:05:14.560> on<00:05:14.740> FIFA<00:05:15.100> um<00:05:15.340> which<00:05:15.940> me<00:05:16.240> is

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
do wrong on FIFA um which me is

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.910 
do wrong on FIFA um which me is
sometimes<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.080> think<00:05:17.140> is<00:05:17.320> maybe<00:05:17.440> a<00:05:17.560> bit<00:05:17.770> bizarre

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
sometimes I think is maybe a bit bizarre

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.670 
sometimes I think is maybe a bit bizarre
because<00:05:18.580> I<00:05:18.930> think<00:05:19.930> that<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:20.170> guys<00:05:20.200> are<00:05:20.500> always

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
because I think that you guys are always

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.560 
because I think that you guys are always
trying<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.280> get<00:05:21.370> better<00:05:21.430> at<00:05:21.700> FIFA<00:05:22.150> because<00:05:22.420> hey

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
trying to get better at FIFA because hey

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.450 
trying to get better at FIFA because hey

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
let's face it the game is far more fun

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.220 
let's face it the game is far more fun
when<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:24.910> are<00:05:25.030> winning<00:05:25.210> everybody<00:05:26.080> would

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
when you are winning everybody would

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.570 
when you are winning everybody would
prefer<00:05:26.500> have<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.740> winning<00:05:27.010> record<00:05:27.190> of<00:05:27.460> ever

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
losing record I if possible I would

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.600 
losing record I if possible I would
think<00:05:31.780> that<00:05:32.080> some<00:05:32.680> of<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:32.830> guys<00:05:32.950> might<00:05:33.220> take<00:05:33.460> I

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
about going back to wager matches I

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.840 
about going back to wager matches I
thought<00:05:44.620> about<00:05:44.740> you<00:05:45.070> know<00:05:45.220> taking<00:05:45.430> that<00:05:45.670> and

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
thought about you know taking that and

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.580 
thought about you know taking that and
doing<00:05:45.970> my<00:05:46.180> own<00:05:46.210> spin<00:05:46.660> on<00:05:46.720> it<00:05:46.870> and<00:05:47.110> doing

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
doing my own spin on it and doing

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.960 
doing my own spin on it and doing
something<00:05:48.190> that<00:05:48.280> I<00:05:48.340> was<00:05:48.490> going<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:48.670> call<00:05:48.850> the

putting<00:06:21.610> those<00:06:21.700> out<00:06:22.030> but<00:06:22.870> I<00:06:23.040> you<00:06:24.040> know<00:06:24.070> it's

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
putting those out but I you know it's

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.710 
putting those out but I you know it's

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
still I guess it's that team of the

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.660 
still I guess it's that team of the
season<00:06:26.110> people<00:06:26.380> just<00:06:26.560> want<00:06:26.650> to<00:06:26.800> see<00:06:26.980> the<00:06:27.010> the

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
big fancy shmancy cards and I made a

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.470

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
mistake with path to power this year and

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.910 
mistake with path to power this year and
that<00:06:31.570> was<00:06:31.720> cutting<00:06:32.050> it<00:06:32.200> short<00:06:32.560> from<00:06:32.770> where<00:06:32.890> I

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
that was cutting it short from where I

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.550 
that was cutting it short from where I
was<00:06:33.220> and<00:06:33.520> going<00:06:34.390> packs<00:06:34.630> to<00:06:34.840> assign<00:06:35.140> spending
