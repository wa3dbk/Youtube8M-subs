00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.869 
so yeah then also these screwdrivers
right<00:03:21.060> here<00:03:22.160> these<00:03:23.160> were<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.430> clearance<00:03:23.639> as

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
right here these were on clearance as

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.729 
right here these were on clearance as
well<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:24.269> these<00:03:24.419> were<00:03:24.540> only<00:03:24.720> 199<00:03:25.290> which<00:03:25.620> is

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
well but these were only 199 which is

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.349 
well but these were only 199 which is
this<00:03:25.889> is<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.220> me<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.669> really<00:03:26.940> good<00:03:27.150> price

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
this is to me it's a really good price

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.640 
this is to me it's a really good price
to<00:03:28.319> 199<00:03:28.829> I<00:03:29.419> think<00:03:30.419> it's<00:03:30.540> originally<00:03:30.900> 789<00:03:31.500> but

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
to 199 I think it's originally 789 but

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.649 
to 199 I think it's originally 789 but
it<00:03:31.769> scanned<00:03:32.489> for<00:03:32.669> women<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.209> at<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.449> redbox

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
it scanned for women and at the redbox

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.199 
it scanned for women and at the redbox
and<00:03:34.109> it<00:03:34.199> has<00:03:34.319> a<00:03:34.349> light<00:03:34.620> on<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:35.010> actually<00:03:35.489> this

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
and it has a light on it actually this

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.729 
and it has a light on it actually this
is<00:03:36.389> this<00:03:36.540> would<00:03:36.690> be<00:03:36.780> great<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.139> go<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.379> your<00:03:37.500> car
