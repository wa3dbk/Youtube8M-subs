00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140
 hey 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:08.230
 ready to be live on tve 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.570
 in fact we needed live video 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.129
 they accompany us this week helm and 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.609
 new arrivals from sweden the new 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:19.390
 author sensation roxie roker wines rocks 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.860
 and how is working with austin is great 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.490
 work with me I am a person 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:29.369
 wonderful I was wondering roxy 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.369
 how is working with austin and 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.200
 because if it says in your biography that you are 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.180
 daring and alive and you always say what 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.620
 you think it's the craziest thing you've ever 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.620
 said already 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.230
 you saw that you do not have a filter you never know what 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.520
 which is going to say good by the way is 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.720
 different from the last author of 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.190
 'hosting' ali 2 or it is not true anymore 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.190
 different not the same person 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.210
 austin I think this song I like 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.110
 more than all the songs that 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.110
 did you write with someone 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.090
 roig and brought the fire there no 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.450
 I had and I think you're more talented than 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.070
 she 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.310
 what 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.250
 ali is brilliant you have no idea what 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.020
 what are you talking about I think if you 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.850
 you brought something cool to the music and the 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.479
 song is a hit so the audience 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.479
 like 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.180
 there was also cool I say there are those who 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.890
 they would say that al and roxy have the same 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.720
 amount of freshness my opinion breath 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.220
 They were not such an important part of your 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.220
 success after all I was 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.700
 overvalued 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.710
 and you know how you write music you feel 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.510
 there with your hair full of super crazy gel 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.280
 and you read so many questions from your 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.229
 cards 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.720
 another interesting fact about rocks and it's 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.490
 that when she gets angry she talks like 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.340
 any of us 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.140
 and another thing to work very hard to be 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.140
 treated with such disrespect 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.150
 this is what he was talking and this is 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.150
 the kind of game that lacks me 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
 show 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.800
 thank you for inviting us have a good time 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.800
 very well 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.560
 someone who happened to you I do not know but I know 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:48.640
 rock does make me feel so powerful 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.890
 and I think it's great next remember 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.280
 so much to me before I started to 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.770
 be good and that 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.770
 ronnie what are you doing here are you straight to 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.750
 point I do not like your vigor 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.900
 I want to hire you to work with me 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.890
 new talented artist that's great since 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.890
 I mean, it's worth
