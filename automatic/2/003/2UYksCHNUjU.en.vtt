00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.310
 Personal speech beauty of the road that one more 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.599
 I'm here with the second part 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.910
 how you're improving your r fps game 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.460
 but precisely the flash book 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.289
 then it will start facebook from us here 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.600
 It's not going to mess up, it 's a little something. 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.359
 Dearest, quite liked the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.570
 performance of the first thing is you 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:29.220
 do in a sweep with your 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.439
 antivirus is from the place where the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.660
 virus it will or will not leave the pc more 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.059
 Good and low, but it's win. 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.410
 You 're with evans, you're taking the viruses. 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.870
 switch to quarantine 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.320
 you need to download any antivirus 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.899
 can be a lookout turns is the avast 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.829
 You'll scan your entire computer. 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.649
 and in china at the end of the check you 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.300
 will be sending you to the quarantine or 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.410
 finally blocking the children of the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.750
 your computer 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.219
 The second tip is the galley that is 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.890
 passing and you're using a pendrive 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.130
 Celebrate this by not making you victims. 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.530
 wrong but after completing here and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:18.950
 potential for you to start your computer 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.950
 and then connect plugs into a pendrive 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.430
 device on it with the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:36.990
 right in properties hugs little window 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.079
 You come here to boost here in the red bull. 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.360
 it will appear on the option screens you 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:48.979
 will mark the last and will pull the maximum 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.979
 you give will use the best you're 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.979
 to apply 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.229
 I do not know how to explain how it is. 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.369
 works you better as that 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.680
 improvement but it is not so much but it is already 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.780
 something black and I recommend that you have a 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.289
 pen drive that you do not have had a 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.490
 pendrive is only dedicated to memory 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.330
 of their lives with their same extra memory 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.730
 the computer the third tip I 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.940
 I'm leaving 6 to be there to be. 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.060
 deleting the free space on your 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:32.180
 computer using drywall will bless 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:34.490
 declines goes well in the tools tab goes 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:42.320
 yes you see in cleaning the 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:44.300
 device one locked and thaeme paid and 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.380
 You gotta be careful here, let it go. 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:52.010
 just a free space security you 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.040
 mark the first disk device 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.130
 place you this process here means 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.680
 slow the crowd and can be well 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.680
 lengthy paver but there is a process that 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.280
 helps a lot and is discovering the 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.470
 files that stay there because when you 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.910
 deletes a target file from the trash he 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.570
 will continue your computer for more 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.570
 some time doing this process goes until 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.370
 excluding all files that have already been 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.560
 trash was deleted 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.050
 if you do this you do not have 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.330
 how to recover the deleted files in the 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.920
 recycle bin and has this program where 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.140
 recover here after you 're done 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.150
 completed but if you do this process 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.140
 You will not have any more how to recover. 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.940
 so if you're not careful nothing 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.400
 important do not want to recover you do 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.580
 this process will take a little 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.770
 but obviously is very quiet has not 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:51.050
 problem is that you are doing the fourth and 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.970
 last step is you are setting 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.420
 your video card and this can be a 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.510
 most important method and then go there 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.190
 Just work, you 're going to stay on the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.550
 with the right button in my case I have 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.570
 one in a screen of 3 thousand to appear here 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.640
 nvidia graphic properties or something 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.230
 so it may appear in the media 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:22.070
 finally settings properties 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.870
 graphics is yours by an intervention 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.450
 little window will probably be on 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.290
 basic module you see the advanced 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.290
 everything is OK 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.700
 will be a little here now independently 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.000
 of the glass video door is going to have 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.730
 3d energy option most likely 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.090
 is here positive doing nothing at all 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:51.080
 to let it go the way you are 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:54.170
 use this right here 3d 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.740
 When you click here, you 'll be in or in 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:01.340
 quality up to or in quality or enter 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:08.750
 in the middle you pull to performance and then 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:13.550
 Apply ok now you come energy here 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.100
 in energy and will promise sieve or this 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:21.680
 first option you click on performance 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:25.790
 maximum of the battery the same thing well the 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:31.300
 of the performance jack and stay 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:39.110
 connected to the outlet performance in applying 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:42.800
 Ok ok on my next one and video on video 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:50.470
 cultural has to do with the current lego 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:50.470
 time to evolve the pie is us
