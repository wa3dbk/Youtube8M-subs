00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.880
 very good people of youtube good of 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.220
 this family is doing well 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.999
 commented occurring in a game with 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.549
 very seriously 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:15.510
 well I go normal and I will appear 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.050
 again where same 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.990
 the truth overflowed 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.680
 but when they are imported and they are 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.250
 buying 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.390
 with this background law on rings is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.670
 they gave an account I know when I started 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.079
 about the different types of characters 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.570
 They found in pc 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.760
 they have low power long 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.770
 the john kehr good currently and 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.850
 mainly mainly 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.710
 find in s 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.000
 but there are also consoles like 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:55.589
 the playstation 2 playstation 3 xbox and 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.589
 xbox 360 sinks 620 good 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.520
 good the consequence of letting in the 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.080
 most can be shot and some do not 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.250
 they are bathed which is a bit unfair 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.420
 but good here in good fish and a 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.030
 nape a master spoke that is practically 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.190
 They are called hacker because as you can 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.350
 make a streak if so high so without 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.290
 die once because is very common 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.910
 in the hackers I want and it's true 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.250
 is that a friend got a run of 25 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.220
 less if almost almost the 25 that was removed 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.180
 the nape of modern warfare2 modern 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.860
 warfare 2 on the map I think at 12 and 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.530
 Well , they accused us of hacking and almost almost 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.110
 they are taking it out of the game I do not 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.970
 game in here modern warfare 3 by 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.400
 techno votes that in which there are many 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.060
 hackers but the good thing that already the majority 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.950
 They have been damaged this 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.360
 and modern warfare 2 overlooked 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:02.230
 revolution that I have not seen any hacker 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.570
 one another 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.070
 some others but 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.229
 or not 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.930
 they are simply taken out by those who are left 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.210
 but good what the hackers have 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.020
 invaded almost almost all games 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.020
 they realize 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.630
 when you enter a game of a lobby 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.390
 hacked a game that will make them 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.550
 from experience 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.610
 in most people or rather 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.470
 some people who 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.810
 and want to get everything legal for example 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.210
 I do not know of your seeking gold a base 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.060
 always nothing 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.330
 acr of good gold make them with your 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.090
 own merits and their effort suddenly 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.400
 suddenly enters a lobby and gives them no 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.160
 I know 80 the level and they rise in prestige and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.380
 everything has been a blow maybe to the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.820
 most or some people like it but 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.230
 well there are some people not because good 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.819
 even if it comes out in the soybean 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.840
 it is saved 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.610
 and a little cabrera 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.610
 so open up a little bit that 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.460
 here I do not know how the hell writes 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.520
 good if I saw it but I saw it later 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.660
 Well this one I think is the server ruiz 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.920
 events 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.470
 A) Yes 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.690
 and good to look at the favorites an approach 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.260
 130 to osasuna to cr forgiveness 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.260
 this 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.390
 and the one that most 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.270
 well yes I know I do not like that kind of 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:46.569
 people who like hardcore 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.959
 to level up and that's why 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.650
 with nothing they win with being first if not 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.630
 they are demonstrating to those who 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.460
 truly is man 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.860
 but well here I write one of those 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.340
 mines that I do not know how the hell itself does not 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.540
 I saw her I did not see the mine that but I heard the 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:09.600
 noisy and automatically I went to bed 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:13.080
 I slept remove the floor and good 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:18.709
 this machine all like 12 I'm not 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.600
 sure but good here of the 2 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.870
 a companion the least to kill 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.870
 friends 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.830
 I do not know 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.510
 it's just that 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.590
 I recommend it if you see a 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:39.260
 playstation 3 or xbox extinguish pc 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.360
 what are you looking for, charge or some kind 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:47.259
 of suite or a good or something 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.759
 that hurt others or something that 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.830
 denounce 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.430
 in the same server administrator if 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.430
 it's in pc 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.880
 practically or rather most of 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.340
 the administrators put in the chat by 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.889
 example just appeared for 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.210
 report or put your e-mails will thought 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:11.030
 He explained their data in case 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.540
 there is an error or some 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.169
 one who can report false 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.389
 this 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.039
 and well here they kill me the truth was not 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.689
 a good game but we finished 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.600
 winning we ended up I think good 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.550
 I stayed in first 31 10 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.800
 the truth my fucking idea of how I did it 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.160
 but 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.370
 carlos something not 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.480
 and well at the end I think it was where I think 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.480
 you better take me where 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.610
 because I think he killed four or five of 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.490
 a hit 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.330
 and good to me arms me that I like the most 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.460
 well I told them the scale acr and I 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.860
 I really like to use sniper the truth 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.800
 like too much 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.210
 I in very good almost always play 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.180
 with the sniper 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.370
 but good 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.880
 here they kill me and good took advantage of 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.880
 appear there 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.020
 already to go to the last thing that is over 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.630
 game 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.130
 subscribe where they comment 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.930
 buy you encourage those who want to join 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.680
 on the facebook page 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:22.590
 good this streak 12 and then here comes 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.800
 the third side 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:31.050
 I know there was one out there 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:33.539
 they were all changing all right 4 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.910
 and here came the fifth but it's over 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:40.470
 departure and we left a 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:42.320
 with 6 in 11,400 to 10,200 practically 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.980
 for 200 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:49.100
 but well I'm already ahead and we're going 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.620
 losing and we have the good advantage a 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.390
 I greet everyone at 31 days a good 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.390
 departure but for me goodbye
