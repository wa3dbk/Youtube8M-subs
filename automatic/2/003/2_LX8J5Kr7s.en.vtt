hey<00:00:09.660> guys<00:00:09.870> it's<00:00:10.469> been<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> while<00:00:10.860> but<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.130> have

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
hey guys it's been a while but I have

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.539 
hey guys it's been a while but I have
another<00:00:12.030> video<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.929> one<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> tech<00:00:13.860> video<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
another video this one is a tech video a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.390 
another video this one is a tech video a
little<00:00:14.790> bit<00:00:14.969> different<00:00:15.389> from<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> usual<00:00:16.400> but

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
little bit different from the usual but

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.950 
little bit different from the usual but
I<00:00:17.430> hope<00:00:17.730> you'll<00:00:17.940> guys<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.480> guys<00:00:18.690> will<00:00:18.930> enjoy

I hope you'll guys you guys will enjoy

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.870 
I hope you'll guys you guys will enjoy
it<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.869> mfsu<00:00:22.859> factory<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
it so this here is a mfsu factory and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.340 
it so this here is a mfsu factory and
for<00:00:24.119> those<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.539> who<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:24.840> know<00:00:25.080> what<00:00:25.260> an

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
for those of you who don't know what an

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.550 
for those of you who don't know what an
mfsu<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.359> block<00:00:27.630> right<00:00:27.869> here<00:00:27.930> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
mfsu is it's this block right here it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.150 
mfsu is it's this block right here it
stores<00:00:29.189> energy<00:00:29.510> or<00:00:30.980> BuildCraft<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.309> believe<00:00:32.899> so

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
stores energy or BuildCraft I believe so

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.340 
stores energy or BuildCraft I believe so
this<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.750> factory<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.989> I've<00:00:37.140> designed

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
this is the factory that I've designed

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.860 
this is the factory that I've designed
that<00:00:37.770> makes<00:00:38.040> them<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.790> makes<00:00:39.000> an<00:00:39.329> mfsu

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that makes them and it makes an mfsu

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.220 
that makes them and it makes an mfsu
every<00:00:40.379> ten<00:00:40.620> point<00:00:40.920> eight<00:00:41.040> seconds<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.230> this

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
every ten point eight seconds and this

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
every ten point eight seconds and this
this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.190> an<00:00:44.489> example<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.329> would<00:00:45.420> do

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
this is an example of what it would do

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.660 
this is an example of what it would do
it<00:00:45.930> stores<00:00:46.320> energy<00:00:46.530> from<00:00:47.070> these<00:00:47.219> solar<00:00:47.579> panels

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it stores energy from these solar panels

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.430 
it stores energy from these solar panels
for<00:00:48.539> my<00:00:48.719> factory<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:52.190> well<00:00:53.539> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.780> now<00:00:55.260> this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
for my factory and well this is now this

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.810 
for my factory and well this is now this
is<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.770> drawing<00:00:56.010> energy<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> factory

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
is just drawing energy for the factory

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.529 
is just drawing energy for the factory
so<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.710> started<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.250> how<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.699> works

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
so to get started on how it works

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.149 
so to get started on how it works
each<00:01:03.840> mfsu<00:01:04.530> has<00:01:04.890> four<00:01:05.309> parts<00:01:06.229> now<00:01:07.229> here's<00:01:07.950> the

and<00:02:09.479> eventually<00:02:09.989> get<00:02:10.229> crafted<00:02:10.890> into

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
and eventually get crafted into

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.059 
and eventually get crafted into
their<00:02:12.280> individual<00:02:12.819> ingredients<00:02:13.769> now<00:02:14.769> because

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
their individual ingredients now because

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.160 
their individual ingredients now because
there's<00:02:15.280> six<00:02:15.549> lava<00:02:15.849> Tron<00:02:16.180> crystals<00:02:16.659> and<00:02:16.900> only

there's six lava Tron crystals and only

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.940 
there's six lava Tron crystals and only
one<00:02:17.349> of<00:02:17.500> everything<00:02:17.890> else<00:02:19.109> every<00:02:20.109> six<00:02:20.560> times

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
one of everything else every six times

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.300 
one of everything else every six times
that<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.640> timer<00:02:21.969> goes<00:02:22.239> off<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:23.379> will<00:02:23.680> release

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
that this timer goes off it will release

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.860 
that this timer goes off it will release
the<00:02:24.459> pulse<00:02:24.670> over<00:02:24.849> here<00:02:25.120> triggering<00:02:25.569> all<00:02:25.719> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
the pulse over here triggering all the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.869 
the pulse over here triggering all the
other<00:02:25.989> machines<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.739> each<00:02:26.950> time<00:02:27.219> a<00:02:27.280> pulse<00:02:27.609> is

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
other machines so each time a pulse is

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.119 
other machines so each time a pulse is
sent<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.299> each<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.109> sections<00:02:29.560> it'll<00:02:29.950> be

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
sent to each of the sections it'll be

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.970 
sent to each of the sections it'll be
one<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.329> what<00:02:31.629> is<00:02:31.750> needed<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.530> these

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
one of what is needed so the these

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.449 
one of what is needed so the these
circuits<00:02:36.549> here<00:02:37.299> control<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.049> timing<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.889> when

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
circuits here control the timing of when

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.789 
circuits here control the timing of when
ingredients<00:02:40.090> are<00:02:40.209> added<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.560> goes<00:02:41.769> all

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
ingredients are added and this goes all

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.440 
ingredients are added and this goes all
the<00:02:42.099> way<00:02:42.250> around<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:43.389> all<00:02:43.569> of<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:44.489> filters<00:02:45.489> and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
the way around to all of the filters and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.839 
the way around to all of the filters and
then<00:02:47.109> this<00:02:47.349> timer<00:02:47.650> in<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:47.920> center<00:02:48.250> pulses

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
then this timer in the center pulses

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.050 
then this timer in the center pulses
quickly<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.829> it<00:02:50.829> triggers<00:02:51.250> all<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.790> filters

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
quickly and it triggers all the filters

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.300 
quickly and it triggers all the filters
that<00:02:52.450> are<00:02:52.569> inside<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.049> machine<00:02:53.409> so<00:02:54.280> that

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
that are inside the machine so that

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.789 
that are inside the machine so that
whenever<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:55.139> ingredient<00:02:56.139> is<00:02:56.260> done<00:02:56.470> being

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
whenever a ingredient is done being

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.690 
whenever a ingredient is done being
crafted<00:02:57.370> or<00:02:58.530> smelt<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.709> or<00:02:59.859> macerated<00:03:00.579> or

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
crafted or smelt it or macerated or

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.750 
crafted or smelt it or macerated or
whatever<00:03:01.000> it'll<00:03:01.930> get<00:03:02.109> sent<00:03:02.439> out<00:03:03.900> now<00:03:04.959> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
whatever it'll get sent out now the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.940 
whatever it'll get sent out now the
let's<00:03:06.760> see<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.299> overall<00:03:07.599> size<00:03:07.989> of<00:03:08.409> this<00:03:08.620> is

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
let's see the overall size of this is

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.589 
let's see the overall size of this is
about<00:03:09.389> volume<00:03:10.389> of<00:03:10.780> about<00:03:11.700> 741<00:03:12.700> blocks<00:03:13.349> and

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
about volume of about 741 blocks and

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.129 
about volume of about 741 blocks and
that<00:03:16.599> gives<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:17.169> machine<00:03:17.889> a<00:03:18.159> rating<00:03:18.579> of

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
that gives this machine a rating of

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.030 
that gives this machine a rating of
about<00:03:20.139> one<00:03:20.530> half<00:03:20.829> of<00:03:20.889> a<00:03:22.049> mfsu<00:03:23.049> per<00:03:23.500> block<00:03:23.709> per

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
about one half of a mfsu per block per

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.449 
about one half of a mfsu per block per
hour<00:03:24.569> which<00:03:25.569> basically<00:03:25.959> means<00:03:26.349> that<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
hour which basically means that the

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.430 
hour which basically means that the
entire<00:03:27.819> volume<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.419> this<00:03:28.690> produces<00:03:30.479> wool<00:03:31.479> it

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
entire volume of this produces wool it

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.319 
entire volume of this produces wool it
means<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.889> for<00:03:33.250> each<00:03:33.549> block<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.180> this

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
means that for each block of this

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.719 
means that for each block of this
produces<00:03:34.930> half<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.979> an<00:03:36.129> MFP

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:36.729 
produces half of an MFP

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.530 
produces half of an MFP
per<00:03:37.540> hour<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.729> that<00:03:39.729> I<00:03:39.760> think<00:03:40.120> that's<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.419> good

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
per hour and that I think that's a good

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.219 
per hour and that I think that's a good
way<00:03:40.599> of<00:03:41.040> grading<00:03:42.040> factories<00:03:42.909> in<00:03:43.239> Tekkit<00:03:44.139> I

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:44.229 
way of grading factories in Tekkit I

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.140 
way of grading factories in Tekkit I
haven't<00:03:44.650> seen<00:03:44.829> anyone<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.549> know

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
haven't seen anyone you know

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.870 
haven't seen anyone you know
great<00:03:47.840> great<00:03:48.680> diamond<00:03:48.920> rate<00:03:49.190> dumber<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.730> know

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
great great diamond rate dumber you know

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.800 
great great diamond rate dumber you know
have<00:03:50.690> competitions<00:03:51.349> between<00:03:51.560> sizes<00:03:52.780> but<00:03:53.780> I

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
have competitions between sizes but I

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.930 
have competitions between sizes but I
think<00:03:54.140> that's<00:03:54.349> a<00:03:54.590> good<00:03:55.069> way<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.280> taking<00:03:55.610> all

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
think that's a good way of taking all

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.089 
think that's a good way of taking all
the<00:03:56.090> different<00:03:56.390> variables<00:03:56.660> into<00:03:57.110> account<00:03:57.410> so

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
the different variables into account so

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.550 
the different variables into account so
here<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.400> have<00:03:58.550> another<00:03:59.060> timer<00:03:59.420> set<00:03:59.810> to<00:04:00.050> ten

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
here I have another timer set to ten

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.820 
here I have another timer set to ten
point<00:04:00.830> eight<00:04:01.540> seconds<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:02.989> we<00:04:03.110> can<00:04:03.260> see<00:04:03.470> here

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
point eight seconds so we can see here

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.820 
point eight seconds so we can see here
that<00:04:04.250> if<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.810> let<00:04:05.810> this<00:04:05.930> time<00:04:06.200> ago<00:04:06.500> when<00:04:06.709> in

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
that if I let this time ago when in

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.300 
that if I let this time ago when in
Amethi<00:04:07.280> comes<00:04:08.180> here<00:04:08.540> or<00:04:08.840> an<00:04:08.989> mfsu<00:04:09.560> comes<00:04:09.920> here

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
Amethi comes here or an mfsu comes here

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.180 
Amethi comes here or an mfsu comes here
we<00:04:10.400> go<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:12.200> each<00:04:12.560> time<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.010> goes<00:04:13.130> around

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
we go that each time it goes around

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.460 
we go that each time it goes around
it'll<00:04:14.060> take<00:04:14.239> ten<00:04:14.480> point<00:04:14.720> eight<00:04:14.810> seconds<00:04:15.290> and

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
it'll take ten point eight seconds and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.909 
it'll take ten point eight seconds and
another<00:04:15.739> one<00:04:15.950> will<00:04:16.130> come<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:16.519> come<00:04:17.030> out

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
another one will come and come out

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.719 
another one will come and come out
nicely<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:19.190> same<00:04:19.400> time<00:04:20.620> we<00:04:21.620> go<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:22.070> there<00:04:22.639> you

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
nicely the same time we go and there you

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:29.230 
nicely the same time we go and there you
go<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.870> can<00:04:24.020> see<00:04:24.229> it<00:04:24.260> there<00:04:25.960> now<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.850> machine

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
go you can see it there now this machine

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.140 
go you can see it there now this machine
doesn't<00:04:30.020> have<00:04:30.229> any<00:04:30.800> excess<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.610> gets<00:04:31.850> left

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
doesn't have any excess that gets left

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.300 
doesn't have any excess that gets left
over<00:04:32.540> in<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.750> machine<00:04:33.020> all<00:04:33.290> of<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.740> recipes

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
over in the machine all of the recipes

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.770 
over in the machine all of the recipes
are<00:04:34.490> exact<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.350> each<00:04:36.350> of<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.620> filters<00:04:37.010> that

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
are exact and each of the filters that

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.710 
are exact and each of the filters that
pulls<00:04:38.780> out<00:04:38.990> from<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.470> energy<00:04:40.160> condensers

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
pulls out from the energy condensers

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.990 
pulls out from the energy condensers
pulls<00:04:41.720> out<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.080> exact<00:04:42.620> amount<00:04:42.979> so<00:04:43.280> there's

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
pulls out the exact amount so there's

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.180 
pulls out the exact amount so there's
