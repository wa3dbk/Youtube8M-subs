00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.460
 first victory of the season of 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.350
 Real Zaragoza got the set 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.389
 Aragon cornellá-victory in the for 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.129
 have a strange match in which the 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.360
 Spanish was better in the first half and 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.610
 in fact he put himself ahead in the 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.490
 marker a first part where you do not 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.010
 there were many occasions but the whole 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.580
 blue and white as we say had the 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.580
 initiative 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.590
 and it was always closer to 1 to 0 than 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.590
 from 0 to 1 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.210
 the Zaragoza practically did not reach the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 goal 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.710
 from cristian 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.870
 and the set of pochettino 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.879
 both in corner kicks and hanging 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.940
 I look for balls in the header your 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.239
 best weapon to surprise in this lance 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.370
 of the game he received a blow hector tan 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.870
 the Mexican footballer albín would be 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.250
 protagonist in the second part 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.180
 we want this auction 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.180
 as we say 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.970
 and hector Moreno himself two minutes 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.580
 then returns to star in that auction 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 above the crossbar a brown hector 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.330
 that he had to leave in the second 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.180
 half injured 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.610
 of the pitch as we said more and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.770
 better the Spanish that would get the edge 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.920
 of rest this fantastic goal 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.620
 recovery of wakaso delivery for 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.650
 álvaro vázquez and 8 of Spanish 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.350
 solves the play in the hand to hand with 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.420
 Goalkeeper Roberto to score 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.200
 the first of the party was put by 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 front in the espanyol 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.960
 that had been better has not been in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.250
 overwhelming domain but yes superior to 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:54.090
 zaragoza to get the prize of the goal 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:57.240
 fantastic the action again 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.950
 by Álvaro Vázquez seeing it for the 1 to 0 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.060
 but everything changed in the second half 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.350
 it was a play 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.410
 unfortunate of course for the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.950
 blanquiazules before notified the zaragoza 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.650
 with this very distant shot that saves the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.049
 goalkeeper cristian álvarez 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.939
 but the misfortune misfortune play 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.799
 would arrive right away with albin's hand 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.240
 who had already seen a yellow in the 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.730
 first period 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.140
 of the second leaves his team with 10 and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.630
 in addition the party referee 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:35.920
 for rosemary that ends up whistling 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.910
 the maximum penalty was left with 10 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.910
 set 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.540
 blue and white the penalty that would transform 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.920
 in support goal to tie the match 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.920
 at minute 5 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.790
 of the second part 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.799
 not only did he match the shock but 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.260
 that he had the whole second part of 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.659
 zaragoza to look for the victory playing 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.330
 against a team with 10 and had chances 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.670
 to do it 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.620
 I feel in some phases of the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.910
 party in this second period that 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.150
 two teams were satisfied with the draw 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.090
 is a very clear pinter in a 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.430
 postiga action that ends with 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.340
 the ball rejected and we see 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.930
 and he is about to make a swing in the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.910
 forward Álvaro Vázquez practically 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.800
 from the same goal line 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.650
 zaragoza that also tried with 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.020
 aerial balls surprise the goal of 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.020
 cristian traction from the left 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.670
 and the party that was for the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.670
 tie the two teams to one 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.910
 He seemed to insist that 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.640
 this action came at the last breath 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.959
 also as it would happen in the first 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.370
 Half with the goal of Espanyol Helder 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.280
 postiga hunts a ball 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.140
 the center from the right fantastic 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.819
 that center of víctor rodríguez player 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.329
 that had entered the second half 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.319
 it's short and the one that hangs does not reject rui 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.650
 fonte 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.650
 and ends up marking Zaragoza something of the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.470
 Espanyol victory claim 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.410
 something in the area when Roberto did not 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.790
 he could catch the ball desperately 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.100
 the blue and white team to tie a 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.550
 party that in the end would end up losing 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.340
 this was the last action already of the party 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:39.590
