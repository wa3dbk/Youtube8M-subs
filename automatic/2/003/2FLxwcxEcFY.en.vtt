00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that it can be worn on the wrist so it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.139 
that it can be worn on the wrist so it
is<00:01:24.179> basically<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.319> a<00:01:25.380> wristwatch<00:01:26.149> we

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
is basically just like a wristwatch we

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
the mb-910 is about twice as heavy as a

heavy as a woman's watch and of course

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.620 
heavy as a woman's watch and of course
it<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.119> bigger
