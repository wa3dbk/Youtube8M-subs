know you're going around you you do what
you<00:02:17.840> can<00:02:18.049> and<00:02:18.079> you<00:02:18.620> know<00:02:19.159> the<00:02:19.249> fires<00:02:19.489> unit<00:02:19.790> it's

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
you can and you know the fires unit it's

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.149 
you can and you know the fires unit it's
going<00:02:20.359> to<00:02:20.420> go<00:02:20.510> out<00:02:20.599> sometime<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.409> once<00:02:22.069> you

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
going to go out sometime and once you

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.589 
going to go out sometime and once you
start<00:02:22.340> getting<00:02:22.370> around<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.209> can<00:02:23.359> find<00:02:23.540> a

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
start getting around and you can find a

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.059 
start getting around and you can find a
spot<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.870> pinch<00:02:24.170> off<00:02:24.319> like<00:02:24.530> they<00:02:24.680> did<00:02:24.829> you<00:02:24.980> know

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
spot to pinch off like they did you know

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.039 
spot to pinch off like they did you know
that<00:02:25.219> dozer<00:02:25.459> line<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.060> Hereford<00:02:26.749> and<00:02:26.780> stuff

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
that dozer line and Hereford and stuff

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.300 
that dozer line and Hereford and stuff
like<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.260> then<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.709> can<00:02:27.829> stop<00:02:28.129> it<00:02:28.280> from

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
like that then you can stop it from

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.270 
like that then you can stop it from
getting<00:02:28.609> exposed<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.750> other<00:02:29.810> structures<00:02:30.379> but

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
getting exposed to other structures but

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.119 
getting exposed to other structures but
for<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.879> most<00:02:32.030> part<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.510> he<00:02:32.900> just<00:02:33.139> you<00:02:34.099> know

the<00:02:34.250> fire<00:02:34.609> starts<00:02:35.000> here<00:02:35.209> stops<00:02:35.569> here<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:35.959> goes

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
the fire starts here stops here and goes

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.509 
the fire starts here stops here and goes
over<00:02:36.290> here<00:02:36.590> in<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.769> throat<00:02:37.010> you're<00:02:37.250> trying<00:02:37.459> to

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
over here in the throat you're trying to

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.020 
over here in the throat you're trying to
tie<00:02:37.669> it<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.969> and<00:02:38.239> but<00:02:39.230> it's<00:02:39.469> use<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.919> you<00:02:40.909> know

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.330 

see<00:04:50.990> what<00:04:51.170> it<00:04:51.200> is<00:04:51.320> you<00:04:51.560> have<00:04:51.680> you'll<00:04:52.160> see

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
see what it is you have you'll see

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.600 
see what it is you have you'll see
likely<00:04:52.640> see<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:52.940> smoke<00:04:53.210> build<00:04:53.510> up<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:54.610> when

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
likely see the smoke build up and when

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.060 
likely see the smoke build up and when
that<00:04:55.730> smoke<00:04:55.970> build<00:04:56.210> up<00:04:56.300> its<00:04:56.480> really<00:04:56.660> dark

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
that smoke build up its really dark

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.040 
that smoke build up its really dark
that's<00:04:58.070> all<00:04:58.370> heat<00:04:58.700> and<00:04:58.940> you're<00:04:59.120> getting<00:04:59.270> all

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
that's all heat and you're getting all

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.440 
that's all heat and you're getting all
the<00:05:00.350> leaves<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:00.890> anything<00:05:01.220> hot<00:05:01.460> it's<00:05:02.060> coming

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
the leaves and anything hot it's coming

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.990 
the leaves and anything hot it's coming
off<00:05:02.570> of<00:05:02.600> that<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.670> getting<00:05:04.670> caught<00:05:04.820> at<00:05:04.970> the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
off of that is getting caught at the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.270 
off of that is getting caught at the
mill<00:05:05.240> that<00:05:05.390> I<00:05:05.600> called<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.930> home<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.530> then<00:05:07.100> when

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
mill that I called it home and then when

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.620 
mill that I called it home and then when
that<00:05:07.370> column<00:05:07.700> gets<00:05:07.790> right<00:05:08.030> across<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.570> he

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
that column gets right across and he

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.700 
that column gets right across and he
hits<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:08.870> road<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.200> starts<00:05:09.410> laying<00:05:09.560> over

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
hits the road and it starts laying over

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.950 
hits the road and it starts laying over
the<00:05:09.860> road<00:05:10.040> it's<00:05:10.640> taking<00:05:10.760> all<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.420> heat<00:05:11.660> over

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
the road it's taking all that heat over

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.040 
the road it's taking all that heat over
so<00:05:12.140> a<00:05:12.170> lot<00:05:12.530> of<00:05:12.560> it<00:05:12.740> starts<00:05:13.010> off<00:05:13.160> of<00:05:13.420> the<00:05:14.420> hotter

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
so a lot of it starts off of the hotter

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.750 
so a lot of it starts off of the hotter
it<00:05:15.170> is<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.440> heavier<00:05:16.220> you<00:05:16.370> know<00:05:16.430> the<00:05:16.550> bigger

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
it is the heavier you know the bigger

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.090 
it is the heavier you know the bigger
stuff<00:05:17.000> it'll<00:05:17.210> carry<00:05:17.540> and<00:05:18.320> you<00:05:18.530> when<00:05:18.770> it's

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
stuff it'll carry and you when it's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.770 
stuff it'll carry and you when it's
usually<00:05:19.580> it's<00:05:19.790> like<00:05:19.970> it'll<00:05:20.300> knock<00:05:20.450> your<00:05:20.600> heart

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
usually it's like it'll knock your heart

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.960 
usually it's like it'll knock your heart
out<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:21.290> mean<00:05:21.680> it's<00:05:21.800> kind<00:05:21.950> of<00:05:22.010> you<00:05:22.640> know<00:05:22.670> it'll

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
out I mean it's kind of you know it'll

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.670 
out I mean it's kind of you know it'll
generate<00:05:23.120> me<00:05:23.480> I<00:05:23.510> would<00:05:23.720> say<00:05:23.810> its<00:05:23.930> own<00:05:24.050> win<00:05:24.320> but

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
generate me I would say its own win but

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.860 
generate me I would say its own win but
it's<00:05:25.490> got<00:05:25.730> a<00:05:25.760> lot<00:05:25.910> of<00:05:25.970> energy<00:05:26.210> with<00:05:26.570> that<00:05:26.720> and

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
it's got a lot of energy with that and

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.270 
it's got a lot of energy with that and
when<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.050> hits<00:05:27.260> when<00:05:27.500> it<00:05:27.590> gets<00:05:27.740> up<00:05:27.830> to<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:28.070> road

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
when it hits when it gets up to the road

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.060 
when it hits when it gets up to the road
and<00:05:28.810> it's<00:05:29.810> an<00:05:29.960> email<00:05:30.200> it<00:05:30.500> lays<00:05:30.650> over<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.950> road

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
and it's an email it lays over the road

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.500 
and it's an email it lays over the road
and<00:05:31.160> it<00:05:31.250> throws<00:05:31.400> all<00:05:31.640> that<00:05:31.880> all<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.210> embers

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
and it throws all that all the embers

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.680 
and it throws all that all the embers
over<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.950> it's<00:05:34.070> just<00:05:34.250> like<00:05:34.340> you<00:05:34.700> know<00:05:34.760> taking
