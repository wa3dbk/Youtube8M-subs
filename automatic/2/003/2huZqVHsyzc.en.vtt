00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 saved people from spazioogames are doctor 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.580
 weitz and first of all I wanted to make you of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.890
 happy Easter 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.870
 today we are here with a typical video 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.420
 button and sutil team with an announcement 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.210
 very important because why they are 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
 finally the first teams of were decided 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.630
 the season I had made a video of it 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.390
 saying that they had opened and candura 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.310
 the first season deimos consists 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.900
 now there are official teams vi 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.869
 I remember these players are 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.340
 players who linked during the year 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 they have been particularly good 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180
 all year but never received 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.309
 a version that will be in this year 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.380
 a team has most suit consists of for the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.870
 bronze for silver and talk that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.059
 so many players will be there 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.610
 particular week in pubs because 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.680
 because we will have 3demon the season is one 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
 team of the week of many 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.760
 players players can vote 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.000
 on the forum the trains that have been chosen 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.379
 from the users the bronze players are not 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.809
 I have not particularly interesting 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.789
 seen no one particularly strong 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.890
 but already because of the silver it changes because 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.780
 because we certainly have heard of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.670
 verona as an interesting agent but 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.549
 we have players that will cost 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.080
 a lot for example the bike of which then 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.360
 we'll talk later 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.729
 and above all the left-back is not me 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.920
 it seems to be called the show you play 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.409
 England there it will go a lot 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 because highly rated on tony formulas 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.520
 kart so it will really cost a lot 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.320
 how most interesting is certainly to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.479
 a destiny of gold because why 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.170
 we have three players from the series a 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.140
 we have castan of roma de rossi 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.759
 always from rome and cerci del torino 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.159
 so many players because we can 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.420
 note rooney so we do n't have it 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.040
 danny de gea so many players 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.720
 interesting look at that why in there 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.460
 bench that really statistics 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.750
 interesting I remember the statesmen 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.070
 that will be decided by the caf trains 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.470
 but the players have already been chosen 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.700
 so these are when this comes out 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.490
 team of the season 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.020
 some already say 23 so this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.179
 Wednesday in my opinion 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.259
 we will see at 30 to open anyway missing 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.299
 very little 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.369
 I had four highlights 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.479
 players of this team in particular 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.209
 on the season 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.670
 the first is de paris is equal to the left 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.140
 del psv is a yellow silver itself not 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.489
 are worth in the stronger silver of the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.739
 I wanted to bring you reviews 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.540
 sooner or later this present we decide 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.280
 the afi will really cost a lot 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.790
 because it will really have statistics 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.099
 really interesting the only penalty 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.950
 could be the fact that you play in 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.680
 Eredivise if it were such a card 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.260
 played in the premier league would cost 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.000
 in my opinion also above 800 900 thousand 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.819
 credits because it will really really be 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.500
 absurd if you remember the theme here 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.360
 of the last year's season this 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.610
 could also have that cost and me 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.560
 I want to unbalance a player who 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.349
 surely it could interest many 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.390
 eggers martin jackson martinez of the port 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.799
 and jamie moul stronger gold educators 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.230
 is often used in tandem with 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.299
 ibarbo con falcao exploiting the fact 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.610
 which is Colombian this president has a 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.829
 decidedly promises to be excellent above all 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.810
 from the point of view of the speed of the 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.459
 Dripping shot then the header 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.799
 it was already extraordinary in the version 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.630
 base therefore will definitely be enhanced 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.819
 in this I was the seventh decision will become 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.459
 really really crazy I expect 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.290
 a card like that and sincerely 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.910
 could be one of the attackers 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.069
 during the game in my opinion it will cost 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.410
 even less than 150,000 therefore you believe one 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.310
 figure within player's reach 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.530
 interesting could be 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.049
 the alternative in low cost quotes a 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.940
 cristiano ronaldo and the damages to the 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.880
 the five stars left of the zen 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.709
 therefore excellent screen will have some 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.389
 really interesting values ​​for everything 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.709
 who was very good speed 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.840
 extremely at first that of cristian 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.209
 hard but a dribble will definitely be a 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.430
 very high value certainly above 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.590
 all 88 so it could be 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.720
 a low cost alternative to others if not 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.760
 they would be nice to compare danny 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.349
 was among which is one of the legends that 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.079
 one of the strongest is indicated e 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.389
 cristiano ronaldo to define the s 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.530
 Portuguese of the strongest in relationship 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.329
 quality price could be a 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.010
 interesting comparison to make of danny 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.389
 I would like to bring you the review 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.959
 we close with a player waiting 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.730
 all practically alessio cerci ati 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.980
 so changed 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.510
 position from outside right has one 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.370
 central position of between being 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.780
 deployed as a striker 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.299
 the values ​​will surely be 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.900
 interesting the medium-low work then 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.610
 okay for a tip i look great 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.199
 things this player could be 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.970
 one of the most used attackers in 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.620
 set a to do the shoulder a player 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.820
 maybe ibarbo like balotelli then 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.410
 maybe the strongest player 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.919
 physically we can make an attack 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.930
 fast good at dribbling good shot and 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.940
 left then maybe not opponents 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.889
 they know it very well so we can 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.419
 go to pull left and score 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.080
 easily he wanted to bring one back 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.900
 review 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.600
 tell me a little bit about the players 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.860
 wait for these teams of the season 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.350
 maybe you don't even play first class 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.449
 maybe you saw a silver carrier 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.520
 to complete your league rose 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.270
 Mexican you want to suggest me to try 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.070
 even that 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.479
 so in the case I believe in some 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.300
 comments that troubadours you expect 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.430
 what do you want to try and then maybe 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.620
 who can notice a review of the 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.360
 I definitely wanted to do cerci and denny 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.169
 then we will see a little how it will evolve 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.370
 situation 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.050
 I am also therefore concluded that 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.789
 I still wish you a Happy Easter 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.789
 we'll see you soon, hello to everyone
