00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
got a lot of dead leaves you just want

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.300 
got a lot of dead leaves you just want
to<00:01:25.930> remember<00:01:26.110> to<00:01:26.320> be<00:01:26.410> very<00:01:26.650> safe<00:01:26.950> with<00:01:27.130> it

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
to remember to be very safe with it

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.090
