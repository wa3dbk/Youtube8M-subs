the entire game and never do anything

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.990 
the entire game and never do anything
with<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.680> evidenced<00:01:23.220> by<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.400> chance<00:01:23.820> in

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
with it as evidenced by this chance in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.640 
with it as evidenced by this chance in
the<00:01:24.090> 75th<00:01:24.540> minute<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.960> think<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.259> was<00:01:25.470> like

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the 75th minute I think this was like

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.170 
the 75th minute I think this was like
probably<00:01:25.860> their<00:01:26.189> only<00:01:26.220> shot<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> entire

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
probably their only shot at the entire

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.240 
probably their only shot at the entire
game<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.570> add<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> ball<00:01:28.500> gets<00:01:28.770> cleared<00:01:29.100> it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
game and add the ball gets cleared it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.249 
game and add the ball gets cleared it
ends<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.909> one-nil<00:01:30.299> victory<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:30.930> us<00:01:30.960> which

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
ends in a one-nil victory for us which

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.109 
ends in a one-nil victory for us which
I'm<00:01:31.439> satisfied<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.670> did<00:01:32.880> want

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
I'm satisfied with but I really did want

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
I'm satisfied with but I really did want
to<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.570> run<00:01:33.810> riot<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.530> their<00:01:34.710> defense<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
to like run riot on their defense I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800 
to like run riot on their defense I
really<00:01:35.369> wanted<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> send<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.090> signal<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.540> really

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
really wanted to send a signal I really

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.499 
really wanted to send a signal I really
wanted<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> score<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.890> five<00:01:38.159> goals<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:39.210> them

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
wanted to score like five goals but them

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.330

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it didn't happen and read and get

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.980 
it didn't happen and read and get
relegated<00:01:41.729> because<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
relegated because of that and this is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
relegated because of that and this is
how<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> full<00:01:43.560> time<00:01:43.770> starts<00:01:44.130> look<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.549> I'm

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
how the full time starts look like I'm

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.940 
how the full time starts look like I'm
sure<00:01:45.240> they're<00:01:45.420> absolutely<00:01:46.079> delighted<00:01:46.649> with

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
sure they're absolutely delighted with

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
sure they're absolutely delighted with
their<00:01:47.040> fifty-nine<00:01:47.490> percent<00:01:47.670> possession<00:01:48.329> and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
really important to get the win and

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.770 
really important to get the win and
that's<00:03:48.610> why<00:03:48.760> in<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:48.940> 60th<00:03:49.390> minute<00:03:49.480> when
