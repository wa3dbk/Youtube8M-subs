00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.470
 hello, I am the teacher, we are moving away 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.689
 the moral ones I am a student of 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.650
 PhD in the research center 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.020
 in applied science and technology 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.900
 advanced of the polytechnic institute 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.029
 national 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.220
 since my masters studies I have 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.739
 worked with on innovation topics 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.660
 technology focused on solving 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.250
 environmental problems 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.650
 as a student of the institute by the 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.600
 national coach I have had the fortune of 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.460
 give use to the laboratories of this 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.150
 institution to carry out my 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.150
 research 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.920
 basically the idea is to create 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.930
 nanotech solar collectors 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.670
 able to purify water 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.400
 carrying out the degradation of 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.560
 Persistent pollutants using 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.380
 as an energy source sunlight 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.350
 the idea is to employ with the combination of 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.590
 nanotechnology and sunlight and in turn 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.600
 green technology 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.549
 the main process that intervenes in 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.820
 this idea is photocatalysis 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.510
 heterogeneous using the structures 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.640
 as photocatalysts 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.060
 these photocatalysts are activated with 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.030
 sunlight 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.700
 and they work in the following way this 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.170
 is we have a nanoparticle immersed in 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.390
 a contaminated aqueous solution 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.090
 they can be pollutants mainly 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.909
 of organic type call paintings 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.130
 insecticide herbicides colorants 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.330
 pesticides solvent fertilizers 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.659
 greasy oils paintings among others to 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.869
 absorb the light the particle this makes 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.729
 generate hollow electron pairs and in 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.920
 the surface of the nanoparticles inter 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.840
 by interacting with the surface of the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.869
 the nanoparticle interact 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.050
 water molecules dissociate protons and 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.540
 in potholes in radicals or potholes that are 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.299
 highly electro negative which in turn 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.130
 these radicals participate in a process 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.830
 of degradation of pollutants 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.069
 organic the products of the reaction 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.750
 ideal end is that you get from co2 and 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.569
 again water that is can be 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.390
 reused 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.590
 the project is innovative and can 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.420
 compete with the processes of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.010
 water purification that is currently 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.829
 used in agriculture and in 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.260
 industry and is directed from to micro 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.749
 small and medium businesses up 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.799
 large industrial plants where 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.799
 uses the vital liquid 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.620
 and point
