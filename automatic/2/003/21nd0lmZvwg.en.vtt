00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
here and here Smith normal I looked at

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.450 
here and here Smith normal I looked at
it<00:01:50.370> on<00:01:50.550> two<00:01:50.850> different<00:01:51.210> steps<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.470> how

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
it on two different steps and so is how

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.120 
it on two different steps and so is how
it's<00:01:53.670> supposed<00:01:53.760> to<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.150> so<00:01:54.960> she's<00:01:55.710> three

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
it's supposed to be so she's three

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.870 
it's supposed to be so she's three
different<00:01:56.400> power<00:01:56.580> setting<00:01:58.400> so<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.430> starts

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
different power setting so it starts

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.200 
different power setting so it starts
from<00:02:00.000> here

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.289 

he<00:02:02.750> has<00:02:03.070> screen<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.280> device<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:04.970> then<00:02:05.150> they

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
he has screen and device and then they

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.570 
he has screen and device and then they
make<00:02:05.450> bubbles<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.500> bubbles<00:02:07.340> not

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
make bubbles this is on bubbles not

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.040 
make bubbles this is on bubbles not
bubbles<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:10.220> next<00:02:10.520> power<00:02:10.789> setting<00:02:11.300> should<00:02:11.990> be

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
bubbles the next power setting should be

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.650 
bubbles the next power setting should be
continuous

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
continuous

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.660 
continuous
this<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.350> does<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.710> for<00:02:14.980> 10<00:02:15.190> or<00:02:15.220> 15<00:02:15.640> minutes

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
this is does this for 10 or 15 minutes

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.310 
this is does this for 10 or 15 minutes
and<00:02:15.970> then<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.210> turns<00:02:16.450> off<00:02:16.600> on<00:02:16.780> its<00:02:16.930> own<00:02:17.020> if<00:02:17.200> you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320
