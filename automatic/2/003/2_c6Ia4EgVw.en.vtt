00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
froze over and stayed that way for about

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.799 
froze over and stayed that way for about
two<00:00:55.980> months<00:00:56.250> remember<00:00:56.610> rightly<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.239> kept

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
two months remember rightly I kept

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.180 
two months remember rightly I kept
walking<00:00:57.930> down<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.440> was<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> way<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> work

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
walking down it was on the way to work

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.740 
walking down it was on the way to work
so<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.430> could<00:00:59.550> go<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.850> ever<00:01:00.090> lurk<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
so I could go down ever lurk and if that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.660 
so I could go down ever lurk and if that
if<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> had<00:01:01.710> thawed<00:01:02.010> out<00:01:02.160> sort<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
if it had thawed out sort of be the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.439 
if it had thawed out sort of be the
first<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.059> know

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
first to know

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.840 
first to know
I<00:01:03.480> went<00:01:04.470> down<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.769> very<00:01:05.070> early<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.460> February

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
I went down there very early in February

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.149 
I went down there very early in February
I<00:01:05.880> think<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> third<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:06.720> fourth<00:01:07.159> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
I think it was the third or fourth and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.830 
I think it was the third or fourth and
the<00:01:08.340> back<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.450> an<00:01:09.540> area<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.720> I

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the back by which is an area that I

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.500 
the back by which is an area that I
decided<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.380> target<00:01:10.830> because<00:01:11.270> single<00:01:12.270> scale

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
decided to target because single scale

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.750 
decided to target because single scale
was<00:01:12.900> quite<00:01:13.710> often<00:01:13.890> got<00:01:14.189> caught<00:01:14.400> from<00:01:14.549> around

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
was quite often got caught from around

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
was quite often got caught from around
the<00:01:14.820> back<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.689> was<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> bit<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> bit<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the back there was a bit of a bit of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.649 
the back there was a bit of a bit of
free<00:01:16.530> water<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.119> was<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> area<00:01:18.479> I'd

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
free water and it was the area I'd

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.780 
free water and it was the area I'd
caught<00:01:18.930> from<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.380> before<00:01:19.590> Christmas<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.729> I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
caught from just before Christmas so I

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.010 
caught from just before Christmas so I
put<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> bit<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.119> bait<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.780> much

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
put a bit of bait in not so much

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.800 
put a bit of bait in not so much
probably<00:01:22.320> 100<00:01:22.740> boilies<00:01:23.240> just<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
probably 100 boilies just on so that the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.179 
probably 100 boilies just on so that the
exactly<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> same<00:01:25.409> air<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.710> caught<00:01:25.890> from

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
exactly the same air that caught from

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.090 
exactly the same air that caught from
went<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.939> work<00:01:27.229> following<00:01:28.229> more<00:01:28.560> than<00:01:28.680> exactly

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
went to work following more than exactly

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.710 
went to work following more than exactly
the<00:01:29.189> same<00:01:29.430> went<00:01:29.970> back<00:01:30.119> down<00:01:30.270> again<00:01:30.570> about

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the same went back down again about

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
the same went back down again about
another<00:01:30.960> hundred<00:01:31.200> boards<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:31.799> planning<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
another hundred boards I was planning to

road same road again so I'm just so put
me<00:02:38.220> boats<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:38.790> ever<00:02:38.940> little<00:02:39.209> lurkin<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
me boats on so ever little lurkin of the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.900 
me boats on so ever little lurkin of the
bobbin<00:02:40.800> put<00:02:40.980> up<00:02:41.130> with<00:02:41.250> let<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.459> pull<00:02:41.640> out<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
clip and just slowly start to trundle

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.260 
clip and just slowly start to trundle
off<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.100> thought<00:02:44.280> if<00:02:44.490> he<00:02:44.520> dies<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.090> know<00:02:45.209> it

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
off so I thought if he dies you know it

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.580 
off so I thought if he dies you know it
looks<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.600> gonna<00:02:45.690> be<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.870> car<00:02:46.110> there<00:02:46.140> was

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
looks like it's gonna be a car there was

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.710
