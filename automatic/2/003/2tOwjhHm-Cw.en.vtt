00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
look at half a gun the simple goal this

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.799 
look at half a gun the simple goal this
game<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> build<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.640> path<00:00:38.879> from<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.420> side<00:00:39.780> to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
game is to build a path from one side to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.190 
game is to build a path from one side to
the<00:00:40.050> other<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> six<00:00:41.460> games<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.200> Miranda

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the other of the six games that Miranda

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.450 
the other of the six games that Miranda
has<00:00:43.320> done<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> think<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> most

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
has done I think this is the most

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.959 
has done I think this is the most
original<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.450> them<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.379> any<00:00:46.559> good<00:00:46.820> time<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
original of them is it any good time to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:01:04.880 
original of them is it any good time to
find<00:00:48.000> out

path from this side to this side it

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.830 
path from this side to this side it
doesn't<00:01:12.159> really<00:01:12.400> matter<00:01:12.700> how<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.540> path

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
doesn't really matter how the path

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.930 
doesn't really matter how the path
progresses<00:01:14.500> obviously<00:01:15.369> you<00:01:15.460> can<00:01:15.580> just<00:01:15.610> go<00:01:15.909> for

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
progresses obviously you can just go for

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.330 
progresses obviously you can just go for
a<00:01:16.180> straight<00:01:16.540> path<00:01:16.780> across<00:01:17.100> you'd<00:01:18.100> win<00:01:18.310> that

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
a straight path across you'd win that

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.790 
a straight path across you'd win that
way<00:01:18.700> but<00:01:18.940> you<00:01:19.060> can<00:01:19.180> also<00:01:19.350> curve<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.680> get

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
way but you can also curve and get

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.180 
way but you can also curve and get
across<00:01:21.009> too<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.869> doesn't<00:01:23.170> really<00:01:23.259> matter<00:01:23.560> as

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
across too it doesn't really matter as

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.460 
across too it doesn't really matter as
long<00:01:24.280> as<00:01:24.430> you<00:01:24.580> can<00:01:24.670> draw<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:24.880> path<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:26.110> dark

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
long as you can draw a path and the dark

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.080 
long as you can draw a path and the dark
color<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:27.130> trying<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.490> go<00:01:27.610> from<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.880> top<00:01:28.030> to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
color is trying to go from the top to

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.990 
color is trying to go from the top to
the<00:01:28.330> bottom<00:01:28.450> here<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.740> on<00:01:29.920> your<00:01:30.100> turn<00:01:30.430> you<00:01:30.700> can

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
the bottom here so on your turn you can

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.910 
the bottom here so on your turn you can
place<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.479> piece<00:01:31.840> anywhere<00:01:32.290> in<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.470> board<00:01:32.680> and

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
place a piece anywhere in the board and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.790 
place a piece anywhere in the board and
you<00:01:33.820> just<00:01:34.000> keep<00:01:34.179> placing<00:01:34.840> pieces<00:01:35.170> back<00:01:35.560> and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
you just keep placing pieces back and

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.520 
you just keep placing pieces back and
forth<00:01:36.149> but<00:01:37.149> one<00:01:37.720> of<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.899> things<00:01:38.110> that<00:01:38.259> you<00:01:38.350> can

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
forth but one of the things that you can

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.160 
forth but one of the things that you can
do<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:38.950> if<00:01:39.580> you<00:01:39.729> put<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.030> piece<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.570> your<00:01:40.990> two

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
do is if you put a piece and your two

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.320 
do is if you put a piece and your two
pieces<00:01:41.410> that<00:01:42.220> are<00:01:42.340> both<00:01:42.580> on<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.820> side<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.119> it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
pieces that are both on the side of it

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.200 
pieces that are both on the side of it
one<00:01:43.570> other<00:01:43.690> piece<00:01:44.020> then<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:45.220> can<00:01:45.910> capture

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
one other piece then you can capture

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.150 
one other piece then you can capture
that<00:01:46.420> piece<00:01:46.720> not<00:01:46.929> capture<00:01:47.380> but<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.679> remove<00:01:48.009> it

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
that piece not capture but you remove it

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.340 
that piece not capture but you remove it
from<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.490> board<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:48.970> on<00:01:49.660> their<00:01:49.869> next<00:01:50.200> turn

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
from the board and on their next turn

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.279 
from the board and on their next turn
they<00:01:50.530> can't<00:01:50.800> place<00:01:51.130> one<00:01:51.429> there<00:01:51.729> so<00:01:51.970> then<00:01:52.929> you

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
they can't place one there so then you

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.380 
they can't place one there so then you
basically<00:01:53.860> can<00:01:54.190> take<00:01:54.429> that<00:01:54.610> spot<00:01:54.970> from<00:01:55.030> them

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
basically can take that spot from them

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.930 
basically can take that spot from them
and<00:01:55.539> it's<00:01:55.810> only<00:01:55.990> one<00:01:56.350> you<00:01:57.159> can't<00:01:57.399> capture<00:01:57.610> more

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
and it's only one you can't capture more

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.279 
and it's only one you can't capture more
than<00:01:58.090> one<00:01:58.210> at<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.330> same<00:01:58.420> time<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:58.929> can't<00:01:59.140> get

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
than one at the same time you can't get

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.830 
than one at the same time you can't get
a<00:01:59.320> whole<00:01:59.530> row<00:01:59.770> but<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.640> can<00:02:00.909> see<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.330> what

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
a whole row but you can see that what

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.389 
a whole row but you can see that what
you'll<00:02:02.020> do<00:02:02.170> is<00:02:02.350> you'll<00:02:02.500> line<00:02:02.770> up<00:02:03.009> but<00:02:03.159> if<00:02:03.280> you

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
you'll do is you'll line up but if you

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.889 
you'll do is you'll line up but if you
deliberately<00:02:03.819> try<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.210> capture<00:02:04.479> someone

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
deliberately try to capture someone

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.810 
deliberately try to capture someone
else's<00:02:05.259> well<00:02:05.800> then<00:02:05.950> what<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.189> likely<00:02:06.670> going

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
else's well then what the likely going

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.180 
else's well then what the likely going
to<00:02:06.939> do<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.299> get<00:02:07.540> rid<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:07.810> one<00:02:07.930> of<00:02:08.019> yours<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.560> so

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
to do is get rid of one of yours and so

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.830 
to do is get rid of one of yours and so
there's<00:02:09.369> this<00:02:09.489> cat-and-mouse<00:02:09.850> plate<00:02:10.509> because

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
there's this cat-and-mouse plate because

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.140 
there's this cat-and-mouse plate because
you're<00:02:11.470> trying<00:02:11.799> to<00:02:11.980> form<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.370> row<00:02:12.549> across<00:02:12.880> the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
you're trying to form a row across the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.270 
you're trying to form a row across the
board<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:14.470> at<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.650> same<00:02:14.860> time<00:02:15.100> you're<00:02:15.250> trying

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
board but at the same time you're trying

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.190 
board but at the same time you're trying
to<00:02:15.519> maneuver<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.060> positions<00:02:16.600> where<00:02:17.170> you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
to maneuver it to positions where you

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.470 
to maneuver it to positions where you
can<00:02:17.440> capture<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:18.519> get<00:02:18.700> rid<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.090> enemies

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
can capture to get rid of the enemies

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.690 
can capture to get rid of the enemies
pieces<00:02:20.019> that<00:02:20.500> will<00:02:20.650> stop<00:02:20.980> him<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.519> he'll<00:02:21.640> have

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
pieces that will stop him and he'll have

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.580 
pieces that will stop him and he'll have
more<00:02:21.910> pieces<00:02:22.329> and<00:02:22.570> get<00:02:23.049> your<00:02:23.170> own<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.470> the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
more pieces and get your own on the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.620 
more pieces and get your own on the
board<00:02:23.799> once<00:02:24.519> all<00:02:24.640> your<00:02:24.790> pieces<00:02:25.000> are<00:02:25.299> on<00:02:25.329> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
board once all your pieces are on the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.650 
board once all your pieces are on the
board<00:02:25.870> then<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.530> take<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.519> piece<00:02:27.820> from<00:02:28.060> one

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
board then you can take a piece from one

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.690 
board then you can take a piece from one
spot<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.170> move<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.560> another<00:02:29.799> spot<00:02:30.160> but

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
spot and move it to another spot but

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.979 
spot and move it to another spot but
likely<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.120> won't<00:02:31.450> have<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.720> worry<00:02:31.900> about

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
likely you won't have to worry about

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.420 
likely you won't have to worry about
that<00:02:32.230> very<00:02:32.440> long<00:02:32.620> because<00:02:32.920> your<00:02:33.070> opponent

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
that very long because your opponent

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.190 
that very long because your opponent
will<00:02:33.549> likely<00:02:33.730> find<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.209> way<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.900> get<00:02:35.049> your

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
will likely find a way to get your

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.620 
will likely find a way to get your
pieces<00:02:35.680> off<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:35.860> board<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.430> once<00:02:37.269> again<00:02:37.510> the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
pieces off the board so once again the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.150 
pieces off the board so once again the
first<00:02:37.750> person<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.170> make<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.410> path<00:02:38.709> from<00:02:38.980> their

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
first person to make a path from their

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.310 
first person to make a path from their
side<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:39.700> other<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:40.060> either<00:02:40.570> direction<00:02:40.989> is

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
side to the other in either direction is

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.930 
side to the other in either direction is
the<00:02:41.769> winner<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.130> players<00:02:42.370> will<00:02:42.579> alternate

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the winner and players will alternate

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.090 
the winner and players will alternate
placing<00:02:43.390> pieces<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.930> removing<00:02:44.769> them<00:02:44.859> if<00:02:44.980> they

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
placing pieces and removing them if they

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.949 
placing pieces and removing them if they
capture<00:02:45.280> them<00:02:45.640> until<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:46.420> happens

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
capture them until that happens

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.870 
capture them until that happens

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
for a couple reasons one because it's

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.110 
for a couple reasons one because it's
original<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.829> other<00:03:08.980> five<00:03:09.310> are<00:03:09.340> interesting

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
original the other five are interesting

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.070 
original the other five are interesting
but<00:03:10.269> they're<00:03:10.419> derivatives<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.290> other<00:03:11.560> games

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
but they're derivatives of other games

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.170 
but they're derivatives of other games
this<00:03:12.530> one<00:03:12.710> probably<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.370> too<00:03:13.610> I've<00:03:13.820> played

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
this one probably is too I've played

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.970 
this one probably is too I've played
other<00:03:14.360> abstract<00:03:14.690> games<00:03:15.080> where<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:15.710> try<00:03:15.920> to

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
other abstract games where you try to

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.950 
other abstract games where you try to
connect<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.430> path<00:03:16.640> but<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.600> one<00:03:17.780> just

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
connect the path but I this one just

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.410 
connect the path but I this one just
seemed<00:03:18.290> very<00:03:18.350> enjoyable<00:03:18.830> has<00:03:19.610> super<00:03:20.270> high

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
seemed very enjoyable has super high

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.630 
seemed very enjoyable has super high
production<00:03:20.780> like<00:03:21.380> all<00:03:21.650> these<00:03:22.220> games<00:03:22.490> that

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
production like all these games that

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.330 
production like all these games that
haven't<00:03:23.060> been<00:03:23.150> having<00:03:23.440> it's<00:03:24.440> just

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
haven't been having it's just

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.400 
haven't been having it's just
interesting<00:03:25.730> that<00:03:26.180> concept<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:27.020> going<00:03:27.200> back

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
interesting that concept of going back

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.290 
interesting that concept of going back
and<00:03:27.440> forth<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.070> like<00:03:28.580> again<00:03:28.730> like<00:03:29.000> all<00:03:29.150> these

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
and forth and like again like all these

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.910 
and forth and like again like all these

you're gonna get just one of these games

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.770 
you're gonna get just one of these games
this<00:04:19.519> will<00:04:19.700> be<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.910> one<00:04:20.060> I'd<00:04:20.180> recommend<00:04:20.660> it

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
this will be the one I'd recommend it

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.720 
this will be the one I'd recommend it
probably<00:04:21.230> has<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.560> deepest<00:04:21.919> strategy<00:04:22.400> in<00:04:22.610> it

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
probably has the deepest strategy in it

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.909 
probably has the deepest strategy in it
also<00:04:22.940> it<00:04:23.360> says<00:04:23.570> it's<00:04:23.780> six<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.230> ninety<00:04:24.470> nine<00:04:24.620> but

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
also it says it's six to ninety nine but

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.820 
also it says it's six to ninety nine but
I<00:04:25.460> think<00:04:26.060> that<00:04:26.210> you'll<00:04:26.780> see<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.410> difference

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
I think that you'll see the difference

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.230 
I think that you'll see the difference
between<00:04:27.980> ages<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.700> this<00:04:28.820> one<00:04:29.000> more<00:04:29.210> than

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240
