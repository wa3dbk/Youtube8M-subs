00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
is the part we got to be really careful

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.889 
is the part we got to be really careful
you<00:01:29.679> have<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:30.039> be<00:01:30.160> patient<00:01:30.459> because<00:01:31.420> if<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.630> try

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
you have to be patient because if I try

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.510 
you have to be patient because if I try
and<00:01:31.959> flip<00:01:32.349> it<00:01:32.440> now<00:01:32.649> and<00:01:32.920> see<00:01:33.039> if<00:01:33.099> I<00:01:33.160> can<00:01:33.280> show

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
and flip it now and see if I can show

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.580 
and flip it now and see if I can show
you<00:01:33.580> it's<00:01:34.209> not<00:01:34.509> gonna<00:01:34.720> flip<00:01:35.050> very<00:01:35.229> well<00:01:35.349> it's

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
you it's not gonna flip very well it's

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.830 
you it's not gonna flip very well it's
gonna<00:01:35.679> really<00:01:36.009> fall<00:01:36.250> apart<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:36.849> you<00:01:37.360> really

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
gonna really fall apart so you really

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.100 
gonna really fall apart so you really
got<00:01:37.959> to<00:01:37.990> be<00:01:38.080> patient<00:01:38.740> until<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.099> bottom<00:01:39.849> is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
got to be patient until the bottom is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.779 
got to be patient until the bottom is
completely<00:01:41.110> cooked<00:01:41.429> before<00:01:42.429> you<00:01:42.550> start

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
completely cooked before you start

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.279 
completely cooked before you start
flipping<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.450> so<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:46.360> just<00:01:46.660> flipped<00:01:46.869> this<00:01:46.989> first

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
flipping it so I just flipped this first

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.600 
flipping it so I just flipped this first
one<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.560> I'm<00:01:47.619> sorry<00:01:47.860> it's<00:01:48.039> a<00:01:48.069> little<00:01:48.099> bit<00:01:48.399> loud

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
one and I'm sorry it's a little bit loud

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.600 
one and I'm sorry it's a little bit loud
but<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.539> can<00:01:49.660> see<00:01:49.899> what<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.349> looks<00:01:50.619> like<00:01:50.709> here

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
but you can see what it looks like here

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.669 
but you can see what it looks like here
and<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.660> other<00:01:52.780> sides<00:01:53.050> are<00:01:53.140> already<00:01:53.349> starting

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
and the other sides are already starting

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.370 
and the other sides are already starting
to<00:01:53.860> force<00:01:54.670> up<00:01:54.819> this<00:01:54.970> one<00:01:55.209> is<00:01:55.330> still<00:01:55.750> not<00:01:56.020> quite

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
to force up this one is still not quite

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.510 
to force up this one is still not quite
there<00:01:56.860> yet<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.509> that's<00:01:58.630> okay<00:01:59.280> takes<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.399> little

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
there yet so that's okay takes a little

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.660 
there yet so that's okay takes a little
while<00:02:00.700> that's<00:02:00.970> all<00:02:01.119> right

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.910 

so<00:02:04.670> I've<00:02:04.940> got<00:02:05.150> this<00:02:05.300> one<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.590> I've<00:02:06.680> got<00:02:06.830> this

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
so I've got this one so I've got this

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.340 
so I've got this one so I've got this
one<00:02:07.100> pretty<00:02:07.340> much<00:02:07.520> done<00:02:07.880> on<00:02:08.149> both<00:02:08.360> sides<00:02:08.660> so

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
one pretty much done on both sides so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.749 
one pretty much done on both sides so
I'm<00:02:09.410> gonna<00:02:09.500> go<00:02:09.649> ahead<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.039> put<00:02:10.220> some<00:02:10.250> meat

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759

I'm gonna go ahead and put some meat
into<00:02:11.240> it<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:14.650> then<00:02:15.650> we're<00:02:15.740> gonna<00:02:15.830> flip<00:02:16.130> it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
into it and then we're gonna flip it

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.530 
into it and then we're gonna flip it
like<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> taco<00:02:16.910> shell<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.940> got<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.150> all<00:02:20.510> done
