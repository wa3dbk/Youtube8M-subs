00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
all day and that brings me to my second

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
all day and that brings me to my second
way<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.939> 1<00:01:12.270> rush<00:01:12.450> your<00:01:12.600> Town<00:01:12.780> Hall<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.650> use

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
way to 1 rush your Town Hall is to use

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
way to 1 rush your Town Hall is to use
one<00:01:14.369> singular<00:01:15.090> army<00:01:15.450> comp<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.960> would<00:01:16.049> be

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
one singular army comp and that would be

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.249 
one singular army comp and that would be
Barch<00:01:16.619> which<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.340> archers<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.030> barbarians

Barch which is archers and barbarians

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.960 
Barch which is archers and barbarians
now<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> cheapest<00:01:20.220> army<00:01:20.549> comp<00:01:20.790> in

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
now this is the cheapest army comp in

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
collectors very easily with dead basis

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.490 
collectors very easily with dead basis
and<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.159> bases<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.939> basically<00:01:30.420> bases<00:01:31.380> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and that bases are basically bases that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.319 
and that bases are basically bases that

I'd probably recommend

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.900 
I'd probably recommend
silver<00:02:14.460> or<00:02:14.960> high<00:02:15.960> bronze<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:17.100> actually<00:02:17.550> farm

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
for loot and sometimes bronze is a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.670 
for loot and sometimes bronze is a
really<00:02:20.490> really<00:02:20.850> really<00:02:21.030> under<00:02:21.960> level<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.560> you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
really really really under level but you

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.920 
really really really under level but you
can<00:02:22.830> go<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.220> sub<00:02:23.490> 200<00:02:24.120> loot<00:02:24.360> which<00:02:24.780> is

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
can go for the sub 200 loot which is

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.200 
can go for the sub 200 loot which is
really<00:02:25.260> nice<00:02:25.410> as<00:02:25.620> well<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.340> fourth<00:02:26.610> tip<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
really nice as well the fourth tip is to

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.000 
really nice as well the fourth tip is to
max<00:02:27.570> out<00:02:27.720> your<00:02:27.780> defenses<00:02:28.350> before<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:28.800> go<00:02:28.950> to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
max out your defenses before you go to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.500

people who are townhall 8 or town home

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.860 
people who are townhall 8 or town home
line<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.640> they're<00:02:33.210> really<00:02:33.390> thinking<00:02:33.810> about

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
line and they're really thinking about

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.600 
line and they're really thinking about
going<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.410> townhall<00:02:34.800> 10<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.130> that's<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.340> very

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
going to townhall 10 and that's a very

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.910 
going to townhall 10 and that's a very
very<00:02:36.000> bad<00:02:36.180> idea<00:02:36.360> max<00:02:36.990> out<00:02:37.230> your<00:02:37.410> defenses

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
very bad idea max out your defenses

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.740 
very bad idea max out your defenses
before<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.790> Town<00:02:38.970> Hall<00:02:39.210> tap<00:02:39.480> and

before going to Town Hall tap and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.360 
before going to Town Hall tap and
obviously<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.650> do<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.040> need<00:02:41.160> really

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
obviously to do that you need really

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.430 
obviously to do that you need really
good<00:02:41.490> troops<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.420> rule<00:02:42.750> number<00:02:42.900> 4<00:02:43.200> goes

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
good troops so rule number 4 goes

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.560 
good troops so rule number 4 goes
subsequently<00:02:44.010> after<00:02:44.310> rule<00:02:44.790> number<00:02:45.000> 3<00:02:45.360> and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
subsequently after rule number 3 and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.120 
subsequently after rule number 3 and
