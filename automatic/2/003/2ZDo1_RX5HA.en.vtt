 you can get a team members now 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.039
 of course very difficult anyway 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.660
 a new cheeky name is all the way 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.279
 with tip glass that you leave behind 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.500
 because these bottles is in the bowl 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.029
 left behind by knowledge about mill or 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.220
 concealed 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.630
 folded dna he calls him the bios clash 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.520
 between mmc 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.590
 with the pesmes and only site hardline 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.410
 fans scavenger and textaid that is on it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.579
 with 2 times pi grenade so some wood in it 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.900
 the through the windows can be very fast 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.740
 weapon exchange sauce can see click click 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.030
 click a click 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.320
 and we can also team very quickly 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.670
 pin is just the course I saw 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.930
 make good use of it 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.060
 because those in phoenix can do it and 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.710
 He has been seen for almost nothing 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.750
 minimum minimap just completely gone 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.980
 and of course as a plus 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.960
 because they are no longer where I shot today 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.990
 and the second plus is of course and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.100
 that I can simply overwhelm them 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.950
 You must of course know 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.630

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.690
 two and that is the only one really inhibition 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.280
 tons and the plays as a someone as a 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.020
 Dutchman with the brakes join the and 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.020
 m is this is also the only 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.480
 oh oh plus go sniper that's also the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.770
 only person is what i flat that 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.120
 I have to watch where is with me 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.560
 also two must be sleiffer two with one 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.850
 tsr sniper rifle 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.909
 that he has, I also watched 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 one with the an-94 and you do n't have to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.050
 Keep an eye on them in the years w verdi 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.340
 Hi Ferdi see in the video and 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.920
 other two I don't know where that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.540
 play along but it is just a watch out 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.729
 porches minus 2 in pinus which of course 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.110
 I still have to use it but I really have to be smart 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.210
 of player these emily play too 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.380
 pretty reasonable good they aren't either 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.790
 worst 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.790
 it means that I have to go well 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.290
 pay attention 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.400
 this and him in an easy way 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.930
 way to be able to see what they are com 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.580
 and just go through the middle of it 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.750
 to run the skin but I was natural 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.590
 also tried in an easy way 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.130
 to kill 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.600
 that is just me that he is 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.060
 looks no more I don't care about you 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.650
 of course it is not a bottle of boys 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.730
 ip &amp; s to walk forward structurally as 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.770
 what i meant he put it on it already 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.390
 we have a hard side to that though 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.980
 so if we want to pick them up 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.140
 the 10 kills that are made there 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.070
 not too much not too little 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.360
 then of course I must succeed 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.410
 Peter got all this was being so 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.060
 not that i am a yolo 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.310
 this is so cow kony from that spawner and 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.930
 that because of those in figure sizes therefore 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.740
 the bios classroom works in this class 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.030
 that it really 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.290
 pretty pathetic on those things 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.850
 throw everywhere but it is 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.200
 a nice tactic that you can 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.250
 apply that work of course 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.930
 really very good 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.250
 that was to myself jan that is not true 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.930
 handy or its from another side 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.760
 couchsurfing him no minimal at all 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.290
 more those in phoenix and we don't have any 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.739
 need more oh oh uh oh oh oh my god oh 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.150
 my God 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.400
 one is coming and suddenly it is coming 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.410
 nothing is a bank 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.700

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.650

 hard to get 10 app is now clear 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.680
 why and very simple explanation 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.790
 you go with the 75 kilt and if you want 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.049
 they are also a good team 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.970
 making kills is no longer a nice man 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.080

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.130

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.340
 can be made 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.360

 also played something under douglas 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.350
 the team will look great at 16 kills 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.270
 16 to 712 to sturdy 727 also just kills 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.650
 made and that was a pity that one side 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.940

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.190
 difficulty with this series
