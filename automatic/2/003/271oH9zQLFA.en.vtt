00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
why can we make this camera faster and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.640 
why can we make this camera faster and
how<00:00:13.090> can<00:00:13.150> we<00:00:13.360> get<00:00:13.510> this<00:00:13.630> lens<00:00:13.870> smaller<00:00:14.230> and

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
how can we get this lens smaller and

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.519 
how can we get this lens smaller and
improve<00:00:15.370> image<00:00:15.640> quality<00:00:15.720> what<00:00:16.720> processes<00:00:17.230> can

why<00:00:20.380> shouldn't<00:00:20.890> this<00:00:20.949> technology<00:00:21.519> be<00:00:22.060> more

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:22.239 
why shouldn't this technology be more

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.659 
why shouldn't this technology be more
available<00:00:22.449> for<00:00:22.960> instance<00:00:23.289> this<00:00:24.009> questioning

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
available for instance this questioning

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.800 
available for instance this questioning
is<00:00:24.820> really<00:00:25.089> in<00:00:25.179> our<00:00:25.269> DNA<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.980> has<00:00:27.039> led<00:00:27.460> to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
is really in our DNA it has led to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.079 
is really in our DNA it has led to
cameras<00:00:28.810> like<00:00:29.079> the<00:00:29.259> eos<00:00:29.560> 300d<00:00:29.829> the<00:00:30.789> camera

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
cameras like the eos 300d the camera

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.690 
cameras like the eos 300d the camera
that<00:00:31.239> really<00:00:31.539> put<00:00:31.779> digital<00:00:32.290> SLR<00:00:32.710> within<00:00:33.579> the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
that really put digital SLR within the

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.180 
that really put digital SLR within the
reach<00:00:33.910> of<00:00:33.940> everyone<00:00:34.809> and<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:35.350> 1<00:00:35.500> vs<00:00:35.710> mark<00:00:35.920> 3

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
reach of everyone and the 1 vs mark 3

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.340 
reach of everyone and the 1 vs mark 3
which<00:00:36.399> gave<00:00:37.090> prophet<00:00:37.510> ographers<00:00:37.899> the<00:00:38.109> kind<00:00:38.289> of

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
which gave prophet ographers the kind of

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.860 
which gave prophet ographers the kind of
resolution<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.160> quality<00:00:39.370> that<00:00:39.870> previously

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
resolution and quality that previously

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.900 
resolution and quality that previously
you<00:00:41.109> only<00:00:41.320> found<00:00:41.679> in<00:00:41.890> medium<00:00:42.340> format<00:00:42.579> for

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
you only found in medium format for

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.900 
you only found in medium format for
instance<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.410> we<00:00:45.010> think<00:00:45.219> about<00:00:45.429> the<00:00:45.519> question

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
instance so we think about the question

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.209 
instance so we think about the question
what's<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.780> next<00:00:46.989> big<00:00:47.199> technology<00:00:47.769> what's

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
what's the next big technology what's

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.880 
what's the next big technology what's
really<00:00:48.519> the<00:00:48.670> next<00:00:49.449> game-changer<00:00:50.260> right<00:00:50.469> now

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
really the next game-changer right now

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.979 
really the next game-changer right now
actually<00:00:51.339> we<00:00:51.489> we<00:00:51.879> really<00:00:52.089> think<00:00:52.420> it's<00:00:52.629> the

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
actually we we really think it's the

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.060 
actually we we really think it's the
heart<00:00:53.379> of<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.980> camera<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.699> CMOS<00:00:55.149> sensor<00:00:56.070> it's

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
heart of the camera the CMOS sensor it's

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.520 
heart of the camera the CMOS sensor it's
CMOS<00:00:57.550> that's<00:00:57.850> given<00:00:58.239> us<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.870> quality<00:00:59.109> edge

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
CMOS that's given us the quality edge

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.160 
CMOS that's given us the quality edge
for<00:00:59.800> so<00:01:00.010> many<00:01:00.219> years<00:01:00.579> now<00:01:00.699> CMOS<00:01:01.629> clears<00:01:01.960> the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
for so many years now CMOS clears the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.049 
for so many years now CMOS clears the
data<00:01:02.379> more<00:01:02.679> quickly<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.670> makes<00:01:03.909> the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
data more quickly so it makes the

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.170 
data more quickly so it makes the
cameras<00:01:04.510> much<00:01:04.780> faster<00:01:05.379> adapting<00:01:06.220> CMOS<00:01:06.700> the

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
raking is gonna start being done because

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.740 
raking is gonna start being done because
the<00:05:44.570> technology<00:05:45.050> becomes<00:05:45.380> seamless<00:05:45.680> and<00:05:46.750> a

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
the technology becomes seamless and a

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.800 
the technology becomes seamless and a
product<00:05:48.349> like<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.860> 5d<00:05:49.340> takes<00:05:50.330> as<00:05:50.510> a<00:05:50.539> step

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
product like the 5d takes as a step

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.060 
product like the 5d takes as a step
closer<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.320> life

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
actually not just by these new cameras

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.110

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
but but what they might mean to

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.810 
but but what they might mean to
photographers<00:06:11.870> in<00:06:12.050> the<00:06:12.140> future<00:06:12.580> where<00:06:13.580> might

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
photographers in the future where might

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.780

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
they take photography how might they

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.060 
they take photography how might they
change<00:06:17.150> the<00:06:17.480> way<00:06:17.600> we<00:06:17.780> record<00:06:18.230> and<00:06:18.560> therefore

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
change the way we record and therefore

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.990 
change the way we record and therefore
remember<00:06:19.460> our<00:06:20.120> histories<00:06:20.660> and<00:06:21.910> if<00:06:22.910> we

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
remember our histories and if we

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.250 
remember our histories and if we
continue<00:06:23.180> really<00:06:23.660> to<00:06:23.780> challenge<00:06:24.140> ourselves

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
continue really to challenge ourselves

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.890 
continue really to challenge ourselves
with<00:06:24.740> these<00:06:24.860> questions<00:06:25.370> then<00:06:25.730> who<00:06:26.600> knows<00:06:26.840> what

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
with these questions then who knows what

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.650 
with these questions then who knows what
will<00:06:27.350> be<00:06:27.470> next
