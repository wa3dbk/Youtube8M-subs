00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.590
 Well today I will teach you to deign the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.050
 letter from the viewer 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.830
 I want to be honest and it was not explained 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.080
 for example that if one takes a letter 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.500
 this 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.330
 the cube of diamonds 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.190
 Once you see it you say that 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.000
 put up obviously that we the 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.630
 we saw 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.890
 and we show him that we cut if 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.300
 can you see there I'm cutting 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.640
 and it is already 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.700
 the letter was lost in the middle where 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:42.280
 but I show you that all 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:44.230
 letters are different and I tell you that this 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.620
 It is your letter 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.579
 But as we do good for 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.239
 make them we mix then 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.059
 Jewish entity because we do not stop now 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.570
 we have to register this letter 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.150
 and house our guide letter which is going 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.970
 to help you find your letter in this 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.650
 case mine is the 5 of hearts the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.850
 they have to memorize remember 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.760
 surreptitiously while nice clan and you 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.140
 we show 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.560
 we say that I have a letter 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.470
 any of the deck for example 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.450
 j of diamonds 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.770
 we tell him that the life of the place 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.740
 above the deck and we cut what 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.850
 What we do is put our lilac letter 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.740
 above your letter 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.240
 or jack of diamonds 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.790
 we do not have to do after 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.579
 show them that all the letters are 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.390
 different and once we 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:53.750
 We found our letter on the 5th of 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.259
 hearts the one that follows them or is our 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:02.360
 full letter which follows is your letter 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:06.170
 in this case the jota of diamonds and 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.869
 we show that this is your letter 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.429
 well that was the trick today almost 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.429
 banned chao
