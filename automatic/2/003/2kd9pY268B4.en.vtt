00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
obviously once i stand up this part with

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.470 
obviously once i stand up this part with
the<00:00:57.570> gray<00:00:57.780> remaining<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:59.300> obviously<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the gray remaining is a obviously a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.720 
the gray remaining is a obviously a
lower<00:01:00.780> area<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.219> sand<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
lower area so what you do is you sand it

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.840 
lower area so what you do is you sand it
until<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.559> depth<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
until it's at that at that depth and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.219 
until it's at that at that depth and

then you'll have this nice clean smooth

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.690 
then you'll have this nice clean smooth
area<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.439> when<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.710> spray<00:01:10.920> paint<00:01:11.159> it'll<00:01:11.340> all
