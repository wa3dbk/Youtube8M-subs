00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.760
 we see the hardest it's just a 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.050
 decree signed in two roles especially very 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.480
 strong for them to clean and well 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.510

 slightly weaker suddenly I train 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.080
 mountain and I give you a benchmark for 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:19.970
 a place is good is to have two 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:22.130
 cliffs and it's not just 108 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.840
 have sent his qualities 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:35.000

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:38.210
 happy it's a first session with 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.490

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.899
 runner the manager 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.640

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.170
 that charlie is passed too 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.070

 at 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.010

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.060

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.390
 but it's up to the rays uv wayne place 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.900
 he's been looking for two years now that the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.950

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.910
