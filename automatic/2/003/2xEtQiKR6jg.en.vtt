00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:18.500
 ad jan 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.500
 me 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.890
 I am Tsurumaki from Japan Film University . I want to start a recording course from now on. 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.480
 Char 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.440
 Let's use an external microphone 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.110
 Connect a microphone to the external microphone terminal of Fumimura 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.790
 Through 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.690
 Please tell us about the motive you took this time 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.400
 Why do n't you have to look in your eyes 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.420
 It and it does not say is you can say will Ugaï½° 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.360
 The microphone is often blown by the breath of the speaker 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:06.350
 This two-legged to avoid it 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.730
 Let's put on the windbreaker Let's ask again 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.730
 Please tell me about the tools 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.049
 Can you say that? 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.640
 If you can not say what you can say 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.640
 Will the so-called you doing hanging 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.220
 The microphone is made sensitive to vibration 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:45.880
 So you need to be especially careful when holding the microphone by hand 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:51.110
 It does not have the microphone with your hands directly we recommend that you use the folder for such anti-vibration 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.240
 But it is often troubled by blown a strong wind and bobo 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.640
 In that case, for example 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.290
 Like this 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.440
 By covered with a towel to the microphone 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.690
 You can weaken the noise of the wind 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.690
 It is also effective to use the jacket to cut the wind 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.630
 This is a special appearance called wind jammer 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:19.030
 I can see quite rock to cut the wind 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:25.320
 You can also use other familiar things like knit hats and gloves 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.320
 Although the sound may confuse a little, it can weaken the wind. 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.879
 Yes thank you
