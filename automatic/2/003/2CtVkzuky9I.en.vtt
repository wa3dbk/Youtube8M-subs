in<00:00:01.950> Chinese<00:00:02.490> cooking<00:00:02.760> we<00:00:03.030> highly<00:00:03.389> recommend<00:00:03.419> a

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
in Chinese cooking we highly recommend a

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.680 
in Chinese cooking we highly recommend a
set<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.650> wok<00:00:04.859> but<00:00:05.220> many<00:00:05.850> we<00:00:06.089> just<00:00:06.359> start

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
set of wok but many we just start

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.770 
set of wok but many we just start
cooking<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.610> therefore<00:00:08.610> any<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> skillet

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
cooking so therefore any of the skillet

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.780 
cooking so therefore any of the skillet
and<00:00:09.870> you've<00:00:10.080> got<00:00:10.290> at<00:00:10.440> home<00:00:10.650> which<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:10.950> like<00:00:11.219> 12

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
and you've got at home which is like 12

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.110 
and you've got at home which is like 12
to<00:00:11.969> 14<00:00:12.360> inches<00:00:12.630> diameter<00:00:12.960> would<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:14.009> fine<00:00:14.429> but

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
to 14 inches diameter would be fine but

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.180 
to 14 inches diameter would be fine but
more<00:00:15.540> importantly<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.560> find<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
more importantly you have to find a

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.910 
more importantly you have to find a
cover<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.450> able<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.020> encapsulate<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
cover that is able to encapsulate you to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.000 
cover that is able to encapsulate you to
Slean<00:00:20.250> from<00:00:21.030> your<00:00:21.270> cooking<00:00:21.780> and<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.620> do<00:00:22.800> that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
Slean from your cooking and we do that

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.190 
Slean from your cooking and we do that
quite<00:00:23.250> often<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.970> stir-fry<00:00:24.540> as<00:00:24.720> well<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
quite often in stir-fry as well and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.770 
quite often in stir-fry as well and
cover<00:00:25.440> something<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:25.950> this<00:00:26.510> remember<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
cover something like this remember that

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.490 
cover something like this remember that
the<00:00:27.990> cover<00:00:28.650> should<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.130> at<00:00:29.580> least<00:00:29.610> 1<00:00:30.270> 1/2<00:00:31.200> inch

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
the cover should be at least 1 1/2 inch

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.020 
the cover should be at least 1 1/2 inch
down<00:00:31.830> from<00:00:31.860> your<00:00:32.489> skillet<00:00:33.920> but<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
down from your skillet but if you

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.990

goes down and leads about half inch to
an<00:01:23.940> inch<00:01:24.210> down<00:01:24.690> so<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.190> capsulate<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.340> steam

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
an inch down so they capsulate the steam

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.170 
an inch down so they capsulate the steam
much<00:01:27.210> better<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:29.310> other<00:01:29.460> two<00:01:29.760> that<00:01:30.060> we

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
much better and the other two that we

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.109 
much better and the other two that we
have<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.690> is<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> spatula<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:32.220> spatula<00:01:32.850> is

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
have here is a spatula the spatula is

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.210 
have here is a spatula the spatula is
designed<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> helps<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.650> curvature

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
designed so that it helps the curvature

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.660 
designed so that it helps the curvature
of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.490> wok<00:01:35.760> and<00:01:36.090> able<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.960> pick<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:38.340> foo

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
of the wok and able to pick up the foo

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.630 
of the wok and able to pick up the foo
of<00:01:38.940> this<00:01:39.360> width<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.830> that<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.159> don't<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
of this width so that you don't have to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.219 
of this width so that you don't have to
wind<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.060> doing<00:01:42.210> too<00:01:42.540> many<00:01:42.720> times<00:01:43.130> like<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
wind up doing too many times like so and

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.870 
wind up doing too many times like so and
if<00:01:46.229> sometimes<00:01:46.680> no<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.010> is<00:01:47.130> turning<00:01:47.670> by<00:01:47.820> the

chopped carrots stir as we deep fry or
as<00:02:13.319> we<00:02:13.680> do<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.459> broth<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.030> then<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.810> more

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
as we do in the broth and then and more

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.039 
as we do in the broth and then and more
importantly<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.950> helps<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.700> push<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.659> product

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
importantly it helps to push the product

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.350 
importantly it helps to push the product
into<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.830> strainer<00:02:20.190> therefore<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.180> could

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
into the strainer therefore you could

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.000 
into the strainer therefore you could
grab<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.629> much<00:02:21.989> better<00:02:24.080> here's<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.200> 12<00:02:25.650> inch

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
grab it much better here's a 12 inch

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.710 
grab it much better here's a 12 inch

it's<00:02:27.840> already<00:02:28.290> treated<00:02:28.799> this<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.940> design

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
it's already treated this is to design

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.930 
it's already treated this is to design

so<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.420> don't<00:02:33.720> really<00:02:33.959> need<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.590> ring<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.040> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
so you don't really need the ring on the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.059 
so you don't really need the ring on the
