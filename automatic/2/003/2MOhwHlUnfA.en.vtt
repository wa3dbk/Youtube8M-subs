00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.869
 good morning to all and welcome back to mine 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.060
 channel today I want to talk to you about the new one 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.369
 pupa waterproof make-up line 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.740
 milano then a product line 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.740
 designed for long-lasting make-up 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.660
 that accompanies us and landed and during 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.720
 the arch of our day therefore 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.170
 ideal for summer days 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.150
 we hope this will arrive soon 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.120
 we regret the products and make up 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.850
 actually three types of product 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.879
 there is a new version so obviously 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.519
 empty the vamp mascara prof that the sphere 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:52.030
 best selling in perfumery at a price 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.580
 of 12 euros and fifty and that guarantees 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.890
 the same performances obviously in the 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.860
 mascara saying in traditional version 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.710
 and 15 elongated volumized and defined 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.340
 even on the beach comfortable smears 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.560
 the color is successful and black is actually 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.360
 still this I have not purchased not 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.790
 because they are not interesting mascara 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.410
 pupa that I used in the past and it is me 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.480
 still remained a good port but 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.080
 because I still don't call it no 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.660
 decided which beach mascara will be 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.990
 then came out this year 4 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.409
 definition liner and waterproof at the price 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.150
 recommended of 14 euros and 50 and it comes 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.050
 instead of eye liner 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.670
 here it is brought in felt with 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.820
 characterized by a rapid rapidity is 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.250
 a gross and ultra-bright stroke e 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.530
 four choirs have surely come out 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.350
 We have already said, however, look for that 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.990
 I 'm practically a black river 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.650
 reddish in a joke 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:58.120
 the team and I instead bought the 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.430
 tier ii ma brown and the blue pear li that in 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.010
 reality is what you see me this morning 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.080
 worn in genoa meters make-up sto 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.780
 shut up and stop so I hope you can 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.680
 applying logic can be assessed 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.740
 the intensity of the color of the high 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.600
 line that as I show you now because of it 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.760
 I have it here and therefore no slow china 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.490
 because in reality I was not looking for 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.690
 a highlight of mars really are 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.380
 was struck by the trait of this 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.570
 plus the applicator is absolutely 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.810
 very common therefore also the application 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.959
 do you believe 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.530
 writing is child's play 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:46.930
 favors and today but it is the color and this 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:50.470
 fantastic blue really really beautiful 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.080
 in fact I believe I will also take the version 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.550
 of the deal because it's really beautiful 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.040
 the bill amuses the other with the charges 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.340
 certainly said a more traditional one 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.550
 the most classic but also very beautiful 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.980
 is valid and is to pull them brown 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.840
 also this rich reflections that 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.650
 it affects just how much 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:20.700
 these are brilliant I would say you can 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:32.620
 suffice as it is ok and we have 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:36.790
 here you should brown the product that makes up 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.900
 part of this new line is the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:44.400
 matitone a sharon world of make to last 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.319
 at the recommended price of 12 euros and 90 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.840
 this is the park of the tory ne hands 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.440
 they are very simple sad salesmen 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.769
 so with the tip turning and yes 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.049
 raises the lower part is a 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.879
 penknife discovered by chance when 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.750
 obviously I adjusted on the floor 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:07.060
 just come into the house and you can 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.400
 use the eye in a double 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.829
 dual use practically was era 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.349
 used over the entire eyelid from the mo 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:17.769
 of traditional eyeshadow which has like 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.780
 eyeliner the created is also of this e 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.960
 absolutely full- bodied to the 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.030
 first passed the very light texture 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.860
 so they are also comfortable on a 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.110
 eye 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.150
 as for the colors they came out 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.900
 so 12 colors I don't remember what 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:39.460
 what I do not say like us and you do it 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.729
 from white and a hundred pink certainly given the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.970
 emerald green, of course, the inevitable 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.260
 dark blue turquoise and deep purple 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.120
 the black 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.870
 I took these two colors and yes 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.930
 it's color 0 0 4 golden brown 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:01.599
 let's look at c 0 0 4 against 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:04.270
 came in here is beautiful color that 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:07.300
 I work for the summer with 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.760
 the tan on the eyelids 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.670
 actually more than a brown folder 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:19.080
 let 's say a warm gilded bronze yes 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.700
 however, I sing because it is very beautiful 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.600
 the beach gives a touch of color 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.920
 then in the end nothing invasive 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.230
 however , beach make-up at least 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.580
 I definitely prefer delicate like 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:36.390
 hue and then I took metallic gray 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.350
 number 10 11 0 11 because he took 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.420
 gray metallic 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.810
 I don't know but I took such a say 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.860
 belong jokes because he has a fucking 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.960
 but this dullness and I was a little blue 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.030
 so I did n't think of this guy 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.050
 in short, to order it with 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:58.080
 a beautiful blue liner anyway 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.960
 Accountants like it so much is that 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.980
 that you always see in combination in the 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.210
 cards of today with the rain pirli tires 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.190
 blue 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.290
 that was all it was about 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.460
 puppets like me to mind 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.069
 just yesterday wed 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.720
 I bought it in black iii came in 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.960
 mind these two already used instead 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.169
 the state elected by Scott is fine but 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.509
 last summer are instead of time are 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:29.169
 two goals and obviously empty that 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:31.630
 guarantee a duration of 16 hours and mi 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.389
 I loved them a lot 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.550
 really tragicomic side of the beauty 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.470
 the appearance that practically the two colors 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.930
 they are identical to the ones I purchased 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.360
 this is called soft brown e 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.830
 holy gray with a large part of this 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.880
 obviously means that these gorrieri 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.949
 I particularly appreciate I found them 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.960
 spectacular last year because the 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:56.320
 drafting is very simple of ecology 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.840
 very bright and they sent her on 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.970
 incredible game I July and August 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.340
 I live practically on a beach myself 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.229
 he applies them the morning before 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.570
 go down to the beach and they didn't have 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:10.330
 need therefore no retouching 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.840
 indeed these have already been tested 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.199
 and absolutely for the beach 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:19.470
 but line and eye shadows that work 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:22.260
 great before closing i wanted 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:24.840
 tell you that on the lips or the last dyed 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.139
 that remained for me to find of the r 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.270
 splash cosmetics the color secret garden 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.639
 that this beautiful rose a lot 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.710
 portable that I tend to see in 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:39.419
 by now you know that I see everything 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:41.250
 but certainly more beautiful color 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:43.229
 easy to use compared to 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.780
 others, however, I understood something about 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.860
 these colors and less product applies 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.100
 the better 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.690
 being there is in fact I had tried to 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.880
 reach one layer for another 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.889
 product layer a disaster due 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.080
 remove it and then apply it because 

00:07:55.889 --> 00:08:00.000
 went away to appreciate us 

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.210
 practically this however is only one 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.560
 passed it seems to me not to have a la 

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:08.010
 sum lips 

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.110
 ok for the moment everything i hope to 

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.550
 have been useful I invite you to
