00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.680
 hello to all the thoughts of youtube 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.880
 how are you today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.130
 where are we going to be learning to 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.779
 duplicate blocks so let's double 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.160
 blocks of any type less 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.349
 obsidian because now we can from the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.920
 pistons let's put multiply 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.830
 stone rock scenarios like this 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.699
 diamond blocks wood oak ground 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.440
 any that any blogging 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.480
 then we go to once done the 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.340
 mechanism we will provide the lever and 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.260
 at the same time lower the sight to the block 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.850
 we want to duplicate something like that sometimes 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.680
 it comes to us the first time but as you can see 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.260
 now we quickly break the one above 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.790
 and then the one below we grabbed the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.860
 down and how they see the one above does not 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.809
 opened we wait for it to reappear as 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.870
 come here is again and we will return 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.820
 to break it as you see already gives it to us 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.820
 Sometimes it will not be the first one sometimes and only 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 it's a matter of going practicing and that and 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.199
 well then we repeat again 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.630
 here we go to lever and we look at the block 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.090
 There are times I do not know I told them and so 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.310
 we break the one on top quickly then 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.659
 the one below and it will reappear on 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.240
 above 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.969
 we quickly break the one on top and 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.590
 then the one below to be sure one 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.420
 time I come back to do this we go 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.479
 like to touch the walls to say so 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.159
 I do not know why I find that lucky and 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.530
 let's break the top one again and 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.969
 As you see, it gives us the block because it can be 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.090
 with any of these either from 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.880
 golden diamond any block and good 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.039
 they are explaining how to do the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.329
 mechanism and everything and so good today I'm going to 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.270
 cut the video to be done by day 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.490
 and explain that to them 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.590
 and then good with the tutorial 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.810
 the next thing we're going to have to do 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.110
 is we are going to have to have any 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.789
 block type one adhesive piston one 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.259
 lever and a good as a rest is not 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.719
 Now what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.509
 open a hole of two deep 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.890
 let's put a sticky piston and then 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.560
 we are going to open another two envelopes of 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.170
 deep I say another hole deep and 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.120
 let's put rest not there then like 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.980
 come this will have something like that and 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.470
 now let's put block on top of 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.900
 rest and let's do this let's do 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.760
 like a piston base and then here 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.450
 let's put the block we want 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.520
 apply for example if I want 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.040
 explain this 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.100
 the diamond block so you have more 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.920
 and more and more diamonds simply because 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.200
 I put it here I put the lever and as you can see 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.120
 as I had told you before we are going to have 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.820
 to press the lever and at the same time 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.710
 how to see the block as well as putting the 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.480
 look there and then move away to give 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.060
 to the block then you have to do this 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.200
 is we remove the top one then the one from 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.780
 down 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.849
 and then the one below to see if you see this 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.069
 and we waited a while for this to be 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.860
 as it goes well and what 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.739
 we take off sometimes he does not give it to us but this 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.239
 it usually happens so it would be expected that 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.860
 reappear we can jump 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.260
 above what we will do whatever 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.940
 thing as for as if to be 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.890
 there so that it is already there and we are going to 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.290
 break it as you see there already gave it to me 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.500
 so good that's all the truth 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.720
 we put the block we put the lever and 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.160
 is we have this 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.920
 then we break this 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.540
 I think that it disappeared first well no 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.570
 we can the one below gives us the one below 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.370
 we wait for the one above to appear and 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.360
 I already chopped it but not now 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.610
 bored 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.790
 yes often played so if they 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.130
 I'll try to exit without saving and 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.040
 like they take off the book and then 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.320
 this good that's been all this we're going to 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.030
 try one more time as in I put the 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.780
 block the lever we do 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.610
 this as I tell you there are times that it does not come out 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.400
 but since trying to try 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.160
 try and well, it 's simple 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.750
 the truth of doing but the point is 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.180
 already have a little practice as in 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.920
 ms Lyon off the top and then the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.840
 down remember to quickly remove the 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.360
 up so that it turns to do and 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.280
 because he does not possess anything as they see it removed and 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.020
 he gives it to me and well, that's all 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.570
 can duplicate any block either 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.900
 This adhered stone blocks 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.910
 diamond can not be karting tables 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.419
 not with and chests but you can say the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.580
 clay this all all all 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.919
 blocks that you can imagine and well 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.980
 I hope you liked this video 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.419
 tutorial like if it served them 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.120
 comment if you have any questions or 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.510
 something like that and good greetings to all and 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.510
 see you later
