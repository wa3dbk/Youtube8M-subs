00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
face you have to do criss cross motions

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.970 
face you have to do criss cross motions
and<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:18.090> leaves<00:03:18.600> lots<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.230> streaks<00:03:19.620> on<00:03:19.829> your

face<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.459> doesn't<00:03:20.700> really<00:03:20.760> apply<00:03:21.060> it

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
face and it doesn't really apply it

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.699 
face and it doesn't really apply it
evenly<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.780> have<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:21.989> let<00:03:22.079> go<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.410> dab<00:03:22.680> it

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
evenly so I have to let go and dab it

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.350 
evenly so I have to let go and dab it
and<00:03:23.010> stuff<00:03:23.190> like<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.700> it's<00:03:24.150> horrible

and<00:03:24.450> then<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.959> pump<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.470> just<00:03:25.650> gets<00:03:25.829> all<00:03:25.980> over

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
and then the pump it just gets all over

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.289 
and then the pump it just gets all over
and<00:03:26.310> it's<00:03:26.400> getting<00:03:26.610> all<00:03:26.700> over<00:03:26.730> my<00:03:26.910> hands<00:03:27.120> right

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
now which I hate that and it feels like

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.430
