00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello and welcome the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.820
 confectioner show today talk shows 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.920
 another fudge and indeed one 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.380
 bananas wrong i experiment yes 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.049
 always with almost what I am 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.010
 best of all I present you then 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.920
 so we need to at times even 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.140
 then you need dried banana chips 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.140
 we serve lighter and sweetened 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.710
 Vanilla and condensed milk must be sugared 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.000
 you are the first step in the process 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.410
 looks like this you guys do 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.550
 decorative normal liquid now 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.329
 of course that is swinging that was now 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.770
 not planned yet 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.750
 the second step looks like this 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:50.070
 simply the condensed milk innovative 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:53.210
 and then commission is one 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.210
 uniform water results 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.330
 then like banana chips if they are too big 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.100
 then you make yourselves one 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.140
 bit of a small bag of ryan dunn good with 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.610
 Rolling pin so things from the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.320
 leave out the bus 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.170
 then you give yourself the defenses 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.880
 at once 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:19.660
 Just give it here very loose flaky 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.220
 under so if you then stop under 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.680
 then that's what you get 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.520
 put baking mold on the cars 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.700
 paper 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.229
 the wind of utterly not at all 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.460
 world 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.750
 hey i have i have the nicest ones 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.360
 colleagues yes we want to do here 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:49.000
 essential work live in the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:51.580
 Konditorei then not by a 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.380
 palette and quickly cutting him 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.190
 of course, quite simple floor space 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.940
 then we put the whole story 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.010
 cool until it solidifies and then 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.250
 Let's cut it all the other way 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:13.420
 I would have it on when we got the house 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:16.090
 good on and the beautiful stuck and cut 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.040
 the concert succeeds everything or else 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.780
 not if not in its table 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.580
 want to make dirty then then 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.400

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:30.310

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:33.490
 Of course, this size has been 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.590
 To say exactly , this is the one 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.810
 some other computer show where her things 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.760

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.350
 because we also very much enjoy it 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.880
