shutter speed and aperture for a well
exposed<00:00:41.200> picture<00:00:41.680> I'm<00:00:42.129> assuming<00:00:42.579> there<00:00:42.700> isn't

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
exposed picture I'm assuming there isn't

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.510 
exposed picture I'm assuming there isn't
a<00:00:43.030> whole<00:00:43.239> lot<00:00:43.270> of<00:00:43.570> light<00:00:43.809> so<00:00:44.170> you<00:00:44.770> may<00:00:45.160> want<00:00:45.399> to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
a whole lot of light so you may want to

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.840 
a whole lot of light so you may want to
increase<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.480> ISO<00:00:47.219> remember<00:00:48.219> that<00:00:48.520> even<00:00:48.789> if

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
increase the ISO remember that even if

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.270 
increase the ISO remember that even if
you<00:00:49.000> are<00:00:49.149> using<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.600> flash<00:00:49.930> it's<00:00:50.680> really<00:00:51.039> only

no<00:01:37.000> flash<00:01:37.330> looking<00:01:37.720> image<00:01:37.990> very<00:01:38.650> simple<00:01:39.100> just

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
no flash looking image very simple just

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.520 
no flash looking image very simple just
close<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.210> flash<00:01:40.480> and<00:01:40.750> you're<00:01:41.170> basically

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
close the flash and you're basically

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.970 
close the flash and you're basically
dependent<00:01:42.280> on<00:01:42.460> ISO<00:01:43.270> now<00:01:44.140> remember<00:01:44.530> people<00:01:44.890> are

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
dependent on ISO now remember people are

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.100 
dependent on ISO now remember people are
moving<00:01:45.220> you<00:01:45.880> may<00:01:46.090> not<00:01:46.270> have<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.450> tripod<00:01:46.750> with

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
moving you may not have a tripod with

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.500 
moving you may not have a tripod with
you<00:01:47.290> so<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:47.860> want<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.160> maintain<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.790> shutter

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
you so you want to maintain a shutter

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.900 
you so you want to maintain a shutter
speed<00:01:49.750> faster<00:01:50.170> than<00:01:50.710> one<00:01:51.100> sixtieth<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.790> a

halfway<00:01:54.400> just<00:01:54.930> go<00:01:55.930> ahead<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.200> point<00:01:56.470> the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
halfway just go ahead and point the

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.090 
picture if your shutter speed is faster
than<00:02:03.250> one<00:02:03.580> sixtieth<00:02:04.090> of<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.450> second<00:02:04.900> as<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.710> mine

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
than one sixtieth of a second as is mine

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.460 
than one sixtieth of a second as is mine
then<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.790> should<00:02:07.120> be<00:02:07.270> fine<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.870> can<00:02:08.020> handhold

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
then you should be fine you can handhold

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.580 
then you should be fine you can handhold
that<00:02:08.619> without<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.950> problem<00:02:09.280> if<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.239> not<00:02:10.590> then

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
that without a problem if it's not then

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.800 
that without a problem if it's not then
you're<00:02:11.770> going<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:11.950> want<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.280> increase<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.060> ISO

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
you're going to want to increase the ISO

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.259 
you're going to want to increase the ISO
again<00:02:15.810> if<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.560> are<00:02:16.830> taking<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.519> picture<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.879> a

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
again if you are taking a picture of a

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.390 
again if you are taking a picture of a
long<00:02:18.480> table<00:02:18.900> with<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.079> lot<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.319> people<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:20.220> want

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
long table with a lot of people you want

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.490 
long table with a lot of people you want
everybody<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.299> focus<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.230> also

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
everybody to be in focus so you also

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.559 
everybody to be in focus so you also
have<00:02:22.829> to<00:02:22.950> take<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.459> aperture<00:02:24.239> into

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
have to take the aperture into

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.929 
have to take the aperture into
consideration<00:02:25.379> right<00:02:26.069> now<00:02:26.250> mine<00:02:26.519> is<00:02:26.549> set<00:02:26.819> to

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
consideration right now mine is set to

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.300 
consideration right now mine is set to
f/8<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.659> that<00:02:28.140> should<00:02:28.349> be<00:02:28.470> really<00:02:28.500> fine

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
f/8 and that should be really fine

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.880 
f/8 and that should be really fine
if<00:02:29.610> yours<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.060> set<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.480> something<00:02:30.959> much<00:02:31.349> larger

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
if yours is set to something much larger

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.119 
if yours is set to something much larger
than<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.220> like<00:02:32.549> F<00:02:33.079> 5.6<00:02:34.079> you<00:02:34.769> don't<00:02:34.980> really

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
than that like F 5.6 you don't really

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.069 
than that like F 5.6 you don't really
have<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.549> much<00:02:35.790> all<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.450> need<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.720> do<00:02:36.870> is

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
have to do much all you need to do is

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.830 
have to do much all you need to do is
release<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.250> shutter<00:02:38.640> button<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.090> move<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.569 
figures are still on the screen I can
change<00:02:47.040> those<00:02:47.549> values<00:02:48.030> both<00:02:48.750> will<00:02:49.109> change

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
change those values both will change

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.640 
change those values both will change
