00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.730
 for a new video then when you 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.650
 know very precisely I have you 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.540

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.369
 little wholesale mix that I have here 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.810
 so you have been a lot to me 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.919
 ask for a tutorial you 've already talked about 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.360
 in the video you said yeah 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.890
 it was a bit difficult to reconnect so 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.279
 I had a tutorial I hope that soon 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.189

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.170

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.650
 I'll save you even spent 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.480
 tutorial it's just after his voice animates them 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.730
 so you need all this for 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.770
 plug your mix in between so we go 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.170
 start with the basics of the bases 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.280
 casing mixing then so there I 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.280
 you were showing for sure to plug it in 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.030
 on a pc and at the same time on your box 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.710
 or your pc 4 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.210
 but I'm going to mount on xbox so 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.370
 of course your helmet so me it's a 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.239
 siberia v2 is the best with two 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.520
 as you can know 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.119
 it's like the 40 there are two little ones in 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.930
 end like that so for the microphone and for 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.369
 for the helmet 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.869
 so you need this little 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.369
 adapter that fornicate unique seems 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.570
 so you put your thing here and that 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.670
 you plug it back on mx1 show you 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.250
 its right after you also need to 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.860
 this junction nique the mic seems so 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.610
 usb i will try to make you a 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.610
 mayor pocus 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.079
 that's it then you have usb on one side and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.299
 mini usb from the other here such a case 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.380
 so provide that I do not know at all 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.399
 it's but it's a cape like that 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.530
 you need I showed you

 finally for consoles in general and that 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.899
 it is for the pc so a hyper club 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.130
 easy I do not know the name anymore but 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.929
 it's the stuff you plug in as 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.250
 your headphones here are hyper simple 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.349
 it's not really what his name is 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.670
 but it is equally provided with the 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.849
 clan you need all of this I 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.869
 will now show the hookup 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.459
 so you take to start your 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.560
 simple and your cable mix when we 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.149
 mud mountains that's weird so 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.459
 you put the biggest end of 2 so 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.920
 the one you put in the port 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:07.420
 how is it called opt which optim 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.950
 optical of your mix up here wait i 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.349
 see not move your hand here so you 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.299
 put in there and the other side I 'm going 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.989
 show you put on your xbox 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.239
 world 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:21.459
 so how well do you show it's going 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:27.280
 to be a little tense wait i'll you 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:30.910
 show it's the cable here so between 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.190
 the hdmi out and the hdmi ynwa that's the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.079
 case it's between the two hdmi so you 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.489
 plug on this side there I do not arrive 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.739
 slow sequence that you 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.780
 plug here here and that's it for the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.310
 first step then second 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.019
 mans sleeve with two small cable 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.310
 headphones from which you will branch 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.169
 ad enough for the pc have it 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.519
 connect the xbox now will connect the 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:52.540
 pc which you will put a 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.160
 in stream or mp3 it's like you 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.690
 prefer it's pretty much the same thing 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.370
 I put in stream we do a little 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.049
 do like me and the second you 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.889
 so plugged into your computer 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.239
 so on your pregnant port I'm going 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.450
 show you if ever but I think that 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.859
 all see where mine is for example 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.840
 he is on my facade 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.489
 here is where there is the little headphones 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.750
 for the sake of simplicity so here 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.669
 now we will put the sick 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.109
 but our rock punk mix for that nothing of 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.919
 simpler is with the usb cable and 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.590
 mini usb 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.169
 so you're going to put the usb or you 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.239
 so want to be on your xbox one we 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.940
 do it here for example here is a port 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.120
 usb you go master for example there 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.030
 but and you can m you too 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.709
 master for example 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.810
 shown there are also ports on the back 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.150
 so I pass we can see but here it 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.480
 there are also doors and sb so here it is 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:46.340
 is plugged into usb and the other side here 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.560
 you connect it to your usb of 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.900
 others not mixing the aura while there 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.700
 to reach a hand are a little tense 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.090
 gv native of mans cable thriller 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.360
 which you plug here here is so it's 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.739
 my body on the front surface so the 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.000
 three caps years of mandate and we put them 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.760
 on the top as you can the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.100
 find out and sailly let's finally salute you 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.709
 see that the buttons without turning on so 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.390
 So here we go before last step 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.400
 one of the simplest you will take 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.709
 so your video ride your helmet that 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.269
 in two outings if you have problems 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.709
 you castan a single exit you do not have 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.540
 no need to do this state you go 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.100
 take this case what has bola that provides 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.200
 still in half of the mix between you 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.919
 go hook it up so violated on purple 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.270
 and green on glass on glass and then 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.990
 that you will plugged into the example I 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.970
 show you that right now 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.229
 and here is the last rambo you 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.150
 put now in the front you have 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.800
 we put our club here and there 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.030
 you will put forward so that where 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.380
 there is the little cable so I do it 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.570
 see offer there we see well here is the 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.540
 little headphones you'll put up and 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.640
 here you have now your mix 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.370
 branch men and so this cable there he 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.720
 is connected to lightbox this cable yours 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.039
 white and this for feeding you 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.419
 connect it to the pc also it would change 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.530
 we can put it in usb on the xbox and 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.780
 on pc we do not care a bit 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.190
 and this one is for the pc think we 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.770
 do not see you skype for example 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.419
 and that one goes to the mixing 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.820
 until autumn until siberia v2 which 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.440
 is your headphones out 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.419
 then if you want to add a 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.270
 last computer for example by 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.770
 example you with me I have a macbook 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.860
 so when I also want to plug my 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.300
 macbook i use a little devil so 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.080
 it's the same as black that's 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.450
 plugged into your pc 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.000
 this is the one me for example going there 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.130
 him not provided with his six china 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.870
 but a symptom x so what am I doing 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.860
 to connect my mac is the so 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.110
 it's the same course as seeing it as I 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.340
 told you you come here and there you 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.900
 have twice the same nantes together 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.610
 here and one here so for example you 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.500
 take a load of one of the doubs you 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.970
 plug it in is the same 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.930
 go out on your macbook here is a 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.090
 example I can show you 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.700
 and there you will also have the sound of your 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.950
 macbook 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.410
 here I think I did pretty much 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.030
 the turn of those in this tutorial ap strauss he 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.820
 still asked questions asked them 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.830
 month in the comments at the level of 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.450
 live xbox chat you can not you 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.400
 have to buy an adapter the link will be 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.560
 in the description you can not 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.940
 just like that there you have nothing you do not 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.530
 can not talk on the xbox live for 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.110
 what to use skype or a 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.130
 bullshit in the genre on a pc and but 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.760
 otherwise I think I made a comeback 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.200
 if you have other questions 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.150
 do not forget to put them in 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.070
 comments I will try to answer them and 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.170
 very soon contest to win 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.180
 this mx 1 in any case just a small 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.030
 presentation therapy the button for 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.120
 turn it on to adjust your 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.160
 the minimum audio maximum the power of 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.910
 the audio that however have a dolby sound 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.950
 7.1 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.660
 so when you did not have it it's a 5.1 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.790
 if you activate it 107 points so as much 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.340
 activate it and that I have not too much 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.750
 understood that that and it is to change 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.310
 when I sent that change the letter 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.200
 has different sides 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.160
 although cinemas in cost gaming 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.880
 others like that I know that coaching 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.620
 it's this one 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.660
 so if you make the lion try to 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.210
 put on this side and saas to adjust to 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.490
 level of the game so the voices of 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.740
 game and dpc voices so you can 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.210
 set as you wish voila 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.080
 Thank you all for having this video 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.080

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.550
 all that
