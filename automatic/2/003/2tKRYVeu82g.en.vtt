someone<00:01:57.439> alright<00:01:58.439> another<00:01:59.250> connector<00:01:59.820> was<00:01:59.969> on

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
someone alright another connector was on

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
those are for air so there's really no

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.490 
those are for air so there's really no
no<00:02:07.469> tighten<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.459> anything

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.630 
has six bolts on it so make sure you put
those<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.489> tighten<00:02:23.730> them<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:24.060> pretty<00:02:24.330> good

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
don't drop anything inside that's my

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.940 
don't drop anything inside that's my
first<00:02:30.660> time<00:02:30.930> actually<00:02:31.170> taking<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.770> bike

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
first time actually taking the bike

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.420 
first time actually taking the bike
apart

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
apart

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.130 
apart
I<00:02:32.489> mean<00:02:32.640> replacing<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> starter<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.900> bike

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
I mean replacing the starter on the bike

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.979 
I mean replacing the starter on the bike
but<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.860> came<00:02:34.980> out<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.340> mean<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.819> did<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> good<00:02:36.540> job<00:02:36.600> I

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
but I came out I mean I did a good job I

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.199 
but I came out I mean I did a good job I
think<00:02:38.989> guys<00:02:39.989> so<00:02:40.200> six<00:02:40.560> bolts<00:02:41.090> could<00:02:42.090> have

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
think guys so six bolts could have

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.300 
think guys so six bolts could have
skipped<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.630> step<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.140> hey<00:02:43.380> I'm<00:02:43.739> recording

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
skipped a step but hey I'm recording

00:02:44.310 --> 00:03:14.520 
skipped a step but hey I'm recording
already<00:02:46.250> II<00:02:49.250> four<00:02:50.250> five<00:02:50.760> six

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:24.870 

you<00:03:15.130> could<00:03:15.370> skip<00:03:15.670> that<00:03:15.910> part<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.330> guess

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.040 

after<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:26.030> we're<00:03:26.180> going<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.330> put<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.570> filter

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
after that we're going to put the filter

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.950 
after that we're going to put the filter
in<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.470> believe<00:03:31.210> all<00:03:32.210> right<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:32.540> those<00:03:32.690> two

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
in I believe all right so those two

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.290 
in I believe all right so those two
screws<00:03:33.200> on<00:03:33.440> top<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:33.860> think<00:03:34.130> yeah<00:03:34.280> those<00:03:34.910> two

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
screws on top I think yeah those two

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.810 
screws on top I think yeah those two
screws<00:03:35.660> on<00:03:35.690> top<00:03:36.370> tighten<00:03:37.370> them<00:03:37.460> up<00:03:37.610> with<00:03:37.790> a

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
screws on top tighten them up with a

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:51.460 
screws on top tighten them up with a
Phillips<00:03:38.240> head

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.880 

I<00:03:51.500> get<00:03:52.460> to<00:03:52.550> go<00:03:52.700> on<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:52.910> one<00:03:53.590> tire<00:03:54.590> shop<00:03:54.860> I

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
I get to go on that one tire shop I

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.890 
I get to go on that one tire shop I
forget<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.310> put<00:03:55.490> it<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:55.760> record<00:03:56.270> how<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.510> put<00:03:56.750> the

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
forget to put it to record how I put the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.390 
forget to put it to record how I put the
filtering<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.590> can<00:03:57.710> figure<00:03:57.890> it<00:03:58.010> out<00:03:58.190> I'm

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
filtering but you can figure it out I'm

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.810 
filtering but you can figure it out I'm
sure

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
sure

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
don't tighten it up yet now you see all

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.710 
don't tighten it up yet now you see all
those<00:04:19.459> connectors<00:04:20.030> make<00:04:20.209> sure<00:04:20.420> that<00:04:20.600> you

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
those connectors make sure that you

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.180 
those connectors make sure that you
don't<00:04:20.870> make<00:04:21.110> sure<00:04:21.260> you<00:04:21.470> remember<00:04:21.860> where<00:04:22.010> they

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
don't make sure you remember where they

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.650 
don't make sure you remember where they
go<00:04:22.430> but<00:04:22.460> it's<00:04:22.790> kind<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:22.970> it's<00:04:23.150> got<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.300> hard<00:04:23.600> to

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
go but it's kind of it's got a hard to

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.900 
go but it's kind of it's got a hard to
mess<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:24.050> up<00:04:24.140> that's<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.590> main<00:04:24.860> connector<00:04:25.430> the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
mess it up that's the main connector the

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.960 
mess it up that's the main connector the
fuel<00:04:26.210> line<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:27.380> has<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:27.920> little<00:04:28.250> plastic<00:04:28.550> thing

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
fuel line it has a little plastic thing

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.760 
fuel line it has a little plastic thing
on<00:04:29.120> top<00:04:29.330> you<00:04:29.510> have<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.750> lift<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.140> up<00:04:30.260> kinda<00:04:30.620> to

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
on top you have to lift it up kinda to

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.610 
on top you have to lift it up kinda to
take<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.130> apart<00:04:31.400> see<00:04:31.640> those<00:04:31.930> greenish<00:04:32.930> bluish

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
take it apart see those greenish bluish

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.750 
take it apart see those greenish bluish
color<00:04:35.410> buttons<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.710> have<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:37.070> push<00:04:37.340> them<00:04:37.550> and

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
color buttons you have to push them and

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.670 
color buttons you have to push them and
then<00:04:37.970> take<00:04:38.210> that<00:04:38.420> connector<00:04:38.930> off<00:04:39.080> but<00:04:39.440> here

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
then take that connector off but here

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.050 
then take that connector off but here
I'm<00:04:39.800> actually<00:04:39.950> putting<00:04:40.340> it<00:04:40.490> back<00:04:40.640> together<00:04:40.790> so
