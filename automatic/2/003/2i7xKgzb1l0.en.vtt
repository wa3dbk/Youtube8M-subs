00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.200
 well it's a surprise game they 're going to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.170
 participate the girls we are going to ask for the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.290
 girl from green to red please all 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.030
 and not but they say the 10 is defined 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.040
 because we play, they do not play for one 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.049
 plays for nothing is played for something as 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.660
 call this game this game is called 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.330
 all hung and what it is about is 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.610
 that they're going to have to hang up all 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.340
 Whoever lasts longer or is the last one in 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:32.009
 to fall will win wins the pelón that will win that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.949
 try harder and I think if it's a 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.769
 personal prize is not for the team is 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.239
 a personal prize but at the same time it is a 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.850
 prize that they will share with 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.340
 someone of combat that they choose then 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.370
 I think the red team with that this 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.120
 it's a personal reward it's not a thing it 's 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.350
 a prize of truth 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.960
 it is not a personal prize that they will be able to 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.640
 share if you do not imagine what it is that 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.350
 I wonder, may the 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.439
 competitor 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.320

 bell have to come running 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.700
 someone needs that is that they ask me 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:27.090
 the girl is almost with a hat or system 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:31.259
 hair in the combed hair and the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.880
 beautiful pheasants feathers 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.700
 micaela as one of the best 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.140
 character when I want said he has the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.399
 pheasant hair 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.399
 qualify as a compliment 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.179
 the prof never knows 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.940
 good guys can help 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.980
 if we are ready already then we are going to 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.450
 ask them to approach the quadrant if 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.450
 some need help from someone 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.689
 they need help 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.569
 eugenio is also a red- haired girl 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.569
 clear if I stay and stayed in the background 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.019
 and you can go up wherever you want, it does not matter 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.019
 it is not one place or another 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:32.719
 the Red 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.719

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.300

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.390
 I do not need to upload it and up the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.940
 award is personal who wins will take 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.030
 a prize to be able to use is no longer that 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.850
 it's one thing and look and within three years 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.310
 you just have to plant or it's a child that 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.140
 you'll be careful not for now 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.600
 It seems that they are very interested because 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.700
 it does not just say good that's why it does not have 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.240
 prize 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.090

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.440
 training after so much effort 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.840
 you have to reward the smallest 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.700
 [Music] 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.629
 and you already imagine that you want to use it with 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.430
 someone who left and you have to see if 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.530
 we are talking about that not because many 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.870
 Sometimes one can have certain plans that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.019
 then they prick is a problem but 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.040
 no no this is not the case and there it is 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.040

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:03.989
 [Music] 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.989
 shoulder width 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.200
 and micaela and I think we're 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.250
 conditions already decides the prize or 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.620
 still not 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.230
 to enjoy townhouses are going to 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.340
 have to choose a man of combat 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.340
 with whom to use it 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.129
 and that is to pull the gravity 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.420
 imagine what your prize is 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.380
 well I'm missing my life 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:44.510
 I have the one, the more battery you divide for 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.450
 share with one of the boys 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.460
 an iron is also a little more 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.380
 glamorous the iron can go down 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.420
 the shirt down the mattress 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.600
 so iron is ironed not iron 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.850

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.010

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.870
 seasonal can be from the red team 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.870
 it can be the green team 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:20.699

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.430

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:26.949

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.550
