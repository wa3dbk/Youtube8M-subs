00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
very familiar design to it and I come

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.420 
very familiar design to it and I come
from<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.020> primarily<00:00:22.500> an<00:00:22.650> Apple<00:00:22.980> background

using Apple's range of laptops but this

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.200 
using Apple's range of laptops but this
isn't<00:00:26.070> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> comparative<00:00:27.060> review

that'd<00:00:27.539> be<00:00:27.689> wrong<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.619> instead<00:00:29.369> I'm

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
that'd be wrong for me to do instead I'm

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.370 
that'd be wrong for me to do instead I'm
going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> look<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.359> judge<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.320> on

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
going to look at this and judge it on

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.410 
going to look at this and judge it on

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
2560 by 1440 and that gives a 221 pixel

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.960 
2560 by 1440 and that gives a 221 pixel
density<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> screen<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.939> of

would<00:03:03.840> put<00:03:04.049> their<00:03:04.170> speakers<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:04.680> better

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
would put their speakers in better

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.460 
would put their speakers in better

positions this fires down onto the desk

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.960 
positions this fires down onto the desk
so<00:03:07.709> that's<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:07.890> little<00:03:07.980> bit<00:03:08.099> bass<00:03:08.340> heavy<00:03:08.700> with

so that's a little bit bass heavy with

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.479 
so that's a little bit bass heavy with
the<00:03:09.209> audio<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.019> reproduces<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:11.220> still

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
the audio that it reproduces it's still

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.920 
the audio that it reproduces it's still
good<00:03:11.730> it's<00:03:11.940> nice<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.360> clear<00:03:12.540> they're<00:03:12.780> good

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
good it's nice and clear they're good

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.350 
good it's nice and clear they're good
quality<00:03:13.110> speakers<00:03:13.799> placement<00:03:14.790> could<00:03:15.090> have

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
quality speakers placement could have

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.840 
quality speakers placement could have
been<00:03:15.599> better<00:03:15.989> though<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.560> then<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
been better though and then this is the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.910 
been better though and then this is the
little<00:03:17.970> outlet<00:03:18.480> here<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:18.989> fan<00:03:19.260> there's

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
little outlet here for the fan there's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.770 
little outlet here for the fan there's
some<00:03:20.100> more<00:03:20.250> outlet<00:03:20.670> here<00:03:20.970> for<00:03:21.209> heat<00:03:21.389> as<00:03:21.569> well

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
some more outlet here for heat as well

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.890 
some more outlet here for heat as well
in<00:03:22.019> general<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.310> fan<00:03:23.549> ramps<00:03:24.000> up<00:03:24.120> quite<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.540> bit

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
in general the fan ramps up quite a bit

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.740 
in general the fan ramps up quite a bit
more<00:03:25.500> than<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.799> expected<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:27.030> still<00:03:27.359> it's<00:03:27.600> not

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
more than I expected but still it's not

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.840 
more than I expected but still it's not
very<00:03:28.139> loud<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:28.799> not<00:03:28.920> intrusive<00:03:29.340> at<00:03:29.670> all

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
very loud so it's not intrusive at all

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.300
