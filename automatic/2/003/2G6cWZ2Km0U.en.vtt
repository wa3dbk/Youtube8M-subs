00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.550
 you think you can have fun driving 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.920
 in the midst of all this chaos 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.690
 yes if you have a very special car like 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.029
 the bmw i3 because first from 0 to 50 per hour 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.430
 you will be faster than virtually 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.310
 anything there is no bmw m3 that holds 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.080
 so to understand the 250 newtonmetri of 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.390
 maximum torque are all available 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.579
 damn and immediately stopped and with 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.610
 170 horses touch 100 per hour in 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.579
 7.9 seconds up to 150 of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.899
 full speed 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.160
 second, I don't think a car is fun 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.629
 on which you always have the foot 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.000
 on the accelerator without ever having to 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.860
 touching the brake to the three regenerates so 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.079
 lots of energy when the gas is released 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.820
 which practically stops without having to 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.800
 brake and in fact the lights come on 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.610
 stop because otherwise it will buffer you 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.780
 the tires so narrow would third 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.480
 make a certain impression 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.289
 one wonders how they manage to get grip 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.159
 in the curve 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:10.409
 yet the proportions are so strange and 155 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.390
 bar 60 front and 175 bar 55 behind 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.880
 on 20-inch wheels with tires a 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.360
 low friction copy counters give away one 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.530
 instant steering response and gear changes 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.049
 direction 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.180
 incredibly fast and with a weight of 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.460
 1400 kg concentrated at the bottom where there is 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.970
 are the batteries and behind where there are i 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.970
 two engines 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.790
 but when you overdo it the electronics holds 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 under control 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.380
 front to cancel understeer 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.650
 and softens the supply to avoid 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.750
 power skids despite the 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.150
 rear-wheel Drive 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.160
 then the steering wheel is really nice 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.520
 as on sports too too much 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.520
 parking maneuvers 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.810
 here is how to have fun driving in the 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.920
 traffic but getting excited in the city wants 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.330
 also to say to be in the center 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.400
 of the attention of those around them 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.420
 if you like to make you look stop by 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.650
 curious and admirers 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.450
 this machine has nothing to 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.370
 envy of a very sporty supercar 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.370
 to say rather that it gives even more to the eye 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.329
 design merit in a word is 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.329
 absurd 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.380
 futuristic and banal style but the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.480
 proportions are different than the strange shapes 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.220
 and not very harmonious if you want as in the case 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.900
 of the side of the tail but it is almost 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.620
 impossible not to be affected if the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.620
 meets on the street 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.640
 not to mention the interiors that 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.710
 they seem taken from the living room of a 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.480
 flat open space more than thought 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.040
 for the passenger compartment of a car the fiber of 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.660
 carbon entirely made with 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.250
 the shell is visible or one is 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.720
 surrounded by recycled plastic and 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.460
 materials made with vegetable fibers 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.950
 and on request from eucalyptus wood 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.480
 curved and particularly satisfying 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.740
 it also highlights the two 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.390
 instrumentation display in 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.670
 particular the central screen standards 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.080
 infotainment also tells you when 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.980
 no longer use the car to get to 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.540
 destination 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.459
 gives you suggestions for intermodality 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.810
 between multiple transports displays 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.850
 on the navigator the maximum distance 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.040
 reachable by batteries and tank 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.810
 petrol station full and has dedicated apps 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.400
 on the smartphone to interact with 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.880
 charging stations and with the machine a 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.880
 distance 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.440
 recharge the batteries need about 8 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.239
 hours from a household socket by three 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.760
 at six o'clock with optional on request 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.319
 of the homebox and 30 wallbox 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.849
 minutes with another payment accessory 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.620
 the quick charge function in 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.060
 alternating and continuous current which 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.470
 allows you to take advantage of details 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.450
 public stations or stations 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.160
 business recharge to fill up with 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.230
 electricity the personal card is used 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.000
 provided by bmw with which in practice yes 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.830
 pay parking fees 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.690
 the closet doors are tight 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.610
 and whoever is seated behind cannot go down 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.050
 if the front door closed even though 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.050
 can fold the backrest forward 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.860
 not so much interior they are thick and very 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.750
 bent so they make it difficult to understand 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.460
 where the bodywork for example ends 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.720
 in u-turns when exploiting 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.120
 the considerable steering angle of the 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.950
 wheels two words on the range extender 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.030
 gasoline engine goes around constant speeds e 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.210
 reminds a little of the noise of a 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.210
 fridge 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.920
 by default it starts only when the 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.180
 batteries run down but cannot be done 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.250
 intervene on request when the 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.880
 charge level drops below 75 per 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.800
 one hundred 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.270
 I do not hide the 40 thousand behind a finger 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.580
 euros that we need for this 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.380
 bmw i3 are not few and beyond 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.240
 fact that the figure is aligned to others 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.070
 purely electric car or al 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.570
 Plug-in hybrid with extended autonomy 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.580
 maybe even less innovative e 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.440
 technologically in front of this 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.330
 city supercar let me call it that 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.400
 according to me there are two ways to 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.590
 travel spend 10 thousand euros for one 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.240
 city ​​cars to use every day and 30 thousand 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.040
 let's say for a nice car 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.990
 to move with at the weekend or do a 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.820
 long journey or try to change 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.070
 mentality even risking mindfulness 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.440
 conceiving a machine like the i3 like 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.910
 only car for everyday use e 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.500
 it is not already have more traditional cars 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.630
 on other occasions for example i 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.400
 bmw models included in the program and don 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.740
 mobility and in this range version 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.020
 extender with two-cylinder engine 650 of 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.790
 displacement with 34 horses and 9 liters of 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.290
 The tank can be used without anxiety 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.860
 to remain still perhaps to make a 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.860
 trip out of town 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.780
 we have taken it to the limit in a 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.820
 longer journey from Rome to Forlì 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.900
 find out how it got away with ours 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.280
 proof of real consumption 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.380
 as to say about a car like that 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.419
 there would be so much technology 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.139
 as in general on the world of cars 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.970
 electrical 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.710
