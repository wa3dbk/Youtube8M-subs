00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.269
 Hello everyone, and our most bloomed 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.870
 The first bush of peonies and the video today will be 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.740
 how to do it yourself 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.869
 Here is a stand under the bush so that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.500
 time of rain and while they are blowing 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.490
 winds 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.630
 the bush did not fall apart and the flowers did not break 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.630
 flower stalks did not break 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.579
 let's see how to do this 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.519
 simple but at the same time very necessary and 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.890
 device for making this 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.430
 designs we need nothing at all 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.570
 Here is such a pipe metal-plastic 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.140
 plumbing which can be found in 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:14.020
 any hardware store like that 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 trim from the wall paneling screwdriver further us 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.899
 you will need an ordinary garden hose 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.720
 about these are the pieces we need 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.319
 will be for making our designs 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.149
 but see that the hose diameter is 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.850
 larger than pipe diameter 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.600
 so we can do like this 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.850
 tightly put it on the pipe and connect 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.850
 then you will see everything and screw 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.580
 our ring is ready at an angle of 120 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.600
 degrees 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.090
 divided turned out here 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:41.770
 mersedesovsky wheel three points by 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:48.040
 steady support and if you want 2 and 3 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:52.860
 dots farther what white legs 400 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:57.400
 millimeters cut the tubing further 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:01.050
 chopped up blades from the remaining lining 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.050
 shut up 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:20.310
 further screwdriver and screw that is 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.350
 we hammered the wood in order to 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.360
 screw to drive there to drive 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.360
 self-tapping screw that googol and steady 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.810
 and now we will wear the bottom ring 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:04.670
 Here the screw fastens simply in 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:09.350
 pipe to metal to aluminum wood 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:13.610
 insert it turned out to stand under 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:17.150
 beer so but now we will dress 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.489
 here is this stand but we do it for 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.640
 when our rainy season 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:26.630
 started and they fall after the rain and 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.530
 break when they bloom they do 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.860
 get very heavy so do 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.800
 stand to hust me fall apart 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:42.370
 with his health in a handful doing here 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.370
 such a bouquet for example 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:52.780
 two screws 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:05:04.090
 neatly dressed so as not to damage 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:05.889
 we are trying to remove our buds just like that 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.020
 at the child but everything 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.540
 and our peony turned out in a vase and 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.449
 now no wind no rain no scary 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.880
 even when they bloom will 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.410
 heavy they will not fall and will not fall apart 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.320

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.160
