00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.950
 Hello everyone was offense 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.380
 we find a spoiler on the 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.959
 future 1.8 the future version of 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.430
 pc minecraft and the olivan spoiler 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.460
 contracting at the hands of ryan hulse 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.289
 developer up to 1.8 and good by 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.660
 Finally , 100% of the 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.640
 rabbits for up to 1.8 I'll be watching in 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.580
 screen how these rabbits interact 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.919
 at the moment they are quite strange they jump 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.260
 pretty weird like the back legs 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.570
 fixed something quite strange are a 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.400
 bit ugly must be said and well what 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.990
 what do I say I always say with implements 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.910
 a new way is that if they implement it 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.760
 that has some utility again the 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.320
 utility they have is basically 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.640
 beautify the landscape because for now 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.700
 it is not known if they are going to do anything in 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.720
 concrete jump is ok and that's it but 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.490
 moment you do not know they are going to spoil 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.380
 something specifically if we are going to serve for 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.090
 do some crash but your skin or something 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.590
 like that down here like 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.880
 I always say I like to read your 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.770
 comments and why here below 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.930
 you can put your ideas I love 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.689
 read them as I always say and I would like 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.729
 read your creativity and tell me what 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.320
 you think about these rabbits that can 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.750
 make these rabbits 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.120
 with them that we can do ourselves 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.080
 I do not know how skin can stop for something 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.180
 be or europe in another object that does not have 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.310
 I thought is that I do not know I do not really know 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.540
 I do not know who also uses these rabbits 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.530
 but as I always say hopefully they have 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.270
 some use because to 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.400
 implement them as bats that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.800
 they do not do anything better not implement anything 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.910
 and well it 's okay can not comment 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.650
 down here below you think these 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.180
 rabbits that the best I could do could 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.430
 different colors not only with the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.500
 brown but white black rabbit 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.060
 different colors good and good nothing 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.350
