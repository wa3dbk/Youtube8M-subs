empty it's at zero now we can come back
here<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.640> what<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.239> show<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.540> how

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
here and what I will do is show you how

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.310 
here and what I will do is show you how
we<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.250> bypass<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.239> situation<00:00:42.899> by<00:00:43.050> using

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
we can bypass this situation by using

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.119 
we can bypass this situation by using
what<00:00:43.680> HP<00:00:43.920> calls<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.329> override<00:00:45.899> mode<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
what HP calls the override mode in the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.720 
what HP calls the override mode in the
override<00:00:47.610> mode<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:49.590> printer<00:00:50.070> will<00:00:50.250> ignore

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
override mode the printer will ignore

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.779 
override mode the printer will ignore
the<00:00:51.270> readings<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.440> short<00:00:52.770> supply<00:00:53.190> smart

the<00:00:56.309> printer<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.180> will<00:00:57.300> simply<00:00:57.719> continue

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the printer and it will simply continue

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.430 
the printer and it will simply continue
trying<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.070> print<00:00:59.750> regardless<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.350> it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
thinks is inside the cartridge and you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.479 
thinks is inside the cartridge and you
can<00:01:03.420> keep<00:01:03.600> doing<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.140> either<00:01:04.650> until<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> ink

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
can keep doing that either until the ink

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.789 
can keep doing that either until the ink

the two choices are stopped at out

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.710 
the two choices are stopped at out
meaning<00:01:43.320> stop<00:01:43.890> whenever<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.939> chips<00:01:45.210> tell<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
meaning stop whenever the chips tell you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.429 
meaning stop whenever the chips tell you
that<00:01:46.020> you're<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.619> toner<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:48.170> override<00:01:49.170> out

ask us to verify and now the printer can

ask us to verify and now the printer can
continue

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380

at that point you should be able to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
at that point you should be able to
