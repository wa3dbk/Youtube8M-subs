00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
which is a really much better trade-off

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.600 
which is a really much better trade-off
like<00:00:46.079> most<00:00:46.379> people<00:00:46.770> would<00:00:46.890> prefer<00:00:47.010> not<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.430> be

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
like most people would prefer not to be

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.060

in<00:00:47.730> actually<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.690> fed<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:49.950> we're

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
in actually be fed so that's what we're

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.799 
in actually be fed so that's what we're
doing<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.309> her<00:00:50.430> she's<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
doing with her she's going to have a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.590 
doing with her she's going to have a
meal<00:00:52.309> does<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.430> sounded

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
meal does that sounded

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.140 
meal does that sounded
and<00:00:55.050> that's<00:00:55.610> one<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> things<00:00:57.030> that's

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
and that's one of the things that's

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.180 
and that's one of the things that's
changed<00:00:57.810> so<00:00:58.079> dramatically<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.860> turkeys

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
changed so dramatically with turkeys

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.190 
changed so dramatically with turkeys
with<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.489> selective<00:00:59.940> breeding<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.989> they've

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
made them really really great they have

made them really really great they have
really<00:01:03.780> big<00:01:03.960> breasts<00:01:04.589> week<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.700> really<00:01:06.090> throws

off their weight with the white turkeys

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.160 
off their weight with the white turkeys
including<00:01:11.030> definitely<00:01:12.030> even<00:01:12.630> though<00:01:12.750> she<00:01:12.840> has

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
including definitely even though she has

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.930 
including definitely even though she has
toast<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.100> she<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.369> younger<00:01:14.550> she<00:01:14.670> could

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
toast and when she was younger she could

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.640 
toast and when she was younger she could
root<00:01:15.119> she<00:01:15.390> actually<00:01:15.540> flew<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> fences

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
root she actually flew up on the fences

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.380 
root she actually flew up on the fences
as<00:01:16.979> she's<00:01:17.310> getting<00:01:17.430> older<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.000> she's<00:01:18.240> getting

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
as she's getting older now she's getting

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.810 
as she's getting older now she's getting
so<00:01:18.750> heavy<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.200> her<00:01:19.290> chest<00:01:19.590> area<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.490> she

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
so heavy in her chest area that she

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.400 
so heavy in her chest area that she
really<00:01:21.060> can't<00:01:21.300> hold<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.960> loose<00:01:22.110> because

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
really can't hold on and loose because

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.690 
really can't hold on and loose because
she's<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.800> her<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.040> too<00:01:23.100> stupid

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
she's in her way too stupid

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
she's in her way too stupid
so<00:01:24.119> she<00:01:24.180> again<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.660> sleeping<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> other

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
so she again is sleeping like the other

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.800 
so she again is sleeping like the other
girl<00:01:25.770> she<00:01:25.860> sleeps<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.369> fails<00:01:26.640> they<00:01:27.420> sleep<00:01:27.690> on

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
girl she sleeps on fails they sleep on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.620 
girl she sleeps on fails they sleep on
low<00:01:28.369> areas<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.550> bales<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.090> straw<00:01:30.119> because

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
low areas like bales of straw because

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.150 
low areas like bales of straw because
they<00:01:30.930> can't<00:01:31.170> go<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.440> high<00:01:31.619> which<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.039> their

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
they can't go up high which is their

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.620 
they can't go up high which is their
natural<00:01:32.520> instinct<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> only<00:01:33.420> reason

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
natural instinct but the only reason

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
natural instinct but the only reason
they<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.080> is<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.710> are<00:01:34.860> designed<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
they can is because they are designed to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.719 
they can is because they are designed to
be<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.820> much<00:01:36.000> larger<00:01:36.390> than<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.570> real<00:01:36.750> Turkey

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
be so much larger than a real Turkey

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.490 
be so much larger than a real Turkey
when<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:38.850> come<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.960> industry<00:01:40.350> what

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
when they come in in the industry what

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.779 
when they come in in the industry what
they<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.830> they<00:01:40.920> warehouse<00:01:41.310> raise<00:01:41.550> these

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
they do is they warehouse raise these

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.550 
they do is they warehouse raise these
birds<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.300> to<00:01:42.690> keep<00:01:42.930> them<00:01:43.110> from<00:01:43.289> fighting

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
birds so to keep them from fighting

very<00:03:04.200> hard<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.620> see<00:03:04.800> them<00:03:04.950> as<00:03:05.040> individuals<00:03:05.640> but

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
very hard to see them as individuals but

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.560 
very hard to see them as individuals but
any<00:03:06.360> one<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.750> them<00:03:07.020> pulled<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.670> if

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
any one of them pulled out is and so if

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.510 
any one of them pulled out is and so if
I<00:03:09.780> see<00:03:10.320> who<00:03:10.560> they<00:03:10.680> are<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.100> seeing<00:03:11.370> their

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
I see who they are and seeing their

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.310 
I see who they are and seeing their
individual<00:03:11.940> personalities<00:03:12.660> we're<00:03:13.080> hoping

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
individual personalities we're hoping

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.630 
individual personalities we're hoping
that<00:03:13.380> people<00:03:13.590> recognize<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.190> since<00:03:14.550> you

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
that people recognize it since you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.550 
that people recognize it since you
really<00:03:14.820> don't<00:03:15.060> need<00:03:15.450> meat<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.110> your<00:03:16.200> diet<00:03:16.440> that
