the Battle of paddling Dana or
California<00:00:35.969> dana<00:00:36.180> point<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.180> 510<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
California dana point so what I'm 510 I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.280 
California dana point so what I'm 510 I
think<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.010> then<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:41.879> 175<00:00:42.719> weighed<00:00:43.140> myself

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
think and then I just 175 weighed myself

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.930 
think and then I just 175 weighed myself
last<00:00:43.710> night<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> guess<00:00:44.399> I'm<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> lighter

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
last night so I guess I'm on the lighter

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540 
last night so I guess I'm on the lighter
and<00:00:45.500> that's<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:47.070> used<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and that's it's used to be a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.130 
and that's it's used to be a
disadvantage<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> years<00:00:48.719> because<00:00:48.930> every

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
disadvantage in the years because every

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.900 
disadvantage in the years because every
all<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> craft<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.950> skis<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.579> boards<00:00:50.670> are

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
all the craft and skis and boards are

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.150 
all the craft and skis and boards are
heavy<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> bigger<00:00:52.050> stronger<00:00:52.320> guys<00:00:52.590> but

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
heavy so the bigger stronger guys but

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.220 
heavy so the bigger stronger guys but
now<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> boards<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.149> getting<00:00:54.989> lighter

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
now that the boards are getting lighter

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
now that the boards are getting lighter
and<00:00:55.350> lighter<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.949> all<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> skis<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and lighter and all the skis on the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.490 
and lighter and all the skis on the
craft<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.629> kind<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.930> coming<00:00:58.109> down<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
craft it's kind of coming down to a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.990 
craft it's kind of coming down to a
power<00:00:58.710> weight<00:00:58.949> game<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> little<00:00:59.489> bit<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.879> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
power weight game a little bit so the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.910 
power weight game a little bit so the
lighter<00:01:00.239> guys<00:01:00.449> some<00:01:01.440> other<00:01:01.530> guys<00:01:01.739> are

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
lighter guys some other guys are

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.650 
lighter guys some other guys are
actually<00:01:02.070> back<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.969> an<00:01:03.090> even<00:01:03.180> playing<00:01:03.539> field

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
actually back on an even playing field

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.840 
actually back on an even playing field
and<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.290> lot<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.100> stuff<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.700> might

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and a lot of the stuff get they might

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.310 
and a lot of the stuff get they might
even<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.180> an<00:01:06.299> advantage<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:06.990> they're

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
even get an advantage because they're

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.830 
even get an advantage because they're
not<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.560> being<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.159> heavy<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.210> board

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
not as being not as heavy the board

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.859 
not as being not as heavy the board

take a little bit more well at the
moment<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:38.130> wearing<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.759> compression

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
moment I'm wearing this compression

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.330 
moment I'm wearing this compression
stuff<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> compression<00:01:40.890> shirt<00:01:41.100> it's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
stuff it's like a compression shirt it's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.150 
stuff it's like a compression shirt it's
best<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.630> tight

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
best if it's just really tight

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.830 
best if it's just really tight
and<00:01:45.160> it's<00:01:45.700> just<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.120> little<00:01:46.240> hot<00:01:46.510> so<00:01:46.690> I<00:01:46.720> mean

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
and it's just a little hot so I mean

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.450 
and it's just a little hot so I mean
that<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.170> cold<00:01:47.500> erases<00:01:47.980> it's<00:01:48.190> good<00:01:48.310> to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
that in the cold erases it's good to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
also actually speak to help blood flow

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.910 
also actually speak to help blood flow
but<00:01:54.430> obviously<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:55.630> Hawaii<00:01:55.960> or<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.320> super<00:01:56.740> hot

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920

but obviously in Hawaii or a super hot
and<00:01:57.160> Australia<00:01:57.970> is<00:01:58.030> even<00:01:58.240> hotter<00:01:58.420> again<00:01:58.780> I

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
and Australia is even hotter again I

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.170 
and Australia is even hotter again I
mean<00:01:59.710> I<00:01:59.890> but<00:02:00.310> it's<00:02:00.430> still<00:02:00.550> old<00:02:00.760> school<00:02:00.850> we've

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
mean I but it's still old school we've

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.790 
mean I but it's still old school we've
still<00:02:01.420> just<00:02:01.540> where<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.870> least<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.350> possible

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
still just where the least is possible

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.160 
still just where the least is possible
you<00:02:02.980> know<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.400> some<00:02:03.580> block<00:02:03.790> but<00:02:04.030> other<00:02:04.810> people

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
you know and some block but other people

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.020 
you know and some block but other people
are<00:02:05.260> going<00:02:05.290> performance<00:02:05.890> garments<00:02:06.580> now<00:02:06.730> and

are going performance garments now and

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.160 
are going performance garments now and
like<00:02:07.150> everyone's<00:02:07.540> trying<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.840> get<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.050> edge

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
like everyone's trying to get the edge

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.250 
like everyone's trying to get the edge
in<00:02:08.640> everything<00:02:09.640> from<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:10.240> guess<00:02:10.479> it's<00:02:11.020> getting

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
in everything from I guess it's getting

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.950 
in everything from I guess it's getting
crazier<00:02:11.680> they<00:02:11.800> like<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.040> balance<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.390> wrist

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
crazier they like the balance and wrist

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.380 
crazier they like the balance and wrist
scenes<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.770> neck<00:02:14.980> laces<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.730> like<00:02:15.880> and

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
but if they don't eat properly this is

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.970 
but if they don't eat properly this is
the<00:03:12.580> biggest<00:03:12.790> waste<00:03:13.060> of<00:03:13.239> time<00:03:13.590> all<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.650> feel

nutrition<00:03:15.550> is<00:03:15.790> Millie<00:03:16.180> more<00:03:16.420> important<00:03:16.900> than

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
nutrition is Millie more important than

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.740 
nutrition is Millie more important than
training<00:03:17.350> sometimes<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.489> stressed<00:03:18.880> there's

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
training sometimes I so stressed there's

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.180 
training sometimes I so stressed there's
no<00:03:19.900> more<00:03:20.170> important<00:03:20.560> than<00:03:20.620> tracks<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.130> on

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
no more important than tracks and so on

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.890 
no more important than tracks and so on
so<00:03:21.220> i<00:03:21.400> actually<00:03:21.580> do<00:03:21.940> their<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.450> easy<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.870> i

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
so i actually do their the easy to i

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.710 
so i actually do their the easy to i
think<00:03:23.110> is<00:03:23.440> resting<00:03:23.800> train<00:03:24.010> reskin<00:03:24.580> food<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.690> i

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
think is resting train reskin food so i

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.880
