00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.529
 I am Alejandra Coghlan and you are in my house 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.590
 which is your house this time we are 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.930
 making this arrangement that's fine 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.859
 cute and we did it with good things 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.320
 simple we are going to use a cylinder 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.989
 then the sphere for the flowers and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.070
 then we are going to make the flowers that the 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:29.020
 we did with crepe paper 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:34.100
 This one that you already know and some sticks 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:37.430
 we are also going to use diurex glitter 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.820
 to put these little taps and a little bit 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.150
 of ribbon and of course a brush for 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.489
 put the resistol and be able to give these 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.949
 so cute touches in our flowers 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.949
 this was a sheet 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.510
 of bs 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.280
 and then we cut it 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.240
 and it is already amount of this tribute 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.240
 to get them out 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.409
 and then 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.150
 and love 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.119
 not local for us 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.990
 the flower 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.590
 and now some of the flowers like 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.439
 You can see here and we've put a 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.650
 little bit of glitter not all I think 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:28.409
 which looks better if only some then 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.630
 I'll explain how we put the 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.210
 sparkly 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.000
 here I already have the benzine prepared in 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.070
 a little 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.230
 the truth is that glitter has its 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.920
 charm and you have to work it very 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.920
 controlled 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.220
 then when a little zinc or 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.580
 fast glue liquid 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.450
 over here we're going to splash a little bit 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.709
 much 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.709
 I have it enough 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:14.560
 10 and here I had a ball 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.560
 half the truth is that we're going to 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.209
 for other 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.370
 but what we did cut in half 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.989
 ale as is constant 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.989
 you heat a knife 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.470
 I danced it with 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.740
 so what we are going to do is we are going to 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.740
 paste 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.760
 more parents put the flowers is the most 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.250
 then nothing else here like to think 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.250
 legends like 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.430
 How did you like it? 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.799
 you can do in the colors you want 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.040
 in the combinations you want, you can 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:19.400
 put other things down or type vases 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.470
 vintage oldest maybe the 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.600
 sphere with a stick and in a pot 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.240
 common or tweet and I think you can do 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.970
 many more things you know that what 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.000
 important is that you give ideas inventes 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.220
