00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
you like to know by OPI so we definitely

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.310 
you like to know by OPI so we definitely
have<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.230> bit<00:04:54.530> of<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.710> different<00:04:55.040> finish<00:04:56.140> but<00:04:57.140> are

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
have a bit of a different finish but are

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.940 
have a bit of a different finish but are
quite<00:04:57.680> similar<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:58.760> then<00:04:59.660> the<00:04:59.780> next<00:04:59.960> one<00:05:00.320> is

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
quite similar and then the next one is

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.490 
quite similar and then the next one is
man-eater<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:02.180> it's<00:05:02.330> somewhat<00:05:02.720> like<00:05:02.990> my

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
man-eater and it's somewhat like my

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.650 
man-eater and it's somewhat like my
voice<00:05:03.710> is<00:05:03.950> a<00:05:03.980> little<00:05:04.070> Norris<00:05:04.610> only<00:05:05.150> more<00:05:05.360> pink

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
voice is a little Norris only more pink

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.100 
voice is a little Norris only more pink
so<00:05:06.590> they<00:05:06.710> have<00:05:06.920> a<00:05:06.950> small<00:05:07.730> rainbow<00:05:08.330> holographic

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
so they have a small rainbow holographic

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.220 
so they have a small rainbow holographic
glitter<00:05:09.730> so<00:05:10.730> it<00:05:10.790> also<00:05:10.970> has<00:05:11.390> some<00:05:11.630> kind<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.900> tiny

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
glitter so it also has some kind of tiny

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.040 
glitter so it also has some kind of tiny
rose<00:05:12.650> gold<00:05:13.010> specks<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.870> kind<00:05:14.870> of<00:05:14.900> like<00:05:14.990> a

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
rose gold specks and kind of like a

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.320 
rose gold specks and kind of like a
cobalt<00:05:15.590> blue<00:05:15.800> glitter<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:16.610> silver<00:05:17.060> glitter

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
cobalt blue glitter and silver glitter

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.840 
cobalt blue glitter and silver glitter
so<00:05:17.600> it's<00:05:17.720> super<00:05:18.080> interesting<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:19.010> I<00:05:19.550> really

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
so it's super interesting and I really

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.180 
so it's super interesting and I really
like<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.180> color<00:05:20.390> combination<00:05:20.810> in<00:05:21.320> here<00:05:21.560> so<00:05:22.010> we

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
like the color combination in here so we

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.310 
like the color combination in here so we
