00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.860
 A) Yes 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.610
 and a little more than a month before a 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.100
 huge asteroid impact against 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.730
 land with enough power to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.739
 end life as we know it 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.379
 or at least this is what they believe 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.230
 some experts in biblical prophecy 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.690
 who believe that the apocalypse 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.960
 will occur between 22 and 28 September 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.180
 2015 as we discussed the world 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.550
 esoteric and paranormal the asteroid 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.860
 four kilometers wide will impact 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.080
 near puerto rico- causing a 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.619
 tsunami and an earthquake that will devastate the 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.720
 East coast of the USA and Mexico 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.570
 30 million people will perish 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.850
 after the impact and another 40 million 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.100
 more will die due to diseases and 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.070
 other factors in subsequent months 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.900
 to the catastrophe but really this 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.080
 frightening vision of our future 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.960
 will happen it is clear that for the NASA the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.420
 answer is not shortly after the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.549
 main means of communication and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 social networks would echo the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.570
 event that will take place in September 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.790
 2015 the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.950
 NASA experts were forced 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.470
 to issue a statement denying the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.590
 possibility of impact now or in a 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.750
 near future the nasa currently does not 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.119
 know no asteroid or comet in 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.040
 course of collision with the earth so 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.229
 that the probability of a collision 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.710
 this magnitude is quite small 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.350
 explained the nasa in its press release 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.570
 done the best we can say is that 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.220
 no large object impacts the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.070
 land at any time of the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.140
 next 100 years but with what not 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.300
 counted the nasa is that in the past 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.250
 mysteries days special objects 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.940
 they will cross the skies of our fragile 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.709
 planet last Thursday , July 30 a 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.390
 very bright white light ball 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.000
 appeared on the skies of good 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.550
 aires- and a few hours later a great 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.640
 meteorite struck near the city of 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.890
 down north of Iran it's about the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.930
 first fragments of the asteroid that 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.590
 will impact against the earth the month that 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.450
 comes argentine cross fireball according to 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.090
 the online version of the nation newspaper 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.720
 a big green fireball 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.670
 sparkly 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.880
 they are the skies of argentina at night 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.250
 on Thursday, July 30, the event had 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.070
 place on Buenos Aires and according to 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.900
 experts was the result of a meteor 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.040
 that entered the Earth 's atmosphere 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.470
 on the spectacular 21 00 h 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.660
 sighting lasted about 10 seconds and not 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.730
 there were no regrets, no injuries or deaths 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.830
 by the presence of the unusual ball of 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.220
 light 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.750
 according to doctor francisco diego 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.330
 researcher of the department of physics 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.430
 and astronomy of the university with axis of 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.340
 london explained when the rocks 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.440
 spacecraft access the earth they burn 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.080
 and what is known as a 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.450
 shooting star and in the case of rocks 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.120
 larger ones are known as balls of 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.600
 fire in addition doctor diego also 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.640
 he said there are thousands of rockets remnants 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.560
 satellites or space junk in the orbit 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.490
 of the earth and that will eventually go 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.500
 falling into our atmosphere 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.120
 meteorite impacts on the doctor 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.430
 Diego made it clear that there is no need 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.560
 worry about the presence of these 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.190
 meteorites discarding the possibility 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.350
 that may cause harm to the population 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.660
 However, what I did not count on is that 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.880
 few hours later great confirmed that 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.850
 a meteor hit somewhere in the 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.430
 north of the country according to the agency 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.740
 faint news there is that the meteorite 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.980
 fell near the city ​​below in the 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.140
 province of Qazvin north of Iran 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.280
 authorities of the country assured that 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.709
 several fragments 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.410
 space rock impacted in different 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.380
 areas of the country including the province 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.630
 of elbur so far is unknown 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.850
 the damage caused by this meteorite 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.280
 but everything seems to indicate that 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.110
 have dozens of injured and numerous 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.690
 material damage 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.850
 the countdown begins these two 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.160
 phenomena in our skies with few 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.440
 hours of difference have caused a great 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.480
 stir in social networks where 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.639
 many people expressed their 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.919
 concern and fear that they are 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.230
 the first fragments of the assumption 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.660
 asteroid that should impact against the 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.919
 land between 22 and 28 September 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.510
 of 2015 on the other hand the conspiranoicos 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.030
 stressed that a few days after 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.110
 the nasa issued the statement 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.640
 discarding the possibility that 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.669
 there would be the impact of an asteroid 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.550
 danger in the next few years a group of 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.200
 outstanding astronomers and scientists 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.880
 signed a petition to urge the 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.419
 governments in the search for rocks 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.979
 potentially dangerous space 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.229
 among the experts who signed the 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.280
 statement included the guitarist of 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.340
 queen brian 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.700
 and the real astronomer ress brian cox and 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.889
 Richard Dawkins Each of the experts 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.200
 He assured that they are not taking 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.419
 necessary measures to protect us from 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.120
 asteroids that may be in the process of 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.280
 collision with the earth the statement 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.080
 says there are a million asteroids in 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.090
 our solar system that have the 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.430
 enough potential to impact 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.190
 against the earth and destroy a city 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.530
 it is for this reason that more and more 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.110
 the people who believe in the prophecy of 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.480
 reverendo efraín rodríguez who says 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.580
 have written to NASA in 2010 to 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.090
 warn of the catastrophe that will occur 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.550
 in September 2015 as we discussed 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.830
 the Reverend Rodriguez said that he 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.890
 they transmitted the apocalyptic event to 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.020
 through a message from God 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.400
 confirming that the killer asteroid 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.740
 it would impact near Puerto Rico- and 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.229
 would cause an earthquake and a tsunami that 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.840
 It will devastate the east coast of the US 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:18.260
 point mexico and certain parts of america 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.210
 from the south the reverendo Rodríguez too 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.160
 affirmed that the nasa confirmed the 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.610
 trajectory of the asteroid and that the 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.199
 price 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.990
 Before Barack Obama had been informed 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:29.689
 although they only warned the 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.840
 rich and powerful the conspiranoics 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:34.520
 they assure that the government of the USA has 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.650
 started the preparation before the 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.349
 imminent catastrophe with the assumption 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.569
 jade and jade jade military exercise 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.789
 that will serve to introduce the law 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.419
 martial when the panic takes over 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.419
 the population
