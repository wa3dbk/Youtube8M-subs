00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
hey guys static here with another

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.850 
hey guys static here with another
episode<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.030> spawn<00:00:09.389> point<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.559> today's

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
episode of spawn point and in today's

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.290 
episode of spawn point and in today's
episode<00:00:10.889> we're<00:00:11.550> going<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.820> testing<00:00:12.210> an

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
episode we're going to be testing an

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.940 
episode we're going to be testing an
item<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:12.780> everyone<00:00:13.110> seems<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.410> think<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.920> a

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
item that everyone seems to think is a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.430 
item that everyone seems to think is a
foregone<00:00:14.429> conclusion<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:15.210> mobs<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:16.020> spawn

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
foregone conclusion that mobs can spawn

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.189 
foregone conclusion that mobs can spawn
on<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.789> but<00:00:17.789> I've<00:00:17.880> been<00:00:17.910> hearing<00:00:18.240> reports<00:00:18.449> that

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
on it but I've been hearing reports that

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.080 
on it but I've been hearing reports that
mobs<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.680> spawn<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.100> one<00:00:20.279> variety<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.970> not

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
mobs can spawn on one variety and not

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.550 
mobs can spawn on one variety and not
the<00:00:21.210> other<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.170> that's<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.500> be

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
the other and so that's going to be

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.439 
the other and so that's going to be
pressure<00:00:22.830> plates<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.820> today<00:00:24.090> we're<00:00:24.269> going<00:00:24.359> to

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
pressure plates so today we're going to

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.300 
pressure plates so today we're going to
be<00:00:24.510> testing<00:00:24.990> both<00:00:25.230> wooden<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.800> stone

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
be testing both wooden and stone

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.120 
be testing both wooden and stone
pressure<00:00:26.670> plates<00:00:27.680> alright<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.830> there<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:28.980> go

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
pressure plates alright so there we go

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.089 
pressure plates alright so there we go
guys<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.789> 16<00:00:30.630> pads<00:00:30.929> covered<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.710> wooden

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
guys all 16 pads covered with wooden

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.830 
guys all 16 pads covered with wooden
pressure<00:00:32.399> plates<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.570> side<00:00:33.780> note

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
pressure plates and just a side note

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.600 
pressure plates and just a side note
here<00:00:34.170> actually<00:00:34.530> do<00:00:34.680> quite<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.370> way<00:00:35.460> that

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
here actually do quite like the way that

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.139 
here actually do quite like the way that
this<00:00:35.760> looks<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.780> mean<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.460> didn't<00:00:38.700> use<00:00:38.879> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
this looks so I mean if it didn't use so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.729 
this looks so I mean if it didn't use so
much<00:00:39.300> wood<00:00:39.629> I'd<00:00:39.840> probably<00:00:40.079> even<00:00:40.320> consider

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
much wood I'd probably even consider

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.340 
much wood I'd probably even consider
actually<00:00:41.190> doing<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.820> permanently<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.629> it's

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
actually doing this permanently and it's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.959 
actually doing this permanently and it's
probably<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> good<00:00:43.739> time<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> note<00:00:44.370> guys<00:00:44.579> that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
probably a good time to note guys that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.029 
probably a good time to note guys that
yeah<00:00:45.149> everything<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.500> spawn<00:00:46.770> point

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
yeah everything I do on the spawn point

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.250 
yeah everything I do on the spawn point
series<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.730> 100%<00:00:48.450> legit

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
series is 100% legit

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.189 
series is 100% legit
so<00:00:49.680> I've<00:00:49.950> mine<00:00:50.340> not<00:00:51.120> mine<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.570> harvested<00:00:52.079> all

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
so I've mine not mine but harvested all

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.330 
so I've mine not mine but harvested all
the<00:00:52.230> wood<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.770> pressure<00:00:53.039> plates

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the wood for these pressure plates

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090 
the wood for these pressure plates
myself<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.289> being<00:00:55.469> said<00:00:55.559> let's<00:00:55.739> flick

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
myself so that being said let's flick

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.090 
myself so that being said let's flick
off<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> lights<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.629> what<00:00:57.750> happens

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.109 

move<00:01:05.100> around<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.489> bit<00:01:05.640> see<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.000> can

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
move around a bit see if we can

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.190 
move around a bit see if we can
encourage<00:01:06.390> some<00:01:06.750> spawns<00:01:08.420> it's<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.720> daytime

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
encourage some spawns it's it is daytime

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.109 
encourage some spawns it's it is daytime
there<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.560> go<00:01:10.710> we've<00:01:10.890> got<00:01:11.189> plenty<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.790> spawns

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
there we go we've got plenty of spawns

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.140 
there we go we've got plenty of spawns
happening<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:14.970> guys

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
happening so there you go guys

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.359 
happening so there you go guys
conclusive<00:01:15.990> proof<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.259> mobs<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.830> spawn<00:01:17.159> on

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
conclusive proof that mobs can spawn on

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
conclusive proof that mobs can spawn on
wooden<00:01:17.759> pressure<00:01:18.000> plates<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.990> we'll<00:01:19.110> test

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
wooden pressure plates so we'll test

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.719 
wooden pressure plates so we'll test
stone<00:01:19.710> ones<00:01:19.979> next<00:01:21.890> alright<00:01:22.890> guys<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
stone ones next alright guys so just to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.490 
stone ones next alright guys so just to
prove<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.320> are

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
prove it as you can see there are

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.630 
prove it as you can see there are
pressure<00:01:25.799> plates<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.369> all<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.360> these<00:01:27.570> pads

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
pressure plates on all of these pads

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.039 
pressure plates on all of these pads
completely<00:01:29.640> covering<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.180> surface<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
completely covering the surface of the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.530 
completely covering the surface of the
pad<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.780> head<00:01:34.290> back<00:01:35.210> should<00:01:36.210> probably<00:01:36.360> use

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
pad so now head back should probably use

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.569 
pad so now head back should probably use
my<00:01:36.659> glass<00:01:36.869> walkways<00:01:37.350> we'll<00:01:37.920> head<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
my glass walkways we'll head back and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:49.400 
my glass walkways we'll head back and
we'll<00:01:39.540> test<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.049> see<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:41.420> mobs<00:01:42.420> spawn

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.290 

and<00:01:50.410> they<00:01:50.620> get<00:01:50.800> almost<00:01:51.400> instantly<00:01:52.000> we<00:01:52.150> had

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
and they get almost instantly we had

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.880 
and they get almost instantly we had
spawns<00:01:52.630> up<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.960> back<00:01:53.110> guys<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:53.560> just<00:01:53.590> move

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
spawns up the back guys I just move

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.340 
spawns up the back guys I just move
around<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.550> make<00:01:54.700> sure<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:56.020> gets<00:01:56.110> them

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
around and make sure it gets them

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.480 
around and make sure it gets them
elsewhere

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.240 

as<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.790> can<00:02:03.850> see<00:02:04.030> guys<00:02:04.650> both<00:02:05.650> types<00:02:06.070> of

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
as you can see guys both types of

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.050 
as you can see guys both types of
pressure<00:02:06.430> plates<00:02:06.730> do<00:02:07.030> indeed<00:02:07.510> spawn<00:02:08.020> mobs<00:02:09.060> all

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
pressure plates do indeed spawn mobs all

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.940 
pressure plates do indeed spawn mobs all
right<00:02:10.210> guys<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:10.630> with<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:10.869> testing<00:02:11.320> done<00:02:11.560> we

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
right guys so with that testing done we

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.100 
right guys so with that testing done we
can<00:02:12.130> now<00:02:12.280> check<00:02:12.580> both<00:02:12.910> stone<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.810> wooden

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
can now check both stone and wooden

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.750 
can now check both stone and wooden
pressure<00:02:14.380> plates<00:02:14.740> into<00:02:15.070> our<00:02:15.190> spawn<00:02:15.490> or<00:02:15.640> ball

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
pressure plates into our spawn or ball

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.210 
pressure plates into our spawn or ball
box<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.270> our<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.570> do<00:02:16.750> wall<00:02:17.020> room<00:02:17.350> now<00:02:18.190> this

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220
