barrels<00:02:49.040> but<00:02:49.130> move<00:02:49.280> back<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.730> actually

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
barrels but move back so you actually

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.330 
barrels but move back so you actually
kill<00:02:50.210> yourself<00:02:50.570> that<00:02:50.630> explosion<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.500> pretty

the building here knife this one here
and<00:03:16.670> basically<00:03:17.240> here<00:03:17.510> we<00:03:17.600> go<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.990> glitch<00:03:18.230> is

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
and basically here we go the glitch is

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.620 
and basically here we go the glitch is
nearly<00:03:18.740> ready<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:19.070> be<00:03:19.190> done<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.700> basically

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
nearly ready to be done and basically

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.790 
nearly ready to be done and basically
you<00:03:20.780> know<00:03:20.810> if<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.020> want<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.200> get<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.410> go<00:03:21.500> scare

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
you know if you want to get it go scare

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.110 
you know if you want to get it go scare
you<00:03:22.010> got<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.190> turn<00:03:22.280> into<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.489> ghost<00:03:22.760> yourself

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
you got to turn into a ghost yourself

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.910 
you got to turn into a ghost yourself
and<00:03:23.330> die<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.870> like<00:03:24.260> he<00:03:24.380> could<00:03:24.560> die<00:03:24.680> on<00:03:24.709> this

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
and die and like he could die on this

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.530 
and die and like he could die on this
map<00:03:25.160> here<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.580> by<00:03:25.820> basically<00:03:26.120> hanging

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
map here is by basically hanging

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.560 
map here is by basically hanging
yourself<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.550> will<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.760> basically<00:03:29.000> do<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.540> a

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570
