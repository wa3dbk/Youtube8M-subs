00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
going to change this out because we're

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.430 
going to change this out because we're
kind<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:32.640> enduro<00:00:32.940> position<00:00:33.450> now<00:00:33.600> not

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
kind of in an enduro position now not

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.750 
kind of in an enduro position now not
the<00:00:34.620> best<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> flatter<00:00:35.280> trails<00:00:35.579> around

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the best for the flatter trails around

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
the best for the flatter trails around
here<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.120> we're<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> move<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
here so we're going to move that to a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.970 
here so we're going to move that to a
more<00:00:36.989> neutral

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
more neutral

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.940 
more neutral
to<00:00:38.160> get<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> better<00:00:38.670> router<00:00:38.910> view<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.200> just

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
to get a better router view so we just

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.490 
to get a better router view so we just
take<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.460> whole<00:00:41.850> top<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.470> middle<00:00:45.350> push<00:00:46.350> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
take the whole top of the middle push it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.150 
take the whole top of the middle push it
through<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.440> pulls<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:49.920> both

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
through and that that pulls out both

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160 
through and that that pulls out both
ships<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.120> there's<00:00:51.360> all<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.720> can<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
ships and there's all you can see the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.720 
ships and there's all you can see the
suspension<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> angles<00:00:53.220> every<00:00:53.489> Potter

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
suspension the angles every Potter

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.189 
suspension the angles every Potter
bracket<00:00:54.089> height<00:00:54.239> everything<00:00:54.720> moving

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
bracket height everything moving

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.720 
bracket height everything moving
there's<00:00:55.860> there's<00:00:56.160> our<00:00:56.309> cross<00:00:56.519> country

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
there's there's our cross country

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.570 
there's there's our cross country
position<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.449> there's<00:00:57.629> enduro<00:00:58.019> so<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.460> we

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
position that there's enduro so so we

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.920 
position that there's enduro so so we
have<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> much<00:01:00.390> difference<00:01:00.780> in

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
have we have that much difference in

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.700 
have we have that much difference in
just<00:01:01.170> Rock<00:01:02.040> position<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.050> but<00:01:04.050> we're<00:01:04.199> going

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
just Rock position that but we're going

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:17.790 
just Rock position that but we're going
to<00:01:04.860> take<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.940> push<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.890> chip<00:01:07.890> out

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.560 

oh<00:01:19.620> there's<00:01:20.620> the<00:01:20.740> big<00:01:20.890> chip<00:01:21.160> any<00:01:22.000> position

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
oh there's the big chip any position

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.550 
oh there's the big chip any position
will<00:01:22.690> let<00:01:22.840> us<00:01:22.930> put<00:01:23.110> it<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.440> center

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
will let us put it to the center

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.160 
will let us put it to the center
position<00:01:23.800> which<00:01:24.190> is<00:01:24.340> neutral<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.840> we<00:01:25.900> can<00:01:26.050> put

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
position which is neutral so we can put

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.230 
position which is neutral so we can put
the<00:01:26.260> big<00:01:26.410> ship<00:01:26.620> back<00:01:26.800> in<00:01:27.010> we'll<00:01:27.700> rotate<00:01:27.910> that

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
the big ship back in we'll rotate that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.480 
the big ship back in we'll rotate that
to<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.750> neutral<00:01:29.380> middle<00:01:29.680> position<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:35.490> slide

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
to the neutral middle position and slide

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.030 
to the neutral middle position and slide
that<00:01:36.730> back<00:01:36.880> through<00:01:37.410> knock<00:01:38.410> it<00:01:38.560> back<00:01:38.590> in<00:01:38.920> when

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
that back through knock it back in when

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.830 
that back through knock it back in when
you<00:01:39.130> knock<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.280> out<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:40.180> other<00:01:40.630> comes

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
you knock it out the other comes

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.950 
you knock it out the other comes
out<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.650> we<00:01:41.830> can<00:01:42.010> take<00:01:42.160> that<00:01:42.340> one<00:01:42.840> rotate<00:01:43.840> it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
out and we can take that one rotate it

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.800 
out and we can take that one rotate it
to<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.080> middle<00:01:44.350> position<00:01:45.510> take<00:01:46.510> it<00:01:46.630> back<00:01:46.840> in<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
to a middle position take it back in and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.360 
to a middle position take it back in and
then<00:01:50.530> lay<00:01:50.710> butch<00:01:51.550> back<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:53.800> we're<00:01:53.980> ready<00:01:54.280> to

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.260 
then this is a cable here that you could
adjust<00:02:10.440> your<00:02:11.440> physicians<00:02:12.040> by<00:02:12.820> on<00:02:13.060> trail

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
adjust your physicians by on trail

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.270 
adjust your physicians by on trail
distance<00:02:13.660> okay<00:02:14.170> by<00:02:14.470> one<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.710> these<00:02:14.800> levers<00:02:15.040> up

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
distance okay by one of these levers up

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.510 
distance okay by one of these levers up
top<00:02:15.490> chip<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.440> now<00:02:17.800> we<00:02:17.860> are<00:02:18.160> in<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.370> neutral

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
top chip so now we are in the neutral

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.200 
top chip so now we are in the neutral
position

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
position

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.630 
position
so<00:02:19.570> it's<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.050> guy<00:02:20.530> your<00:02:20.740> average<00:02:21.100> shock<00:02:21.340> rate

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
so it's a guy your average shock rate

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.430 
so it's a guy your average shock rate
and<00:02:21.850> an<00:02:22.750> average<00:02:23.290> our<00:02:24.010> favorite<00:02:24.610> um<00:02:25.440> geometry

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
and an average our favorite um geometry

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.570 
and an average our favorite um geometry
essentially<00:02:27.330> there<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.420> go
