you<00:02:08.799> have<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.039> make<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.190> 16<00:02:09.610> set<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:09.880> days<00:02:10.030> is

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
you have to make a 16 set of days is

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.390 
you have to make a 16 set of days is
like<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:11.049> it's<00:02:11.290> basically<00:02:11.590> an<00:02:11.739> extended<00:02:12.220> 10

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
like this it's basically an extended 10

sided dice they're there they're cool to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.050 
sided dice they're there they're cool to
have<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.709> know<00:02:14.830> for<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.100> sake<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.400> having

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
have you know for the sake of having

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.000 
have you know for the sake of having
them<00:02:16.390> although<00:02:16.900> they're<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.319> as<00:02:17.410> nice<00:02:17.590> as<00:02:17.799> the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
them although they're not as nice as the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.460 
them although they're not as nice as the
the<00:02:18.190> 14<00:02:18.610> sided<00:02:18.970> or<00:02:19.090> even<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.569> 18<00:02:19.930> side<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.319> days

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
the 14 sided or even the 18 side of days

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.890 
the 14 sided or even the 18 side of days
which<00:02:21.130> are<00:02:21.310> essentially<00:02:21.880> an<00:02:22.000> upgrade<00:02:22.360> at<00:02:22.480> 14

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
which are essentially an upgrade at 14

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.839 
which are essentially an upgrade at 14
side<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.200> days<00:02:23.319> they<00:02:23.530> also<00:02:23.709> roll<00:02:24.190> really

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
side of days they also roll really

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.630 
side of days they also roll really
really<00:02:25.000> well<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.750> then<00:02:26.680> need<00:02:26.950> 20-sided<00:02:27.370> dice

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
really well and then need 20-sided dice

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.670 
really well and then need 20-sided dice
which<00:02:27.850> most<00:02:28.120> anybody<00:02:28.600> who's<00:02:29.170> ever<00:02:29.350> played<00:02:29.440> any

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
which most anybody who's ever played any

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.979 
which most anybody who's ever played any
role<00:02:29.769> playing<00:02:30.160> game<00:02:30.400> knows<00:02:31.000> what<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.570> 20-sided

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
role playing game knows what a 20-sided

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.170 
role playing game knows what a 20-sided
die<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:33.280> each<00:02:33.400> player<00:02:33.609> starts<00:02:33.640> out<00:02:34.090> with

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
die is so each player starts out with

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.900 
die is so each player starts out with
three<00:02:34.510> dice<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.049> so<00:02:35.500> what<00:02:35.680> you'll<00:02:35.890> do<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.370> your

three dice and so what you'll do on your

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.509 
three dice and so what you'll do on your
turn<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.930> roll<00:02:38.170> dice<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.010> roll<00:02:39.370> these

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
turn is you roll dice so I roll these

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.550 
turn is you roll dice so I roll these
dice<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.970> I've<00:02:40.120> rolled<00:02:40.299> now<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.230> this

and<00:03:11.350> A<00:03:11.410> three<00:03:11.440> well<00:03:11.980> that's<00:03:12.190> easy<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:13.060> means

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
and A three well that's easy that means

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.759 
and A three well that's easy that means
a<00:03:13.359> ten<00:03:13.569> sided<00:03:13.959> die<00:03:14.109> is<00:03:14.170> added<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.560> my

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
a ten sided die is added to my

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.379 
a ten sided die is added to my
collection<00:03:14.829> a<00:03:15.519> six<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.720> five<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:16.989> six<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.829> A<00:03:17.950> five

collection a six a five a six and A five

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.110 
collection a six a five a six and A five
that<00:03:19.389> seems<00:03:19.660> pretty<00:03:19.750> obvious<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.350> me<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:21.120> could

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
that seems pretty obvious to me I could

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.650 
that seems pretty obvious to me I could
take<00:03:22.329> it<00:03:22.359> 12<00:03:22.780> into<00:03:23.019> 10<00:03:23.489> but<00:03:24.489> uh<00:03:24.519> why<00:03:25.450> don't<00:03:25.510> we

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
take it 12 into 10 but uh why don't we

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.370 
take it 12 into 10 but uh why don't we
jump<00:03:26.049> up<00:03:26.260> here<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.739> take<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:28.090> 10<00:03:28.720> plus<00:03:29.049> 6

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
jump up here and take the 10 plus 6

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.830 
jump up here and take the 10 plus 6
which<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.799> 16<00:03:30.400> sided<00:03:30.790> die<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.209> then<00:03:31.630> use

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
which is a 16 sided die and then use

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.840 
which is a 16 sided die and then use
this<00:03:32.079> 6<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:32.560> add<00:03:32.650> another<00:03:32.889> six<00:03:33.310> sided<00:03:33.579> die<00:03:33.790> to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
this 6 and add another six sided die to

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.540 
this 6 and add another six sided die to
my<00:03:34.150> my<00:03:34.840> mix

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
my my mix

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.310 
my my mix
I<00:03:35.640> think<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.060> would<00:03:36.210> be<00:03:36.270> better<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.200> now<00:03:37.290> i

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
I think that would be better so now i

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.800 
I think that would be better so now i
have<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.470> 13<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.190> seven<00:03:38.670> which<00:03:39.420> gives<00:03:39.660> me<00:03:39.780> a

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
have a 13 and a seven which gives me a

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
have a 13 and a seven which gives me a
20<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.640> 4<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.910> 2<00:03:41.940> gives<00:03:42.720> me<00:03:42.870> another<00:03:43.050> six<00:03:43.500> and

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
20 a 4 and a 2 gives me another six and

a 5 and a 3 gives me an eight hooray and
this<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.810> what<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.020> keep<00:03:49.170> doing<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.830> keep

this is what you keep doing you keep
doing<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> game<00:03:50.580> until<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.090> get<00:03:51.300> three

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
doing the game until you get three

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.680 
doing the game until you get three
20-sided<00:03:53.040> dice<00:03:53.490> once<00:03:54.300> you<00:03:54.390> have<00:03:54.480> three

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
20-sided dice once you have three

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.390 
20-sided dice once you have three
20-sided<00:03:55.080> dice<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.500> win<00:03:55.680> now<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:55.950> could<00:03:56.250> make

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
20-sided dice you win now you could make

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.430 
20-sided dice you win now you could make
the<00:03:56.550> game<00:03:56.700> more<00:03:56.960> difficult<00:03:57.960> you<00:03:58.170> could<00:03:58.320> add

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
the game more difficult you could add

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.150 
the game more difficult you could add
dice<00:03:58.710> that<00:03:58.920> are<00:03:59.040> higher<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.640> don't<00:04:00.630> have<00:04:00.900> any<00:04:01.160> 22

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
dice that are higher I don't have any 22

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.030 
dice that are higher I don't have any 22
or<00:04:02.400> 24<00:04:02.820> s<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.150> wish<00:04:03.330> I<00:04:03.450> did<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.740> could<00:04:04.890> also

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
or 24 s I wish I did but you could also

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.400 
or 24 s I wish I did but you could also
go<00:04:05.280> up<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.490> 30<00:04:05.760> s<00:04:05.910> or<00:04:06.120> if<00:04:06.210> you're<00:04:06.390> really<00:04:06.930> insane

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
go up to 30 s or if you're really insane

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.840 
go up to 30 s or if you're really insane
i<00:04:07.620> guess<00:04:07.740> you<00:04:07.860> could<00:04:07.920> add<00:04:08.070> 100<00:04:08.430> set<00:04:08.580> of<00:04:08.670> diet

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
i guess you could add 100 set of diet

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.040 
i guess you could add 100 set of diet
but<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.090> doesn't<00:04:09.330> make<00:04:09.390> any<00:04:09.570> sense<00:04:09.750> at<00:04:09.930> all

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
but that doesn't make any sense at all

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.680 
but that doesn't make any sense at all
but<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.070> is<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:11.790> really<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.150> simple<00:04:12.390> game

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
but this is this is really a simple game

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.720 
but this is this is really a simple game
you're<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.050> using<00:04:13.200> dice<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.860> get<00:04:14.070> other<00:04:14.310> dice

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
you're just using dice to get other dice

you're just using dice to get other dice
now<00:04:15.510> really<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.170> a<00:04:16.200> win-win<00:04:16.670> because

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
now really this is a win-win because

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.759 
now really this is a win-win because
even<00:04:18.120> if<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:18.239> think<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.810> game<00:04:19.019> is<00:04:19.080> not<00:04:19.500> that

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
don't even think the rules really even

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.909 
don't even think the rules really even
even<00:04:59.730> cover<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.330> oh<00:05:00.540> no<00:05:01.200> if<00:05:01.380> everyone<00:05:01.500> loses

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
even cover that oh no if everyone loses

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.190 
even cover that oh no if everyone loses
all<00:05:02.130> their<00:05:02.280> dice<00:05:02.460> then<00:05:02.850> then<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:04.050> other

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
all their dice then then the other

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.000 
all their dice then then the other
people<00:05:04.560> win<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:06.169> okay<00:05:07.169> but<00:05:07.650> that's<00:05:07.740> that's

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
people win so okay but that's that's

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.890 
people win so okay but that's that's
kind<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.370> just<00:05:08.580> luck<00:05:09.060> but<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.419> game<00:05:09.570> is<00:05:09.750> all

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
kind of just luck but the game is all

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.750 
kind of just luck but the game is all
about<00:05:09.930> luck<00:05:10.290> so<00:05:10.530> look<00:05:11.010> I'm<00:05:11.340> going<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.640> say<00:05:11.730> this

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
that's that's actually kind of leaning

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.100 
that's that's actually kind of leaning
towards<00:05:17.910> me<00:05:18.000> not<00:05:18.210> really<00:05:18.510> like<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.840> game<00:05:18.960> up
