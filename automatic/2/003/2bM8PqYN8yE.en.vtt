00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
first brake light pulsar was created out

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.779 
first brake light pulsar was created out
of<00:00:14.790> necessity<00:00:15.379> our<00:00:16.379> Roasters<00:00:16.980> sits<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.550> low<00:00:17.730> to

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
of necessity our Roasters sits so low to

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.150 
of necessity our Roasters sits so low to

lighting<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.180> do<00:00:21.390> that's<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.930> to

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
lighting that we can do that's going to

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.259 
lighting that we can do that's going to
draw<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.830> attention<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> driver<00:00:23.910> behind

the car the better off we're gonna be

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.279 
the car the better off we're gonna be
we've<00:00:26.910> actually<00:00:27.150> had<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> few<00:00:27.570> club<00:00:27.990> members

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
we've actually had a few club members

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.380 
we've actually had a few club members
across<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> country<00:00:29.179> they've<00:00:30.179> been

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
across the country they've been

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020 
across the country they've been
rear-ended<00:00:30.990> because<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.130> car<00:00:32.369> sits<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.850> low

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
rear-ended because the car sits so low

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.299

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
hard time seeing us as oddly is that

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.069 
hard time seeing us as oddly is that
ours<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.190> cool<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.610> these<00:00:38.790> cars<00:00:39.059> look<00:00:39.360> so

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
ours or as cool as these cars look so

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.170 
ours or as cool as these cars look so
you<00:00:40.890> know<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> first<00:00:41.309> brake<00:00:41.579> light<00:00:41.790> pulsar

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you know the first brake light pulsar

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
you know the first brake light pulsar
was<00:00:42.360> great<00:00:42.660> he<00:00:42.989> stepped<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> brake<00:00:43.739> pedal

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
was great he stepped on the brake pedal

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.680 
was great he stepped on the brake pedal
and<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> third<00:00:44.579> brake<00:00:44.820> light<00:00:44.850> would<00:00:45.300> flash

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and the third brake light would flash

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.569 
and the third brake light would flash
three<00:00:46.350> times<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.219> would<00:00:47.340> stay<00:00:47.550> on

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
three times and then it would stay on

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.700 
three times and then it would stay on
and<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.870> would<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.289> every<00:00:49.469> time<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and it would do that every time you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
and it would do that every time you
stepped<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> brake<00:00:50.370> we've<00:00:50.879> taken<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
stepped on the brake we've taken that a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.729 
stepped on the brake we've taken that a
step<00:00:51.420> further<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.110> our<00:00:52.140> second<00:00:52.649> generation

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
step further with our second generation

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.720 
step further with our second generation
module<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.800> new<00:00:55.949> module<00:00:56.190> is

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
module as you can see the new module is

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.060 
module as you can see the new module is
a<00:00:56.820> little<00:00:57.149> bit<00:00:57.270> larger<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.890> got<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
a little bit larger but it's got a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.250 
a little bit larger but it's got a
little<00:00:59.309> knob<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.690> 10<00:01:00.930> different

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
little knob here with 10 different

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
little knob here with 10 different
settings<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.160> that's<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> allow

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
settings and what that's going to allow

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.910 
settings and what that's going to allow
you<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.449> choose<00:01:04.080> from<00:01:04.320> 10<00:01:04.710> different

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
you to do is choose from 10 different

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.660 
you to do is choose from 10 different
styles<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.970> 3rd<00:01:06.780> brake<00:01:07.110> light<00:01:07.170> flashing<00:01:08.040> it'll

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
styles of 3rd brake light flashing it'll

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.789 
styles of 3rd brake light flashing it'll
do<00:01:08.850> everything<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.170> first<00:01:10.439> brake

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
do everything that the the first brake

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.500 
do everything that the the first brake
light<00:01:10.979> module<00:01:11.369> did<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:11.760> was<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.150> step<00:01:12.360> on

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
light module did which was you step on

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.390 
light module did which was you step on
the<00:01:12.600> brake<00:01:12.810> pedal<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.439> flashes<00:01:13.950> three<00:01:14.130> times

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the brake pedal it flashes three times

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.760 
the brake pedal it flashes three times
and<00:01:14.610> then<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.790> stays<00:01:15.030> lit<00:01:15.299> too<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.470> one<00:01:16.650> will

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and then it stays lit too this one will

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.800 
and then it stays lit too this one will
actually<00:01:17.100> strobe<00:01:17.880> it'll<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.420> continually

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
actually strobe it'll just continually

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.440 
actually strobe it'll just continually
strobe<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.830> third<00:01:20.100> brake<00:01:20.369> light<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:21.180> long<00:01:21.330> as

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
strobe the third brake light as long as

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510 
strobe the third brake light as long as
you<00:01:21.540> step<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> pedal<00:01:21.990> too<00:01:22.470> it'll<00:01:22.680> flash

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you step on the pedal too it'll flash

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.130 
you step on the pedal too it'll flash
seven<00:01:23.970> times<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.540> it'll<00:01:24.659> stay<00:01:24.869> lit

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
seven times and then it'll stay lit

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.770 
seven times and then it'll stay lit
it'll<00:01:25.439> flash<00:01:25.680> five<00:01:26.009> times<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.580> stay<00:01:26.790> lit<00:01:27.030> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it'll flash five times and stay lit this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.590 
it'll flash five times and stay lit this
is<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.200> really<00:01:28.500> versatile<00:01:29.600> application

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
is just a really versatile application

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.649 
is just a really versatile application
and<00:01:31.259> again<00:01:31.590> anything<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and again anything that we can do to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
and again anything that we can do to
increase<00:01:34.259> visibility<00:01:34.500> behind<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.430> Roadster

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
increase visibility behind the Roadster

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.850 
increase visibility behind the Roadster
the<00:01:36.540> better<00:01:36.750> off<00:01:36.960> we're<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.290> gonna<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.770> the
