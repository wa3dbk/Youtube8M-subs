actually<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.430> enjoyable<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.360> play<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.570> didn't

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
actually very enjoyable to play I didn't

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
actually very enjoyable to play I didn't
get<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> kills<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.039> game<00:00:59.190> only

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
get a lot of kills because the game only

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.700 
get a lot of kills because the game only
goes<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.730> 100<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.199> fast<00:01:01.410> paced

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
goes to 100 but it was really fast paced

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.500 
goes to 100 but it was really fast paced
and<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.070> all<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> mats<00:01:02.640> were<00:01:02.820> sort<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.300> that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and if all the mats were sort of that

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.390 
and if all the mats were sort of that
kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.809> size<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.379> think<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.040> game<00:01:05.220> would

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
kind of size I think this game would

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.350 
kind of size I think this game would
actually<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> very<00:01:06.210> very<00:01:06.450> good<00:01:06.720> game<00:01:07.130> now

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
actually be a very very good game now

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.570 
actually be a very very good game now
when<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> mean<00:01:09.659> by<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> maps<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.560> they<00:01:11.369> just

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
when I mean by the maps how they just

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.310 
when I mean by the maps how they just
don't<00:01:11.760> play<00:01:11.939> quickly<00:01:12.210> there's<00:01:12.510> no<00:01:12.869> flow<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
don't play quickly there's no flow to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.170 
don't play quickly there's no flow to
the<00:01:13.590> maps<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> guys<00:01:14.250> ever<00:01:14.549> remember<00:01:15.030> they

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the maps if you guys ever remember they

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.310 
the maps if you guys ever remember they
said<00:01:15.390> they're<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> change<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> map

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
said they're going to change the map

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
said they're going to change the map
layout<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:17.070> call<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.520> duty<00:01:17.610> ghosts<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.420> what

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
layout in call of duty ghosts and what

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.469 
layout in call of duty ghosts and what
that<00:01:18.780> means<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.380> instead<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> old<00:01:20.580> H<00:01:21.030> style

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that means is instead of the old H style

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.580 
that means is instead of the old H style
of<00:01:21.720> maps<00:01:22.310> symmetrical<00:01:23.310> shit<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.909> that

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
of maps symmetrical shit like that

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.190 
of maps symmetrical shit like that
they're<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.070> giant<00:01:26.729> circle<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> bunch

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
they're just a giant circle with a bunch

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.740 
they're just a giant circle with a bunch
of<00:01:28.320> routes<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.860> take<00:01:29.009> which<00:01:29.430> actually

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
of routes you can take which actually

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.370 
of routes you can take which actually
slows<00:01:30.750> down<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> game<00:01:31.170> play<00:01:31.579> extremely

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
slows down the game play extremely

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.670 
slows down the game play extremely
extremely<00:01:34.380> slow<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:36.079> don't<00:01:37.079> know<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.409> I'm

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
extremely slow I don't know because I'm

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.520 
extremely slow I don't know because I'm

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
four different routes and the spawn

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.530 
four different routes and the spawn
systems<00:03:25.570> are<00:03:25.690> kind<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.200> iffy<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:27.610> think<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.300> can

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
systems are kind of iffy I think you can

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.110 
systems are kind of iffy I think you can
spawn<00:03:28.840> trap<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.770> spawns<00:03:30.400> are<00:03:30.580> really<00:03:30.910> really

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
spawn trap that spawns are really really

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.820 
spawn trap that spawns are really really
white<00:03:31.450> like<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.050> said<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.290> maps<00:03:32.500> are<00:03:32.620> really

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
white like I said the maps are really

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.330 
white like I said the maps are really
really<00:03:33.070> big<00:03:33.280> guys<00:03:33.459> so<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.150> spawns<00:03:34.480> are<00:03:34.720> really

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
really big guys so the spawns are really

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.980 
really big guys so the spawns are really
far<00:03:36.340> spread<00:03:36.730> out<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.120> can<00:03:37.240> kill<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.480> guy<00:03:37.720> and

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
far spread out so you can kill a guy and

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.010 
far spread out so you can kill a guy and
then<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.680> guy<00:03:38.830> can<00:03:39.040> spot<00:03:39.280> behind<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.850> so<00:03:40.090> the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
then a guy can spot behind you so the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.420 
then a guy can spot behind you so the
biggest<00:03:41.350> letdown<00:03:41.650> one<00:03:41.770> goes<00:03:41.950> right<00:03:42.160> now<00:03:42.280> is
