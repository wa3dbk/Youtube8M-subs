00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.610 
headband and I actually DIY this a
couple<00:00:14.059> months<00:00:14.210> ago<00:00:14.420> but<00:00:14.540> I<00:00:14.809> wanted<00:00:15.139> to<00:00:15.200> reuse

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
couple months ago but I wanted to reuse

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.040 
couple months ago but I wanted to reuse
it<00:00:15.860> before<00:00:16.520> I<00:00:16.550> destroy<00:00:17.029> it<00:00:17.240> you'll<00:00:17.599> see<00:00:17.869> later

it before I destroy it you'll see later
but<00:00:18.529> I<00:00:18.740> thought<00:00:19.189> I<00:00:19.369> would<00:00:19.430> just<00:00:19.700> try<00:00:19.880> to<00:00:19.910> come

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
but I thought I would just try to come

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.720 
but I thought I would just try to come
up<00:00:20.210> with<00:00:20.390> some<00:00:20.810> you<00:00:21.410> know<00:00:21.439> hairstyles<00:00:22.340> with

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
up with some you know hairstyles with

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.420 
up with some you know hairstyles with
this<00:00:22.970> piece<00:00:23.330> before<00:00:23.630> I<00:00:23.900> take<00:00:24.289> it<00:00:24.439> apart<00:00:24.740> so

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
this piece before I take it apart so

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.910 
this piece before I take it apart so
first<00:00:26.119> I'm<00:00:26.330> going<00:00:26.539> to<00:00:26.750> pull<00:00:27.050> my<00:00:27.230> hair<00:00:27.529> to<00:00:27.769> one

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
first I'm going to pull my hair to one

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.920 
first I'm going to pull my hair to one
side<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.550> I'm<00:00:28.640> just<00:00:28.849> simply<00:00:29.300> going<00:00:29.330> to<00:00:29.720> eat

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
side and I'm just simply going to eat

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.229 
side and I'm just simply going to eat
braiding<00:00:30.470> it<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:30.859> I<00:00:31.279> think<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:31.699> effect<00:00:32.059> with

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
braiding it and I think the effect with

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.700 
braiding it and I think the effect with
the<00:00:32.269> chains<00:00:32.660> going<00:00:33.019> out<00:00:33.260> throughout<00:00:33.620> the

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
the chains going out throughout the

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.380 
the chains going out throughout the
braid<00:00:34.070> is<00:00:34.370> really<00:00:34.820> cool<00:00:35.150> and<00:00:35.420> really<00:00:35.449> pretty

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
braid is really cool and really pretty

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.969 
braid is really cool and really pretty
and<00:00:38.390> by<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.629> way<00:00:38.809> can<00:00:39.019> we<00:00:39.049> just<00:00:39.110> talk<00:00:39.379> about

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:39.979 
and by the way can we just talk about

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:41.969 
and by the way can we just talk about
the<00:00:40.309> lighting<00:00:40.519> a<00:00:40.760> little<00:00:41.030> bit<00:00:41.180> here<00:00:41.479> I

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:41.979
