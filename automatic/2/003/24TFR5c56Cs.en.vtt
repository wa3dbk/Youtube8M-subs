Tiffany I decided to
sketches<00:00:12.050> on<00:00:12.200> lips<00:00:12.470> in<00:00:12.740> my<00:00:13.010> pen<00:00:13.250> doodles<00:00:13.809> so

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
sketches on lips in my pen doodles so

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.890 
sketches on lips in my pen doodles so
I'm<00:00:14.900> using<00:00:15.080> a<00:00:15.230> ballpoint<00:00:15.470> pen<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.720> I<00:00:17.720> with

I'm using a ballpoint pen and I with
black<00:00:18.140> ink<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:19.779> I'm<00:00:20.779> beginning<00:00:21.320> my<00:00:21.640> lip

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
black ink and I'm beginning my lip

sketch by lightly sketching in my guide

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.109 
sketch by lightly sketching in my guide
lines<00:00:27.070> so<00:00:28.070> I'm<00:00:28.160> drawing<00:00:28.430> the<00:00:28.640> shape<00:00:28.849> of<00:00:29.000> the

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
lines so I'm drawing the shape of the

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.010 
lines so I'm drawing the shape of the
lips<00:00:29.300> first<00:00:30.340> all<00:00:31.340> I<00:00:31.400> need<00:00:31.669> is<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.660> upper

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
lips first all I need is the the upper

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.250 
lips first all I need is the the upper
line<00:00:33.380> and<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:34.310> lower<00:00:34.700> lip<00:00:34.940> line<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.480> it<00:00:36.050> kind

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
line and the lower lip line and it kind

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.810 
line and the lower lip line and it kind
of<00:00:36.320> look<00:00:36.560> like<00:00:36.590> a<00:00:36.770> little<00:00:37.070> bit<00:00:37.250> of<00:00:37.340> an<00:00:37.460> almond

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
of look like a little bit of an almond

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.770 
of look like a little bit of an almond
shape<00:00:37.850> or<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.329> leaf<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:40.120> I'm<00:00:41.120> adding<00:00:41.510> the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
shape or a leaf and I'm adding the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.180 
shape or a leaf and I'm adding the
ridges<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:42.559> go<00:00:43.270> vertical<00:00:44.270> on<00:00:45.010> both<00:00:46.010> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
ridges that go vertical on both the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:56.520 
ridges that go vertical on both the
upper<00:00:46.520> lips<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:47.210> a<00:00:47.450> lower<00:00:47.750> lips

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.729 

now<00:00:57.100> you<00:00:57.160> see<00:00:57.490> I'm<00:00:57.580> going<00:00:57.910> really<00:00:58.570> light<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
now you see I'm going really light the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.340 
now you see I'm going really light the
midsection<00:01:03.489> of<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.640> lips<00:01:03.970> were<00:01:04.900> that<00:01:05.199> let's

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
midsection of the lips were that let's

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.000 
midsection of the lips were that let's
divide<00:01:05.710> or<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.729> opening<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.390> mouth<00:01:08.010> that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
divide or the opening of the mouth that

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.890 
divide or the opening of the mouth that
line<00:01:09.280> will<00:01:09.520> be<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.700> little<00:01:09.940> bit<00:01:10.060> heavier<00:01:10.420> when<00:01:10.750> I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
line will be a little bit heavier when I

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.000 
line will be a little bit heavier when I
shake<00:01:11.110> they're<00:01:12.300> here<00:01:13.300> I'm<00:01:13.420> drawing<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
shake they're here I'm drawing the the

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.859 
shake they're here I'm drawing the the
upper<00:01:15.310> lip<00:01:15.490> line<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:18.150> making<00:01:19.150> sure<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.630> my

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
upper lip line and making sure that my

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.190 
upper lip line and making sure that my
Cupid's<00:01:20.770> bow<00:01:20.979> which<00:01:21.340> is<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.729> very<00:01:22.420> metal<00:01:22.840> top

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
Cupid's bow which is the very metal top

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.690 
Cupid's bow which is the very metal top
part<00:01:23.500> of<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.920> upper<00:01:24.220> lip

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
part of the upper lip

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.750 
part of the upper lip
tom<00:01:25.479> has<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.750> v-shape<00:01:26.410> but<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.340> want<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.729> don't

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
tom has a v-shape but I want I don't

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.730 
tom has a v-shape but I want I don't
want<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.150> be<00:01:28.300> a<00:01:28.330> strong<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.720> shape<00:01:29.140> I'm<00:01:29.320> going<00:01:29.380> to

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
want to be a strong a shape I'm going to

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.420 
want to be a strong a shape I'm going to
make<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.009> little<00:01:30.070> bit<00:01:30.280> smoother<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:33.250> did

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
make it a little bit smoother and I did

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.730 
make it a little bit smoother and I did
a<00:01:33.460> little<00:01:33.670> bit<00:01:33.790> of<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:34.030> some<00:01:34.780> shading<00:01:35.229> or<00:01:35.410> dark

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
a little bit of a some shading or dark

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.760 
a little bit of a some shading or dark
shading<00:01:36.330> to<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.479> corner<00:01:37.899> of<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.259> mouth<00:01:38.380> all

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
shading to the corner of the mouth all

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.760 
shading to the corner of the mouth all
right<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:43.180> now<00:01:43.330> I'm<00:01:43.509> adding<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.869> dark<00:01:44.200> shadow<00:01:44.560> to

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
right so now I'm adding a dark shadow to

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.840 
right so now I'm adding a dark shadow to
the<00:01:45.990> dividing<00:01:46.990> line<00:01:47.440> of<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.979> upper<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:48.729> lower

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
the dividing line of the upper and lower

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.440 
the dividing line of the upper and lower
lips<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:50.520> some<00:01:51.520> more<00:01:51.700> dark<00:01:51.910> shading<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.390> the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
lips and some more dark shading to the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.649 
lips and some more dark shading to the
other<00:01:52.630> side<00:01:52.840> of<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.050> corner<00:01:53.410> of<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.590> mouth

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.719 

and<00:01:59.869> then<00:02:00.350> using<00:02:00.680> hatching<00:02:01.100> technique<00:02:01.490> for

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
and then using hatching technique for

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:25.309 
and then using hatching technique for
this<00:02:01.850> entire<00:02:02.210> drawing<00:02:02.689> or<00:02:03.200> sketch

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.390 

so<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:26.760> got<00:02:26.939> to<00:02:26.969> do<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:28.069> create<00:02:29.069> your

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
so you really got to do to create your

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.390 
so you really got to do to create your
values<00:02:29.909> with<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.239> ballpoint<00:02:30.719> pen<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.400> to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
values with a ballpoint pen is to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.809 
values with a ballpoint pen is to
lightly<00:02:32.849> graze<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.900> paper<00:02:34.430> remember<00:02:35.430> you're

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
lightly graze the paper remember you're

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.920 
lightly graze the paper remember you're
hatching<00:02:36.090> technique<00:02:36.510> which<00:02:37.439> is<00:02:38.390> short<00:02:39.390> quick

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
hatching technique which is short quick

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.890 
hatching technique which is short quick
strokes<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:41.730> are<00:02:41.790> very<00:02:42.239> very<00:02:42.599> close

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
strokes that are very very close

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.020 
strokes that are very very close
together<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:46.159> you<00:02:47.159> just<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.609> to<00:02:47.700> put<00:02:47.939> them

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
together and you just want to put them

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.979 
together and you just want to put them
in<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.269> right<00:02:48.450> places<00:02:52.730> which<00:02:53.730> means<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.840> only

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
in the right places which means you only

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.740 
in the right places which means you only
hatch<00:02:55.500> any<00:02:55.980> errors<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.340> need<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.849> be

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.649 

sketched<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.989> with<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.349> little<00:03:01.680> bit<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.889> a<00:03:01.980> tone

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
sketched in with a little bit of a tone

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.240 
sketched in with a little bit of a tone
so<00:03:03.659> I'm<00:03:03.989> building<00:03:04.230> my<00:03:04.560> tones<00:03:05.120> which<00:03:06.120> also

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
so I'm building my tones which also

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:17.360 
so I'm building my tones which also
means<00:03:08.250> I'm<00:03:08.549> also<00:03:08.760> building<00:03:09.450> up<00:03:09.659> my<00:03:09.900> shadows

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.660 

so<00:03:17.940> when<00:03:18.120> you're<00:03:18.300> sketching<00:03:18.569> or<00:03:18.900> drawing<00:03:19.670> what

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
so when you're sketching or drawing what

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.140 
so when you're sketching or drawing what
you're<00:03:20.819> really<00:03:20.970> doing<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:22.819> really<00:03:23.819> finding

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
you're really doing is really finding

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.809 
you're really doing is really finding
out<00:03:24.330> where<00:03:24.690> your<00:03:25.290> shadows<00:03:25.890> are<00:03:26.190> it's<00:03:26.610> all

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
out where your shadows are it's all

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:36.870 
out where your shadows are it's all
light<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.239> shadow

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.880 

and<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.600> course<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.020> also<00:03:38.200> need<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:39.100> know<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
and of course you also need to know the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.080 
and of course you also need to know the
shapes<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.580> how<00:03:43.540> things<00:03:43.930> look<00:03:44.230> like<00:03:48.030> now<00:03:49.030> you

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
shapes of how things look like now you

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.340 
shapes of how things look like now you
sketch<00:03:49.660> lips<00:03:50.400> just<00:03:51.400> remember<00:03:51.940> that<00:03:52.300> lips<00:03:53.140> are

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
sketch lips just remember that lips are

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.760 
sketch lips just remember that lips are
very<00:03:53.530> organic<00:03:54.120> there's<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.270> lot<00:03:55.420> of<00:03:55.770> roundness

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
very organic there's a lot of roundness

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:04.070 
very organic there's a lot of roundness
to<00:03:57.310> them<00:04:00.060> but<00:04:01.350> break<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.500> down<00:04:02.710> into<00:04:03.010> simple

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
to them but break it down into simple

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.040 
to them but break it down into simple
shapes<00:04:05.080> at<00:04:05.410> first<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:09.250> know<00:04:09.370> how<00:04:09.580> much<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:10.050> of

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
shapes at first you know how much of of

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.440 
shapes at first you know how much of of
the<00:04:11.410> upper<00:04:11.710> lip<00:04:11.890> you're<00:04:12.790> drawing<00:04:13.090> in<00:04:13.360> the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
the upper lip you're drawing in the

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.330 
the upper lip you're drawing in the
lower<00:04:13.630> lip<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.140> if<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:16.770> use<00:04:17.770> reference

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
lower lip and if you use reference

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.420 
lower lip and if you use reference
you're<00:04:19.210> going<00:04:19.360> to<00:04:19.450> find<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:20.190> you'll<00:04:21.190> be<00:04:21.340> able

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
you're going to find that you'll be able

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:43.630 
you're going to find that you'll be able
to<00:04:21.640> draw<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.910> lot<00:04:22.270> better

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.010 

so<00:04:44.640> for<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.200> lower<00:04:46.200> part<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:46.860> lips<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:48.840> the

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
so for the lower part of the lips of the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.020 
so for the lower part of the lips of the
area<00:04:49.290> where<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.800> not<00:04:50.010> chant<00:04:50.520> begins<00:04:50.670> I

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
area where the not chant begins I

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.870 
area where the not chant begins I
just<00:04:51.480> made<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.440> little<00:04:52.860> bit<00:04:53.070> of<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.310> soft<00:04:53.580> shadow

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
just made a little bit of a soft shadow

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.150 
just made a little bit of a soft shadow
there<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:57.060> tend<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:57.840> fade<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.320> out<00:04:59.000> by<00:05:00.000> just

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
there and I tend to fade it out by just

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:22.710 
there and I tend to fade it out by just
adding<00:05:02.160> some<00:05:02.460> really<00:05:02.880> light<00:05:03.120> strokes

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.470 

he<00:05:23.200> unlikely<00:05:23.830> going<00:05:24.250> over<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.670> entire<00:05:27.480> shadow

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
he unlikely going over the entire shadow

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.620 
he unlikely going over the entire shadow
of<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.810> lip<00:05:28.990> with<00:05:29.230> some<00:05:29.830> cross<00:05:30.070> hatching

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
of the lip with some cross hatching

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.900 
of the lip with some cross hatching
again<00:05:31.630> I'm<00:05:31.750> just<00:05:31.900> grazing<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.590> paper<00:05:32.830> but<00:05:33.700> I'm

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
again I'm just grazing the paper but I'm

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:41.480 
again I'm just grazing the paper but I'm
building<00:05:34.330> up<00:05:34.480> my<00:05:34.800> my<00:05:37.110> values<00:05:38.110> in<00:05:38.440> layers<00:05:39.840> or

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
building up my my values in layers or

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.830 
building up my my values in layers or
increasing<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:43.260> my<00:05:44.260> shading<00:05:44.970> by<00:05:45.970> layering<00:05:46.390> my

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
increasing the my shading by layering my

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:55.170 
increasing the my shading by layering my
hatching<00:05:47.380> technique

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.540 

so<00:05:55.750> using<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:56.110> ballpoint<00:05:56.350> pen<00:05:57.990> or<00:05:58.990> actually

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
so using a ballpoint pen or actually

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.550 
so using a ballpoint pen or actually
help<00:06:00.550> to<00:06:00.610> improve<00:06:01.180> your<00:06:01.440> hatching<00:06:02.440> and

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
help to improve your hatching and

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.790 
help to improve your hatching and
cross-hatching<00:06:02.620> technique<00:06:04.470> it<00:06:05.470> kind<00:06:05.740> of

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
cross-hatching technique it kind of

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.880 
cross-hatching technique it kind of
forces<00:06:06.460> you<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:07.120> control<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:08.290> pen<00:06:08.530> pressure

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
forces you to control the pen pressure

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.930 
forces you to control the pen pressure
in<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:10.450> amount<00:06:10.720> of<00:06:10.870> strokes<00:06:11.610> the<00:06:12.610> tightness

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
in the amount of strokes the tightness

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.390 
in the amount of strokes the tightness
of<00:06:13.300> them<00:06:16.140> that's<00:06:17.140> all<00:06:17.350> part<00:06:17.680> of<00:06:17.860> cross

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
of them that's all part of cross

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.260 
of them that's all part of cross
hatching<00:06:18.850> and<00:06:20.250> for<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.340> final<00:06:21.730> here<00:06:22.000> I<00:06:22.210> just

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
hatching and for the final here I just

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.670 
hatching and for the final here I just
want<00:06:22.600> to<00:06:22.630> darken<00:06:22.900> via<00:06:24.510> the<00:06:25.510> shadow<00:06:25.810> part<00:06:26.350> of

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
want to darken via the shadow part of

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.480 
want to darken via the shadow part of
the<00:06:27.250> lower<00:06:27.460> lips<00:06:31.170> this<00:06:32.170> helps<00:06:32.740> to<00:06:32.860> create<00:06:33.100> more

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
the lower lips this helps to create more

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.680 
the lower lips this helps to create more
of<00:06:34.440> around<00:06:35.440> the<00:06:35.620> shape<00:06:36.060> to<00:06:37.060> the<00:06:37.090> bottom<00:06:37.540> of<00:06:37.570> the

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
of around the shape to the bottom of the

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.260 
of around the shape to the bottom of the
lips<00:06:37.900> here<00:06:38.430> but<00:06:39.430> also<00:06:39.610> want<00:06:39.910> to<00:06:39.970> be<00:06:40.030> very

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
lips here but also want to be very

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.610 
lips here but also want to be very
careful<00:06:40.570> I<00:06:41.110> can<00:06:41.500> go<00:06:41.710> to<00:06:41.890> dark<00:06:43.290> so<00:06:44.290> there<00:06:44.470> you

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
careful I can go to dark so there you

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:56.220 
careful I can go to dark so there you
have<00:06:44.650> it<00:06:44.980> a<00:06:45.190> quick<00:06:45.760> sketch<00:06:46.320> of<00:06:47.320> some<00:06:47.740> lips

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.290 

you
