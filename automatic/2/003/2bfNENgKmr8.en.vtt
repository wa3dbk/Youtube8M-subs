00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 do you still think about lobster at the end 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.390
 of the year and well today we 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.760
 let's concoct a bottom-based dish 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.980
 of lobster there will be no lobster but 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
 make lobsters lacroix we go 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.250
 use it in the dish following a 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.420
 potato mousseline with 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.609
 prawns and lobster white butter 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.670
 potatoes are already cooked and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.810
 taste is but keep some of the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.550
 baking juice for muslin 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.820
 reserve about 1/2 of the six liters of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.050
 drippings 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.430
 reduce the mashed potatoes to 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.940
 using a quick pass 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.719
 huddle potato masher you can do 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.930
 that in advance and then warm up 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.489
 your muslin did not waste anything 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:57.500
 add a half deciliter of bottom of to 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:59.820
 marc lacroix one of the six liters of cream 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.590
 mix with the mashed potatoes 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.090
 Earth 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.549
 you then get a muslin 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
 Creamy and creamy 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.510
 if you want to serve the dish 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 immediately I advise you of good 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.439
 warmed up the liquids before 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.430
 incorporate there are still some 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.930
 parts 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.640
 if you do not want it and you 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.659
 want to get even more texture 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.580
 creamy past the muslin to the Chinese 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.470
 with a spoon leaning of course 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.850
 mashed potatoes to get them through 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.020
 then season the muslin with 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.740
 a pinch of salt from the sea salt of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.400
 preference and pepper 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 do not skimp on the season 'mans 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.280
 finally add some nutmeg 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.180
 grated 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.180
 it's better when it's missed 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.579
 mix well so that all the spices 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.040
 incorporates in the mixture the muslin is 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.210
 ready for the lobster butter sauce 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.140
 I already mince the shallots I 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.750
 sprinkles with white wine 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.380
 about 1/2 deciliter I then add 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.780
 the remaining marc lacroix foundry is a 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.840
 sprig of thyme 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.220
 and I let 'reduce' without covering for 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.319
 the trim and small trim 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.850
 bread croutons white bread 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.020
 preference but you can also 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.319
 use jack pine cut out 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.660
 slices in small dice we go them 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.130
 fry in olive oil 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.220
 put the croutons in the oil 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.220
 boiling 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.239
 it smells good to finish adding 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.970
 lemon zest the lemon has to be 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:52.110
 clean thoroughly grate lemon peel 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.120
 which has a fairly fresh note removed 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.940
 the croutons of the pan to avoid 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.620
 they do not burn and dispose of them on 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.190
 a cold plate for them 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.810
 cool quickly you can 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.050
 of course do all this in advance 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.340
 let's see we are the sauce she is 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.540
 sufficiently reduced 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.000
 we will remove the branch of thyme and we 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.880
 will thicken it with butter cubes 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.959
 very cold you can cut them out at 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.250
 in advance and place them in the freezer 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.200
 reduce to low heat so that the butter 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.600
 and time to slowly melt 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.290
 in this way you will delicately 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.290
 to bind the meaning 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.939
 the source in Narbonne 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:42.140
 once all the cubes are in the 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:46.620
 sauce must be passed and seasoned 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:51.359
 with a pinch of salt a little pepper 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.189
 cayenne and the juice of half a lemon this 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:04:00.599
 even let's mention that you have grated everything to 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:04:05.730
 the hour is here to drop a big 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:09.359
 spoon of hot muslin on a 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.370
 plate have drawn a line with the 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.720
 spoon 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.780
 add the shrimp you had 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.870
 already out of the fridge for her to release 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.620
 all their flavor 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:27.150
 top with white butter lobster paid 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:31.830
 in also about shrimps dotted with 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.889
 croutons and lemon and garnish with 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.889
 a touch of greenery a branches of 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.680
 parsley or so as here a branch of 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.610
 Pursue please that seems 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.610
