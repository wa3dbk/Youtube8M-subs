it's<00:02:25.610> building<00:02:26.060> pressure<00:02:26.299> in<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.629> primary

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
it's building pressure in the primary

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.619 
it's building pressure in the primary
and<00:02:28.129> secondary<00:02:28.370> tanks<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:30.670> good<00:02:31.670> charge<00:02:32.060> that's

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
and secondary tanks a good charge that's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.220 

gage<00:02:36.960> oil<00:02:37.960> pressure<00:02:39.810> alarm<00:02:40.810> will<00:02:41.080> go<00:02:41.110> off

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
gage oil pressure alarm will go off

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.559 
gage oil pressure alarm will go off
shortly

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.449 

the<00:02:44.959> air<00:02:45.110> pressure<00:02:45.260> gets<00:02:45.650> up<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.920> acceptable

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
the air pressure gets up to acceptable

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.949 
the air pressure gets up to acceptable
range<00:02:47.379> which<00:02:48.379> i<00:02:48.530> think<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:49.329> 60<00:02:50.329> will<00:02:50.510> be<00:02:50.540> alarm

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
range which i think is 60 will be alarm

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.589 
range which i think is 60 will be alarm
will<00:02:51.140> go<00:02:51.170> off<00:02:51.290> but<00:02:51.829> then<00:02:52.040> pop<00:02:52.939> off<00:02:53.180> once<00:02:53.450> it

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
will go off but then pop off once it

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.080 
will go off but then pop off once it
gets<00:02:53.750> too

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
gets too

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:03.809 
gets too
so<00:02:59.580> the<00:03:01.590> blinking<00:03:02.590> there's<00:03:03.520> not<00:03:03.670> enough

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
so the blinking there's not enough

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.229 
so the blinking there's not enough
pressure<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.180> maintain<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:05.200> highway<00:03:06.239> setting

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
pressure to maintain the highway setting

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:18.059 
pressure to maintain the highway setting
if<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:08.020> needed<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.410> add<00:03:08.470> air<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.890> tires

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.920 

it's<00:03:18.250> gonna<00:03:18.370> idle<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.849> up<00:03:19.000> just<00:03:19.239> slightly

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
it's gonna idle it up just slightly

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:33.280 
it's gonna idle it up just slightly
and<00:03:20.890> they<00:03:20.980> can<00:03:21.159> do<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.459> here<00:03:21.970> on<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.299> back

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290
