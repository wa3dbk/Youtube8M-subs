00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:11.490
 most of the time in the group 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.490

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.550
 the thing 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.030
 hence another positive 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.030
 as the hbo channel aches 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.800
 the bug on the channel 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.309
 since today another kicked from a channel 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.200
 and I can another here and there one would look for 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:01:00.610
 a potter and his plate by chile 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:03.470

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.910
 the title of the first flood 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.910

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.070

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.070
 another perth rule 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.010

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.409

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.219
 it's OK 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.649
 tite could not go to close the channel 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.649
 and the penal colony against you 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.590
 and I think that 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.590
 the program 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.469

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.469
 this is the line 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.060
 It's not how I want it 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.289
 only one or the sony trish asks that the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.679

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.620
 the caic 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.570

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.540
