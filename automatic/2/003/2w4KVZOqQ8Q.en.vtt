00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
beat the boredom second tip that I have

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.789 
beat the boredom second tip that I have
is<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:46.670> pick<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.880> spot<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> sky<00:01:49.110> further<00:01:49.560> off

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
is to pick a spot in the sky further off

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.850 
is to pick a spot in the sky further off
