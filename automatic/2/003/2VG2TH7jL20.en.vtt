 to do I will show you what products I have 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.880
 also tested in this 2014 that I have been 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.189
 delighted and those who have not spoken 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.960

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.640

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.070
 it works and I 'm testing little by little 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.870
 to test a treatment product and 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.880
 really see the results I think that 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.649
 it takes about three weeks so 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.809
 less and good because I've been testing 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.610
 products and I'm still trying to show you 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.980
 new options for different types of 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.090
 skin and the first products of which 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.110
 I want to talk are those of nature 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.670
 Iberian 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.770
 I do not know if you know this brand is a 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.059
 Natural marks you can find in 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.280
 herbalists I discovered it by 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.960
 first time in calle conca in barcelona 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.390
 in the listeria where I used to buy 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.060
 many food products too 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.119
 and it's a Russian brand 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.700
 the incredible products for a price 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.950
 approximate of about 10-15 euros as 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.369
 a lot some products that are very very 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.840
 anti wrinkle are worth 20 20 something euros 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.789
 but they really are amazing and have 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.909
 of all the eye contour be a 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.259

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.390
 are the products that I am using 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.009
 currently and I am doing great 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.220
 you can also find them on the page 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.960
 web of croze point is after following 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.390
 with treatment products 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.880
 one of my workhorses are the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.039
 lips if you have seen my video of 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.049
 lip care and I discovered this 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.299
 product of this product has a 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.850
 price of about eight euros and it is a 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.069
 authentic wonder those that you have as 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.500
 I completely parched lips 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.170
 flake 2 you need products that are 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.720
 very nutritious and this product is 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.510
 it has a certain smell also though 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.630
 good is a soft smell of honey 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.280
 and I love it really goes super well what 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.380
 I use tomorrow night I always wear it 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.030
 with me because I also do not weigh in the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.580
 bag I'm always waiting to see 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.800
 looking for it around the house and it really is 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.990
 highly recommended and I love to tell me if 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.760
 you have tried it and what do you think and 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.280
 now we go to the makeup I want 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.350
 speak of first shadow that 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.930
 You are fans of shadows like me and 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.000
 do all kinds of looks make a 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.550
 pro evolution really when I saw them 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.650
 there and I saw that they were worth a euro 50 in 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.400
 I bought them the best I said 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.770
 It can not be but I tried the tester and 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.130
 I said really pigment well then 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.780
 I bought them and I used them and 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.880
 they really go great, it's also a 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.890
 intermediate pigmentation is not 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.600
 too pigmented because sometimes the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 shadows when they pigment too much is 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.860
 more complicated to work and blur 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.600
 the later ones and these seem to me 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.180
 wonderful so good girls is 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.980
 this is super mega low cost and 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.280
 I think it is also highly recommended 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.110
 based on the proofreaders this year 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.989
 it has been a year of proofreaders being 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.000
 tried a lot and also good with 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.519
 the correctors video and I follow 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.819
 testing and these the feedback of 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.069
 maybelline gives me very very well is a 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.860
 product that really has a 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.690
 coverage very good but at the same time 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.269
 it diffuses very well and remains as very 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.709
 natural and I think good look at me 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.629
 I buy two so you can see one more 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.159
 yellowish more for this area and another 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.440
 more clarito to light up a bit by 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.670
 here I am using it like that lately 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.370
 and that I'm not very use 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.629
 correctors to illuminate but these are 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.579
 integrate very well with the base and 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.510
 I really do very well and cover very well 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.340
 dark circles so I recommend it 100% 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.829
 following with the correctors for 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.230
 that you have then marquitas spots if 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.950
 you need a more powerful corrector os 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.109
 I recommend this from nix is a proofreader 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.660
 very very powerful for spots or 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.849
 marquitas of grains for a very thing 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.660
 concrete is called full coverage with phil 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.120
 you are 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.450
 Well, you see, I've used a lot 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.910
 and it really goes very very well is it has 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.980
 a lot of pigmentation and then you have to 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.960
 work it well with your finger like a 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.870
 glosa I prefer with the finger because 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.700
 Apply heat to it as it fades and 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.549
 Blurs much better is very very well 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.350
 also recommended and another proofreader 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.140
 I 've used a lot since you see girls 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.820
 and also a long time ago this is the one of 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.100
 max factor master touch I've used it 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.230
 in a lot of videos and sometime you 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.360
 I have commented that I love it has less 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.940
 coverage that those of the fit me that is to say is 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.620
 for one choose a very light ojera or if 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.530
 you apply the pre corrector in the area 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.840
 where you need more correction in the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.700
 dark circles and then over this but I 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.440
 love it, I will really buy myself another 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.710
 fast before it's going to be that what 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.260
 discontinue and minors like it 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.150

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.610

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.170

 wonderful are very well priced 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.520

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.720
 different websites where you want but 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.660
 they are really wonderful I use them 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.910
 very much to blur shadows 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.500
 a little bit to replace the 217 mark and 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.360
 I really do not only have a great time 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.570

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.790
