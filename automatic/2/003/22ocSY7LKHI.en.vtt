this is the output to the opposite and I

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.120 
this is the output to the opposite and I
got<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> test<00:00:29.970> mood<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.679> which<00:00:31.679> I'm<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
got a test mood here which I'm going to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.180 
got a test mood here which I'm going to
show<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.340> how<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> work<00:00:36.649> this<00:00:37.649> ignite<00:00:38.040> your

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
show you how to work this ignite your

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.119 
show you how to work this ignite your
bones<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.860> sisters<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.710> get<00:00:44.480> equation

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
bones and your sisters to get equation

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.389 
bones and your sisters to get equation
and<00:00:48.170> you're<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> simulate<00:00:49.829> here

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and you're just going to simulate here

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.580 
and you're just going to simulate here
I'm<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.360> put<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> resistor<00:00:52.140> into<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I'm going to put the resistor into the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.000 
I'm going to put the resistor into the
terminals<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:57.170> then<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.289> click<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
terminals here and then we click the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.310 
terminals here and then we click the
test<00:00:59.250> button<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.739> if<00:01:02.780> ignition<00:01:03.780> circuit<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
test button and if ignition circuit is

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.830 
test button and if ignition circuit is
completed<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.850> show<00:01:06.150> us<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.479> good

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
completed and then show us a good

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.340 
completed and then show us a good
connection<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.909> this<00:01:08.909> green<00:01:09.299> labs<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
connection for this green labs going to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.700 
connection for this green labs going to
buy<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.220> flip<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.939> test<00:01:12.210> swatch<00:01:12.710> yes

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
buy up when I flip the test swatch yes

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.910 
buy up when I flip the test swatch yes
it<00:01:13.950> does<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.000> means<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:16.080> good<00:01:16.650> for

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it does and that means it's good for

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.370 
it does and that means it's good for
launch<00:01:17.360> I'm<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.810> launch<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.170> now

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
launch I'm not going to launch it now

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.859 
launch I'm not going to launch it now
but<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:21.299> flip<00:01:22.290> over<00:01:22.500> 30<00:01:22.860> armed<00:01:23.549> mode<00:01:23.869> with

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
but the flip over 30 armed mode with

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.620 
but the flip over 30 armed mode with
those<00:01:25.110> two<00:01:25.350> switches<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.299> toggle

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
those two switches and then just toggle

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
those two switches and then just toggle
both<00:01:28.189> at<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> same<00:01:29.460> time<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.970> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
both at the same time to get it to it so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.899 
both at the same time to get it to it so
I'm<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.420 

and<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.180> I'm<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> take<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> cable<00:01:43.649> this

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and then I'm going to take a cable this

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.270 
and then I'm going to take a cable this
is<00:01:44.610> very<00:01:44.850> good<00:01:44.939> Teflon<00:01:45.869> cable<00:01:46.939> to<00:01:49.430> this<00:01:50.430> point

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
is very good Teflon cable to this point

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.639 
is very good Teflon cable to this point
industrial<00:01:53.280> sensors<00:01:55.310> sit<00:01:56.310> very<00:01:56.580> very<00:01:57.649> good

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
industrial sensors sit very very good

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.480 
industrial sensors sit very very good
cable<00:02:00.890> just<00:02:01.890> put<00:02:02.189> your<00:02:02.399> sister<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.590> LG

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
cable just put your sister in the LG

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:25.000 
cable just put your sister in the LG
lips<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.209> that<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:07.489> so<00:02:09.769> just<00:02:10.769> go<00:02:10.979> ahead

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.380 

after<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.220> sister<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:32.180> take<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.360> other

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
after a sister like that take the other

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.069 
after a sister like that take the other
end<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.260> cable<00:02:38.570> connect<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.690> into<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
end of the cable connect it into the

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.390 
end of the cable connect it into the
ignition<00:02:40.230> box

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.600 

like<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:48.780> like<00:02:49.780> test<00:02:50.200> which<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.920> it's<00:02:51.220> green

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
like that like test which and it's green

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.190 
like that like test which and it's green
that<00:02:52.180> means<00:02:52.480> week<00:02:52.750> at<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.170> higher<00:02:56.459> mode<00:02:58.200> just

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
that means week at it higher mode just

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.849 
that means week at it higher mode just
to<00:02:59.349> cover<00:02:59.590> us<00:03:01.109> just<00:03:02.640> just<00:03:03.640> get<00:03:04.239> out<00:03:04.329> of<00:03:04.480> here

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
to cover us just just get out of here

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:14.610 
to cover us just just get out of here
toggle<00:03:05.859> switches<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:10.890> there<00:03:11.890> we<00:03:12.159> go<00:03:13.620> yep

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
toggle switches and there we go yep

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.220 
toggle switches and there we go yep
that's<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:16.349> works<00:03:17.349> for<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.769> works<00:03:19.109> very<00:03:20.109> good

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
that's it works for you works very good

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.589 
that's it works for you works very good
actually<00:03:20.590> oh<00:03:22.440> yeah<00:03:23.440> that's<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.150> Jeff<00:03:25.150> built-in

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
actually oh yeah that's it Jeff built-in

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.780 
actually oh yeah that's it Jeff built-in
battery<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.620> we're<00:03:27.099> going<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.310> make<00:03:27.639> your

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
battery and we're going to make your

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.550 
battery and we're going to make your
charging<00:03:28.739> input<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:31.030> join<00:03:31.750> from<00:03:31.959> battery<00:03:32.290> pack

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
charging input to join from battery pack

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.069 
charging input to join from battery pack
and<00:03:33.329> be<00:03:34.329> able<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.840> run<00:03:35.019> from<00:03:35.319> a<00:03:35.470> bigger<00:03:35.680> battery

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
and be able to run from a bigger battery

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.050 
and be able to run from a bigger battery
but<00:03:38.079> yeah<00:03:38.290> that's<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:39.129> hope<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:39.760> enjoyed<00:03:40.030> it
