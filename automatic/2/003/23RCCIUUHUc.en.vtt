00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.019
 It should be quick this morning 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.969
 So what did I do? I got it 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.350
 thought if make a fresh one 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.760
 recipe for the pure, we take three eggs 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.730
 for a person who is hungry 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.150
 fits that can take two or five 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.689
 for two people a tomato or a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.340
 half depending on a spring onions 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.270
 and a few herbs I have 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 Chive basil selected something 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.649
 pepper and some water to stretch 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.030
 first prepare the eggs for me 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.640
 you can put it right in the pan 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.809
 beat if you only pure eggs 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.890
 would like to take 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.100
 fruit is something I captured there 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:59.820
 always like to drink some mineral water 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:02.340
 or milk high because I think so 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:10.500
 relax that a bit and do 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:12.630
 it nicely supple fits that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.030
 no dish more in it is the taking 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.830
 We take a sip of water and mix that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.090
 have been here together because many 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.520
 catch are coated 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.520
 then you can not with a fork 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.670
 it stays that way too 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.050
 is then lifted is the first 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.220
 easy and now she will 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.220
 and a little salt on 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.270
 meanwhile in the pan we already have 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.900
 sautÃ©ed the butter 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.900
 that's not important either 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.470
 I cut the spring onions, the 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:18.060
 come to that, I take the green 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.990
 Also, I think that's the best 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:26.620
 you have to be flexible in how far you are 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:35.560
 I would like to find that running fits 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:48.630
 wonderful comes in a fresh recipe 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:51.910
 in addition and also herbs come to it if 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.450
 you want to make an omelet you can 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.450
 let that rush 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.110
 who more herbs namely the added value 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.330
 less markets less or you take 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.700
 no herbs at all with pepper 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.700
 salt on recipe it is up to you 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:32.010
 Now we take half a tomato 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:34.980
 in addition I cut now so you can 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.350
 also like to use this cocktailtomaten 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.100
 little rooney 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.870
 they also taste wonderful to this 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.790
 tomato is just coming to an end 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.790
 the time to do so 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.820
 if it stopped nicely everywhere 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:07.200
