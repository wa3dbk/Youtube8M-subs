usually<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.530> use<00:03:13.739> win<00:03:14.250> but<00:03:14.880> every<00:03:15.030> once<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:15.299> a

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
usually I use win but every once in a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.120 
usually I use win but every once in a
while<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.720> do<00:03:15.780> need<00:03:16.230> something<00:03:16.500> that's<00:03:16.890> going

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
while I do need something that's going

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.970 
while I do need something that's going
to<00:03:17.340> foam<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:17.970> lift<00:03:18.269> more<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.350> stuff<00:03:19.650> from

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
to foam and lift more of the stuff from

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.150 
to foam and lift more of the stuff from
my<00:03:20.070> scalp<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.570> for<00:03:21.930> me<00:03:22.079> works<00:03:22.530> perfectly

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
my scalp so this for me works perfectly

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.630 
my scalp so this for me works perfectly
because<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:24.600> foams<00:03:25.079> like<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> regular<00:03:25.799> shampoo

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
because it foams like a regular shampoo

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.360 
because it foams like a regular shampoo
but<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.329> doesn't<00:03:27.810> have<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.410> doesn't<00:03:28.709> have<00:03:29.160> any

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
but it doesn't have it doesn't have any

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.090 
but it doesn't have it doesn't have any
sulfates<00:03:30.030> or<00:03:30.299> parabens<00:03:30.989> or<00:03:31.350> anything<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:32.040> it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
sulfates or parabens or anything in it

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.289 
sulfates or parabens or anything in it
but<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.090> still<00:03:33.360> foams<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.820> really<00:03:36.120> like

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
but it still foams and so I really like

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.110 
but it still foams and so I really like
this<00:03:36.480> product<00:03:36.780> because<00:03:37.350> um<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.700> thing<00:03:38.910> about

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
this product because um the thing about

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.270 
this product because um the thing about
it<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:39.420> after<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.079> wash<00:03:40.320> your<00:03:40.530> hair<00:03:40.799> with<00:03:40.829> it

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
it is after you wash your hair with it

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.360 
it is after you wash your hair with it
it's<00:03:41.910> like<00:03:42.209> really<00:03:42.840> really<00:03:43.019> curly<00:03:43.560> probably

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
it's like really really curly probably

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.910 
it's like really really curly probably
because<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:44.880> foaming<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.200> really

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
because it's foaming and so I really

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.720
