the TCT it would hurt the sales if they

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.840 
the TCT it would hurt the sales if they
like<00:01:21.600> destroyed<00:01:22.110> channels<00:01:22.770> too<00:01:23.430> much<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.820> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
like destroyed channels too much so I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.280 
like destroyed channels too much so I
really<00:01:24.330> don't<00:01:24.479> see<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.990> was<00:01:25.110> really

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
really don't see I was really

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.810 
really don't see I was really
getting<00:01:25.380> hit<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.680> all<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.130> our<00:01:26.340> list<00:01:26.549> but

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
getting hit it all from our list but

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.819 
getting hit it all from our list but
again<00:01:27.600> my<00:01:27.869> guess<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:28.590> good<00:01:28.619> as

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
again my guess it's just as good as

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.350 
again my guess it's just as good as
anyone<00:01:29.130> elses<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> mean<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> could<00:01:30.240> be

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.950 
wrong you never know what kind of me is
gonna<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.360> only<00:01:33.479> thing<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.750> feel

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
gonna do on that the only thing I feel

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.179 
gonna do on that the only thing I feel
like<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.229> gonna<00:01:34.530> happen<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.890> feel<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.070> I'm

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
like that's gonna happen I feel like I'm

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.499 
like that's gonna happen I feel like I'm
about<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.610> hundred<00:01:35.670> percent<00:01:35.850> sure<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.420> is

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
about one hundred percent sure this is

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.539 
about one hundred percent sure this is
gonna<00:01:36.600> happen<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.369> think<00:01:38.369> sole<00:01:38.520> charge

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
gonna happen and I think sole charge

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.760 
gonna happen and I think sole charge
will<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.939> limited<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.329> us<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.659> well<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.049> just

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
will be limited for us as well I just

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.929 
will be limited for us as well I just
feel<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.610> lap

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
feel like that's kind of more like lap

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.300 
feel like that's kind of more like lap
and<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> makes<00:01:42.299> sense<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.920> yeah<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.070> mean<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and it makes sense and yeah I mean I

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.800 
and it makes sense and yeah I mean I
just<00:01:44.610> feel<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:44.939> that's<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> only<00:01:45.390> thing<00:01:45.689> I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
just feel like that's the only thing I

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.969 
just feel like that's the only thing I
felt<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:46.439> really<00:01:46.619> gonna<00:01:46.799> happen

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
felt like that's really gonna happen

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.380 
felt like that's really gonna happen
other<00:01:47.250> than<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.729> really<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.180> any

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
other than that I don't really have any

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.590 
other than that I don't really have any
to<00:01:48.930> too<00:01:49.500> many<00:01:49.619> good<00:01:50.070> guesses<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.000> am

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to too many good guesses on that I am

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600 
to too many good guesses on that I am
hoping<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> possibly<00:01:52.979> strato<00:01:53.340> sand

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
hoping that a possibly strato sand

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.740 
hoping that a possibly strato sand
dragon<00:01:53.850> ravine<00:01:54.060> will<00:01:54.240> come<00:01:54.360> off<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> ban<00:01:54.720> list

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
dragon ravine will come off the ban list

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.530 
dragon ravine will come off the ban list
at<00:01:55.140> some<00:01:55.409> points<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.399> know<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:56.670> least<00:01:56.850> limited

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
at some points you know at least limited

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.760 
at some points you know at least limited
or<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.320> important<00:01:58.619> just

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
or you know just as important just

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.969 
or you know just as important just
anything<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.399> band<00:01:59.840> but<00:02:00.840> those<00:02:01.439> are<00:02:01.680> very

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
anything but band but those are very

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.770 
anything but band but those are very
unlikely<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.790> I'm<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.299> kind<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.479> selfish

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
unlikely but I'm just kind of selfish

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
unlikely but I'm just kind of selfish
and<00:02:03.899> hoping<00:02:04.110> those<00:02:04.259> will<00:02:04.409> come<00:02:04.530> back<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.340> yeah
