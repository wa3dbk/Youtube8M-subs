we do is apply topical anesthetic to the
face<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.080> by<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.409> time<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.950> treatment

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369

takes place the skin is actually quite

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.780 
takes place the skin is actually quite
numb<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> makes<00:01:31.979> everything<00:01:32.400> much<00:01:32.729> more

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
numb and it makes everything much more

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.050 
numb and it makes everything much more
comfortable<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:34.409> apply<00:01:34.829> with<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> spray<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060

formulations to the skin and we use the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.719 
formulations to the skin and we use the
roller<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.329> order<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> induce<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.710> infuse<00:01:41.369> the

perfusion is very very important for the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
perfusion is very very important for the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
in addition to that the needles

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.420 
in addition to that the needles
themselves<00:02:03.360> are<00:02:03.540> exquisitely<00:02:04.290> designed<00:02:04.560> very

themselves are exquisitely designed very
much<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:06.000> acupuncture<00:02:06.780> needles<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.799> are

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
much like acupuncture needles they are

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.859 
much like acupuncture needles they are
really<00:02:08.429> really<00:02:08.879> thin<00:02:09.149> they're<00:02:09.420> thinner<00:02:09.690> than

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
really really thin they're thinner than

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.190 
really really thin they're thinner than

a human hair measured in microns
and<00:02:12.319> just<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.340> acupuncture<00:02:14.090> needles<00:02:14.569> they

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
and just like acupuncture needles they

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.680 
and just like acupuncture needles they
cause<00:02:15.500> some<00:02:15.980> very<00:02:16.310> mysterious<00:02:16.519> things<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.569> go

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
cause some very mysterious things to go

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.910 
cause some very mysterious things to go
on<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.080> skin<00:02:18.379> that<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.650> don't<00:02:18.769> quite

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
on in the skin that we don't quite

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.640 
on in the skin that we don't quite
understand<00:02:19.879> it<00:02:20.180> has<00:02:20.780> something<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.290> do<00:02:21.440> with

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
understand it has something to do with

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.670 
understand it has something to do with

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
what we call demarcation currents these

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.339 
what we call demarcation currents these
are<00:02:24.890> little<00:02:25.160> micro<00:02:26.120> voltage<00:02:26.599> currents<00:02:27.200> that
