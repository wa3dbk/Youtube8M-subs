00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
can see the really funky swatch colors

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.030 
can see the really funky swatch colors
that<00:02:32.849> they<00:02:32.970> always<00:02:33.150> come<00:02:33.569> out<00:02:33.599> with<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.530> touch

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that they always come out with a touch

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.940 
that they always come out with a touch
screen<00:02:35.250> as<00:02:35.790> well<00:02:36.030> which<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.569> good<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.019> if<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.799> go

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
screen as well which is good and if I go

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.530 
screen as well which is good and if I go
through<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.400> next<00:02:38.549> tab<00:02:38.879> along<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.359> see

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
through the next tab along you can see

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.589 
through the next tab along you can see
it<00:02:39.659> front-facing<00:02:40.260> now<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:41.159> looks<00:02:41.609> like<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:42.209> sore

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
it front-facing now it looks like a sore

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.830 
it front-facing now it looks like a sore
for<00:02:43.250> monochrome<00:02:44.250> display<00:02:44.519> so<00:02:45.090> I'm<00:02:45.329> not<00:02:45.540> sure

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
for monochrome display so I'm not sure

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.390 
for monochrome display so I'm not sure
whether<00:02:46.079> it's<00:02:46.290> going<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.530> be<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> full<00:02:47.069> color

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
whether it's going to be a full color

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.210 
whether it's going to be a full color
display<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.690> certainly<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> app<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.980> gives

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
display but certainly the app that gives

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.770 
display but certainly the app that gives
you<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.459> encouragement<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.209> tracks<00:02:51.569> your

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
you the encouragement and tracks your

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.949 
you the encouragement and tracks your
statistics<00:02:52.500> will<00:02:53.220> be<00:02:53.459> full<00:02:53.909> color<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.450> it

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
statistics will be full color and it

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.599 
statistics will be full color and it
just<00:02:54.989> looks<00:02:55.349> absolutely<00:02:55.500> fantastic<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.579> think

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
just looks absolutely fantastic I think

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.330
