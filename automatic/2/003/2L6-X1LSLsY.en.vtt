the<00:00:24.930> clear<00:00:25.620> tape<00:00:25.950> here<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.520> prefer<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.450> over

the clear tape here I prefer this over

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.540 
the clear tape here I prefer this over
the<00:00:27.990> translucent<00:00:28.620> tape<00:00:28.740> which<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.070> frosty

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the translucent tape which is the frosty

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.190 
the translucent tape which is the frosty
tape<00:00:29.760> because<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.330> find<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> frosty<00:00:30.990> tape

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.630 

and<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.910> top<00:00:50.120> coat<00:00:50.329> I'm<00:00:50.540> using<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:51.640> China

faster<00:00:55.190> on<00:00:55.280> top<00:00:55.489> coat<00:00:55.700> so<00:00:57.340> before<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:58.489> start

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
faster on top coat so before you start

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.819 
faster on top coat so before you start
taping<00:00:59.030> you<00:00:59.480> actually<00:00:59.960> want<00:01:00.200> to<00:01:00.470> make<00:01:00.800> sure

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
taping you actually want to make sure

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.220 
taping you actually want to make sure
that<00:01:01.309> your<00:01:01.460> nail<00:01:01.610> polish<00:01:02.059> is<00:01:02.300> thoroughly<00:01:02.780> dry

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
that your nail polish is thoroughly dry

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.460 
that your nail polish is thoroughly dry
otherwise<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.820> tape<00:01:05.030> will<00:01:05.330> remove<00:01:06.200> some<00:01:06.410> of

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
otherwise the tape will remove some of

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.620 
otherwise the tape will remove some of
the<00:01:06.560> nail<00:01:06.680> polish<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.220> then<00:01:07.369> also<00:01:07.580> you<00:01:08.420> want

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
the nail polish and then also you want

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.440 
the nail polish and then also you want
to<00:01:08.690> apply<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.229> tape<00:01:09.500> onto<00:01:10.040> your<00:01:10.160> skin<00:01:10.520> to

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
to apply the tape onto your skin to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.150 
to apply the tape onto your skin to
remove<00:01:11.900> some<00:01:12.080> of<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.259> tackiness<00:01:12.680> as<00:01:12.950> well

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
remove some of the tackiness as well

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.760 
remove some of the tackiness as well
because<00:01:13.820> again<00:01:14.630> it'll<00:01:14.930> rip<00:01:15.170> off<00:01:15.350> some<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.650> your

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
because again it'll rip off some of your

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.840 
because again it'll rip off some of your
nail<00:01:15.920> polish<00:01:16.100> when<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:16.820> remove<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.240> tape<00:01:17.390> I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
nail polish when you remove the tape I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.170 
nail polish when you remove the tape I
also<00:01:19.850> apply<00:01:20.740> all<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.890> tape<00:01:22.070> on<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.610> one<00:01:22.850> hand

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
also apply all the tape on to one hand

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.230 
also apply all the tape on to one hand
at<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.479> time<00:01:23.539> I<00:01:24.580> do<00:01:25.580> this<00:01:25.789> because<00:01:25.940> it's<00:01:26.090> just

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
at a time I do this because it's just

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.770 
at a time I do this because it's just
just<00:01:26.810> easier<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.009> not<00:01:28.399> tapping<00:01:29.240> your<00:01:29.539> nails

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
just easier and not tapping your nails

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.050 
just easier and not tapping your nails
or<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:30.710> know<00:01:30.890> smudging<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.460> nail<00:01:31.580> polish

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.520 

so<00:01:35.060> now<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:35.240> let<00:01:35.390> my<00:01:35.510> whole<00:01:35.660> hand<00:01:35.900> is<00:01:36.080> taped<00:01:36.320> off

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
so now I let my whole hand is taped off

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.790 
so now I let my whole hand is taped off
I'm<00:01:36.950> going<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.580> apply<00:01:38.300> my<00:01:38.660> polish<00:01:39.110> I<00:01:39.320> like<00:01:39.710> to

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
I'm going to apply my polish I like to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.140 
I'm going to apply my polish I like to
use<00:01:39.920> polishes<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:40.310> are<00:01:40.490> pretty<00:01:40.700> opaque

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
use polishes that are pretty opaque

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.030 
use polishes that are pretty opaque
because<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.630> really<00:01:42.050> only<00:01:42.200> like<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:42.560> apply<00:01:42.800> one

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
because I really only like to apply one

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.930 
because I really only like to apply one
coat<00:01:43.340> using<00:01:44.330> only<00:01:44.690> one<00:01:44.870> coat<00:01:45.430> helps<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:46.610> create

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
coat using only one coat helps to create

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.390 
coat using only one coat helps to create
a<00:01:47.150> really<00:01:47.690> clean<00:01:48.050> line<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:48.920> prevents<00:01:49.310> the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
a really clean line and it prevents the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.250 
a really clean line and it prevents the
nail<00:01:49.550> polish<00:01:49.940> from<00:01:50.120> lifting<00:01:50.900> because<00:01:51.080> you

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
nail polish from lifting because you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.530 
nail polish from lifting because you
don't<00:01:51.410> have<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.620> let<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.770> dry<00:01:51.860> in<00:01:52.100> between

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
don't have to let it dry in between

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.630 
don't have to let it dry in between
removing<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.630> tape<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:54.890> remove<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.430> tape

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
removing the tape so I remove the tape

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.380 
removing the tape so I remove the tape
right<00:01:55.910> away

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
right away

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.930 
right away
this<00:01:56.540> creates<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.440> really<00:01:57.470> nice<00:01:58.010> crisp<00:01:58.580> clean

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
this creates a really nice crisp clean

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:07.140 
this creates a really nice crisp clean
line

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:16.910 

you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.240 

so<00:02:17.700> now<00:02:17.819> I'm<00:02:17.970> just<00:02:18.120> applying<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:19.050> coat<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.770> a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
so now I'm just applying a coat of a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.180 
so now I'm just applying a coat of a
fast<00:02:20.550> drying<00:02:20.850> top<00:02:20.970> coat<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.680> I'm<00:02:22.680> making<00:02:23.010> sure

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
fast drying top coat and I'm making sure

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.640
