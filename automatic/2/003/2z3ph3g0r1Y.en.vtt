00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.410
 hello today we are going to teach you 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.050
 how to make a white rice are we going to 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.750
 need a cup of rice 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.630
 we put it in oil and we have it here 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.419
 very hot we also need a 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.329
 onion or half onion to give it 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.600
 a little bit of flavor 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.129
 preparing and a cube of chicken broth 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.780
 we also have to have ready 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.110
 our vegetables here we 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.400
 we bought a can and a list of peas 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.440
 and carrots 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.640
 We are not going to leave just a little while 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.550
 how is it white 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 we are also going to add corn and 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.210
 we also occupy half pot of water 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.210
 boiling 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.449
 so we only left it for a little while 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.449
 in the oil 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.119
 they can add chile chile serrano or 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.130
 half chile serrano to be a 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.630
 slightly viscous 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.630
 then we will add it 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.180
 the chili of your preference 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.540
 we will add s 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.830
 and already it gives off a rich aroma that will be 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.210
 when it is ready 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.210
 a rich rice to accompany a meat or 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.940
 or some other food 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.750
 well here we have our water list 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.399
 boiling as you can see and the rice does not 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.640
 we let it brown or nothing just 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.310
 he 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.619
 hot there is a time with the oil but 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.920
 she is ready to add the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.920
 Water 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.630
 and now we also add the ice cube 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.020
 chicken broth to give it a flavor 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.020
 rich 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.090
 and then 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.580
 we let it boil some 5 minutes or 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.330
 10 to add the other ingredients 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.750
 What is it 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.740
 the vegetables carrots and peas and the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.450
 corn cob 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.319
 and also because we are going to add salt 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.319
 to taste 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.030
 so let's wait for a boil 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.420
 little 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.110
 to add the other ingredients this 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.000
 can of corn contain 432 grams 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.250
 we are only going to use the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.800
 half because if not then it will be more 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.700
 corn that the other vegetable that we already have 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.340
 here we are going to add it now 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.340
 has boiling already like 5 minutes 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.110
 peas and carrots 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.930
 we have not added salt to the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.110
 soup because the chicken broth cube 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.730
 sometimes 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.730
 we want you to build a little 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.020
 also the hotel half according to 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.870
 I remove nothing more 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.870
 nothing peas and and 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.090
 and ready let's let it boil 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.320
 how many minutes 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.520
 some feet 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:18.270
 but let's cover it so that it counts 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.070
 so now the question is wait no 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.510
 forget to try it to see how 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.250
 is also in this process 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.920
 while boiling the 10 minutes 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.160
 to taste and we hope 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.160
 already boiled 5 minutes our our 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.280
 rice and look like this is what it looks like 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.830
 has water if you notice that your rice is 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.020
 very dry and that is still raw 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.169
 then add more boiling water 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.050
 hot but 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.479
 ours is fine still missing that 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.189
 you decrease the water is finished 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.189
 let's cover it again 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:01.750
 the one that lies down right now we come back 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.910
 good after 10 or 15 minutes that 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.040
 let it boil rice is ready and 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.940
 it was cooked now we are going to turn off the 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.390
 Quierda stove and look at this is very 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.450
 rich and remember if you added the 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.460
 chile as well whole and onion can 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.530
 retire the at this time to 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.900
 make sure nobody gets out there 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.500
 do not like it here, it's okay 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.500
 we remove 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.719
 and here is 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:34.300
 and now all that's left is to serve red and 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.300
 enjoy it 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.950
 well this is the final dish and 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.560
 we have here the white rice and what 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.310
 we accompany with a carnita in chile 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.500
 red and clear also with a salad and 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.440
 it's rich and it's simple and fast 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.449

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.729
