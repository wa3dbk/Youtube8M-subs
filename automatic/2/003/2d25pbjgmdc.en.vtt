hello<00:00:12.960> everyone<00:00:13.259> as<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.219> see<00:00:14.370> I've<00:00:14.759> got

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
hello everyone as you can see I've got

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.369 
hello everyone as you can see I've got
the<00:00:15.150> point<00:00:15.330> now<00:00:15.540> I'm<00:00:15.750> rebuilding<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> engine

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
the point now I'm rebuilding the engine

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.599 
the point now I'm rebuilding the engine
for<00:00:16.920> my<00:00:17.010> mini<00:00:17.600> I've<00:00:18.600> split<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.470> block<00:00:19.859> off<00:00:20.250> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
for my mini I've split the block off of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.140 
for my mini I've split the block off of
the<00:00:20.820> gearbox<00:00:21.689> now<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.590> heads<00:00:22.890> off<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:24.029> got

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
the gearbox now and heads off and I got

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.589 
the gearbox now and heads off and I got
the<00:00:24.240> Pistons<00:00:24.630> out<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:26.189> crankshaft<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.300> in

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
the Pistons out the crankshaft is in

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.939 
the Pistons out the crankshaft is in
pretty<00:00:27.840> good<00:00:28.140> condition<00:00:28.289> actually<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.890> think

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
pretty good condition actually I think

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.919 
pretty good condition actually I think
really<00:00:29.460> should<00:00:29.640> steer<00:00:29.910> bearing<00:00:30.480> shells<00:00:30.750> all

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
really should steer bearing shells all

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.530 
really should steer bearing shells all
have<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.230> be<00:00:31.320> replaced<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.949> no<00:00:32.160> deep<00:00:32.880> scoring

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
have to be replaced it's no deep scoring

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.209 
have to be replaced it's no deep scoring
or<00:00:33.780> pitting<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.440> anything<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:34.950> I've

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
or pitting or anything like that so I've

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.660 
or pitting or anything like that so I've
been<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.550> quite<00:00:35.760> lucky<00:00:35.969> there<00:00:37.370> now<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.520> you

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
been really quite lucky there now as you

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.750 
been really quite lucky there now as you
can<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:38.969> from<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.420> shells<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.440> there<00:00:40.890> very

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
can see from the shells in there very

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.810 
can see from the shells in there very
good<00:00:41.790> condition<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.989> only<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.980> scoring<00:00:44.430> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
good condition is only like scoring so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.490 
good condition is only like scoring so
both<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> shells<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.989> should<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.230> fine

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
both the shells and that should be fine

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.100 
both the shells and that should be fine
they're<00:00:46.739> ready<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.010> go<00:00:47.100> back<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.840> from<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:48.960> on

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
they're ready to go back in from then on

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.080 
they're ready to go back in from then on
it's<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.710> simple<00:00:50.039> case<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.309> replacing<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
it's just a simple case of replacing the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.110 
it's just a simple case of replacing the
piston<00:00:51.210> rings<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> oil<00:00:52.289> control<00:00:52.680> ring

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
piston rings and the oil control ring

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.139 
piston rings and the oil control ring
and<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.660> giving<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.050> good<00:00:55.170> cleanup

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
and you know giving it a good cleanup

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.369 
and you know giving it a good cleanup
and<00:00:57.149> possibly<00:00:57.449> replacing<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.960> bearing<00:00:58.289> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and possibly replacing the bearing in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
and possibly replacing the bearing in
there<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.280> there<00:00:59.550> isn't<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.090> continent<00:01:00.600> yeah

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
there but there isn't a continent yeah

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
there but there isn't a continent yeah
it's<00:01:00.870> hardly<00:01:01.109> anywhere<00:01:01.460> laterally<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.579> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it's hardly anywhere laterally on that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.429 
it's hardly anywhere laterally on that
so<00:01:02.879> that's<00:01:03.030> fine<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:05.960> found<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> right<00:01:07.170> was<00:01:07.320> up

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
so that's fine I found a right was up

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
so that's fine I found a right was up
with<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> clutch<00:01:08.369> because<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.240> see

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
with the clutch because as you can see

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.530 
with the clutch because as you can see
it's<00:01:09.630> pretty<00:01:10.080> much<00:01:10.229> brand<00:01:10.680> new<00:01:11.270> it's<00:01:12.270> hardly

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it's pretty much brand new it's hardly

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.300 
it's pretty much brand new it's hardly
anywhere<00:01:12.900> there's<00:01:13.470> no<00:01:13.619> winner<00:01:13.799> down<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
anywhere there's no winner down to the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.660 
anywhere there's no winner down to the
rivets<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.090> fine

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
rivets so that's fine

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670 
rivets so that's fine
pressure<00:01:17.670> plate<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.240> well<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.680> pretty

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
pressure plate as well that's pretty

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
pressure plate as well that's pretty
much<00:01:19.920> brand<00:01:20.250> news<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.119> not

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
much brand news you can see that's not

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.390 
much brand news you can see that's not
the<00:01:21.360> only<00:01:21.619> corrosion<00:01:22.619> aliens<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.040> bit<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> wear

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the only corrosion aliens a bit of wear

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.820 
the only corrosion aliens a bit of wear
with<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> year<00:01:23.939> sent<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> forks<00:01:25.350> combat

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
with the year sent to the forks combat

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.090 
with the year sent to the forks combat
yeah<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> again<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.320> run<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.770> finger

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
yeah and again when you run your finger

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
yeah and again when you run your finger
along<00:01:29.189> there<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.939> barely<00:01:30.150> feel<00:01:30.450> any

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
along there and you can barely feel any

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
along there and you can barely feel any
difference<00:01:30.990> that's<00:01:31.229> had<00:01:31.470> hardly<00:01:32.009> any<00:01:32.189> weight

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
difference that's had hardly any weight

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.620 
difference that's had hardly any weight
at<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.659> I'm<00:01:33.750> very<00:01:33.869> pleased<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:35.630> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
at all so I'm very pleased with that the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.719 
at all so I'm very pleased with that the
water<00:01:37.020> pump<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.770> pretty<00:01:38.280> poor<00:01:38.520> condition

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
water pump is in pretty poor condition

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.609 
water pump is in pretty poor condition
actually<00:01:39.360> uses<00:01:40.170> lots<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.470> corrosion<00:01:40.860> their

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
actually uses lots of corrosion their

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.990 
actually uses lots of corrosion their
fins<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.399> might<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
fins on that so I might have to get a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.670 
fins on that so I might have to get a
new<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.720> think<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.770> will<00:01:48.619> now<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
new one of them I think I will now the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.160 
new one of them I think I will now the
bores<00:01:50.070> are<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.549> very<00:01:50.820> good<00:01:51.000> condition<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.750> mean

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
bores are in very good condition I mean

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.859 
bores are in very good condition I mean
hardly<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.740> nice<00:01:53.100> cooling<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.610> all<00:01:53.820> no<00:01:54.450> clipping

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
hardly a nice cooling at all no clipping

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.420 
hardly a nice cooling at all no clipping
there's<00:01:55.049> no<00:01:55.170> deep<00:01:55.409> gouge<00:01:55.740> or<00:01:56.009> anything<00:01:56.189> so

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
there's no deep gouge or anything so

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.120 
there's no deep gouge or anything so
they're<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.729> fine<00:01:57.140> I'm<00:01:58.140> beginning<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.009> think

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
they're all fine I'm beginning to think

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100 
they're all fine I'm beginning to think
the<00:01:59.579> engine<00:01:59.880> might<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.329> been<00:02:00.540> rebuilt

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the engine might have been rebuilt

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.649 
the engine might have been rebuilt
before<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.469> its<00:02:01.560> lifetime<00:02:02.450> but<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.540> never

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
before in its lifetime but you never

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.990 
before in its lifetime but you never
know<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.469> may<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:05.250> an<00:02:05.369> easy<00:02:05.520> life<00:02:05.610> but

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
know it may just have an easy life but

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.429
