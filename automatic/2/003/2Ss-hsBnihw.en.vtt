00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
galvanized that I used to do my welding

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.700 
galvanized that I used to do my welding
on<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.030> used<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.600> underneath<00:01:37.110> whatever<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

was welding just to catch any of the hot
flux<00:01:40.829> Sparks<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> pretty<00:01:43.439> much<00:01:43.680> I'm<00:01:43.920> going

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
flux Sparks and so pretty much I'm going

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.139 
flux Sparks and so pretty much I'm going
to<00:01:44.130> mark<00:01:44.369> out<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> piece<00:01:45.509> here<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.939> just<00:01:47.939> cut<00:01:48.119> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149

out<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.540> some<00:01:48.689> tin<00:01:48.899> snips<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.590> let's<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.520> in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
out with some tin snips so let's go in

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.639 
out with some tin snips so let's go in
to<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> shop<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> we'll<00:01:52.110> mark<00:01:52.350> everything

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
okay so I end up finishing off the chain

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.620 
okay so I end up finishing off the chain
guards<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.710> end<00:02:35.490> up<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.700> following<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.390> lines
