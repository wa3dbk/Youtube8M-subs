00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.980 
know it's after Christmas so I apologize
for<00:00:08.490> that<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.880> was<00:00:09.179> originally<00:00:09.300> planning<00:00:09.780> on

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
for that I was originally planning on

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.999 
for that I was originally planning on
doing<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.349> video<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:11.639> Christmas<00:00:12.330> but<00:00:12.509> when<00:00:12.690> I

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
doing this video on Christmas but when I

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.660 
doing this video on Christmas but when I
tapped<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.219> keg

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
tapped the keg

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.990 
tapped the keg
I<00:00:14.700> had<00:00:15.570> forced<00:00:16.260> carbonated<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.310> there<00:00:17.880> was

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
I had forced carbonated it and there was

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.170 
I had forced carbonated it and there was
a<00:00:18.240> loose<00:00:18.449> still<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.590> was<00:00:19.710> pretty<00:00:19.740> murky<00:00:20.340> it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
a loose still it was pretty murky it

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.150 
a loose still it was pretty murky it
still<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.660> pretty<00:00:21.990> murky<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.710> not<00:00:22.980> I

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
still is pretty murky but I'm not I

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.720 
still is pretty murky but I'm not I
don't<00:00:23.400> think<00:00:23.930> that<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.960> think<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.920> gave<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
don't think that I think I gave it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.390 
don't think that I think I gave it
enough<00:00:26.939> time<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.390> all<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.750> yeast<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.230> I

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
enough time for all that yeast that I

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.720 
enough time for all that yeast that I
put<00:00:29.400> back<00:00:29.580> into<00:00:29.820> suspension<00:00:31.340> kind<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.430> settle

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
put back into suspension kind of settle

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.180 
put back into suspension kind of settle
back<00:00:32.880> down<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.239> bit<00:00:33.600> after<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.890> forced

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
back down a bit after the forced

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.540 
back down a bit after the forced
carbonation<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.329> hope<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.710> still

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
carbonation so I hope that this is still

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.790 
carbonation so I hope that this is still
a<00:00:38.610> festive<00:00:39.600> event<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.620> were<00:00:40.710> looking

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
a festive event if you were looking

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
a festive event if you were looking
forward<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:41.610> Christmas<00:00:42.559> but<00:00:43.559> at<00:00:44.550> any

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
forward to it for Christmas but at any

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.270 
forward to it for Christmas but at any
rate<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.420> go<00:00:45.629> let's<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.010> final

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
rate here we go let's see the final

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.090 
rate here we go let's see the final
gravity<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.090> one<00:00:48.270> ended<00:00:48.510> up<00:00:48.660> being<00:00:49.100> 1.01

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
gravity on this one ended up being 1.01

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.689 
gravity on this one ended up being 1.01
6<00:00:50.539> starting<00:00:51.539> was<00:00:51.750> 1.05<00:00:52.649> 4<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.309> we're<00:00:53.460> sitting

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
6 starting was 1.05 4 so we're sitting

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.939 
6 starting was 1.05 4 so we're sitting
at<00:00:54.230> about<00:00:55.230> 5%<00:00:55.920> ABV<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.250> the

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
at about 5% ABV or so this one was the

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.619 
at about 5% ABV or so this one was the
pretty<00:01:01.949> much<00:01:02.070> liquid<00:01:02.399> malt<00:01:02.550> extract<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:03.300> bit<00:01:03.510> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
pretty much liquid malt extract a bit of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.130 
pretty much liquid malt extract a bit of
dry<00:01:03.840> malt<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.339> some<00:01:05.700> cure<00:01:06.299> munich<00:01:08.750> grains<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
dry malt and some cure munich grains and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.660 
dry malt and some cure munich grains and
a<00:01:11.010> spice<00:01:11.280> packet<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.830> without<00:01:14.100> further<00:01:14.310> ado

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
a spice packet so without further ado

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.070 
a spice packet so without further ado
let's<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.600> this

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
let's do this

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.830 
let's do this
got<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:16.979> ready<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.400> go<00:01:17.570> like<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> said<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
got it here ready to go like I said you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.270 
got it here ready to go like I said you
can<00:01:18.960> still<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.380> him<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> bit

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
can still see him there it is a bit

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.010 
can still see him there it is a bit
murky<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:23.450> opening<00:01:24.450> my<00:01:24.509> pressure's<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> little

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
murky but opening my pressure's a little

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.580 
murky but opening my pressure's a little
bit<00:01:25.290> low<00:01:25.439> oh<00:01:26.270> we've<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.479> time<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.080> sit<00:01:28.259> chat

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
bit low oh we've got time to sit chat

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.109 
bit low oh we've got time to sit chat
right<00:01:29.720> but<00:01:30.920> no<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> had<00:01:32.250> originally<00:01:32.430> planned<00:01:32.759> on

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
right but no I had originally planned on

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.399 
right but no I had originally planned on
getting<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.570> done<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.840> Christmas<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
getting this one done on Christmas but I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.170 
getting this one done on Christmas but I
was<00:01:34.590> hoping<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.400> would<00:01:35.460> clear<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.970> bit

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
was hoping that it would clear up a bit

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.060 
was hoping that it would clear up a bit
and<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.390> did<00:01:36.900> clear<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.650> bit<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.950> as

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and it did clear up a little bit not as

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.569 
and it did clear up a little bit not as
much<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.460> would<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.670> hoped<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:40.110> know

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
much as I would have hoped but you know

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.210 
much as I would have hoped but you know
what<00:01:41.579> you're<00:01:41.729> gonna<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> got<00:01:44.040> too

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
what you're gonna do and then I got too

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.090 
what you're gonna do and then I got too
busy<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.020> holidays<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:48.740> man<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> tell

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
busy with the holidays and man I tell

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
busy with the holidays and man I tell
you<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.549> didn't<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> chance<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.750> breathe

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
you I didn't have a chance to breathe

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.700 
you I didn't have a chance to breathe
let<00:01:52.290> alone<00:01:52.880> shoot<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.970> video<00:01:54.259> my<00:01:55.259> pressure<00:01:55.560> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
let alone shoot a video my pressure is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.590 
let alone shoot a video my pressure is
running<00:01:56.009> really<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.670> low<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.299> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
running really really low on here so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.100 
running really really low on here so
this<00:01:57.899> thing's<00:01:58.140> not<00:01:58.259> giving<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.570> much<00:02:00.570> justice

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
this thing's not giving it much justice

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.060 
this thing's not giving it much justice
on<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> head<00:02:01.530> Department

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.589 

you<00:02:07.070> can<00:02:07.219> see<00:02:07.429> that<00:02:07.609> carbonation<00:02:08.209> is<00:02:08.300> actually

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
you can see that carbonation is actually

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.570 
you can see that carbonation is actually
falling<00:02:08.840> out<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:11.830> in<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.010> line<00:02:13.220> I'm

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
falling out of it in the in the line I'm

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.059 
falling out of it in the in the line I'm
not<00:02:13.730> sure<00:02:13.849> if<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.000> can<00:02:14.150> see<00:02:14.299> that<00:02:15.069> little

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
not sure if you can see that little

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.400 
not sure if you can see that little
bowls
