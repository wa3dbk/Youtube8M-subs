00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.420
 your home welcome 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.220
 andrew from today we come with something that I 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.960
 I think it will save you a lot of time and 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.429
 a lot of effort a few weeks ago that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.809
 we publish the analysis of an application 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.730
 which is called 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.300
 efe 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.250
 it costs to say it in contrast and sometimes 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.500
 it's hard to understand in this application what 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.150
 what he's going to do is automate a 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.529
 series of processes to make us a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.840
 little bit easier life today we have 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.400
 selected a series of recipes for 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.980
 be able to get the most out of twitter 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.780
 is the application and fcc TV and very 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.190
 Attentively, a recipe like 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.199
 says Carlos so you can understand 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.449
 each of these automations a 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.370
 example if I want you to publish me a 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.199
 tweet every time I do x action on 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.659
 facebook, that would be a recipe 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.829
 concrete and so today we go with the most 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.829
 interesting from twitter 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.570
 we go with the first recipe to take out 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.040
 the maximum match on twitter we tell you 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.810
 and we will repeat and be the description 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.820
 only of will dispute the first one goes 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.620
 order you change the photograph of 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.910
 profile on facebook then automatically 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.890
 the application will be responsible for 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.050
 you manage that same photograph and 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.940
 put it as a profile picture on twitter 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.320
 I think a lot of practice is that of 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.970
 Carlos when you find a picture of life 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.560
 here is something really solve that 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.420
 you say I used the photo you want 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.740
 change it everywhere so as not to have 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.660
 than doing it manually 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.550
 this is a pretty useful recipe and that 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.590
 there are a lot of people who use 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.450
 usually continuing with the theme of 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.310
 the photos is for me is the cover the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.350
 that comes to the one that is going to explain to me 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.880
 is the favorite I know Carlos, I know the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.380
 second recipe has to do also with 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.940
 the photographic subject what it does is 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.890
 next when you post a photo on 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.479
 instagram automatically you the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.520
 public on twitter and you will say then go 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.170
 novelty one that you public it of form 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.580
 native that this is the difference what 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.650
 does the application is to say always 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.000
 view the photo and it comes out as if 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.560
 would have posted on twitter me by 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.479
 example that with an example that I've 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.160
 used both the recipe and do it 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.690
 with instagram and it has many more challenges and 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.119
 much more 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.280
 these essentials now we go with 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.900
 another very simple but also very 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.479
 going back to the social network of 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.650
 facebook is very very likely that you 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.570
 you want to take the management of your networks 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.630
 Social simultaneously do as 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.410
 what you post on facebook 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.030
 it will automatically be published in your 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.230
 twitter account this is very useful about 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.480
 everything for people like us who 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.790
 we manage personal accounts 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.290
 of business seemed good way hey can 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.860
 publish it all at once and it would not have 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.110
 to be here now now I 'm going to 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.760
 put on facebook that I do not know if you want 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.739
 to be done on twitter so why 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.420
 please kind of another topic 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.310
 important and another recipe I think it's 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.930
 very useful for all those who 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.730
 use the twitter social network in a way 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.860
 personal but ticed and it says a touch 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.350
 professional as is that of tweets 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.390
 programmed is very interesting we can 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.910
 say what day of the week that now that 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.810
 we want it to say and we will have it 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.630
 automated so that if we in that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.050
 well then we are not available 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.310
 I have life 1.0 many people the 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.340
 good morning every night 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.019

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.069
 I'm ready, I'm ready 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.379
 come from the bull 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.379
 it is well born to be rooted 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.540
 is the dream of the sayings on android 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.920
 forums is called but here the truth that 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.480
 it's very good there are people who say hey 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.889
 me every time a person follows me 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.209
 I am very grateful and I want to give you 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.500
 thanks for doing me in your 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.209
 timeline in a very simple way 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.819
 let's be able to tell this application 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.200
 thank the new forum with the 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.239
 message that we want from two 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.340
 modes on the one hand through a message 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.200
 direct to this new follower or even 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.790
 we will be able to send you an email 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.530
 all these recipes are already 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.299
 predefined but if you want to edit them 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.549
 It is very easy to send an email I want 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.409
 it's a bit tiresome already and that 's what 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.730
 moved away to each one come in the next 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.409
 it also has to do with integration 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.849
 with other social networks like this 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.919
 saying is something quite important 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.389
 because we all use several networks 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.209
 without having to authorize the 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.370
 one is sometimes a little pain in the ass must 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.490
 see with facebook and with linkedin it's about 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.130
 that using the hashtag 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.930
 using hashtag and n said post 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.870

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.240

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.870

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.190
 good morning to everyone because but 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.900
 trying to do it to make a tweet 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.160
 There is something that you have worked on and wants 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.160
 be with your linkedin for people tell 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.500

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.780

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.910
 you have there we go with another recipe and it 's 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.040
 I find it very interesting and maybe not 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.780
 have you thought you have not taken into account 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.250
 many of you already know because it is 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.870
 one of the best applications 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.000
 valued in the google play which is 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.350
 will be in charge of storing content that 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.810
 we want to be able to read 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.520
 posteriori even without connection then in 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.170
 this case related to the social network 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.900
 from twitter every time we give 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.670
 let's give a favorite to a tweet 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.530
 automatically send it pocket is me 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.390
 love it and we end up with hamburg is 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.740
 very useful because you have it at hand and 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.870
 what you use are the ones we use 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.460
 powerful habitual way I think it's a 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.080
 of the most useful recipes you will find 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.270
 because we have it always very available 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.710
 I used at least many favorites in 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.110
 this sense of having something 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.490
 reminder another one that has to do 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.310
 also with favorites 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.310
 and it has to like us 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.230
 that nobody scares on youtube every time 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.210
 that you give to youtube video favorites 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.950
 I hope it's from andro networking forums to 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.190
 jota but also from other us 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.870
 also directly that twitter also 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.910
 pretty useful from the favorite liza and from 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.770
 automatic form twitter you will do what 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.840
 you see this video's favorite side and so the 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.430
 the whole world will know that he has left this 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.800
 favorite video you could put it with this 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.330
 video which I think would be very good and 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.550
 Last but not least 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.560
 important this is also very curious and 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.270
 this especially if you have a bit of 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.230
 diogenes syndrome and you want to save it 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.480
 everything there is a save functionality 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.830
 a lot in this case it's interesting to be able to 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.270
 tell this application that way 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.580
 also automatic and we forget 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.240
 that all the tweets that we 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.280
 we publish 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.470
 and even the retweets that we make 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.180
 convert it to a text sheet and we 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.830
 keep it in our google drive inn to 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.750
 backup mode who knows if one day 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.130
 you will have the possibility to look for a 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.450
 tweet two or three years ago impact 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.260
 also in the edition as Carlos says 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.670
 each one 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.620
 can be edited can be modified 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.210
 For example, just to prevent 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.140
 retweets are inside him inside 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.050
 because yes it is true that some 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.380
 user may or may not be interested 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.550
 today in thousand recipes for twitter for 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.510

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.970
 try it appetite that it seems like a 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.710
 little difficult but we have put in itself very 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.090

 magic all these things are going 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.690
 exacting automation and also we 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.600
 we leave in the description the link to the 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.760
 meeting that we did to http so we did not 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.500

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.860
