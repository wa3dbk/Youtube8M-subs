that is it the same way we just did this

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.750 
that is it the same way we just did this
also<00:03:10.349> for<00:03:10.530> some<00:03:10.709> reason<00:03:11.040> he<00:03:11.129> also<00:03:11.250> has<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.519> link

also for some reason he also has a link
to<00:03:11.879> the<00:03:12.000> bootloader<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:13.079> didn't<00:03:13.709> find<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.310> need

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
to the bootloader I didn't find the need

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.259

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
to flash the bootloader on 441 so I'm

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.220 
to flash the bootloader on 441 so I'm
not<00:03:18.419> going<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:18.630> be<00:03:18.690> doing<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.049> this<00:03:19.169> time

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
not going to be doing that this time

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.050

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
around either so now that the flash is

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.339 
around either so now that the flash is
completely<00:03:21.660> going<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.840> go<00:03:21.900> ahead<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.230> remove

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
completely going to go ahead and remove
