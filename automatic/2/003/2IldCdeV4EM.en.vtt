of the power to the provision cables

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.229 
of the power to the provision cables
that's<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:43.010> problem<00:00:43.309> or<00:00:43.730> what<00:00:44.300> it<00:00:44.480> is<00:00:46.239> that's

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
that's the problem or what it is that's

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.180 
that's the problem or what it is that's
one<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.750> that's<00:00:48.050> not<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.290> TV<00:00:48.649> cable<00:00:48.860> Jeff

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
one of the that's not a TV cable Jeff

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.260 
one of the that's not a TV cable Jeff
that's<00:00:49.430> the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.820 

okay<00:00:56.270> he's<00:00:56.450> back<00:00:56.720> up<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:57.140> on<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.260> bike<00:00:57.560> but

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
okay he's back up and on the bike but

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.490 
okay he's back up and on the bike but
that<00:00:58.040> is<00:00:58.280> devastating<00:00:58.610> for<00:00:59.150> James<00:00:59.570> Stewart<00:00:59.720> as

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
that is devastating for James Stewart as

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.780 
that is devastating for James Stewart as
he's<00:01:01.160> gonna<00:01:01.340> lose<00:01:01.580> almost<00:01:02.030> overlap<00:01:03.580> let's<00:01:04.580> see

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
he's gonna lose almost overlap let's see

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.710 
he's gonna lose almost overlap let's see
how<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:04.910> body<00:01:05.120> meter<00:01:05.360> screen

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
how the body meter screen

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.930 
how the body meter screen
it's<00:01:06.440> a<00:01:06.560> little<00:01:06.800> hucklebuck<00:01:07.280> off<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.730> side

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
it's a little hucklebuck off the side

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.210 
it's a little hucklebuck off the side
and<00:01:07.970> that's<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.690> risk<00:01:09.170> of<00:01:09.380> running<00:01:09.650> that<00:01:09.950> line

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
and that's the risk of running that line

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.430 
and that's the risk of running that line
where<00:01:10.550> where<00:01:11.030> Stewart<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:11.960> Reed<00:01:12.080> were<00:01:12.260> both

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
where where Stewart and Reed were both

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.790 
where where Stewart and Reed were both
really<00:01:12.800> close<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.400> Tuck<00:01:13.610> flops<00:01:13.910> there<00:01:14.800> is

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
really close to the Tuck flops there is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.440 
really close to the Tuck flops there is
that<00:01:16.040> when<00:01:16.160> you<00:01:16.250> do<00:01:16.430> make<00:01:16.580> a<00:01:16.640> mistake<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.360> you
