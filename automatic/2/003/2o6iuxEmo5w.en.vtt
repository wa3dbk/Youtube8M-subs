so you dip it all in here I'm getting
ready<00:00:04.900> for<00:00:05.110> practice<00:00:05.290> and<00:00:05.620> as<00:00:06.009> you<00:00:06.160> know<00:00:06.310> my

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:06.609 
ready for practice and as you know my

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.630 
ready for practice and as you know my
main<00:00:06.790> rig<00:00:07.029> is<00:00:07.330> the<00:00:07.680> XFX<00:00:08.680> to<00:00:08.950> from<00:00:09.250> practical

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:09.640 
main rig is the XFX to from practical

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.570

audio<00:00:09.969> and<00:00:10.240> in<00:00:10.780> order<00:00:10.960> to<00:00:11.080> control<00:00:11.530> that<00:00:11.769> i'll

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
audio and in order to control that i'll

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.190 
audio and in order to control that i'll
use<00:00:13.230> fractals<00:00:14.230> foot<00:00:14.650> controller<00:00:15.040> the<00:00:15.600> mfc<00:00:16.600> 101

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
use fractals foot controller the mfc 101

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.010 
use fractals foot controller the mfc 101
foot<00:00:17.410> controller<00:00:17.800> right<00:00:18.010> now<00:00:18.220> this<00:00:18.430> is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
foot controller right now this is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.960 
foot controller right now this is
programmed<00:00:20.020> so<00:00:20.320> that<00:00:20.350> i<00:00:20.770> can<00:00:21.040> activate<00:00:21.370> or

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
programmed so that i can activate or

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.270 
programmed so that i can activate or
deactivate<00:00:22.000> every<00:00:22.990> effect<00:00:23.380> from<00:00:23.890> my<00:00:24.010> patches

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
deactivate every effect from my patches

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.140 
deactivate every effect from my patches
I<00:00:24.700> kind<00:00:25.090> of<00:00:25.210> want<00:00:25.450> to<00:00:25.660> use<00:00:25.960> these<00:00:26.770> as<00:00:27.130> my<00:00:27.730> main

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
I kind of want to use these as my main

versions of their labels and i have a
few<00:00:51.760> here<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.059> one<00:00:52.809> of<00:00:52.929> them<00:00:53.050> is<00:00:53.079> going<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.530> be

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
few here and one of them is going to be

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.919 
few here and one of them is going to be
used<00:00:54.460> today<00:00:54.850> let<00:00:55.420> me<00:00:55.480> show<00:00:55.629> you<00:00:55.659> what<00:00:55.839> I<00:00:55.870> have

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
used today let me show you what I have

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.889 
used today let me show you what I have
these<00:00:56.829> are<00:00:56.980> labels<00:00:57.339> for<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.789> amps<00:00:58.149> high

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
these are labels for the amps high

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.040 
these are labels for the amps high
quality<00:00:59.319> labels<00:00:59.679> again<00:01:00.719> they're<00:01:01.719> magnetic

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
quality labels again they're magnetic

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.439 
quality labels again they're magnetic
these<00:01:02.920> are<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.249> updated<00:01:03.699> version<00:01:03.729> by<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.269> way

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
these are the updated version by the way

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.280 
these are the updated version by the way
so<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.680> laminated<00:01:06.520> on<00:01:06.970> top<00:01:07.720> is<00:01:07.900> going<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.110> last

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
so the laminated on top is going to last

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.600 
so the laminated on top is going to last
way<00:01:08.590> longer<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.850> I've<00:01:10.510> got<00:01:10.720> these<00:01:10.900> amps<00:01:11.410> I<00:01:11.620> got

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
way longer so I've got these amps I got

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.640 
way longer so I've got these amps I got
a<00:01:12.640> couple<00:01:12.880> more<00:01:13.620> controllers<00:01:14.620> here<00:01:16.290> one<00:01:17.290> that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
a couple more controllers here one that

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.740 
a couple more controllers here one that
i<00:01:17.680> will<00:01:17.920> use<00:01:18.130> as<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.340> volume<00:01:18.760> boost<00:01:19.030> so<00:01:19.480> that<00:01:19.660> if

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
i will use as a volume boost so that if

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.750 
i will use as a volume boost so that if
i'm<00:01:19.900> a<00:01:19.930> lead<00:01:20.350> situation<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:21.310> I<00:01:21.370> want<00:01:21.550> to<00:01:21.640> just

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
i'm a lead situation and I want to just

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.080 
i'm a lead situation and I want to just
bring<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.540> up<00:01:22.660> a<00:01:22.780> notch<00:01:23.290> I<00:01:23.530> can<00:01:23.680> use<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.090> wha

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
bring it up a notch I can use that wha

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.180 
bring it up a notch I can use that wha
if<00:01:25.630> I<00:01:25.720> want<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:25.990> activate<00:01:26.470> or<00:01:26.620> deactivate<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
if I want to activate or deactivate the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.030 
if I want to activate or deactivate the
wall<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.450> this<00:01:28.660> is<00:01:28.930> actually<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.500> pack<00:01:29.740> that

I am really interested in these five

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.490 
I am really interested in these five
labels<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:34.720> going<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.020> be<00:01:35.110> absolutely

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
labels are going to be absolutely

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.730 
labels are going to be absolutely
perfect<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:38.650> navigate<00:01:39.220> from<00:01:39.610> hatch<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.300> patch

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
perfect to navigate from hatch to patch

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.050 
perfect to navigate from hatch to patch
so<00:01:41.740> I'm<00:01:41.830> going<00:01:42.010> to<00:01:42.040> place<00:01:42.280> these<00:01:42.550> on<00:01:42.820> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
so I'm going to place these on the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.840 
so I'm going to place these on the
bottom<00:01:43.450> here<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:44.110> one<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.590> going<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.610> be<00:01:45.700> from

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
bottom here this one is going to be from

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.970 
bottom here this one is going to be from
it<00:01:46.000> clean<00:01:46.300> a<00:01:47.190> crunch<00:01:48.190> /<00:01:49.180> drive<00:01:49.660> i<00:01:50.020> usually<00:01:50.920> use

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
kind of stuff then i'm going to have a

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.500 
kind of stuff then i'm going to have a
rhythm<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:57.430> i'm<00:01:57.520> going<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.700> place<00:01:57.910> here<00:01:58.330> and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
rhythm then i'm going to place here and

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.260 
rhythm then i'm going to place here and
then<00:01:59.320> two<00:01:59.560> leads<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.100> this<00:02:00.190> is<00:02:00.340> exactly<00:02:00.520> how<00:02:01.030> I

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
then two leads and this is exactly how I

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.640 
then two leads and this is exactly how I
use<00:02:01.390> my<00:02:01.840> pedalboard<00:02:02.230> actually<00:02:04.650> they're

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
use my pedalboard actually they're

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.050 
use my pedalboard actually they're
magnetic<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.340> they're<00:02:06.460> not<00:02:06.610> going<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.850> move

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
magnetic so they're not going to move

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.959 
magnetic so they're not going to move
from<00:02:07.570> here<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.920> let's<00:02:09.129> plug<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.459> in<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.849> I'll

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:09.969 
from here so let's plug it in and I'll
