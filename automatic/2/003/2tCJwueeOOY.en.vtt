00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
obviously will get converted the past a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.179 
obviously will get converted the past a
bit<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> converse<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.530> obviously<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.979> wharf

you're<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> method<00:02:05.130> i'm<00:02:05.250> sure<00:02:05.479> 99%

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
you're going to be a method i'm sure 99%

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.999 
you're going to be a method i'm sure 99%
