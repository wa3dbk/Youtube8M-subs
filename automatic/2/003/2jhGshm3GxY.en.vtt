anything<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.609> it<00:02:51.060> first<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:51.780> all<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:51.959> think<00:02:52.379> if

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
anything like it first of all I think if

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.289 
anything like it first of all I think if
you<00:02:52.620> see<00:02:52.859> that<00:02:53.069> fish<00:02:53.340> out<00:02:53.609> there<00:02:53.819> get<00:02:54.060> out<00:02:54.269> of

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
you see that fish out there get out of

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.360 
you see that fish out there get out of
the<00:02:54.510> water<00:02:54.720> because<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.739> thing<00:02:56.010> could<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
the water because that thing could be a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.180 
the water because that thing could be a
real<00:02:56.730> hazard<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.569> don't<00:02:58.139> think<00:02:58.409> I<00:02:58.680> don't<00:02:59.010> think

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
real hazard I don't think I don't think

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.460 
real hazard I don't think I don't think
I<00:02:59.340> think<00:02:59.670> carps<00:03:00.030> are<00:03:00.180> vegetarians<00:03:01.049> so<00:03:01.139> I<00:03:01.260> don't

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
I think carps are vegetarians so I don't

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.990 
I think carps are vegetarians so I don't
think<00:03:01.650> we<00:03:01.769> have<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.040> worry<00:03:02.250> about<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.730> part

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
think we have to worry about that part

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.910 
think we have to worry about that part
of<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.359> but<00:03:03.810> they<00:03:03.989> could<00:03:04.170> sure<00:03:04.379> knocking

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
of it but they could sure knocking

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.789 
of it but they could sure knocking
