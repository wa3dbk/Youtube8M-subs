stove<00:00:11.530> which<00:00:12.429> is<00:00:12.610> the<00:00:12.790> MSR<00:00:13.209> reactor<00:00:13.749> you

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
stove which is the MSR reactor you

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.470 
stove which is the MSR reactor you
really<00:00:14.440> enjoyed<00:00:14.769> this<00:00:14.980> thing<00:00:15.249> so<00:00:15.969> this<00:00:16.090> comes

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
really enjoyed this thing so this comes

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.259 
really enjoyed this thing so this comes
with<00:00:16.660> a<00:00:16.689> few<00:00:17.140> different<00:00:17.199> parts<00:00:17.849> you<00:00:18.849> need<00:00:19.000> some

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:19.269 
with a few different parts you need some

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.009 
with a few different parts you need some
I<00:00:19.980> soap<00:00:20.980> pro<00:00:21.730> canister<00:00:22.359> which<00:00:22.599> is<00:00:22.720> a<00:00:22.750> mixture

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 
I soap pro canister which is a mixture

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.669 
I soap pro canister which is a mixture
of<00:00:23.759> gases<00:00:24.759> and<00:00:24.910> no<00:00:25.029> not<00:00:25.539> in<00:00:26.199> a<00:00:26.289> low-pressure

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
of gases and no not in a low-pressure

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.089 
of gases and no not in a low-pressure
canister<00:00:27.250> plastic<00:00:28.240> lid<00:00:28.509> with<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.529> drain<00:00:29.890> hole

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
canister plastic lid with a drain hole

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.320 
canister plastic lid with a drain hole
so<00:00:30.339> you<00:00:30.429> can<00:00:30.550> actually<00:00:30.669> drain<00:00:31.000> if<00:00:31.210> you're

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
so you can actually drain if you're

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.600 
so you can actually drain if you're
making<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.630> pasta<00:00:31.810> or<00:00:32.110> something<00:00:32.290> and<00:00:32.650> then<00:00:33.400> the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
making a pasta or something and then the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.830 
making a pasta or something and then the
stove<00:00:33.880> itself<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.700> and<00:00:36.880> of<00:00:36.940> course<00:00:37.180> teapot

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
stove itself in and of course teapot

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.440 
stove itself in and of course teapot
that<00:00:37.870> comes<00:00:38.230> with<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.560> system<00:00:39.000> which<00:00:40.000> has<00:00:40.240> the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
that comes with the system which has the

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.150 
that comes with the system which has the
heat<00:00:40.630> exchanger<00:00:40.780> fins<00:00:41.410> and<00:00:41.650> vents<00:00:41.950> on<00:00:42.130> the

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
heat exchanger fins and vents on the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.800 
heat exchanger fins and vents on the
side<00:00:42.550> it's<00:00:42.910> got<00:00:43.060> a<00:00:43.090> couple<00:00:43.300> features<00:00:43.540> that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
side it's got a couple features that

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.380 
side it's got a couple features that
make<00:00:43.990> it<00:00:44.020> different<00:00:44.380> and<00:00:44.740> one<00:00:45.730> is<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.240> it

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
make it different and one is that it

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.910 
make it different and one is that it
actually<00:00:46.570> has<00:00:46.990> a<00:00:47.940> pressure<00:00:48.940> regulator<00:00:49.360> in

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
actually has a pressure regulator in

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.520 
actually has a pressure regulator in
here<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.580> is<00:00:51.700> supposed<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.210> make<00:00:52.600> it<00:00:52.660> help<00:00:53.410> it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
here that is supposed to make it help it

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.980 
here that is supposed to make it help it
function<00:00:53.920> better<00:00:54.130> in<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.970> cold<00:00:55.270> at<00:00:55.720> high

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
function better in the cold at high

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.870 
function better in the cold at high
altitude<00:00:56.500> we<00:00:56.830> have<00:00:57.010> had<00:00:57.220> it<00:00:57.370> up<00:00:57.490> around<00:00:57.700> the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
altitude we have had it up around the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.120 
altitude we have had it up around the
passes<00:00:58.330> and<00:00:58.570> so<00:00:59.350> far<00:00:59.560> it<00:00:59.680> seems<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.980> work

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
passes and so far it seems to work

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.410 
passes and so far it seems to work
pretty<00:01:00.250> good<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:00.700> other<00:01:00.850> difference<00:01:01.030> is<00:01:01.360> that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
pretty good the other difference is that

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.889 
pretty good the other difference is that
instead<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.900> having<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.410> burner<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:04.180> got<00:01:04.509> this

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
instead of having a burner it's got this

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.529 
instead of having a burner it's got this
actual<00:01:05.409> catalytic<00:01:07.920> system<00:01:08.920> okay<00:01:09.909> so<00:01:10.240> without

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
actual catalytic system okay so without

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.719 
actual catalytic system okay so without
any<00:01:10.600> further<00:01:10.840> ado<00:01:11.289> let's<00:01:11.979> get<00:01:12.280> some<00:01:12.460> water<00:01:12.579> in

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
any further ado let's get some water in

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.429 
any further ado let's get some water in
here<00:01:12.759> and<00:01:13.090> see<00:01:13.299> how<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.630> smells<00:01:13.960> tastes<00:01:14.320> and

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
here and see how it smells tastes and

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.580 
here and see how it smells tastes and
feels<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.340> system<00:01:15.789> has<00:01:16.450> enough<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:17.469> know

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
feels so the system has enough you know

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.590 
feels so the system has enough you know
room<00:01:17.829> and<00:01:17.979> there's<00:01:18.130> perfect<00:01:18.909> for<00:01:19.090> two<00:01:19.240> people

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
room and there's perfect for two people

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.359 
room and there's perfect for two people
we're<00:01:19.840> usually<00:01:20.049> when<00:01:20.799> you<00:01:20.920> have<00:01:21.039> just<00:01:21.280> to

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
we're usually when you have just to

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.190 
we're usually when you have just to
react<00:01:21.579> when<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.149> have<00:01:22.299> just<00:01:22.539> a<00:01:22.630> jetboil<00:01:23.049> or

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
react when you have just a jetboil or

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.389 
react when you have just a jetboil or
something<00:01:23.409> like<00:01:23.469> that<00:01:23.530> it's<00:01:23.770> usually<00:01:24.070> just<00:01:24.100> a

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
something like that it's usually just a

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.029 
something like that it's usually just a
kind<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.939> solo<00:01:25.560> situation<00:01:26.560> where<00:01:26.829> you<00:01:26.950> only

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
for yourself but with this you got at

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.200 
for yourself but with this you got at
least<00:01:31.659> two<00:01:31.990> people<00:01:32.259> covered<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.939> now<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.090> wanna

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
least two people covered so now I wanna

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.880 
least two people covered so now I wanna
screw<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:38.020> catalytic<00:01:38.710> keep<00:01:39.700> thing<00:01:40.030> on<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:41.319> the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
screw the catalytic keep thing on to the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.999 
screw the catalytic keep thing on to the
gas<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.759> can<00:01:43.240> figure<00:01:43.479> out<00:01:43.630> how<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.869> do<00:01:44.139> it<00:01:45.179> go

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
gas I can figure out how to do it go

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.200 
gas I can figure out how to do it go
already<00:01:48.009> on

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.469 

then<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:53.260> need<00:01:53.590> fire<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:54.580> then<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:54.880> just<00:01:55.119> slide

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
then I need fire and then you just slide

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:09.180 
then I need fire and then you just slide
it<00:02:01.020> ya<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:06.070> barely<00:02:06.430> even<00:02:06.520> see<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.979> then

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
it ya can barely even see that and then

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.809 
it ya can barely even see that and then
you<00:02:09.459> just<00:02:09.640> pop<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.270> on<00:02:10.390> top<00:02:11.550> alright<00:02:12.550> it's<00:02:12.670> been

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
you just pop it on top alright it's been

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.220 
you just pop it on top alright it's been
just<00:02:12.940> three<00:02:13.180> or<00:02:13.209> four<00:02:13.420> minutes<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.930> whole

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
just three or four minutes in this whole

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.840 
just three or four minutes in this whole
liter<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.560> water<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.010> now<00:02:15.130> at<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.310> range<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.610> oil
