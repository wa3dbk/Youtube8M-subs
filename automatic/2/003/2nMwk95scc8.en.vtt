00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.730
 here guys good morning I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.680
 I entered the advanced multiplayer 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.570
 warfare this is my second game 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.940
 the first one I ever started finished after 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.309
 four seconds because I came in later 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 quite a lot that this was started then 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.529
 is the first gameplay I record e 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.180
 that I show you especially in the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.119
 my first game I lost half of the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.849
 time set the commands of this 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.340
 game that were set to the way 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.489
 of red hat and I can't play 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.620
 aiming with the alt key 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.770
 now I don't know how many in the world look with 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.809
 high sea des is one of these but that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.960
 I say one of these is the only asshole at 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.500
 world that turns with something else 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.500
 let's see let's see 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.430
 I really feel the need for a red dot 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:03.239
 on this weapon but so much so much 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.489
 I really do n't want the red dot 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.580
 because the viewfinder does not show me mine 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:14.280
 friend want we go wrong we go wrong 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.190
 there are people who already have 7 kills and me 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.020
 instead I already have three dead here three or two 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.840
 it seems to me three yes if we count that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.500
 starts at the beginning unworthy ok va 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.550
 well 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.130
 terrible this weapon because it does not make you 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.770
 see where the enemy you are holding is 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.780
 under fire for the moment is terrible 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.740
 Quaestor dott and an excellent weapon instead 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.400
 I think the soon approve the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.780
 when the red dot as soon as you unlock it 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.680
 seen and considered that it is necessary to do i 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.960
 milk point points then give you a 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:57.020
 bag but fuck agent is camper 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:01.010
 went how ugly the reflection in the in is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:08.540
 viewfinder ok change loadout to the next 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:13.540
 to the next he replies slutty bitch wherever 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:17.480
 you go out but only where did you go out? 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.590
 I don't know how to call them weapons 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.590
 Holy shit this hurts 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:31.230
 no, but there are already people who camouflage themselves 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:34.560
 use for monica the crisis 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.560
 that sucks 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.560
 well the walls 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.120
 that goes around practically pulling 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.900
 punches because he uses camouflage a 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.569
 stuck in the back and hand as well 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.569
 screwed the opponent I had bet 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.720
 come down that I know you saw me now 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.550
 come and get me nothing is a 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.550
 cowardly the loathsome litter 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.939
 yeah great fuck you six pounds eight 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.680
 11 boys are not dead either 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.269
 bad but on the other hand is my first 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.920
 game and these people a lot 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.730
 He's probably been playing this morning 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.620
 while at gatwick it was new for everyone and 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.959
 reds we got a very good score 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:43.170
 against others we were in the lead 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:44.870
 I do n't die anymore, I die i 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.640
 response times are not even 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.620
 too fast so it's much less 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.620
 frantic than usual 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.010
 not that this is bad a confinement 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.010
 more reasoned 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.210
 it's not bad as a concept ok let's say that 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.560
 it would have been below I thought it was someone 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.560
 stuck in the net 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.330
 and you have to know how to use jumps because 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.160
 it is not certain that they will take you where where 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:23.770
 you want but it dominates but this weapon does 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.140
 just bad and very painful 20 awards from 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:32.860
 near 10 10 from the guys in my media 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:33.760
 raised 1 to 1 is 1 1 is positive for 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.700
 as I see it 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.780
 pouring being a noob match 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.170
 the problem is these declines in framerates 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.390
 that prevent you from proceeding into the 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.120
 I play in a serene way because in 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.270
 effects che tifare not aim with ne stand 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.300
 fuck off, let's change equipment 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.540
 let's see what this offers us 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.540
 sauce 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.660
 this is a laser it would seem to be a 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.820
 laser 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.390
 maybe it's a weapon that comes back to us 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.390
 let's see 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:14.080
 seems to be a laser on that 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.080
 distance might also come in handy 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.199
 the ignorant deaths I want to try 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.669
 watch this weapon if it didn't kill 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.380
 he wouldn't have stabbed at 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:28.120
 shoulders 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:32.229
 I had a lot of choice or I died or reason 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.229
 together I will show you now 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.520
 and dead yes, however, does not give taste to this weapon 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:44.520
 that is, I don't feel the impact I don't feel the 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:49.740
 I don't like violent death of the enemy 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:53.240
 a little balanced run and shoot support 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.240
 balanced we try this 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:03.140
 this is balanced this weapon e 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:06.070
 balanced it doesn't seem like a star but it's almost 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.070
 specialist 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.319
 indeed it is certainly a specialist weapon 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:27.129
 no 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:30.490
 we are a bit 15 14 I am exceeding the average 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:32.889
 deaths defeat defeat goes to fans 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.169
 ass but it went well because I didn't 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.009
 made the shit match I'm halfway done 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.620
 Ranking 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.330
 it's fine my ping is also cagano 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.889
 in ping it's good ok thanks 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.389
 attention guys see you at 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.629

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.629
 to pay
