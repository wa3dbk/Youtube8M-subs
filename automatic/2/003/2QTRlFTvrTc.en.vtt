00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
think it's really cool it's just not a

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.250 
think it's really cool it's just not a
priority<00:02:13.239> for<00:02:13.660> me

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
priority for me

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.140

when it comes to gaming I could deal

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.140 
when it comes to gaming I could deal
without<00:02:16.360> VR<00:02:16.959> easily<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:18.129> a<00:02:18.189> lot<00:02:18.549> of<00:02:18.579> people

Phil Spencer was asked if VR is

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.069 
Phil Spencer was asked if VR is
something<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.909> xbox<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.510> going<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.930> do

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
something that the xbox is going to do

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.140 
something that the xbox is going to do
and<00:02:29.379> this<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.560> what<00:02:29.890> he<00:02:29.950> said<00:02:30.189> virtual<00:02:31.120> reality

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
and this is what he said virtual reality

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.390 
and this is what he said virtual reality
is<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> really<00:02:32.170> interesting<00:02:32.200> area<00:02:33.040> especially

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
is a really interesting area especially

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.880 
is a really interesting area especially
for<00:02:34.000> games<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.510> while<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.140> seems<00:02:35.409> like<00:02:35.680> it's

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
for games and while it seems like it's

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.039 
for games and while it seems like it's
been<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.430> over<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.970> horizon<00:02:37.090> for<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.840> last

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
been just over the horizon for the last

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.530 
been just over the horizon for the last
20<00:02:38.409> years<00:02:38.620> or<00:02:38.769> so<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.280> think<00:02:39.700> we<00:02:40.060> could<00:02:40.209> finally

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
20 years or so I think we could finally

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.599 
20 years or so I think we could finally
start<00:02:40.750> seeing<00:02:41.049> it<00:02:41.170> proved<00:02:41.440> out<00:02:41.680> soon<00:02:42.099> for<00:02:42.459> both

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
start seeing it proved out soon for both

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.210 
start seeing it proved out soon for both
