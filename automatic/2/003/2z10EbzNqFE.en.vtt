and<00:04:50.060> then<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:52.360> continue<00:04:53.360> doing<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:54.140> motion

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
and then I continue doing this motion

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.350

what<00:04:55.130> patella<00:04:55.520> slipped<00:04:55.730> again<00:05:01.030> for<00:05:02.030> this

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
what patella slipped again for this

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.250

guess<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:07.510> secure<00:05:08.510> it<00:05:08.630> tightly<00:05:08.750> anyway<00:05:09.620> so<00:05:10.160> I<00:05:10.520> do

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
guess I secure it tightly anyway so I do

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.300 
guess I secure it tightly anyway so I do
this<00:05:11.090> thing<00:05:11.840> massaging<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:13.160> know
