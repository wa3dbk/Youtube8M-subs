recommendations<00:02:17.410> as<00:02:17.620> far<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.859> inflating<00:02:18.400> your

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
recommendations as far as inflating your

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.370 
recommendations as far as inflating your
tires<00:02:20.190> now<00:02:21.190> on<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.519> tire<00:02:21.730> itself<00:02:22.380> there's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
tires now on the tire itself there's

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.080 
tires now on the tire itself there's
also<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.709> bunch<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:24.040> information<00:02:26.519> which<00:02:27.519> more

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
also a bunch of information which more

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.789 
also a bunch of information which more
than<00:02:28.269> just<00:02:28.450> who<00:02:28.930> makes<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.290> tire<00:02:29.470> or<00:02:29.650> what

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
than just who makes the tire or what

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.860 
than just who makes the tire or what
model<00:02:30.040> tired<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.489> but<00:02:31.420> you're<00:02:31.540> going<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.690> look

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
model tired is but you're going to look

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.280 
model tired is but you're going to look
for<00:02:33.000> especially<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.690> inflation

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
for especially for the inflation

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.690 
for especially for the inflation
pressure<00:02:36.000> you'll<00:02:37.000> look<00:02:37.209> for<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.980> little<00:02:38.980> tag

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
pressure you'll look for a little tag

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.140 
pressure you'll look for a little tag
like<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.090> which<00:02:40.329> is<00:02:40.680> max<00:02:41.680> load<00:02:42.090> okay<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
like this which is max load okay it

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.660 
like this which is max load okay it
tells<00:02:43.329> you<00:02:43.420> basically<00:02:43.690> how<00:02:43.870> much<00:02:44.400> weight<00:02:45.400> this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
tells you basically how much weight this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.289 
tells you basically how much weight this
sub<00:02:45.880> tire<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.390> support<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:48.160> then<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.819> tells

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
sub tire can support and then it tells

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.110 
sub tire can support and then it tells
you<00:02:49.480> what<00:02:50.319> pressure<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.670> maximum

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
you what pressure so the maximum

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.960 
you what pressure so the maximum
pressure<00:02:52.299> on<00:02:52.569> these<00:02:52.720> tires<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.170> 44<00:02:53.709> psi<00:02:53.970> now

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
pressure on these tires is 44 psi now

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.309 
pressure on these tires is 44 psi now
you'll<00:02:55.090> notice<00:02:55.299> that<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.750> pressure<00:02:56.079> is

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
you'll notice that that pressure is

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.660 
you'll notice that that pressure is
different<00:02:56.709> than<00:02:56.829> what<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.069> manufacturer

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
different than what the manufacturer

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.159 
different than what the manufacturer
recommends<00:02:59.220> this<00:03:00.220> 44<00:03:00.760> psi<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.269> what<00:03:02.049> they

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:02.169 
recommends this 44 psi is what they

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:03.720 
recommends this 44 psi is what they
would<00:03:02.290> want<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.650> use<00:03:02.859> if<00:03:03.160> you

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
would want you to use if you

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.750 
would want you to use if you
we're<00:03:03.849> running<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.330> at<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.720> max<00:03:04.930> load<00:03:05.760> now

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
we're running it at the max load now

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.070 
we're running it at the max load now
that<00:03:06.909> being<00:03:07.090> said<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.420> can<00:03:07.690> follow<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
that being said you can follow the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.920 
that being said you can follow the
manufacturer's<00:03:08.650> recommendations<00:03:09.930> but

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
manufacturer's recommendations but

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.490 
manufacturer's recommendations but
actually<00:03:11.319> what<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.739> can<00:03:12.190> do<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:13.440> if<00:03:14.440> you

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
actually what you can do is if you

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.330 
actually what you can do is if you
inflate<00:03:14.980> your<00:03:15.250> tire<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.879> 44<00:03:16.299> psi<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:17.590> will<00:03:17.799> give

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
inflate your tire to 44 psi it will give

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.330 
inflate your tire to 44 psi it will give
you<00:03:18.519> slightly<00:03:19.239> better<00:03:19.629> gas<00:03:20.110> mileage<00:03:20.340> now

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
you slightly better gas mileage now

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.490 
you slightly better gas mileage now
that'll<00:03:21.670> be<00:03:21.700> at<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.120> cost<00:03:22.510> of<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.049> will<00:03:23.230> where

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
that'll be at a cost of it will where

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.470 
that'll be at a cost of it will where
the<00:03:23.950> center<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.459> tire<00:03:24.700> just<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.269> little

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
the center of the tire just a little

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.839 
the center of the tire just a little
more<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:26.620> also<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.099> tire<00:03:27.340> will<00:03:27.519> provide<00:03:27.790> a

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
more and also the tire will provide a

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.250 
more and also the tire will provide a
harsher<00:03:28.480> ride<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:30.760> generally<00:03:31.690> do<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:31.959> if<00:03:32.170> I

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
harsher ride so I generally do this if I

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.990 
harsher ride so I generally do this if I
Drive<00:03:32.440> on<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.650> long<00:03:32.920> trip<00:03:33.129> on<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.400> highway<00:03:33.610> that<00:03:33.940> I

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
Drive on a long trip on a highway that I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.059 
Drive on a long trip on a highway that I
know<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.810> gonna<00:03:34.989> be<00:03:35.170> pretty<00:03:35.379> smooth<00:03:35.709> I'll

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
know is gonna be pretty smooth I'll

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.509 
know is gonna be pretty smooth I'll
inflate<00:03:36.579> the<00:03:37.379> pressure<00:03:38.379> of<00:03:38.560> my<00:03:38.680> tires<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.280> the

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
inflate the pressure of my tires to the

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.569 
inflate the pressure of my tires to the
maximum<00:03:39.940> recommendation<00:03:40.629> on<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.349> tire<00:03:41.590> but

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
maximum recommendation on the tire but

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.099 
maximum recommendation on the tire but
then<00:03:42.760> when<00:03:42.879> I'm<00:03:42.970> driving<00:03:43.299> around<00:03:43.390> town<00:03:43.750> and

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
then when I'm driving around town and

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.750 
then when I'm driving around town and
know<00:03:44.349> that<00:03:44.500> I'm<00:03:44.650> gonna<00:03:44.829> be<00:03:44.950> on<00:03:45.069> less<00:03:45.489> smooth

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
know that I'm gonna be on less smooth

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.140 
know that I'm gonna be on less smooth
roads<00:03:46.030> I'll<00:03:46.799> inflate<00:03:47.799> them<00:03:48.069> at<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.640> regular

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
roads I'll inflate them at the regular

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.530 
roads I'll inflate them at the regular
pressure<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.400> all<00:03:51.670> being<00:03:51.879> said<00:03:54.540> checking

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
pressure so that all being said checking

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.119 
pressure so that all being said checking
the<00:03:55.720> pressure<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:56.079> your<00:03:56.109> tire<00:03:56.379> and<00:03:56.709> inflating

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
the pressure in your tire and inflating

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.430 
the pressure in your tire and inflating
you're<00:03:57.730> gonna<00:03:57.819> see<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.150> little<00:03:58.599> Val<00:03:58.900> like<00:03:59.200> this

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
you're gonna see a little Val like this

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.940 
you're gonna see a little Val like this
on<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.950> rim<00:04:01.140> unscrew<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.260> cap<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.769> have<00:04:02.920> a

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
on the rim unscrew the cap and I have a

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.650 
on the rim unscrew the cap and I have a
few<00:04:03.250> different<00:04:03.599> gauges<00:04:05.879> you're<00:04:06.879> gonna<00:04:07.000> always

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
few different gauges you're gonna always

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.740 
few different gauges you're gonna always
have<00:04:07.930> one<00:04:08.079> of<00:04:08.169> these<00:04:08.230> gauges<00:04:08.650> in<00:04:08.739> your<00:04:08.859> car<00:04:09.069> and

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
have one of these gauges in your car and

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.629 
have one of these gauges in your car and
this<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.989> little<00:04:11.260> bit<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.620> radial<00:04:12.430> gauge

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
this is a little bit of a radial gauge

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:19.409 
this is a little bit of a radial gauge
and<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.630> press<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:13.959> onto<00:04:14.349> the<00:04:16.769> bow<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:19.180> you

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
and you press it onto the bow and you

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.370 
and you press it onto the bow and you
can<00:04:19.539> see<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.910> arrow<00:04:21.910> goes<00:04:22.240> up<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.570> 190

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
can see that the arrow goes up to 190

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.670 
can see that the arrow goes up to 190
kPa<00:04:23.770> or<00:04:24.690> 25<00:04:25.889> psi<00:04:26.889> so<00:04:27.789> this<00:04:28.120> needs<00:04:28.599> some<00:04:29.320> air<00:04:29.500> in

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
kPa or 25 psi so this needs some air in

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.440 
kPa or 25 psi so this needs some air in
this<00:04:29.770> tire<00:04:30.010> because<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:30.940> should<00:04:31.120> be<00:04:31.270> at<00:04:31.360> either

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
this tire because it should be at either

stick style gauge or again you press it
on<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.110> valve<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:43.770> then<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:44.889> tells<00:04:45.190> you

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
on to the valve and then it tells you

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.560 
on to the valve and then it tells you
what<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.080> pressure<00:04:47.349> is<00:04:48.120> right<00:04:49.120> there<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.450> it

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
what the pressure is right there and it

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.290 
what the pressure is right there and it
agrees<00:04:50.050> with<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.260> other<00:04:50.380> gauge<00:04:50.590> at<00:04:50.800> 26<00:04:51.340> the

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
agrees with the other gauge at 26 the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.779 
agrees with the other gauge at 26 the
last<00:04:52.330> style<00:04:52.950> well<00:04:53.950> not<00:04:54.099> the<00:04:54.220> last<00:04:54.250> style<00:04:54.580> but

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
last style well not the last style but

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.180 
last style well not the last style but
another<00:04:54.970> style<00:04:55.360> it's<00:04:55.570> common<00:04:55.960> is<00:04:56.139> when<00:04:56.950> you<00:04:57.070> go

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
another style it's common is when you go

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.029 
another style it's common is when you go
to<00:04:57.250> a<00:04:57.310> gas<00:04:57.520> station<00:04:57.849> and<00:04:58.210> you<00:04:58.270> put<00:04:58.539> some<00:04:59.039> change

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
to a gas station and you put some change

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.740 
to a gas station and you put some change
into<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.580> Machine<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:00.910> it<00:05:01.210> turns<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:01.660> little

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
into the Machine and it turns a little

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.140 
into the Machine and it turns a little
compressor<00:05:02.229> on<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.650> they'll<00:05:03.280> have<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:03.669> type

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
compressor on and they'll have this type

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.810 
compressor on and they'll have this type
of<00:05:04.180> a<00:05:06.120> valve<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.539> engage<00:05:08.260> at<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.590> end<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.550> you

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
of a valve and engage at the end and you

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.080 
of a valve and engage at the end and you
press<00:05:10.120> it<00:05:10.270> on<00:05:10.360> to<00:05:10.539> your<00:05:11.669> tire<00:05:12.669> gauge<00:05:13.330> and

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
press it on to your tire gauge and

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.070 
press it on to your tire gauge and
pops<00:05:15.990> up<00:05:16.230> here<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.919> can<00:05:17.070> see<00:05:17.660> it<00:05:18.660> gives<00:05:18.840> you<00:05:18.990> a

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
pops up here you can see it gives you a

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.870 
pops up here you can see it gives you a
pressure<00:05:19.380> reading<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.370> this<00:05:20.460> is<00:05:20.610> actually

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
pressure reading and this is actually

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.810 
pressure reading and this is actually
says<00:05:21.060> about<00:05:21.090> 30<00:05:21.540> psi<00:05:21.840> I<00:05:22.350> believe<00:05:23.100> this<00:05:23.280> is<00:05:23.520> a

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
says about 30 psi I believe this is a

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.600 
says about 30 psi I believe this is a
little<00:05:24.780> off<00:05:25.020> but<00:05:25.430> then<00:05:28.220> put<00:05:29.220> some<00:05:29.430> pressure

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
little off but then put some pressure

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.540 
little off but then put some pressure
into<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.090> tires

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
into the tires

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.030 
into the tires
let<00:05:32.550> off<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:33.750> then<00:05:34.470> you<00:05:34.530> can<00:05:34.590> see<00:05:34.800> that<00:05:34.949> the

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
let off and then you can see that the

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:44.090 
let off and then you can see that the
pressure<00:05:36.000> is<00:05:36.210> arisen<00:05:36.479> about<00:05:36.900> 4<00:05:37.290> pounds<00:05:43.100> and

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
pressure is arisen about 4 pounds and

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.530 
pressure is arisen about 4 pounds and
now<00:05:44.400> I'm<00:05:44.570> 36<00:05:45.570> psi<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.639> again<00:05:47.639> like<00:05:47.850> it<00:05:48.000> you<00:05:48.360> saw

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
now I'm 36 psi and again like it you saw

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.520 
now I'm 36 psi and again like it you saw
on<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:50.180> door<00:05:51.180> tag<00:05:51.419> that's<00:05:51.900> cold

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
on the door tag that's cold

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.020 
on the door tag that's cold
so<00:05:52.710> my<00:05:52.830> tires<00:05:53.100> are<00:05:53.250> cold<00:05:53.430> I<00:05:53.669> haven't<00:05:53.940> been

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
so my tires are cold I haven't been

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.300 
so my tires are cold I haven't been
driving<00:05:54.389> around<00:05:54.510> as<00:05:54.900> you<00:05:55.560> drive<00:05:55.800> around<00:05:55.950> your

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
driving around as you drive around your

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.730 
driving around as you drive around your
tires<00:05:56.580> will<00:05:56.910> increase<00:05:57.300> in<00:05:57.450> pressure<00:05:57.740> usually

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
tires will increase in pressure usually

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.810 
tires will increase in pressure usually
about<00:05:59.490> a<00:05:59.550> pound<00:05:59.910> or<00:06:00.120> two<00:06:01.310> so<00:06:02.310> that<00:06:02.340> you<00:06:02.580> have

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
about a pound or two so that you have

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.529 
about a pound or two so that you have
warm<00:06:03.450> tires<00:06:03.720> you<00:06:03.960> want<00:06:04.139> it<00:06:04.229> might<00:06:04.380> want<00:06:04.560> to<00:06:05.539> you

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
warm tires you want it might want to you

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.420 
warm tires you want it might want to you
can<00:06:06.750> put<00:06:07.139> a<00:06:07.169> little<00:06:07.440> more<00:06:07.650> pressure<00:06:07.680> in<00:06:08.130> than

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
can put a little more pressure in than

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.159 
can put a little more pressure in than
you<00:06:08.520> want<00:06:08.760> this<00:06:09.030> as<00:06:09.270> they<00:06:09.630> cool<00:06:09.810> down<00:06:09.870> the

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
you want this as they cool down the

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.719 
you want this as they cool down the
pressure<00:06:10.350> will<00:06:10.530> go<00:06:10.650> down<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:11.100> the

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
pressure will go down to the

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.300 
pressure will go down to the
