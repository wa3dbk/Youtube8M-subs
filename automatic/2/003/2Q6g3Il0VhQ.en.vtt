00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
do is be able to block the front of the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.530 
do is be able to block the front of the
car<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.349> can't<00:00:13.590> take<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:13.950> much<00:00:14.070> Aaron<00:00:14.610> how

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
car so it can't take so much Aaron how

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.779 
car so it can't take so much Aaron how
I've<00:00:15.690> done<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.379> car<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> 2000

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
I've done it on this car this is a 2000

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.090 
I've done it on this car this is a 2000
Honda<00:00:18.090> Insight<00:00:18.350> you<00:00:19.350> can<00:00:19.529> see<00:00:19.710> at<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> top

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
Honda Insight you can see at the top

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.439 
Honda Insight you can see at the top
here<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.670> actually<00:00:21.060> use<00:00:21.510> pipe<00:00:21.810> insulation<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
here I actually use pipe insulation and

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
here I actually use pipe insulation and
pipe<00:00:24.449> insulation<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.230> great<00:00:25.500> because<00:00:25.920> it's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
pipe insulation is great because it's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.269 
pipe insulation is great because it's
basically<00:00:27.240> waterproof<00:00:27.990> very<00:00:28.710> very<00:00:29.039> very

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
basically waterproof very very very

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.179 
basically waterproof very very very
water<00:00:29.640> resistant<00:00:30.380> so<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:31.470> you're<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.099> know

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
water resistant so if you're you know

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.069 
water resistant so if you're you know
going<00:00:32.219> through<00:00:32.550> snow<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:32.969> lots<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> rain<00:00:33.719> or

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
going through snow or lots of rain or

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.560 
going through snow or lots of rain or
ice<00:00:34.309> it's<00:00:35.309> gonna<00:00:35.460> really<00:00:35.700> repel<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.329> well

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
ice it's gonna really repel that well

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.270 
ice it's gonna really repel that well
but<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.140> gonna<00:00:37.260> let<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> air<00:00:37.770> in

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
but it's not gonna let the air in

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.180 
but it's not gonna let the air in
that's<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.510> also<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.440> pretty<00:00:40.739> resilient

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
that's and it also is pretty resilient

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.760 
that's and it also is pretty resilient
to<00:00:41.489> heat<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.719> not<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.379> getting<00:00:43.530> too

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
to heat so not that it's getting too

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.990 
to heat so not that it's getting too
close<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.190> anything<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:45.800> melt<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.430> it's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
close to anything to melt it but it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.279 
close to anything to melt it but it's
just<00:00:48.180> good<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.260> case

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
just good to have that just in case

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.700 
just good to have that just in case
something<00:00:50.129> that's<00:00:50.280> pretty<00:00:51.440> non<00:00:52.440> flammable

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
something that's pretty non flammable

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.670 
something that's pretty non flammable
and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.120> at<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> bottom<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.320> see

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and then here at the bottom you can see

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.260 
and then here at the bottom you can see
that<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.239> actually<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:58.820> coroplast<00:00:59.820> which

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that I actually have coroplast which

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.229 
that I actually have coroplast which
some<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.989> may<00:01:01.140> not<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.440> familiar<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:02.239> is

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
some of you may not be familiar with is

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.410 
some of you may not be familiar with is
basically<00:01:04.729> basically<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:07.460> type<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> plastic

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
basically basically the type of plastic

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.539 
basically basically the type of plastic
that's<00:01:09.630> used<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.110> make<00:01:10.140> political<00:01:10.590> signs<00:01:11.130> so

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that's used to make political signs so

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.219 
that's used to make political signs so
if<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.030> an<00:01:12.180> election<00:01:12.570> coming<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:13.020> you'll

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
if you have an election coming up you'll

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.010 
if you have an election coming up you'll
probably<00:01:13.409> see<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:13.680> signs<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> road

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
probably see some signs on the road

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.370 
probably see some signs on the road
either<00:01:16.020> 4<00:01:16.409> by<00:01:16.590> 8<00:01:16.619> or<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.640> know<00:01:18.630> small<00:01:19.049> little

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
either 4 by 8 or you know small little

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.039 
either 4 by 8 or you know small little
ones<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.740> are<00:01:19.950> plastic<00:01:20.509> they<00:01:21.509> actually<00:01:21.869> look

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
ones that are plastic they actually look

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.890 
ones that are plastic they actually look
like<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.270> see<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> reason

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
like this and you can see the reason

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.480 
like this and you can see the reason
they<00:01:25.020> call<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> corrugated<00:01:25.890> plastic<00:01:26.009> is

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
they call it corrugated plastic is

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.310 
they call it corrugated plastic is
because<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.000> corrugated<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:28.170> usually

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
because it's corrugated it's usually

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.050 
because it's corrugated it's usually
white<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:28.979> side<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:29.939> was

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
white on one side and then this one was

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
white on one side and then this one was
printed<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.540> because<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.049> was<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.590> fact<00:01:31.860> an

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
printed on because it was in fact an

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.789 
printed on because it was in fact an
election<00:01:32.520> sign<00:01:33.110> basically<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> did<00:01:34.380> here

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
election sign basically what I did here

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.800 
election sign basically what I did here
is<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:36.570> put<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:38.119> kind<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.240> cut<00:01:39.630> where

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
is they just put it on kind of cut where

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.810 
is they just put it on kind of cut where
I<00:01:39.840> would<00:01:40.049> want<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.470> match<00:01:41.340> up<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
I would want it to match up on the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
I would want it to match up on the
grille<00:01:42.110> leaving<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.649> room<00:01:43.829> so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
grille leaving a little bit of room so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.620 
grille leaving a little bit of room so
the<00:01:44.159> engine<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.490> still<00:01:44.880> breathe<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> bit<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the engine can still breathe a bit I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.780 
the engine can still breathe a bit I
actually<00:01:46.229> used<00:01:46.619> white<00:01:46.920> chloroplasts<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.700> can

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
actually used white chloroplasts you can

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.149 
actually used white chloroplasts you can
see<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.329> white<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.380> put<00:01:49.649> black

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
see up here it's white and I put black

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.840 
see up here it's white and I put black
duct<00:01:50.520> tape<00:01:50.700> over<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> how<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> attached<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
duct tape over it and how I attached it

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.950 
duct tape over it and how I attached it
was<00:01:54.360> um

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
was um

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.230 
was um
I<00:01:54.990> put<00:01:55.920> zip<00:01:56.189> ties<00:01:56.369> through<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.030> zip

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
I put zip ties through it and then I zip

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.139 
I put zip ties through it and then I zip
tied<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.600> into<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> back<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.939> grille<00:01:59.939> in

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
tied it into the back of the grille in

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.800 
tied it into the back of the grille in
there<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:02.549> top<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.969> zip<00:02:03.210> tied<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.630> two

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
there and the top I zip tied in two

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.870 
there and the top I zip tied in two
different<00:02:03.960> spots<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.619> secure<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.250> then<00:02:05.790> I

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
different spots to secure it and then I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.669 
different spots to secure it and then I
also<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.299> put<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.960> two<00:02:07.200> different<00:02:07.530> pieces

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
also I put it in two different pieces

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.039 
also I put it in two different pieces
so<00:02:08.799> that<00:02:08.950> if<00:02:09.219> for<00:02:10.030> some<00:02:10.090> reason<00:02:10.599> we<00:02:10.719> injured

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
so that if for some reason we injured

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.509 
so that if for some reason we injured
about<00:02:11.200> two<00:02:11.379> hot<00:02:11.560> say<00:02:11.859> I<00:02:11.890> was<00:02:12.069> on<00:02:12.219> the<00:02:12.280> freeway

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
about two hot say I was on the freeway

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.270 
about two hot say I was on the freeway
for<00:02:12.909> a<00:02:12.969> really<00:02:13.180> long<00:02:13.359> time<00:02:13.599> I<00:02:13.870> can<00:02:14.590> simply<00:02:15.040> just

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
for a really long time I can simply just

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.929 
for a really long time I can simply just
pull<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.239> out<00:02:16.450> like<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:18.549> if<00:02:18.730> it

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
pull this one out like that and if it

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:24.360 
pull this one out like that and if it
gets<00:02:19.569> cool<00:02:19.930> again<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.909> can<00:02:21.909> hopefully<00:02:23.129> just<00:02:24.129> put

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
gets cool again I can hopefully just put

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.670 
gets cool again I can hopefully just put
it<00:02:24.430> right<00:02:24.459> back<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:25.120> there<00:02:25.379> using<00:02:26.379> two

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
it right back up in there using two

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.959 
it right back up in there using two
hands<00:02:28.379> so<00:02:29.379> that's<00:02:29.709> one<00:02:29.920> way<00:02:30.069> to<00:02:30.099> do<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.489> or<00:02:30.670> you

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
hands so that's one way to do it or you

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.459 
hands so that's one way to do it or you
can<00:02:31.120> leave<00:02:31.299> it<00:02:31.329> obviously<00:02:32.079> you<00:02:32.139> can<00:02:32.319> just

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
can leave it obviously you can just

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.770 
can leave it obviously you can just
leave<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.650> like<00:02:32.859> that<00:02:32.889> block<00:02:33.489> a<00:02:33.849> little<00:02:34.510> bit

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
leave it like that block a little bit

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.160 
leave it like that block a little bit
more<00:02:34.959> air<00:02:36.150> anyway<00:02:37.150> that's<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.629> great<00:02:37.959> way<00:02:38.139> to

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
more air anyway that's a great way to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.379 
more air anyway that's a great way to
help<00:02:38.379> your<00:02:38.590> car<00:02:38.829> warm<00:02:39.099> up<00:02:39.310> especially<00:02:40.120> when

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389 
help your car warm up especially when

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.949 
help your car warm up especially when
it's<00:02:40.599> really<00:02:40.810> cold<00:02:40.930> outside<00:02:42.480> if<00:02:43.480> you're<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.930> a

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
it's really cold outside if you're in a

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.990 
it's really cold outside if you're in a
pretty<00:02:44.439> tropical<00:02:44.739> climate<00:02:45.430> like<00:02:45.549> I<00:02:45.730> am<00:02:45.849> in

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
pretty tropical climate like I am in

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.059 
pretty tropical climate like I am in
California<00:02:46.569> right<00:02:46.720> now<00:02:46.780> it's<00:02:47.409> not<00:02:47.590> needed<00:02:47.919> too

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
California right now it's not needed too

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.640 
California right now it's not needed too
much<00:02:48.450> with<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.599> exception<00:02:50.049> of<00:02:50.139> the<00:02:50.260> fact<00:02:50.470> that

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
much with the exception of the fact that

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.440 
much with the exception of the fact that
it's<00:02:51.489> great<00:02:51.849> for<00:02:53.010> me<00:02:54.010> because<00:02:54.189> it<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:55.090> faster

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
it's great for me because it the faster

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.699 
it's great for me because it the faster
I<00:02:55.510> can<00:02:55.540> warm<00:02:55.840> up<00:02:55.930> my<00:02:56.079> engine<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.560> more

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
I can warm up my engine the more

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.129 
I can warm up my engine the more
fuel-efficient<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.609> a<00:02:57.849> warm<00:02:58.719> engine<00:02:59.019> is

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
fuel-efficient it is a warm engine is

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.539 
fuel-efficient it is a warm engine is
much<00:02:59.319> more<00:02:59.530> fuel-efficient<00:03:00.159> than<00:03:00.189> a<00:03:00.310> cold

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
much more fuel-efficient than a cold

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.690 
much more fuel-efficient than a cold
engine<00:03:00.939> and<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:02.500> allows<00:03:02.769> me<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.010> go<00:03:03.219> into<00:03:03.400> my

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
engine and it allows me to go into my

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.630 
engine and it allows me to go into my
hybrid<00:03:04.299> functionalities<00:03:05.049> even<00:03:05.379> quicker

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.450 

so<00:03:08.270> here's<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.600> quick<00:03:09.470> little<00:03:09.740> idea<00:03:10.070> of<00:03:10.160> what

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
so here's a quick little idea of what

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.360 
so here's a quick little idea of what
you<00:03:10.580> can<00:03:10.790> do<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.500> help<00:03:12.500> your<00:03:12.680> engine<00:03:13.070> warm<00:03:13.250> up

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
you can do to help your engine warm up

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.210 
you can do to help your engine warm up
quicker<00:03:13.960> so<00:03:14.960> you<00:03:15.020> can<00:03:15.200> have<00:03:15.410> your<00:03:15.950> heater

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
quicker so you can have your heater

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.410 
quicker so you can have your heater
faster<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:18.550> be<00:03:19.550> able<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.790> get<00:03:19.910> better<00:03:20.090> fuel

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
faster and be able to get better fuel

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.970 
faster and be able to get better fuel
efficient<00:03:25.750> one<00:03:26.750> more<00:03:26.930> angle<00:03:27.140> here<00:03:27.620> with<00:03:27.830> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
efficient one more angle here with the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.180 
efficient one more angle here with the
pipe<00:03:28.190> insulation<00:03:28.840> on<00:03:29.840> how<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:30.350> looks<00:03:30.680> now

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
pipe insulation on how that looks now

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.280 
pipe insulation on how that looks now
it's<00:03:32.020> sitting<00:03:33.020> in<00:03:33.260> there<00:03:34.720> also<00:03:35.720> another<00:03:36.020> thing

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
it's sitting in there also another thing

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.870 
it's sitting in there also another thing
you<00:03:36.410> can<00:03:36.590> do<00:03:36.680> with<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.890> pipe<00:03:37.070> insulation<00:03:37.520> is

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
you can do with the pipe insulation is

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.250 
you can do with the pipe insulation is
actually<00:03:38.810> cut<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.200> up<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:40.660> shove<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.690> into<00:03:41.990> the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
actually cut it up and shove it into the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.370 
actually cut it up and shove it into the
pieces<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.610> grill<00:03:43.910> down<00:03:44.150> there<00:03:44.420> if<00:03:44.810> it's

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
pieces of the grill down there if it's

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.970 
pieces of the grill down there if it's
great<00:03:45.620> because<00:03:45.830> it's<00:03:46.130> very<00:03:46.310> moldable<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.980> it

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
great because it's very moldable and it

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.820 
great because it's very moldable and it
compresses<00:03:49.340> really<00:03:49.700> easy<00:03:50.230> so<00:03:51.230> it<00:03:51.410> can<00:03:51.590> fit

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
compresses really easy so it can fit

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.310 
compresses really easy so it can fit
into<00:03:52.010> those<00:03:52.220> little<00:03:52.430> places<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:53.930> can<00:03:54.140> see

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
into those little places so you can see

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.860 
into those little places so you can see
here<00:03:54.560> what<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:54.770> did<00:03:54.890> is<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.280> just<00:03:55.489> have<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:56.500> roll<00:03:57.500> of

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
here what I did is I just have a roll of

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.720 
here what I did is I just have a roll of
the<00:03:59.870> pipe<00:04:00.380> insulation<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.280> just<00:04:01.489> kind<00:04:01.670> of

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
the pipe insulation and I just kind of

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.720 
the pipe insulation and I just kind of
put<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:01.940> in<00:04:02.120> there<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.980> it<00:04:03.980> actually<00:04:04.280> sits

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
put it in there and it actually sits

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.520 
put it in there and it actually sits
perfectly<00:04:04.910> one<00:04:05.450> half<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.930> because<00:04:06.170> it's

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
perfectly one half of it because it's

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.199 
perfectly one half of it because it's
slit<00:04:06.830> down<00:04:06.950> hole<00:04:07.220> metal<00:04:07.520> it's<00:04:07.700> kind<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:07.970> tucked

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
slit down hole metal it's kind of tucked

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.479 
slit down hole metal it's kind of tucked
under<00:04:08.540> my<00:04:08.690> bumper<00:04:09.050> there<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.590> then<00:04:10.190> I<00:04:10.280> just

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
under my bumper there and then I just
