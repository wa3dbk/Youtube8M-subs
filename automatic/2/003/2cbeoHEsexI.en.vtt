going to be sharing some thoughts on

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:43.640 
going to be sharing some thoughts on
filters<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:36.079> there's<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.649> box<00:00:38.540> for<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.600> B+<00:00:40.140> w<00:00:42.650> UV

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
filters and there's a box for a B+ w UV

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.140 
filters and there's a box for a B+ w UV
haze<00:00:43.890> filter<00:00:46.190> multi-coated<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.880> what<00:00:48.060> the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
haze filter multi-coated that's what the

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.460 
haze filter multi-coated that's what the
MRC<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:49.170> under<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> 67<00:00:50.280> means<00:00:51.470> very

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
MRC there under the 67 means very

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.510 
MRC there under the 67 means very
important<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.560> use<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.070> filter

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
important so what do we use that filter

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.580 
important so what do we use that filter
for<00:00:57.530> well<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:59.040> years<00:01:00.230> photographers<00:01:01.230> used<00:01:01.470> to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
for well for years photographers used to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.899 
for well for years photographers used to
say<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.210> protect<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.720> front<00:01:05.060> lens<00:01:06.060> element

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
say to protect the front lens element

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.790 
say to protect the front lens element
which<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.140> under<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.380> filter<00:01:10.890> there<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:13.620> see

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
which is under that filter there you see

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.649 
which is under that filter there you see
the<00:01:13.830> filter<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.820> I'll<00:01:15.210> take<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.600> off

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the filter on there I'll take that off

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.290 
the filter on there I'll take that off
and<00:01:16.380> get<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:16.979> out<00:01:17.190> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> way<00:01:18.440> okay<00:01:20.300> so

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
and get this out of the way okay so

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.510 
and get this out of the way okay so
there's<00:01:21.510> that<00:01:21.720> B<00:01:21.960> plus<00:01:22.200> W<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.620> that<00:01:22.890> box<00:01:23.190> came

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
there's that B plus W that that box came

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.840 
there's that B plus W that that box came
from<00:01:23.549> there's<00:01:24.090> your<00:01:24.270> front<00:01:25.490> element<00:01:26.540> and

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
from there's your front element and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.500 
from there's your front element and
years<00:01:29.850> ago<00:01:30.979> that<00:01:31.979> piece<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.370> glass<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:33.150> front

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
years ago that piece of glass up front

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.980 
years ago that piece of glass up front
was<00:01:33.840> covered<00:01:34.320> with<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:35.729> coating<00:01:36.390> well<00:01:36.840> they

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
was covered with a coating well they

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.260 
was covered with a coating well they
still<00:01:37.200> are<00:01:37.350> there<00:01:37.560> multi-coated<00:01:38.060> but<00:01:39.060> years

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
still are there multi-coated but years

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.810 
still are there multi-coated but years
ago<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.720> coatings<00:01:40.140> weren't<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.650> good<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.250> so

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
ago the coatings weren't so good and so

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
ago the coatings weren't so good and so
you<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.570> touch<00:01:42.869> them<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> coatings

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
you just touch them and the coatings

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.230 
you just touch them and the coatings
would<00:01:44.010> get<00:01:44.159> screwed<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.610> I'm<00:01:44.729> talking<00:01:45.090> 50

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
would get screwed up I'm talking 50

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.000 
would get screwed up I'm talking 50

coatings<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:51.380> very<00:01:52.380> strong<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:54.560> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
coatings are very strong and the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.190 
coatings are very strong and the
technology<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.340> fantastic<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.299> people<00:01:57.750> argue

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
technology is fantastic so people argue

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.390 
technology is fantastic so people argue
I<00:01:58.409> don't<00:01:59.220> need<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.460> filter<00:01:59.760> add<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:01.439> lot

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
I don't need a filter add to that a lot

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.980 
I don't need a filter add to that a lot

of protection from that so the other

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.770 
of protection from that so the other
thing<00:04:04.860> is<00:04:04.890> what<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.580> like<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.090> for<00:04:06.360> what<00:04:06.690> I'm

thing is what I like it for what I'm

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.900 
thing is what I like it for what I'm
shooting<00:04:06.930> landscapes<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.640> if<00:04:08.760> I'm

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
shooting landscapes is that if I'm

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.050 
shooting landscapes is that if I'm
photographing<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.750> waterfall<00:04:10.350> or<00:04:10.710> in<00:04:11.700> dusty

photographing a waterfall or in dusty
conditions<00:04:12.240> or<00:04:12.720> whatever<00:04:13.020> I'll<00:04:13.890> leave<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.400> on

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
conditions or whatever I'll leave it on

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.870 
conditions or whatever I'll leave it on
now<00:04:15.990> does<00:04:16.290> it<00:04:16.320> degrade<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.890> image<00:04:17.250> well<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.790> is

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
now does it degrade the image well it is

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.449 
now does it degrade the image well it is
another<00:04:18.180> lens<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:19.230> is<00:04:19.410> another<00:04:19.680> glass<00:04:19.950> element

quality filter provides i think is worth

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.220 
quality filter provides i think is worth
it<00:04:51.830> and<00:04:52.010> that's<00:04:52.970> how<00:04:53.150> i<00:04:53.180> use<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.600> filter<00:04:53.930> and

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
it and that's how i use a filter and

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.470 
it and that's how i use a filter and
that's<00:04:54.500> why<00:04:54.800> i<00:04:54.830> use<00:04:55.160> filters<00:04:55.580> there<00:04:55.880> on<00:04:56.030> all<00:04:56.300> my

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
that's why i use filters there on all my

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.500 
that's why i use filters there on all my
lenses<00:04:57.040> i<00:04:58.040> can<00:04:58.550> always<00:04:58.760> take<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.060> off<00:04:59.240> if<00:04:59.300> i

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
lenses i can always take it off if i

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.310 
lenses i can always take it off if i
don't<00:04:59.690> want<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:01.330> but<00:05:02.330> i<00:05:02.360> can't<00:05:02.720> add<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.080> if<00:05:03.200> I

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
don't want it but i can't add it if I

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.260 
don't want it but i can't add it if I
don't<00:05:03.500> have<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.130> if<00:05:04.760> I'm<00:05:04.880> shooting<00:05:05.090> a

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
don't have it and if I'm shooting a

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.810 
don't have it and if I'm shooting a
waterfall<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:05.870> need<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:06.370> and<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.430> don't<00:05:07.490> have

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.720 
waterfall and I need it and I don't have
it<00:05:08.000> so<00:05:08.450> it's<00:05:09.200> it's<00:05:09.590> it's<00:05:09.920> relatively<00:05:10.430> cheap

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
it so it's it's it's relatively cheap
