00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.380
 so after the unboxing comes now the hands 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.820
 on the sony PSP 1000 we'll take a look 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.820
 it goes down both here 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.970
 that's how it works 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.629
 then we use the digital 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.050
 German cross from it probably 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.570
 to confirm 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.680
 the time zone 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:53.470
 next to the berlin confirm 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:56.010
 so set the date and time to 16 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:08.850
 Edit Press 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:08.850
 today is the twelfth 12 2012 and it is 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:33.990
 22 34 here below always input circle 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.560

 Can play a functions like network game 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:49.560
 be visible to others 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:54.990
 so what we write because we 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:59.910
 be sure to work now 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.670
 touchscreen again practically well it is 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.720
 Somewhat strange the system here though 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:12.030
 let's do that then we can 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.450
 on input go on press the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.160
 Taste for the first installation 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:29.370
 be completed as game times already 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:33.930
 none on it videos music camera digitally 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.110
 comics and last as with the ps3 that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.630
 Settings menu you can now 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.280
 different things set sound 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:48.810
 Settings the case comes to the left 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.560
 back again with xf you need that 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.370
 menu normal the song with circle again 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.640
 back works well with the dsp 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.329
 original designer settings 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:14.150
 otherwise still classic treat 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:21.260
 we take it out treat well 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:30.079
 camera we have no back there 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:31.280
 as accessories music fans mitchells okay there 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.980
 you have to have a software now 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.720
 Download it down to one 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.609
 bit through the menus can click 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.109
 At first you do not do much 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:45.260
 it is apparently not even any 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.109
 little game or a trailer 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.900
 on it we see so we have to now 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:54.099
 either here in usd insert that 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.099
 happy to go behind 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:02.060
 Of course everybody works there 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:06.500
 synonymous with the film as in the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:10.340
 normal psp too and you can also over 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.540
 a computer program better said about 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.769
 a pc windows program plays from the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.760
 sony store download the for the psp 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.740
 are suitable 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.380
 and then you can also with the help of 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.330
 USB port on it play and can 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.099
 who then play here I will 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.099
 but in another video still show 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.090
 All in all, I would say that 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.919
 screen is well but it works for 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.820
 I can not believe 79 euros, either 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.800
 expect more 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:51.800
 In any case, it is already big 4.3 inches 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.479
 tft display and yes if you get it right 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.120
 then the colors are also complete 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.300
 Nice only once you get into something oblique 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.740
 keeps you know that of tft 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.150
 screens immediately adjust the colors 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.490
 not anymore or you see 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.310
 He does not reflect anything 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.740
 especially that is very pleasant 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.860
 otherwise the buttons are a bit 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:22.009
 shaky maybe here too 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:26.089
 digital cross more beautiful responsive 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.800
 in a logistics it is now in the game 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:38.059
 See how he beats down here 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:41.529
 are sensor fields for the volume and 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.529
 for select and state 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:49.479
 and up here, of course, are the right ones 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:51.830
 the left shoulder button of the insert 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.960
 the plastic is very comfortable it is 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:59.050
 very similar to the mac box 360 controller 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:02.330
 should such a grippy matte 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.389
 plastic housing broken through 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.059
 a shiny something cheap-looking 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.879
 plastic strip is behind it again 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:13.399
 nice and good grip is common 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:16.459
 Good in the hand I would say you can 

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:19.969
 Definitely neat with socks 

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:22.639
 Drive cover behind light to 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:25.069
 towards the black and wobble 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.319
 but as I said the device of 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.559
 meanwhile for 79 euro I have 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:33.020
 think there will be a lot of fun in any case 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:34.610
 You also have to buy memory stick 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.979
 but it is already better so better 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:41.139
 this is a memory stick tour in the 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:44.569
 normal or in the pro variant and 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:47.240
 how to play games from the download now 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.769
 only by pc on it gets I show 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.349
 then in an extra video 

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:54.879
 I hope it was informative and me 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.879
 I would be happy about subscribers
