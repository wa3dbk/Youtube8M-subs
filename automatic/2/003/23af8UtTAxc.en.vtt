before before we get off and this is
about<00:04:38.729> to<00:04:38.880> wrap<00:04:39.060> up<00:04:39.240> what<00:04:39.510> is<00:04:39.599> uh<00:04:39.979> why<00:04:41.360> what

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
about to wrap up what is uh why what

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.520 
about to wrap up what is uh why what
defines<00:04:42.720> phase<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.800> what<00:04:44.220> makes<00:04:44.520> face

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
defines phase and what makes face

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.930 
defines phase and what makes face
different<00:04:46.530> from<00:04:47.070> all<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.340> other<00:04:47.580> clients

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
different from all the other clients

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.899 
different from all the other clients
that<00:04:48.060> are<00:04:48.090> going<00:04:48.270> on<00:04:48.390> right<00:04:48.419> now<00:04:49.310> um<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.550> think<00:04:50.580> I

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
that are going on right now um I think I

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.650 
that are going on right now um I think I
don't<00:04:51.090> know<00:04:51.180> maybe<00:04:51.390> just<00:04:51.690> because

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
don't know maybe just because

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.930 
don't know maybe just because
we<00:04:53.260> were<00:04:53.470> one<00:04:53.890> of<00:04:53.920> the<00:04:54.130> first<00:04:54.280> just<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.640> start

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
we were one of the first just to start

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.330 
we were one of the first just to start
this<00:04:55.120> whole<00:04:55.350> trickshotting<00:04:56.350> thing<00:04:56.680> as<00:04:56.890> a<00:04:56.920> team

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
this whole trickshotting thing as a team

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.910 
this whole trickshotting thing as a team
instead<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.850> in<00:04:58.050> individually<00:04:59.050> so<00:04:59.770> I<00:04:59.800> think

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
instead of in individually so I think

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.070 
instead of in individually so I think
that<00:05:00.160> made<00:05:00.340> us<00:05:00.370> stand<00:05:00.670> out<00:05:00.850> a<00:05:00.910> lot<00:05:01.180> when<00:05:01.570> we

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
that made us stand out a lot when we

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.600 
that made us stand out a lot when we
have<00:05:02.230> like<00:05:02.470> so<00:05:02.740> many<00:05:02.860> people<00:05:03.190> put<00:05:03.430> together

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
have like so many people put together

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.080 
have like so many people put together
making<00:05:04.390> one<00:05:04.750> thing<00:05:05.250> out<00:05:06.250> of<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.520> ordinary<00:05:06.550> i

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
making one thing out of the ordinary i

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.760 
making one thing out of the ordinary i
guess<00:05:07.270> i<00:05:07.510> know<00:05:07.750> i<00:05:07.780> would<00:05:07.990> say<00:05:08.230> it<00:05:08.440> was<00:05:08.530> kind<00:05:08.740> of

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
guess i know i would say it was kind of
