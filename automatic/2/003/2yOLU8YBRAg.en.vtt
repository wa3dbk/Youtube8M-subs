00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:35.859 
sweetener made out of the agave plant
which<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.850> plant<00:01:34.939> that<00:01:35.329> we<00:01:35.420> make<00:01:35.630> our

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
which is a plant that we make our

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.510 
which is a plant that we make our
tequila<00:01:36.259> so<00:01:36.560> it's<00:01:36.679> basically<00:01:37.069> you're<00:01:37.249> putting

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
tequila so it's basically you're putting

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.459 
tequila so it's basically you're putting
in<00:01:37.609> the<00:01:37.700> same<00:01:37.850> flavor<00:01:38.179> in<00:01:38.600> there

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
in the same flavor in there

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.289 
in the same flavor in there
so<00:01:39.710> it<00:01:39.799> makes<00:01:39.979> sense<00:01:40.070> right<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:40.939> have<00:01:41.119> you

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
so it makes sense right so you have you

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.149 
so it makes sense right so you have you
still<00:01:41.749> have<00:01:41.929> your<00:01:42.049> sweet<00:01:42.289> and<00:01:42.409> sour<00:01:42.590> which<00:01:42.920> is

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
nectars got a lower glycemic index so

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.699 
nectars got a lower glycemic index so
it's<00:02:08.479> easier<00:02:08.780> for<00:02:08.840> your<00:02:09.049> body<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.410> metabolize

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
water so one of the components in this

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.180 
water so one of the components in this
in<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.290> canto<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:48.680> actually<00:02:48.980> four

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.270 

then<00:03:12.690> we're<00:03:12.810> always<00:03:12.930> putting<00:03:13.200> fresh<00:03:13.560> ice<00:03:13.830> in

then we're always putting fresh ice in

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.280 
then we're always putting fresh ice in
the<00:03:14.520> glass<00:03:14.700> not<00:03:15.030> dumping<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.840> ice<00:03:15.960> from<00:03:16.230> the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
the glass not dumping the ice from the
shaker<00:03:16.650> because<00:03:16.800> you've<00:03:17.010> already<00:03:17.100> broken

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
shaker because you've already broken

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.490 
shaker because you've already broken
that<00:03:17.580> down<00:03:17.750> destroyed<00:03:18.750> its<00:03:18.900> structure

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
that down destroyed its structure

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.470 
that down destroyed its structure
now<00:03:19.650> you're<00:03:19.830> getting<00:03:20.040> fresh<00:03:20.280> ice<00:03:20.490> in<00:03:21.270> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
now you're getting fresh ice in the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.620 
now you're getting fresh ice in the
cocktail<00:03:21.810> you're<00:03:22.020> parted<00:03:22.320> over<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.920> then

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
cocktail you're parted over and then

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.140 
cocktail you're parted over and then
when<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.720> pour<00:03:25.050> cold<00:03:25.380> into<00:03:25.890> ice<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.940> ice

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
when you pour cold into ice that ice

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.180 
when you pour cold into ice that ice
gets<00:03:27.450> colder<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.320> harder<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.860> it's<00:03:28.980> going<00:03:29.100> to

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
gets colder and harder so it's going to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.610 
gets colder and harder so it's going to
last<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.490> little<00:03:29.610> longer

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.650

all the line wheels you see a lot of

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.480 
all the line wheels you see a lot of
people<00:03:48.750> have<00:03:48.990> put<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.230> on<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.470> side<00:03:49.740> I<00:03:50.070> like

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490

putting<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.910> inside<00:03:51.860> just<00:03:52.860> easier<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.780> looks

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
putting it inside just easier and looks

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.510 
putting it inside just easier and looks
I<00:03:55.080> think<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.710> looks<00:03:55.890> great

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
I think it looks great

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.700 
I think it looks great
two<00:03:57.000> things<00:03:57.210> for<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.570> garnish<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:58.110> has<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.410> look

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
two things for a garnish it has to look

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.280 
two things for a garnish it has to look
good<00:03:58.790> but<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.880> also<00:04:00.000> gives<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.570> roll<00:04:00.810> okay

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
good but it also gives you a roll okay

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.230 
good but it also gives you a roll okay
so<00:04:01.650> why<00:04:02.040> not<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.310> when<00:04:02.460> you<00:04:02.580> leave<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:02.910> inside

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
so why not you when you leave it inside

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.570 
so why not you when you leave it inside
