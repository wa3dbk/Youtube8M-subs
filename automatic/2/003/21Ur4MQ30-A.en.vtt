00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.070
 cap so mysterious and horrible weigh in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.070
 the depths of the sea 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.600
 science is amazed with 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.610
 a new appearance that they called 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.910
 black devil of the sea you see that he is being 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.120
 followed 25 years ago on the shores of 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.120
 Mexico 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.649
 the 2 is really weird awful and 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.649
 mysterious 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.130
 if it is the black devil of the sea is a 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.370
 species that has only been seen on the coast 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.070
 of the Pacific 6 times and that in 2014 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.990
 managed to be recorded by the institute of 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.040
 Aquarium Research Bay 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.040
 monterey in mexico 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.770
 no no 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.560
 According to senior scientist Bruce Robinson 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.390
 mind that they have been diving in the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.590
 monterrey canyon irregularly 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.780
 for 25 years have seen three of this 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.780
 famed black devil of the sea 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.410
 this record is of vital importance since 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.929
 that for the first time is seen alive and in 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.540
 the depth of the waters this devil 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.360
 black of the sea was seen at 500 meters 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.360
 about 1,900 feet deep 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.130
 the species would be 3.5 inches 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.980
 long and the copy that we see in the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.050
 video would be female since the males are 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.239
 smaller and do not have a 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.870
 kind of fishing rod for 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.870
 feed 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.480
 it is said that the black devil of the sea 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.090
 male is ill equipped for his 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.010
 feeding and you have to depend on 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.560
 find a female and mate with 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.550
 her as soon as possible that's 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.550
 what robinson says 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.150
 also the deep sea is full of 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.579
 surprises and mysterious creatures in 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.909
 this case we present the black devil 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.909
 from sea 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.790
