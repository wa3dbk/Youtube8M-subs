00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.980
 Hi I am so from the points Eon the Dabeler on the i Go Conference 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.439
 2010 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.849
 and punctuation a bit surprised 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.589
 because every participant has a Lenovo frying fat it comes to 10 13 ships 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.140
 now have to go out now 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.800
 So here is the netbook itself 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.849
 and the accessory box 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.849
 Hermanns first on 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.010
 Representative stuck 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.160
 Of course not, I think 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.210
 but if now play old with before 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.190
 that didn `t work 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 destroyed in the East German cities 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 the last race 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.280
 and hidden down here 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.280
 on the 18 Baku 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.210
 5 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.280
 ste 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.410
 Green and left with it too 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.410
 look out on the device 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.550
 Takko has a capacity of 60 watt hours 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.490
 Now he is the netbook 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.549
 the whole is actually a clever title netbook technique different from eye to eye 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.170
 Part will do 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.170
 Duty is lean 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.430
 it was also that she will introduce it in 2010 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.630
 you see her sunscreen on it dapd 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.560
 the display career really shines 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.010
 probably no fingerprints and antitrust proceedings ordered 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.010
 because here's Miller's Chandhok 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.080
 so we start putting on 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 CD 10 inch display also Gloss Inc 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 and ever the keyboard and the touchpad 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.179
 on the right side we still recognize the EU 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.279
 wait for a power 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:16.849
 and on the left side 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.989
 three custom Wattens and I had Salih s 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.369
 the keyboard 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.569
 Function 2 is black 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.109
 Us is Nikkei keyboard 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.309
 take a look at Ches without Kensington Lock on the left 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:36.879
 Power supply connection LAN port 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.879
 and then show the fair headphones and microphone 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.559
 still the right side 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.449
 deen No Angels last spew 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:49.419
 twice USB 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.419
 and once VGH 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.989
 and as mentioned full 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.099
 the food will come or netbook 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.189
 So you can rotate the display 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.379
 in this case 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.459
 in every direction a hundred and eighty degrees 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.069
 and you already have a tablet 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.209
 and the display is capacitive like Mans shapes 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.209
 iPad knows for example 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.329
 you could see that on the Boxing Henson for the Lenovo IdeaPad s10 13 but with everyone 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.459
 Case my youtube-channel entertained UCB and com / taz de 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.399
 because I will act on the Renault 11 still Migrol install 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.039
