00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.340
 cut was a normal man and second 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.100
 I agree that we are currently 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.020

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.210

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.210
 in neurosis to take out 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.759
 it is not a matter of controversy not always 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.759
 it's like that 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:46.600
 it was also necessary that they wanted the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:48.870
 men that is often correct by 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 love 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.949
 because they do not get a bit of the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.949
 song 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:04.769

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.920

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.920
 to learn 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.380
 It was not my intention 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.380
 just for my heart 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.550
 but your truth is that wherever you go 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.550
 the cigars 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.430

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.120

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.489
