 most important things you need is one 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:25.740
 Other thing is still needed of course 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:28.680
 cocoa powder cinnamon and sugar natural 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.980
 also a most important things right 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.980
 out of the fridge 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:44.280
 the milk packs again too cool 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:51.930
 cabinet so that the beauty days as 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:55.610
 First, simply potato with that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.610
 spoon of your choice 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:09.720
 about as much it repeats 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:14.900
 you twice here may like it differently 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.900
 make as lively as it wanted to have 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:31.409
 journalists cacau would have kaká that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.189
 first then we pack it next 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.189
 Zockerei 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.950
 open up and just a bit 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.350
 what to do after what do a lot 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.140
 most of the time it's all in one 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:53.280
 very light layer is covered so 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.829
 then you take a spoon eats whole 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.750
 ever so around a bit now 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.490
 does right but with renault nissan 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:08.069
 micra from it but it has first holes 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:11.190
 Hardly most cacau are namely 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.720
 currently little sugar and flour sugar 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.739
 tastes simply better is not 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.750
 So healthy is next from lexa 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:24.030
 next to the cinnamon you can hardly read but 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:28.019
 that's about as much wine now 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.750
 make that all of it is in 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.430
 a very light play always not 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.019
 too much was too much tastes rather 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:45.540
 less so, the whole thing looks to me 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:47.880
 you can be divided and you have to 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.470
 if you are now on youtube too 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.540
 really big one would challenge now is 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:03:01.710
 not super longer is incredible and 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:11.240
 I 'll do you good 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:13.500
 by getting out and making me rich 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.390
 you should not take care a bit 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.600
 too much milk a pact so far 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.800
 previously planned or not 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:28.680
 pity that is not quite okay if 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:32.070
 all mighty rich became second me 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:39.330
 have now brought milk and that it 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:40.140
 tastes the same as two pieces me can 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.270
 that got me right back in 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.350
 fridge 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.810
 they both have that from the cellar 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:55.880
 Because the cold does not want much there 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:55.880
 make a splash and pour in nicely 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.800
 not too much 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.880
 should take care a bit then there is 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.490
 a trick just behind a hole 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.380
 I'm going to clean it up right away 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.570
 that's why it works out then 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.730
 that is not so much anymore 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.720
 very unpleasant from the stuff 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.430
 That's why we do something 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.910
 probably everyone knows buying longer 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.050
 We take the spoon and lead one 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.470
 rotating clockwise flowing 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.570
 Movement through and important is 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.570
 also a smart 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.400
 that would be the red more 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.169
 jumbled 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.629
 It creates a super delicious 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:54.569
 used as soon as they finished with circumnavigate 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:56.159
 you can enjoy and that is how 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:03.680
 you make yourself in super delicious cocoa 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:03.680
 can I rose from saks kaká 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:11.060
 completely forgotten 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.060
