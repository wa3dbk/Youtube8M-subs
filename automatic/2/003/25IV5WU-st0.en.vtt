00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.440
 of 15 and well guys we are another day 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.059
 more in zone gaming cinnamon section that 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.889
 I do a boxing and product reviews 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.549
 gaming in the case of today we will be the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.020
 helmets or zone reich st that in color 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.789
 black that as you can see are quite 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.140
 pimps and they are quite big here you see 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.029
 the size of a human and the size of 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.150
 the helmets and well then let's proceed 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.100
 to take them out of the box and see them more than 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.960
 near 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.060
 and we are back as he has already 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.550
 taken out of the box and we will proceed to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.480
 see what he had inside the box 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.310
 Well here is the manual 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.790
 instructions that this is not going to 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.830
 believe for nothing 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.030
 and let's go to the important we are this 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.649
 what is the visit 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.380
 and let's go to the important thing as you see 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.050
 is here the micro is a pretty method 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.830
 good is very flexible as you can 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.310
 fold we can adapt it to our 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.410
 our taste 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.390
 it's a pretty good metro as I say in 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.710
 the minijack entry from here is this 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.300
 pretty cool 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 he is the only one who can remove and put 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.409
 thing that comes in handy for when 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.180
 we do not want to put on helmets or not 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.909
 get upset we can take it off 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.130
 perfectly and not use it since it is 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.630
 pretty good and now let's see is 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.740
 that my age my hand 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.740
 that is an animality 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.600
 and let's see the design as it is here 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.370
 the design of the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.229
 helmets and well let's see the 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.020
 characteristics of helmets weight with 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.550
 about 300 grams worth is a black color and 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.410
 a pretty pretty design this you see 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.630
 here are not little lights in case you 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.369
 you think a dating solution is worth and good 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.500
 here is connected the micro gets here 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.300
 this is very fluffy and is very 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.770
 comfortable and it's made so that when we 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.820
 we have many hours in front of 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.820
 computer or whatever 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.850
 in front of the computer or whatever 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.530
 so they do not make us in the ears or 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.110
 nothing and I know quite like the food that 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.590
 this 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.340
 padded and we left a cue on the side and 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.909
 here we have the controller and this serves 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.219
 to activate and deactivate the micro 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.689
 adjust the volume and it was already in the 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.440
 It's good for nothing but I've put it 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:14.690
 be it for you to want 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.860
 we have two of them here quite long 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.950
 and then nothing more 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.170
 basically this is what I liked 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.730
 I'm looking for a lot on the internet with 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.700
 some helmets that were good enough 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.090
 and then I found these vouchers I bought them in 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.630
 app because the price for 29 with 10 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.890
 guy with 30 euros and it was the site 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.920
 of cheaper I do not know against 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.170
 valuable that I definitely recommend it and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.510
 well we will be able to try them and look at you 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.520
 tale of the next serious video with with 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.020
 these helmets so I just hope that 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.290
 I liked it if it's like that 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.330
 like 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.680
