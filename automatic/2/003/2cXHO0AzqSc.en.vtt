also they come with the they come with
the<00:03:46.200> regular<00:03:46.880> mountings<00:03:47.880> but<00:03:48.120> these<00:03:48.269> guys

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
the regular mountings but these guys

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.020 
the regular mountings but these guys
these<00:03:49.290> guys<00:03:49.560> kind<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.069> used<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.670> different

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
these guys kind of used a different

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.900 
these guys kind of used a different
bracket<00:03:51.720> with<00:03:51.870> like<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.049> rubber<00:03:52.640> with<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.790> go

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
bracket with like a rubber with that go

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.199 
bracket with like a rubber with that go
rubber<00:03:54.090> grip<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:54.630> that<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:55.640> it'll<00:03:56.640> hold<00:03:56.790> up<00:03:56.970> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
rubber grip so that it it'll hold up a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.509 
rubber grip so that it it'll hold up a
little<00:03:57.569> better<00:03:57.780> against<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.769> vibration<00:03:59.340> and

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
little better against the vibration and

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.150 
little better against the vibration and
then<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.180> other<00:04:00.299> thing<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.599> they<00:04:00.870> did<00:04:01.160> you

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
then the other thing that they did you

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.490 
then the other thing that they did you
can<00:04:02.250> kind<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.519> squeeze<00:04:02.760> in<00:04:03.030> here<00:04:03.290> they<00:04:04.290> just

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
can kind of squeeze in here they just

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.740 
can kind of squeeze in here they just
added<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.950> switch<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:05.640> if<00:04:06.480> we're<00:04:06.660> gonna

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
added this switch so if we're gonna

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.300 
added this switch so if we're gonna
backcountry<00:04:07.170> roads<00:04:07.560> we<00:04:07.709> really<00:04:07.920> don't<00:04:08.099> need

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
backcountry roads we really don't need

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.670 
backcountry roads we really don't need
the<00:04:08.430> lights<00:04:08.610> we<00:04:08.819> can<00:04:08.970> we<00:04:09.840> can<00:04:10.019> just<00:04:10.380> go<00:04:10.530> ahead

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
the lights we can we can just go ahead

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.050 
the lights we can we can just go ahead
and<00:04:10.829> shut<00:04:11.010> them<00:04:11.130> on<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.370> shut<00:04:11.549> them<00:04:11.700> off<00:04:11.819> and

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
and shut them on and shut them off and

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.850 
and shut them on and shut them off and
they<00:04:12.480> did<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.780> same<00:04:12.959> exact<00:04:13.349> thing<00:04:13.440> I'm<00:04:13.709> not

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
they did the same exact thing I'm not

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.620 
they did the same exact thing I'm not
gonna<00:04:14.040> take<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.340> bag<00:04:14.489> apart<00:04:14.880> but<00:04:15.030> there's<00:04:15.540> a

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
gonna take the bag apart but there's a

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.960 
gonna take the bag apart but there's a
similar<00:04:15.989> switch<00:04:16.290> back<00:04:16.530> here<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.190> if<00:04:17.579> we<00:04:17.790> don't

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
similar switch back here so if we don't

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.400 
similar switch back here so if we don't
want<00:04:18.950> if<00:04:19.950> we<00:04:20.010> don't<00:04:20.400> want<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.760> lights<00:04:21.289> to<00:04:22.289> be

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410
