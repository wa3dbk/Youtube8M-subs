00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
[Intro music]

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.150
Noticeably, ranch dressing is the second favourite

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.050
dressing of North Americans.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.020
The main ingredients are either buttermilk or

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.180
sour cream added to mayonnaise

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.110
which makes it a sauce with an extremely

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.060
high fat content.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.230
It is used as a dip

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.240
for vegetables or fried food.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.110
To make your own ranch dressing,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.290
you will need salt, pepper, red wine vinegar,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.120
sour cream, buttermilk, mayonnaise, shallot,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.080
parsley, garlic, celery seeds,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.050
chives, dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.080
Start to chop the celery seeds

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.020
or use a mortar and pestle to grind them.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.030
Place them in a mortar.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.080
So use the pestle to crush and grind the seeds.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.090
That will allow the seeds to release their flavours.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.020
It is very fragrant.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.180
Good. Then transfer this to the bowl.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.160
Can you smell that at home?

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.000
Then add the rest of the ingredients.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.070
Lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, the chives,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:48.200
the garlic, the parsley- a tablespoon,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:02:04.020
the dijon, the chopped shallots., the sour cream;

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.230
if you don’t have sour cream, you may use plain yogurt;

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.230
also you will have less fats in yogurt,

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.050
so it would be a good idea,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:25.070
the red wine vinegar, the mayonnaise, the buttermilk.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:32.170
Whisk everything together.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:40.070
Add a little bit of pepper.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.010
Pinch of salt.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:59.020
Then taste.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.020
Rich in flavour. Very nice.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.000
May be a little bit more pepper.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.040
Taste again with the other side this time.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.060
Perfect! Use the ranch dressing as a sauce

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.050
to dip your vegetables or as a dressing.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.200
It will be fine too.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.290
Bon appétit!

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.220
This is my ranch dressing.
