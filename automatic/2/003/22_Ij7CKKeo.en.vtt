00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
nothing so the beginning of the levels

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.750 
nothing so the beginning of the levels
you<00:00:57.570> want<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.989> start<00:00:58.230> back<00:00:58.440> aways<00:00:58.800> I

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you want to kind of start back aways I

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.549 
you want to kind of start back aways I
start<00:01:00.449> backing<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.170> way<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
start backing up all the way to that

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.529 
start backing up all the way to that
hallway<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.190> sprinting<00:01:03.059> forward<00:01:03.449> at

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
hallway and then sprinting forward at

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.810 
hallway and then sprinting forward at
the<00:01:03.600> beginning<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.549> immediately<00:01:05.549> turn<00:01:05.729> on

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the beginning and immediately turn on

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.200 
the beginning and immediately turn on
that<00:01:05.939> electricity<00:01:07.189> now<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> start<00:01:08.640> back<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that electricity now if you start back a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.600 
that electricity now if you start back a
little<00:01:09.869> ways<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.740> whole<00:01:10.950> reason<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> doing

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
little ways the whole reason to doing

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.920 
little ways the whole reason to doing
that<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> zombies<00:01:12.780> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that is so you can get the zombies to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.320 
that is so you can get the zombies to
spawn<00:01:13.200> back<00:01:13.500> there<00:01:13.740> where<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> started<00:01:14.460> then

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
spawn back there where you started then

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
spawn back there where you started then
you<00:01:15.509> run<00:01:15.689> away<00:01:15.780> from<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:16.920> you're

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
you run away from there and now you're

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.640 
you run away from there and now you're
don't<00:01:17.250> worry<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> zombies<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.470> set

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
don't worry the zombies and if you set

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
don't worry the zombies and if you set
up<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.860> electricity<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.729> pretty<00:01:21.180> much

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
up that electricity then pretty much

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.999 
up that electricity then pretty much
everything<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.869> spawn<00:01:22.229> back<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.799> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
everything that spawn back there is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.350 
everything that spawn back there is
going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.220> die<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:23.790> they're<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
going to die because they're going to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.520 
going to die because they're going to
have<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> run<00:01:24.750> through<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.960> electricity<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
have to run through the electricity to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
have to run through the electricity to
get<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.920> where<00:01:26.100> you're<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
get to you where you're up here so that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350 
get to you where you're up here so that
you<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.770> effectively<00:01:29.369> ends<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> first<00:01:30.000> wave

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you know effectively ends the first wave

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.730 
you know effectively ends the first wave
of<00:01:30.390> zombies<00:01:30.630> basically<00:01:32.869> now<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> get<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> bunch

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
of zombies basically now you get a bunch

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.469 
of zombies basically now you get a bunch
of<00:01:34.920> spot<00:01:35.189> up<00:01:35.369> there<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.820> jump<00:01:36.090> down<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.390> hit

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
of spot up there you jump down and hit

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.600 
of spot up there you jump down and hit
this<00:01:36.600> electricity<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.220> everything<00:01:38.579> that

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
this electricity so now everything that

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.700 
this electricity so now everything that
spawned<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.540> there<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.470> die<00:01:40.590> from

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
spawned up there is going to die from

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.190 
spawned up there is going to die from
that<00:01:40.860> electricity<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.780> kind<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.049> keep

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that electricity and just kind of keep

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.370 
that electricity and just kind of keep
doing<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:44.299> moving<00:01:45.299> getting<00:01:46.079> them<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
doing that moving getting them all to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.350 
doing that moving getting them all to
spawn<00:01:46.619> moving<00:01:47.340> again<00:01:47.640> starting<00:01:48.299> on

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
spawn moving again starting on

electricity you know you can get some

electricity there's a little I was kind

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.950 
electricity there's a little I was kind
of<00:01:56.250> getting<00:01:56.369> low<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.759> point<00:01:57.240> side<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> started

and<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.759> occasionally<00:02:03.090> I'll<00:02:03.420> turn<00:02:03.600> around

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and so occasionally I'll turn around

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.029 
and so occasionally I'll turn around
just<00:02:04.020> flame<00:02:04.259> through<00:02:04.530> them<00:02:04.680> instead<00:02:04.979> of

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
just flame through them instead of

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.910 
just flame through them instead of
setting<00:02:05.399> off<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:06.320> electricity<00:02:07.320> right<00:02:07.680> away

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
setting off the electricity right away

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.490 
setting off the electricity right away
like<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.119> mean<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.840> do<00:02:09.989> two<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
like like I mean you can do two in the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.350 
like like I mean you can do two in the
rounds<00:02:10.739> quicker<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.269> safer<00:02:14.360> like

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
rounds quicker and to be safer like

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.880 
rounds quicker and to be safer like
right<00:02:15.569> here<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.560> set<00:02:16.680> off<00:02:16.769> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
right here that you can just set off the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.650 
right here that you can just set off the
electricity<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.970> wanted<00:02:18.420> some<00:02:18.569> more

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
electricity but I wanted some more

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.420 
electricity but I wanted some more
points<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.260> decided<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:19.890> back<00:02:20.160> track

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
points so I decided to just back track

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.610 
points so I decided to just back track
down<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> hallway<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.300> played<00:02:21.840> throne<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
down the hallway and played throne and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.380 
down the hallway and played throne and
you're<00:02:23.069> relatively<00:02:23.489> safe<00:02:23.880> doing<00:02:24.090> that

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
you're relatively safe doing that

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.509 
you're relatively safe doing that
because<00:02:24.599> most<00:02:24.959> zombies<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.830> all<00:02:26.010> spawn<00:02:26.340> in

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
because most zombies have all spawn in

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.479 
because most zombies have all spawn in
front<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.910> now<00:02:27.950> until<00:02:28.950> they<00:02:29.099> start<00:02:29.340> dying

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
front of you now until they start dying

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.949 
front of you now until they start dying
off<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.790> then<00:02:30.060> they'll<00:02:30.150> start<00:02:30.390> spawning<00:02:30.660> at

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
off and then they'll start spawning at

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.110 
off and then they'll start spawning at
these<00:02:31.140> windows<00:02:31.290> up<00:02:31.650> here<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.849> got<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.060> be

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
these windows up here so you got to be

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.740 
these windows up here so you got to be
careful<00:02:33.239> about<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:35.209> I'll<00:02:36.209> do<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.690> of

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
careful about that I'll do the kind of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.289 
careful about that I'll do the kind of
the<00:02:36.840> same<00:02:37.019> loop<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.410> didn't<00:02:37.650> last<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:39.150> last

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
the same loop I didn't last the last

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.630 
the same loop I didn't last the last
video<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.720> did<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.739> main<00:02:41.040> difference<00:02:41.489> on

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
video I did the the main difference on

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.910 
video I did the the main difference on
this<00:02:41.790> video<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.630> when<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.590> use<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
this video is that when I use the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.580 
this video is that when I use the
teleporter<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.880> don't<00:02:45.810> wait<00:02:46.019> for<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.230> zombies

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
teleporter I don't wait for the zombies

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.839 
teleporter I don't wait for the zombies
to<00:02:46.709> get<00:02:46.860> up<00:02:46.980> there<00:02:47.160> somebody<00:02:47.579> else<00:02:47.670> had

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
to get up there somebody else had

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.930 
to get up there somebody else had
commented<00:02:48.329> on<00:02:48.480> my<00:02:48.540> last<00:02:48.840> video<00:02:49.610> because<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
commented on my last video because the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.430 
commented on my last video because the
last<00:02:51.090> video<00:02:51.299> ended<00:02:51.720> when<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.900> teleporter

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
last video ended when the teleporter

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.350 
last video ended when the teleporter
just<00:02:52.769> wouldn't<00:02:53.099> work<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.579> somebody<00:02:54.180> said

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
just wouldn't work and somebody said

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.789 
just wouldn't work and somebody said
well<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.660> know<00:02:54.690> if<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.900> get<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> zombies<00:02:55.680> up

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
well you know if you get to a zombies up

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.640 
well you know if you get to a zombies up
in<00:02:55.920> there<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.599> teleporter<00:02:58.049> with<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
in there in the teleporter with you you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.850 
in there in the teleporter with you you
can't<00:02:58.920> teleport<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.840> I<00:03:00.840> had<00:03:01.110> nobody<00:03:01.290> else<00:03:01.560> I

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
can't teleport and I had nobody else I

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.470 
can't teleport and I had nobody else I
don't<00:03:02.430> know<00:03:02.489> why<00:03:02.790> they<00:03:02.910> didn't<00:03:03.120> occur<00:03:03.329> to<00:03:03.360> me

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
don't know why they didn't occur to me

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.860 
don't know why they didn't occur to me
but<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:05.280> didn't<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.910> thought<00:03:06.329> okay<00:03:06.660> well

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
but it it didn't so I thought okay well

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.750 
but it it didn't so I thought okay well
I'll<00:03:07.109> just<00:03:07.170> try<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.560> teleport<00:03:07.950> right<00:03:08.160> away<00:03:08.400> and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
I'll just try to teleport right away and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.759 
I'll just try to teleport right away and
you<00:03:09.540> know<00:03:09.660> when<00:03:09.959> there's<00:03:10.139> no<00:03:10.260> zombies<00:03:10.620> in

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
you know when there's no zombies in

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.319 
you know when there's no zombies in
there<00:03:10.920> or<00:03:11.340> as<00:03:11.850> few<00:03:12.090> as<00:03:12.150> possible<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:14.329> didn't

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
there or as few as possible and I didn't

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.300 
there or as few as possible and I didn't
the<00:03:15.510> teleport<00:03:15.930> didn't<00:03:16.230> fail<00:03:16.440> for<00:03:16.650> me<00:03:16.769> once<00:03:16.980> so

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
the teleport didn't fail for me once so

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.580 
the teleport didn't fail for me once so
I<00:03:17.750> don't<00:03:18.750> know<00:03:18.840> if<00:03:18.870> there's<00:03:19.079> any<00:03:19.230> truth<00:03:19.410> to

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
I don't know if there's any truth to

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.830 
I don't know if there's any truth to
that<00:03:19.620> but<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.100> worked<00:03:20.579> this<00:03:20.730> time<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.299> i'm

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
that but it worked this time and i'm

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.960 
that but it worked this time and i'm
sooo<00:03:22.049> persistent<00:03:22.560> enough<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.609> believe<00:03:23.850> it

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
sooo persistent enough to to believe it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.990 
sooo persistent enough to to believe it
now<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:25.100> that<00:03:26.100> time<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.340> missed<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
now so that time I missed the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.550 
now so that time I missed the
electricity<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.569> was<00:03:27.780> trying<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.049> set<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.410> off

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
electricity I was trying to set that off

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.370 
electricity I was trying to set that off
but<00:03:28.859> I<00:03:29.100> didn't<00:03:29.400> quite<00:03:29.579> hit<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.200> it's<00:03:31.200> not

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
but I didn't quite hit it so it's not

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.660 
but I didn't quite hit it so it's not
the<00:03:31.530> end<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.709> world<00:03:31.829> oh<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.250> backtrack

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
the end of the world oh just backtrack

around<00:05:36.790> because<00:05:37.790> he<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.510> rounds<00:05:38.840> are<00:05:38.930> going

around because he the rounds are going

pretty<00:05:39.200> long<00:05:39.530> to<00:05:39.860> a<00:05:40.550> lot<00:05:41.390> of<00:05:41.510> them<00:05:41.570> are<00:05:41.750> less

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
pretty long to a lot of them are less

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.320 
pretty long to a lot of them are less
than<00:05:41.960> 10<00:05:42.410> minutes<00:05:42.650> I<00:05:43.160> actually<00:05:43.580> get<00:05:43.850> a<00:05:43.910> bomb<00:05:44.150> at

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
than 10 minutes I actually get a bomb at

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.210 
than 10 minutes I actually get a bomb at
the<00:05:44.360> end<00:05:44.510> of<00:05:44.600> this<00:05:44.660> round<00:05:44.930> and<00:05:45.260> that<00:05:45.290> helps<00:05:46.070> me

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
the end of this round and that helps me

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.600 
the end of this round and that helps me
out<00:05:46.250> a<00:05:46.340> little<00:05:46.490> bit

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
out a little bit

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.980 
out a little bit
but<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:48.730> rounds<00:05:49.000> are<00:05:49.090> pretty<00:05:49.450> freaking<00:05:49.810> long

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
but the rounds are pretty freaking long

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.410 
but the rounds are pretty freaking long
i<00:05:53.130> was<00:05:54.130> going<00:05:54.730> to<00:05:54.790> keep<00:05:54.940> track<00:05:55.090> on<00:05:55.270> me

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
i was going to keep track on me

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.300 
i was going to keep track on me
electricity<00:05:55.750> a<00:05:55.990> setup<00:05:56.350> but<00:05:56.560> i<00:05:56.590> forgot<00:05:57.100> to<00:05:57.220> do

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
electricity a setup but i forgot to do

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.810 
electricity a setup but i forgot to do
that<00:05:57.340> so<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:59.110> can<00:05:59.230> rewind<00:05:59.860> a<00:06:00.010> cow<00:06:00.280> but<00:06:00.520> i<00:06:00.610> set

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
that so you can rewind a cow but i set

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.100 
that so you can rewind a cow but i set
off<00:06:00.850> a<00:06:01.000> hell<00:06:01.150> of<00:06:01.180> a<00:06:01.240> lot<00:06:01.300> of<00:06:01.360> electricity<00:06:01.780> and

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
off a hell of a lot of electricity and

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.670 
off a hell of a lot of electricity and
then<00:06:02.590> this<00:06:02.740> one<00:06:02.800> around<00:06:03.220> to<00:06:03.630> kill<00:06:04.630> up<00:06:04.810> the

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
then this one around to kill up the

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.400 
then this one around to kill up the
majority<00:06:05.830> of<00:06:06.130> these<00:06:06.220> zombies<00:06:10.020> so<00:06:11.020> i<00:06:11.050> get<00:06:11.260> that

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
majority of these zombies so i get that

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.990 
majority of these zombies so i get that
bomb<00:06:11.620> that<00:06:11.890> helps<00:06:12.100> me<00:06:12.160> finish<00:06:12.490> up<00:06:12.640> the<00:06:12.790> round

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
bomb that helps me finish up the round

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.230 
bomb that helps me finish up the round
there's<00:06:13.510> only<00:06:13.690> a<00:06:13.810> few<00:06:13.930> more<00:06:14.080> zombies<00:06:14.500> left<00:06:15.240> I'm

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
there's only a few more zombies left I'm

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
there's only a few more zombies left I'm
just<00:06:16.450> checking<00:06:16.660> back<00:06:16.870> here<00:06:17.050> to<00:06:17.110> make<00:06:17.230> sure

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
just checking back here to make sure

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.290 
just checking back here to make sure
they're<00:06:17.440> not<00:06:17.530> spawning<00:06:17.890> when<00:06:18.580> I<00:06:18.610> set<00:06:18.850> it<00:06:18.970> off<00:06:19.120> i

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
they're not spawning when I set it off i

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.720 
they're not spawning when I set it off i
usually<00:06:19.750> will<00:06:20.320> keep<00:06:20.560> right<00:06:21.340> next<00:06:21.640> to

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
usually will keep right next to

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.190 
usually will keep right next to
electricity<00:06:22.150> hoping<00:06:22.660> more<00:06:22.840> of<00:06:22.960> them<00:06:23.080> will

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
electricity hoping more of them will

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.630 
electricity hoping more of them will
spawn<00:06:23.470> on<00:06:23.860> the<00:06:24.130> other<00:06:24.280> side<00:06:24.490> of<00:06:24.520> the

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
spawn on the other side of the

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.320 
spawn on the other side of the
electricity<00:06:25.770> if<00:06:26.770> you<00:06:27.460> run<00:06:27.670> back<00:06:27.880> this<00:06:28.060> far

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
electricity if you run back this far

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.910 
electricity if you run back this far
then<00:06:28.570> they<00:06:28.660> start<00:06:28.870> spawning<00:06:29.110> back<00:06:29.350> here<00:06:29.650> so

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
then they start spawning back here so

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.740 
then they start spawning back here so
while<00:06:30.280> electricity<00:06:30.880> is<00:06:30.970> on<00:06:31.090> I<00:06:31.390> try<00:06:31.570> to<00:06:31.600> stay

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
while electricity is on I try to stay

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.350 
while electricity is on I try to stay
closely<00:06:32.080> electricity<00:06:32.800> and<00:06:33.090> that<00:06:34.090> helps<00:06:34.330> me

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
closely electricity and that helps me

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.220 
closely electricity and that helps me
kill<00:06:34.690> more<00:06:35.230> of<00:06:35.260> them<00:06:35.410> using<00:06:36.160> that<00:06:37.080> just<00:06:38.080> keep

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
kill more of them using that just keep

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.540 
kill more of them using that just keep
turning<00:06:38.410> around<00:06:38.590> make<00:06:38.950> sure<00:06:38.980> you<00:06:39.250> don't<00:06:39.340> have

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
turning around make sure you don't have

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.090 
turning around make sure you don't have
dogs<00:06:39.790> or<00:06:40.180> whores<00:06:41.080> amies<00:06:41.470> coming<00:06:41.710> behind<00:06:41.860> your

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
dogs or whores amies coming behind your

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:48.530 
dogs or whores amies coming behind your
back<00:06:45.270> so<00:06:46.270> that's<00:06:46.480> last<00:06:46.750> guy<00:06:46.930> that<00:06:46.960> wraps<00:06:47.380> up<00:06:47.560> 47

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
back so that's last guy that wraps up 47

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.570 
back so that's last guy that wraps up 47
I'm<00:06:49.540> putting<00:06:49.840> these<00:06:49.930> Betty's<00:06:50.320> down<00:06:50.530> here<00:06:51.040> in

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
I'm putting these Betty's down here in

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.220 
I'm putting these Betty's down here in
the<00:06:51.910> off<00:06:52.030> chance<00:06:52.060> that<00:06:52.480> I<00:06:52.630> do<00:06:52.690> get<00:06:52.930> a<00:06:52.990> decent

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.230 
the off chance that I do get a decent

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.950 
the off chance that I do get a decent
drop<00:06:53.620> there<00:06:53.950> after<00:06:54.670> i<00:06:54.700> teleport<00:06:55.270> my<00:06:55.570> run<00:06:55.780> down

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
drop there after i teleport my run down

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.210 
drop there after i teleport my run down
there<00:06:56.080> together<00:06:56.230> the<00:06:56.620> Betty's<00:06:56.920> will<00:06:57.070> help

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
there together the Betty's will help

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.670 
there together the Betty's will help
keep<00:06:58.180> the<00:06:58.360> zombies<00:06:58.720> off<00:06:58.870> me<00:06:59.050> long<00:06:59.230> enough<00:06:59.380> to

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
keep the zombies off me long enough to

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.380 
keep the zombies off me long enough to
to<00:07:00.040> pick<00:07:00.190> up<00:07:00.340> the<00:07:00.460> drop<00:07:02.850> so<00:07:03.850> I'm<00:07:04.120> doing<00:07:04.300> the

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
to pick up the drop so I'm doing the

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.360 
to pick up the drop so I'm doing the
same<00:07:04.510> thing<00:07:04.720> I<00:07:04.810> did<00:07:04.870> before<00:07:05.080> except<00:07:05.980> this<00:07:06.130> time

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
same thing I did before except this time

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.350 
same thing I did before except this time
I<00:07:07.350> do<00:07:08.350> something<00:07:08.650> dumb<00:07:08.970> so<00:07:09.970> there's<00:07:10.090> a<00:07:10.180> zombie

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
I do something dumb so there's a zombie

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.960 
I do something dumb so there's a zombie
that<00:07:10.840> has<00:07:11.290> come<00:07:11.440> up<00:07:11.500> the<00:07:11.740> stairs<00:07:12.010> there<00:07:12.160> and<00:07:12.700> I

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.970 
that has come up the stairs there and I

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.610 
that has come up the stairs there and I
don't<00:07:13.420> really<00:07:13.570> want<00:07:13.810> to<00:07:13.870> drop<00:07:14.050> off<00:07:14.290> yet

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:14.620 
don't really want to drop off yet

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.800 
don't really want to drop off yet
because<00:07:15.100> I<00:07:15.730> feel<00:07:16.120> like<00:07:16.150> it's<00:07:16.420> a<00:07:16.480> waste<00:07:16.510> of

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
because I feel like it's a waste of

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.300 
because I feel like it's a waste of
electricity<00:07:16.900> down<00:07:17.530> there<00:07:17.740> if<00:07:17.830> i<00:07:17.920> drop<00:07:18.100> off

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310 
electricity down there if i drop off

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.550 
electricity down there if i drop off
already<00:07:18.700> so<00:07:19.000> i<00:07:19.240> try<00:07:19.540> to<00:07:19.600> kill<00:07:19.870> him<00:07:20.050> and<00:07:20.290> i

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
already so i try to kill him and i

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.430 
already so i try to kill him and i
zapped<00:07:21.130> myself<00:07:21.310> with<00:07:21.850> the<00:07:21.970> reagan<00:07:22.390> one<00:07:23.260> too

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
zapped myself with the reagan one too

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.300 
zapped myself with the reagan one too
many<00:07:23.590> times<00:07:23.890> there<00:07:24.340> and<00:07:24.550> i<00:07:25.740> had<00:07:26.740> died<00:07:26.950> in<00:07:27.100> a<00:07:27.160> new
