00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
and realized this is a lot more than

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.250 
and realized this is a lot more than
I've<00:02:58.670> taken<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.239> in<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.510> full<00:02:59.780> past<00:03:00.020> four

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
years and in fact I when I start eating

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.130 
years and in fact I when I start eating
these<00:03:04.280> foods<00:03:04.580> basically<00:03:05.390> he's<00:03:05.630> increasing

his calories right the first time he's
eating<00:03:07.700> more<00:03:07.880> than<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:08.590> 800<00:03:09.590> calories<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.890> day

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
eating more than a 800 calories a day

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.229

this<00:03:17.650> cognitive<00:03:18.650> dissonance<00:03:19.160> because<00:03:19.670> it's

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
this cognitive dissonance because it's

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.449 
this cognitive dissonance because it's
like<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:20.360> starved<00:03:20.840> myself<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.500> lose<00:03:21.739> weight<00:03:22.190> it
