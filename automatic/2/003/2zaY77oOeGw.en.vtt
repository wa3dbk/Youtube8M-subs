review<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.229> think<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.680> apple

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
review on this I do think the apple

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
review on this I do think the apple
watch<00:01:41.070> will<00:01:41.130> run<00:01:41.850> very<00:01:42.150> very<00:01:42.360> smoothly

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
watch will run very very smoothly

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.600 
watch will run very very smoothly
similar<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> iphone<00:01:43.470> ipad<00:01:43.770> ipod<00:01:44.040> touch<00:01:44.369> i

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
similar to the iphone ipad ipod touch i

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.190 
similar to the iphone ipad ipod touch i
think<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.180> be<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> great<00:01:45.509> accessory<00:01:45.960> for

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
think it will be a great accessory for

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.380 
think it will be a great accessory for
the<00:01:46.439> iPhone<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:47.070> whatever<00:01:47.670> device<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.360> are

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the iPhone or whatever device you are

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.870 
the iPhone or whatever device you are
using<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:49.470> will<00:01:49.710> integrate<00:01:49.950> well<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.579> has<00:01:50.729> all

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
using it will integrate well and has all

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.460 
using it will integrate well and has all
the<00:01:51.000> same<00:01:51.149> applications<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.990> those<00:01:52.140> devices

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the same applications that those devices

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.310 
the same applications that those devices
have<00:01:53.000> however<00:01:54.000> there<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.079> some

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
have however there are going to be some

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200 
have however there are going to be some
people<00:01:55.470> who<00:01:55.680> don't<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.490> Apple<00:01:56.790> watch<00:01:56.939> if

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
