00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.249 
in every sport muscle work in pairs one
muscle<00:00:08.000> will<00:00:08.149> contract<00:00:08.599> to<00:00:08.809> create<00:00:09.139> the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
nothing but will affect how the same

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.960 
nothing but will affect how the same
scale<00:01:01.730> is<00:01:01.880> performed

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.450 

open<00:01:11.970> skill<00:01:12.320> if<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.560> person<00:01:13.980> being<00:01:14.160> tackled

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
open skill if the person being tackled

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
open skill if the person being tackled
is<00:01:14.700> moving<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.750> type<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.050> taco<00:01:16.470> will<00:01:16.770> vary<00:01:17.040> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
is moving the type of taco will vary and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.420 
is moving the type of taco will vary and
the<00:01:17.850> tackler<00:01:18.750> will<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.710> adjust<00:01:20.010> to<00:01:20.190> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the tackler will have to adjust to the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.910 
the tackler will have to adjust to the
movement<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.720> makes<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.200> skill<00:01:22.470> open

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
movement this makes the skill open

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.300 
movement this makes the skill open
because<00:01:23.100> something<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.210> affecting<00:01:24.690> how<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
because something is affecting how the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.790 
because something is affecting how the
skill<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.550> performed<00:01:27.410> example<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.620> weather

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
skill is performed example the weather

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:44.090 
skill is performed example the weather
or<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> people<00:01:29.640> or<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.540> players

hi<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.460> this<00:01:45.610> part<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.000> animation<00:01:46.659> will<00:01:47.049> show

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
hi in this part the animation will show

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.620 
hi in this part the animation will show
you<00:01:47.350> how<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:47.740> use<00:01:48.130> your<00:01:48.159> synovial<00:01:48.820> joints<00:01:49.479> and

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
you how you use your synovial joints and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.230 
you how you use your synovial joints and
basketball<00:01:50.460> faster<00:01:51.460> if<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.670> ball<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.060> socket

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
basketball faster if the ball and socket

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.710 
basketball faster if the ball and socket
joint<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.899> can<00:01:53.320> rotate<00:01:53.500> round<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:55.270> has<00:01:55.509> little

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
joint it can rotate round it has little

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.529 
joint it can rotate round it has little
movement<00:01:56.320> in<00:01:56.439> all<00:01:56.619> directions<00:01:56.850> your<00:01:57.850> users<00:01:58.360> to

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
movement in all directions your users to

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.620 
movement in all directions your users to
raise<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:59.020> ball<00:01:59.200> up<00:01:59.850> then<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.060> hinge<00:02:01.270> joint

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
raise the ball up then the hinge joint

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.779 
raise the ball up then the hinge joint
it<00:02:01.869> can<00:02:02.200> only<00:02:02.320> Bend<00:02:02.679> forwards<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.549> backwards

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
it can only Bend forwards and backwards

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.480 
it can only Bend forwards and backwards
it<00:02:04.689> had<00:02:04.869> very<00:02:05.080> little<00:02:05.350> movement<00:02:05.679> and<00:02:06.159> this<00:02:06.310> is

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
it had very little movement and this is

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.850 
it had very little movement and this is
when<00:02:06.640> you'd<00:02:06.759> extend<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:07.600> arm<00:02:07.750> last<00:02:08.590> but<00:02:08.769> not

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
when you'd extend the arm last but not

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.670 
when you'd extend the arm last but not
least<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.429> have<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:10.030> gliding<00:02:10.780> joint<00:02:11.319> that

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
least you have the gliding joint that

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.559 
least you have the gliding joint that
which<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.220> your<00:02:12.370> hand<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:12.910> use<00:02:13.239> this<00:02:13.390> to

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
which is in your hand you use this to

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.449 
which is in your hand you use this to
give<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> little<00:02:14.080> flick<00:02:14.500> at<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.769> end<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.250> shoot

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
give a little flick at the end to shoot

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.720 
give a little flick at the end to shoot
the<00:02:15.610> ball<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.959> basically<00:02:17.590> if<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.040> use<00:02:18.370> all

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
the ball in so basically if you use all

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.550 
the ball in so basically if you use all
them<00:02:19.239> correctly<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:20.049> would<00:02:20.170> be<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.380> perfect

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
them correctly that would be the perfect

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.949 
them correctly that would be the perfect
shot<00:02:22.860> by<00:02:23.860> being<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.400> defense<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.330> main
