resets<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.570> level<00:01:39.950> let's<00:01:40.950> try<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.220> again<00:01:45.979> it's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
resets a level let's try it again it's

resets a level let's try it again it's
actually<00:01:47.369> start<00:01:47.700> then<00:01:47.970> B<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.530> start<00:01:49.860> then<00:01:50.310> B

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
actually start then B so start then B

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.440 
actually start then B so start then B
and<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:52.770> start<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.490> then<00:01:53.579> B<00:01:53.729> again<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.240> place

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and then start and then B again to place

moved<00:01:58.409> up<00:01:58.560> his<00:01:58.710> position<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.399> let's<00:01:59.549> try<00:01:59.759> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
moved up his position so let's try that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.209 
moved up his position so let's try that
again<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.509> go

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219
