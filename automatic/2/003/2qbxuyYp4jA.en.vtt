00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:56.930
 Who If you have attached a good grip even if you put the rear we went I Masu Pake in this way 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.650
 It becomes easy to cut 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.630
 A little without grip 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.320
 The 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:09.160
 Kedomo had the feeling no sense of stability 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:16.190
 Judged by helping web reports 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:21.010
 I think Pique take pictures in the pou dou dou 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:24.069
 And how is this grip 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.200
 If you open it here 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:31.500
 In addition, we have terminal similar to the camera body 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.430
 Of this turn 4 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.990
 Produce all here that there is 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:47.880
 We introduced 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:47.880
 You can attach the battery pack etc. of vertical position grip from above 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.110
 Because this is a very easy to understand grip 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.960
 me 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.390
 Here emi well common 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.720
 Oh , when you buy 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.730
 I also think 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:14.180
 I think it is an option 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.180
 a And this is the last thing I want to introduce 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.600
 It is attached flash 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:26.520
 Which has changed so much 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.840
 I also touched the song of the frequency a little more here 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.840
 Enter this way 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.090
 Bounce 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.749

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.780

 It can not be attached to other models 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:34.760
 So here is 4 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.500
 Because I do it by pass power drive 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:43.560
 Power supply is a 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:45.180
 We do not need such as a battery in it that use the power of the camera 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.610

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.080
 I tried to debut 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:18.090
 But sorry in the obscure debut 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.740
 Because it is a very good camera 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.370
 At camera stores 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:27.960
