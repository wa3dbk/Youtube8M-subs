00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
over these things either I mean they

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
over these things either I mean they
should<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.590> installed<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.309> protective

a little bonus tip along with this video
because<00:02:12.360> I've<00:02:12.660> seen<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.080> happen

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
because I've seen it happen

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.110 
because I've seen it happen
before<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.160> not<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.700> pleasant<00:02:15.360> sight<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
before and it's not a pleasant sight and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.360 
before and it's not a pleasant sight and
trust<00:02:18.120> me<00:02:18.300> here's<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.140> theory<00:02:19.560> behind<00:02:19.710> the

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
trust me here's the theory behind the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
trust me here's the theory behind the
underground<00:02:20.970> wiring<00:02:21.330> you're<00:02:21.780> supposed<00:02:22.140> to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
underground wiring you're supposed to

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.820 
underground wiring you're supposed to
put<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.650> without<00:02:22.830> any<00:02:23.250> breaks<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:25.350> wire

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
put it in without any breaks in the wire

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.400 
put it in without any breaks in the wire
if<00:02:26.550> once<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.270> cut<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:27.840> with<00:02:28.050> your<00:02:28.200> shovel

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
if once you cut this with your shovel

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.380 
if once you cut this with your shovel
you<00:02:28.770> now<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> break<00:02:29.580> in<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> wire<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
you now have a break in the wire and

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.720 
you now have a break in the wire and
it's<00:02:30.660> not<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.350> good<00:02:31.920> thing<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.370> don't<00:02:32.490> even<00:02:32.550> know
