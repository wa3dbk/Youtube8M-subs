 cupcakes we will make a candy and for that 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.560
 we will need a cup and a half of sugar 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.299
 and a quarter cup of water last 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.329
 to finish decorating our 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.579
 cupcakes we will need a little syrup 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.729
 of strawberry, the first thing we will do is 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.700
 candy we will put a pot on the fire and 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.090
 we will throw the sugar and now we will throw the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.579
 water we put the fire to the minimum the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.090
 we will move a little bit once we have 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:53.840
 already mixed the sugar with the water 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.879
 we put it on the fire and cover it 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.860
 let's look from time to time to see if 

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:00.200
 the sugar is melting as you see 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.149
 so it has to stay because we do not 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.429
 We're going to toast it because we want to make 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.640
 the simulation of a crystal now what 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.280
 we will throw in a flat tray 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.959
 and when it gets cold and it's hard , 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.180
 You can use below 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.310
 we will mix all the ingredients to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.990
 our cupcakes we will first throw the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.990
 sugar and eggs 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:31.370
 and we will beat next we will take the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.390
 butter that we previously have 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.370
 softened and we will continue beating 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.500
 we will continue mixing the yeast with the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.500
 flour and now we have sifting 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.210
 We know milk and teaspoon 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.160

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.160
 and we will finish beating 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:11.680
 once we have our masseuse 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:13.420

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.230

 in the bowl that we have already softened and 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.049
 let's go throwing the sugar a little bit 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.049
 little bit 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.700

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.400
 we have ready the cream 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.190
 now we are going to decorate our 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.760

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.040
 starting with the handle of a knife and 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.040
 break wherever you want 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.510

 blows we have our crystals on 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.920
