00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:08.440
 hello very good to all I'm effect is 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.700
 in this video I will clarify a question 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:16.289
 that many of you can have 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:20.099
 will try how much time we should take out 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.860
 to our furnace that this is something that 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.140
 we should know 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.180
 then at the time of having a lovebug and 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.060
 we already have it to inform us well 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.130
 about the animal not 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.570
 how much we should take it out is very 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 important that if it is to catch or if not 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.760
 you have a partner is much more than if you have 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.699
 couple since if you have a partner even if you 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.320
 will feel accompanied but if not these 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.329
 birds are to have a couple to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.910
 all of life and if they do not have it then 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.079
 erect and if you do not realize it then 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.249
 can fall into recession 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.249
 so good 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.550
 how much time do you have to take it out? 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.579
 it is very relevant, that is, there may be 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.500
 many answers about him but I what 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.140
 What I personally recommend is that 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.560
 have a few hours a day to be able 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.560
 fly 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.050
 if we can 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.390
 the good thing is Carlos every day 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.640
 whenever we are at home that is 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.170
 as long as we are at home that 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.580
 the gapp or is not loose and when we 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.190
 let's go to your town when 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.680
 we will be covering then your cage is worth 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.390
 that would be the optimal life for a 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.150
 presentation of the gabon and would be super 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.000
 happy you could be loose whenever you 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.940
 we are in houses that do not 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.810
 can I, for example, can I not 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.810
 there is a case 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.390
 then what will we do then in the cases 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:50.210
 where you can not, well, at least 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.310
 a week three days a week minimum 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.220
 It's worth the minimum that I recommend if 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.460
 we have a lovebirds only 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.070
 because if you can not fall into depression if 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.540
 not see us for a long time in my 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.390
 house my daughter for anise 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.479
 I usually take out one day and another not to 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.310
 two days in a row and one is not worth 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.530
 because those days that are not with the saga 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.770
 with me then took the bunny over here 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.780
 and then he also comes out 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.540
 agreement 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.220
 so it's good I have two to gabon and 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.220
 the cuqui 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.870
 he got it out about 3 hours 12 hours at 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.090
 day and cookie sixth the day because because 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.520
 the cuqui gets into the cage and when 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.740
 I'm leaving the house is in this 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.890
 room then he when he goes 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.890
 doing at night because this one alone is worth 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.170
 in the sleeping cage so it's reliable without 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.480
 But mickey, if I leave everything if 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.150
 I leave until at night because no 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.420
 only that's worth it that's the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.420
 difference 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.870
 so good 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.410
 on recommendation that the here is so 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.050
 less a day 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.270
 two or three 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.040
 and that if you can more then more than is not 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.610
 bad take it out a lot the most out of it 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.610
 little vale 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.300
 we ask but it is clear for gold 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.300
 about this 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.040
 see you in the next video and now 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:37.640
 you know at least three times a week see it 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:42.069
 very little worth I recommend that you do not take out 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.980
 more because that is very very little 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:49.420
 and if you can not, it's a minimum and if you can 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.420
 more then of course more 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.510
 why is it important to remove it then for 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.060
 the wings and others for each exercise 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.230
 so that he feels good and apart to 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.230
 climb this crop 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.730
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.840
 if you liked to like it and nothing 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.769
 see you next video 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.769
 goodbye
