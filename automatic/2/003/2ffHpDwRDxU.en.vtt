00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.529
 in this sprint is dedicated to windows 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.079
 seven administration let's talk 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.579
 Task Scheduler 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.469
 this windows tool helps to plan 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.000
 automated tasks that achieves 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.760
 actions at 1am when 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.899
 certain event occurs it contains 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.789
 a library of all tasks 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.350
 planned by providing to organize 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.420
 tasks is a convenient access point 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.600
 managed points time to start we 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.100
 have stopped everything and for that you have 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.739
 started then you type planner 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.649
 boyer that shows up there everything in you from 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.730
 click on it to launch then you 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.060
 see a window 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.510
 these files on the central page our 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.799
 tool we have to summarize myself so if the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.290
 overview of schedules 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.840
 of hostages the statuses of the tasks in progress 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.680
 we have none and the tasks 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.350
 active they are two tasks of windows 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.770
 and not created by ourselves make us 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.450
 of course a file is located the teich 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.009
 by sale these last days to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.380
 left we will have the tree of 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.680
 our tool with several things in 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.310
 that here the planner's library 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.140
 of tasks etc 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.430
 so when we create a task we 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.570
 have on the right side 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.189
 two options in the action column 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.439
 basic encryption so it's a task 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.979
 rather simplistic so when a team 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.310
 have designed 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.579
 we arrive on the assistant for 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.049
 creators so if we promise test 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.549
 you can write a description of 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.070
 your task to be able to call you 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.469
 what it is about is the following fact 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.660
 here you put when you want the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.239
 task starts here so when you do 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.350
 major cod is wrongly ceded when you 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.960
 start your computer 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.000
 the more the task will start and not to 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.220
 opening your session which for 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.070
 this option is remote boarding makes you 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.420
 follow here so you choose what 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.250
 the task performs so saved launches a 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.740
 program sends a mail or display 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.990
 a message for example when you 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.990
 want to alert when a computer and 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.700
 start by mail this allows by 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.940
 example of monitoring the activity of a 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.010
 computer so here since we in 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:53.910
 so choose here you put to address 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:55.200
 so let's put a default approach if 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.900
 you can of course put in a piece 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.250
 attached 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.220
 to finish you will enter our 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.130
 fervence cntp so here I like an address 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.750
 we on the random for my part you 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.050
 do next then we come so 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.420
 on the summary page of our hostage 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:20.010
 we have the name the description of the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:22.080
 trigger and the action or p tick 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.630
 this box for the program you 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.300
 open the properties of 70 hp 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.760
 once you have created it click 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.460
 on open for example or doing 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.240
 completed and then we have the 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.310
 property of the task that appears here 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.860
 promises us especially to modify the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.440
 parameters and as we wish 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.240
 this is my stone castle now or 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.140
 for haiti that you also have a 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.450
 chalk of tasks without base this one 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.590
 mean it will be a stain 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.060
 Customized now we can 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.310
 see that there is a second option for 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.570
 clint age so just below create 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.550
 a basic task we created a 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.110
 just a job 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.610
 this option allows you to create a task 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.470
 for advanced users 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.680
 so when we click on it 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.320
 so have all the different options 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.390
 without assistance to guide us 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.150
 so in the end it allows the same thing 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.700
 but with additional options and 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.160
 increased speed for the creation of 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.810
 the task we did not create the task 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.150
 here we can see that we can 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.070
 bring a task so that's when 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.750
 you look at one of your tasks you 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.910
 can of course one worn for example 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.440
 when you want to import a stain 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.980
 across your network for your 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.870
 business 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.720
 here we have his record better and where the 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.170
 active sizes that if we have them 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.450
 different information and active and 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.360
 history of all tasks so 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.730
 while we did that we 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.380
 can of course she is in the 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.050
 library of fishermen from hostages to 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.590
 cashier or not that we have our 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.030
 task that we created so if we 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.860
 so either the cramped be 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.050
 completed be disabled or exported 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.460
 to take it elsewhere you can 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.550
 also edit it by clicking on 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:14.710
 properties of course sublime and 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.900
 do not attach multiple errors here a 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.610
 pom always the new tasks 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.930
 displayed and tasks etc 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:25.360
 we can even classify them by 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:27.730
 folder so we have at historic 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:33.160
 which allows to see when the task has 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:35.800
 been launched and so we come to the 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.020
 end of a kst system that showed you 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.340
 how to use the planner 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.169
 tasks 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.540
 how to create a task to import it 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.870
 view current tasks and see 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.870
 history
