00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
here on that and I've been on a Bigfoot

here on that and I've been on a Bigfoot
poop<00:01:07.720> thing<00:01:08.020> for<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.410> last<00:01:08.530> couple<00:01:08.800> years

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.440 

this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.130> solid<00:01:32.399> wood<00:01:33.860> scent<00:01:34.860> very<00:01:35.100> thick<00:01:35.490> then

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this is solid wood scent very thick then

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.929 
this is solid wood scent very thick then
we<00:01:36.630> machine<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.380> CMC<00:01:37.890> down<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.819> this

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
we machine it on the CMC down to this

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:48.070 
we machine it on the CMC down to this
shape<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:45.060> individual<00:01:45.630> pieces<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.349> see

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
shape of individual pieces I see

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.560 
shape of individual pieces I see
there's<00:01:48.590> there's<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:49.130> difference<00:01:49.670> in<00:01:49.790> sound<00:01:50.150> in

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
there's there's a difference in sound in

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.080

price

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.510 

those<00:01:53.509> two<00:01:53.720> different<00:01:54.049> times<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:55.040> seconds

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
those two different times the seconds

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:09.369 
those two different times the seconds
are<00:01:55.610> actually<00:01:55.939> going<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.090> be<00:01:56.240> more<00:01:56.479> afterlife

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.309 

so<00:02:10.379> much<00:02:10.590> preparation<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.819> into<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.269> but<00:02:13.170> these

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
so much preparation go into it but these

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.680 
so much preparation go into it but these
get<00:02:13.560> minutes<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.730> then<00:02:14.970> glued<00:02:15.180> up<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.569> then

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
get minutes and then glued up and then

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.830 
get minutes and then glued up and then
and<00:02:16.110> then<00:02:16.260> machine<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.069> lot<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.670> lot<00:02:18.599> more

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
and then machine it's a lot a lot more

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.680 
and then machine it's a lot a lot more
time<00:02:19.140> efficient<00:02:19.739> it's<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.160> lot<00:02:20.340> less

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
time efficient it's a lot less

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.059 
time efficient it's a lot less
preparation<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.170> wood<00:02:22.349> except<00:02:22.860> for<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
preparation of the wood except for the

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.130 
preparation of the wood except for the
bending<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.540> what<00:02:24.690> are<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.900> selling<00:02:25.290> these

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
bending so what are you selling these

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.350 
bending so what are you selling these
for<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.530> detail<00:02:27.100> he'll<00:02:27.460> probably<00:02:27.730> be<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.030> hunger

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
for a detail he'll probably be a hunger

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.230 
for a detail he'll probably be a hunger
of<00:02:28.900> hair<00:02:29.110> under<00:02:29.770> there<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.370> think<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.060> great

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
of hair under there I think it's a great

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.140 
of hair under there I think it's a great
price<00:02:31.540> for<00:02:31.570> an<00:02:31.900> awesome<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.790> this<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.060> the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
price for an awesome so this is the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.300 
price for an awesome so this is the
first<00:02:34.390> solid<00:02:35.050> shell<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.680> I've<00:02:35.800> offered<00:02:36.040> with

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
first solid shell that I've offered with

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.740 
first solid shell that I've offered with
dynamics<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.690> what<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:39.420> what<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.450> call

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.819 

we'll<00:03:21.400> set<00:03:21.700> up<00:03:21.730> putting<00:03:21.939> a<00:03:22.030> wooden<00:03:22.390> leg<00:03:22.829> but

still mentally lay in the wood and

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.190 
still mentally lay in the wood and
that's<00:03:26.530> that's<00:03:26.920> part<00:03:27.280> of<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.519> it's<00:03:28.510> part<00:03:28.930> of
