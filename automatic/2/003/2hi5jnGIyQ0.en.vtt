about<00:00:14.379> the<00:00:14.650> Micah<00:00:14.889> shift<00:00:15.190> technique<00:00:15.639> is<00:00:15.850> that

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
about the Micah shift technique is that

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.150 
about the Micah shift technique is that
it's<00:00:16.750> an<00:00:16.930> optical<00:00:17.320> illusion

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160

it<00:00:18.460> looks<00:00:18.789> textured<00:00:19.449> but<00:00:19.630> it's<00:00:19.810> actually

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
it looks textured but it's actually

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.769

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
now with my clay roller I'm going to

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.960 
now with my clay roller I'm going to
apply<00:01:05.379> quite<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.740> bit<00:01:05.980> of<00:01:06.070> pressure<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.670> here

again<00:01:07.090> I've<00:01:07.420> got<00:01:07.570> a<00:01:07.630> card<00:01:07.990> stock<00:01:08.260> underneath

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
again I've got a card stock underneath

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.740 
again I've got a card stock underneath
my<00:01:08.890> clay<00:01:09.160> so<00:01:09.640> that<00:01:09.820> I<00:01:09.850> can<00:01:10.060> have<00:01:10.270> control<00:01:10.720> of

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
my clay so that I can have control of

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.240 
my clay so that I can have control of
the<00:01:11.020> movement<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.470> my<00:01:11.590> clay<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.010> it<00:01:12.070> won't

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
the movement of my clay and it won't

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.060 
the movement of my clay and it won't
stick<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.640> my<00:01:12.730> work<00:01:12.940> surface<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.660> I'm<00:01:14.650> rolling

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
stick to my work surface and I'm rolling

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.250 
stick to my work surface and I'm rolling
back<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:15.640> forth<00:01:15.910> on<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.330> top<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:17.080> bottom

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
back and forth on the top and the bottom

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.500 
back and forth on the top and the bottom
you<00:01:18.160> really<00:01:18.460> want<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.730> be<00:01:18.820> sure<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.300> bond

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
you really want to be sure and bond

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.930 
you really want to be sure and bond
those<00:01:19.720> three<00:01:19.990> layers<00:01:20.230> together<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.640> that<00:01:21.820> you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
those three layers together so that you

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.700 
those three layers together so that you
won't<00:01:22.060> have<00:01:22.210> air<00:01:22.570> bubbles<00:01:22.990> later<00:01:23.320> when<00:01:23.620> you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
won't have air bubbles later when you

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.300 
won't have air bubbles later when you
pull<00:01:23.920> off<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.310> beautiful<00:01:24.550> texture<00:01:25.210> look

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
pull off that beautiful texture look

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.960 
pull off that beautiful texture look
okay<00:01:28.180> next<00:01:28.869> we<00:01:28.960> want<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.200> texture<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
okay next we want to texture that and

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.609 
okay next we want to texture that and
remember<00:01:31.390> when<00:01:31.570> we<00:01:31.659> textured<00:01:32.049> before<00:01:32.409> we

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
remember when we textured before we

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.230 
remember when we textured before we
always<00:01:32.950> spritz<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.430> top<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.790> clay<00:01:33.970> with<00:01:34.150> a

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
always spritz the top of the clay with a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.969 
always spritz the top of the clay with a
little<00:01:34.479> bit<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.630> water<00:01:34.869> just<00:01:35.380> as<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> release

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
little bit of water just as a release

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.070 
little bit of water just as a release
agent<00:01:36.220> between<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.909> raw<00:01:37.119> clay<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
agent between the raw clay and the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.950 
agent between the raw clay and the
texture<00:01:38.440> sheet<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:40.000> time<00:01:40.330> I'm<00:01:40.570> going<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.750> use

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
texture sheet this time I'm going to use

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.680 
texture sheet this time I'm going to use
only<00:01:41.170> my<00:01:41.530> hand<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.190> I'm<00:01:42.280> gonna<00:01:42.430> press<00:01:42.850> really

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
only my hand and I'm gonna press really

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.080 
only my hand and I'm gonna press really
hard<00:01:44.020> this<00:01:44.800> is<00:01:44.979> where<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.280> cardstock<00:01:45.580> comes

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
hard this is where the cardstock comes

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.149 
hard this is where the cardstock comes
in<00:01:46.240> handy<00:01:46.450> again<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:47.050> keep<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.470> clay<00:01:48.100> from

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
in handy again to keep the clay from

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.789 
in handy again to keep the clay from
sticking<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:49.060> even<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.509> craft<00:01:49.750> paper<00:01:50.049> I'm

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
sticking to even the craft paper I'm

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.070 
sticking to even the craft paper I'm
pushing<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:51.580> pushing<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:52.060> pushing<00:01:52.270> because

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
pushing and pushing and pushing because

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.080 
pushing and pushing and pushing because
the<00:01:53.259> deeper<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.799> get<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.159> texture<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.909> more

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
the deeper you get this texture the more

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.570 
the deeper you get this texture the more
beautiful<00:01:55.630> it's<00:01:56.170> going<00:01:56.440> to<00:01:56.530> be<00:01:56.740> in<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.399> end

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
beautiful it's going to be in the end

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.060 
beautiful it's going to be in the end
now<00:01:58.240> I'll<00:01:58.390> just<00:01:58.420> peel<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:58.960> away<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.800> I've

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
now I'll just peel that away and I've

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.310 
now I'll just peel that away and I've
got<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.250> nice<00:02:00.520> deep<00:02:00.940> texture<00:02:01.509> now<00:02:02.020> at<00:02:02.170> this

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
got a nice deep texture now at this

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.100 
got a nice deep texture now at this
point<00:02:02.619> go<00:02:03.220> ahead<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.789> shave<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.840> raised

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
point go ahead and shave the raised

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.850 
point go ahead and shave the raised
surface<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.039> texture<00:02:06.490> off<00:02:06.670> of<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.300> slab

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
surface of the texture off of the slab

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.949 
surface of the texture off of the slab
when<00:02:08.860> we<00:02:09.009> do<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:10.000> mica<00:02:10.269> shift<00:02:10.690> will<00:02:10.929> be

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
when we do that the mica shift will be

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.979 
when we do that the mica shift will be
revealed<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:12.519> just<00:02:12.760> very<00:02:13.030> slowly<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.959> very

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
revealed so just very slowly and very

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.660 
revealed so just very slowly and very
carefully<00:02:14.610> shave<00:02:15.610> only<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:17.470> raised<00:02:17.709> surface

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.910 

you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.819> see<00:02:21.850> when<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.209> remove<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.920> surfaces

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
you can see when I remove the surfaces

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.949 
you can see when I remove the surfaces
how<00:02:24.100> lacy<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.790> looks<00:02:25.060> because<00:02:25.510> I'm<00:02:25.690> trying

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
how lacy it looks because I'm trying

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.500 
how lacy it looks because I'm trying
really<00:02:26.200> hard<00:02:26.350> not<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.800> go<00:02:27.040> any<00:02:27.310> deeper<00:02:27.640> than

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
really hard not to go any deeper than

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.800 
really hard not to go any deeper than
the<00:02:28.660> raised<00:02:28.900> surface<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.769> clay<00:02:33.570> please<00:02:34.570> do

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the raised surface of the clay please do

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.500 
the raised surface of the clay please do
go<00:02:34.959> slowly<00:02:35.620> because<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.310> can<00:02:36.489> go<00:02:36.640> too<00:02:36.700> far<00:02:37.180> too

go slowly because you can go too far too
fast<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.200> then<00:02:38.650> you'll<00:02:38.799> just<00:02:38.980> have<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.400> start

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
fast and then you'll just have to start

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.740

over<00:02:41.730> can<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.880> see<00:02:43.060> how<00:02:43.269> beautiful<00:02:43.720> that

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
over can you see how beautiful that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.560 
over can you see how beautiful that
looks<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.410> still<00:02:44.920> appears<00:02:45.250> textured<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.420> it's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
looks it still appears textured but it's

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.390 
looks it still appears textured but it's
actually<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.049> smooth<00:02:47.350> surface<00:02:47.590> now<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.220> just

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
actually a smooth surface now and just

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.330 
actually a smooth surface now and just
the<00:02:48.579> mica<00:02:49.380> shifting<00:02:50.380> around<00:02:50.709> on<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.010> surface

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the mica shifting around on the surface

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
the mica shifting around on the surface
of<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.519> clay<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.850> what<00:02:52.030> gives<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.329> that

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
of the clay is what gives you that

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.990 
of the clay is what gives you that
illusion<00:02:53.079> now<00:02:54.040> what<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.250> like<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.640> take<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.910> a

illusion now what I like to take it a
step<00:02:55.030> further<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.630> use<00:02:56.079> my<00:02:56.260> finger<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.769> make

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
step further and use my finger to make

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.009 
step further and use my finger to make
sure<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.579> I<00:02:57.640> have<00:02:57.880> all<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.269> raised<00:02:58.450> surfaces

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
sure that I have all the raised surfaces

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.259 
sure that I have all the raised surfaces
removed<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.769> can<00:02:59.950> feel<00:03:00.370> right<00:03:00.609> in<00:03:00.790> here<00:03:01.090> there's

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
removed I can feel right in here there's

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.090 
removed I can feel right in here there's
some<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.840> still<00:03:02.140> sticking<00:03:02.440> up<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:02.950> just

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.160 
smooth I'm going to go ahead and get it
even<00:03:15.910> smoother<00:03:16.269> by<00:03:16.420> rolling<00:03:16.840> over<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.079> top

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
even smoother by rolling over the top

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.970 
even smoother by rolling over the top
again<00:03:17.650> with<00:03:17.859> my<00:03:17.980> clay<00:03:18.190> roller<00:03:18.959> be<00:03:19.959> gentle<00:03:20.500> go

more gold primo and rope making can be a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.920 
more gold primo and rope making can be a
little<00:04:34.979> challenging<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.970> seems<00:04:36.360> like<00:04:36.570> it's<00:04:36.750> so

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
little challenging it seems like it's so

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.290 
little challenging it seems like it's so
easy<00:04:36.960> but<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.650> does<00:04:37.830> take<00:04:38.070> some<00:04:38.250> practice<00:04:38.310> so

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
easy but it does take some practice so

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.790

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
design I'm going to change the head here

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.390 
design I'm going to change the head here
to<00:05:23.010> my<00:05:23.990> two<00:05:24.990> millimeter<00:05:25.470> pointer<00:05:25.979> and<00:05:26.190> these

to my two millimeter pointer and these
are<00:05:26.580> magnetic<00:05:26.909> so<00:05:27.300> they<00:05:27.419> just<00:05:27.599> change<00:05:27.960> quickly

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
are magnetic so they just change quickly

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.180 
are magnetic so they just change quickly

pointer

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560
