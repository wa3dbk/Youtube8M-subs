00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 because you have to work as a 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.960
 black you have to do three or four times 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.240
 what others do to be recognized 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.460
 I have not always been recognized I would have 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.889
 may have been European golden ball 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.599
 once or twice but I have not been I 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.400
 do not claim this because the most 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.949
 important to me these are the titles 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.039
 collective and I won I say thank you 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.710
 to all my teammates but since this 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.930
 title his trophies resists I could have 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.060
 win that I'm not saying that because 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.210
 I am black certainly not I see 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.809
 already the president blatting or officials 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.190
 who will look at me strangely but 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.870
 I might have had to win it 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 to be like others 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.399
 like great champions like morning 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.090
 or others who did not have to win that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.550
 but me , which gives me a bit of French 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.430
 at one point it was the year at 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.289
 carnival to win and we say but samuel 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.149
 eto'o all won he scored 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.590
 many goals he did everything why 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.320
 he did not win no it's that the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 world the year of the world 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.930
 good it means if I'm hurt any 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.680
 the season I come back to the world I 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.110
 mark 6 goals 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.010
 I am the best player in the world 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.130
 yet the best player arouses 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.049
 all year so there are some 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.000
 things like that we find rules that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.259
 arranges us at times and it has 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 always been like that it's history 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.229
 of my life and I am African proud of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.729
 being 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.280
 and when I'm in a stadium 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.290
 football I do not want to just show 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.360
 that I am a good footballer I am 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.400
 an African and we need to know who has 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.590
 other Africans who are maybe 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.850
 even better than me I have a 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.009
 thought for all my young people who are 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.350
 today in barcelona and others who 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.049
 find themselves elsewhere and I come back in 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.240
 back tuesday tuesday if i'm wrong 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.280
 I played against galatasaray and that I 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.229
 had never seen that elsewhere quite a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 stadium that boosts a negative appetite 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.240
 didier drogba who recognized the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.040
 value of a little big nose that I had 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.869
 never seen that myself I went back to 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.180
 barcelona 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.420
 he whistle me with vigor as whistle 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.729
 even went on for me I summarize 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.650
 so it's mine and in south africa 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.530
 the French came back here there was 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.869
 this problem where we said we had to 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.720
 the president of the French federation 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.890
 resigns and I believe the president to 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.220
 the time I had the pleasure of 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.680
 to meet had made some 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.390
 statement the president of africa's 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.640
 the federation had resigned one does not 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.910
 do not know how but a populace the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.640
 fifa never mixed up with us 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.510
 passes from committees an extended committee of 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.950
 mandates 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.170
 me the only thing I want for my 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.480
 country is good I have 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.080
 known what is good and I say to myself 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.910
 if god wanted me to know all that 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.520
 others may know that but it's 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.930
 not in suffering because me 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.150
 I suffered a lot to get there 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.110
 where I am I accepted a lot of 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.810
 things sometimes game was suffering in silence 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.690
 yet I was right and today 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.630
 where I got where I am I am 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.459
 say we can better organize because 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.130
 we won in the others but 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.450
 imagine if we organize ourselves what is this 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.910
 we can do with this team because 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.269
 that there is a lot of talent you have 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.280
 seen against tunisia me back months 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.750
 17 years in this team I had 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.880
 never had so much fun 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.860
 amazing it's amazing to see all 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.870
 these kids playing it was so beautiful 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.610
 and at the end of the match I found myself 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.790
 currently gt pastor players 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.370
 coaches as we often say b 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.540
 we know I said ok I did not know 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.829
 maybe not but it's only 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.079
 I wish for my country that's what he 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.180
 there's better meyer street and those who 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.610
 have abilities to be at certain 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.739
 positions they are there should not 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.810
 to force people because they have a 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.150
 some interest or say because 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.709
 it is Africa then is those who 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.600
 lead African football the 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.790
 global football that are treating us with 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.010
 less respect me I do not allow 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.430
 that because with other nations of 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.769
 soccer 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.620
 we never do that and I do not see 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.970
 why we would do it with cameroon 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.710
 and 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.250
 a lot of African countries we will be yours 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.250
 his mother's sides
