00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
charge more but i don't think i'm going

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.639 
charge more but i don't think i'm going
to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.060> even<00:02:03.330> use<00:02:03.569> it<00:02:03.599> i<00:02:03.869> don't<00:02:04.110> think<00:02:04.349> i<00:02:04.440> do<00:02:04.500> i

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
to do I even use it i don't think i do i

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.639 
to do I even use it i don't think i do i
think<00:02:04.890> i<00:02:05.129> just<00:02:05.160> finished<00:02:05.700> him<00:02:05.789> off<00:02:05.910> with<00:02:06.239> it

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
think i just finished him off with it

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.650 
think i just finished him off with it
with<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.679> coyote<00:02:08.190> attack<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.390> quite<00:02:09.629> frankly

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
with the coyote attack and quite frankly

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.449 
with the coyote attack and quite frankly
i<00:02:10.140> don't<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.530> why<00:02:10.649> i'm<00:02:10.800> holding<00:02:11.220> back<00:02:11.430> i

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
i don't know why i'm holding back i

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.460 
i don't know why i'm holding back i
guess<00:02:11.849> because<00:02:12.090> i<00:02:12.269> just<00:02:12.599> want<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.989> give<00:02:13.230> him<00:02:13.440> a

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
guess because i just want to give him a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.699 
guess because i just want to give him a
bit<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.950> chance<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:15.450> do<00:02:15.599> something<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.379> i<00:02:16.440> can

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
bit of a chance to do something so i can

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.619 
bit of a chance to do something so i can
continue<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:18.019> like<00:02:19.019> pool<00:02:19.530> energy<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.629> just

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
continue to a like pool energy and just

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.960 
continue to a like pool energy and just
show<00:02:21.840> off<00:02:21.870> my<00:02:22.230> new<00:02:22.260> abilities<00:02:22.920> because<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:23.849> you

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
as you can't stack kaio-ken that would

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.759 
as you can't stack kaio-ken that would
be<00:02:25.950> nice<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:27.000> don't<00:02:27.569> know<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.260> this

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.300 
it is possible for you to miss and
destroy<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.140> planet<00:03:04.380> as<00:03:05.390> you'll<00:03:06.390> see<00:03:06.780> later

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.990 
these enemies you have to have a
strategy<00:05:38.780> and<00:05:39.080> this<00:05:39.260> is<00:05:39.410> not<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.950> one<00:05:40.160> not

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
strategy and this is not the one not

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.750 
strategy and this is not the one not
this<00:05:41.240> look<00:05:41.930> at<00:05:42.050> that<00:05:42.430> energy<00:05:43.430> doesn't<00:05:43.610> even

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
this look at that energy doesn't even

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.700 
this look at that energy doesn't even
stay<00:05:44.030> in<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.240> air<00:05:44.420> for<00:05:44.720> me<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.110> do<00:05:45.290> it<00:05:45.440> again<00:05:45.500> oh

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710
