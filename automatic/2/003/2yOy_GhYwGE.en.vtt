is<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.700> handle<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.090> film<00:01:48.329> once<00:01:48.659> that's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
is just a handle of film once that's

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.630 
is just a handle of film once that's
complete<00:01:49.350> then<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.890> remove<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.430> backing

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
complete then you can remove the backing

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.420 
complete then you can remove the backing
paper<00:01:50.970> from<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.110> film<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> need<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
paper from the film then you need to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.460 
paper from the film then you need to
spray<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> little<00:01:54.149> bit<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> solution<00:01:55.259> onto

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
spray a little bit of the solution onto

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.530 
spray a little bit of the solution onto
the<00:01:55.649> headlight<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.130> well<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.060> film<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the headlight as well as the film and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.179 
the headlight as well as the film and
you<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.780> begin<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.110> roughly<00:01:58.409> work<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.860> into

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
you can begin to roughly work it into

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.620 
you can begin to roughly work it into
where<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.549> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.820> reside<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
where it's going to reside on the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.310 
where it's going to reside on the
headlight<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.619> e39<00:02:02.119> it's<00:02:03.119> best<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> orient

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
headlight on the e39 it's best to orient

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.569 
headlight on the e39 it's best to orient
it<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> bottom<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.310> headlight

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
it with the bottom of the headlight

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.310 
it with the bottom of the headlight
where<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> headlight<00:02:06.210> itself<00:02:06.630> meets<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
where the headlight itself meets the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.589 
where the headlight itself meets the
bodied<00:02:07.649> colored<00:02:08.039> trim<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:09.270> hood<00:02:09.420> will

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
bodied colored trim the hood will

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.969 
bodied colored trim the hood will
provide<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.899> little<00:02:10.229> bit<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.410> protection<00:02:10.560> for

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
provide a little bit of protection for

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.619 
provide a little bit of protection for
the<00:02:11.069> top<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> headlamp<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.480> more

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
the top of the headlamp so it's more

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.640 
the top of the headlamp so it's more
important<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.260> meets

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
important that it meets

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.850 
important that it meets
with<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.340> bottom<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:15.510> protect<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.379> majority

with the bottom to protect the majority

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.130 
with the bottom to protect the majority
of<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.280> headlight<00:02:17.579> this<00:02:18.480> will<00:02:18.659> also<00:02:18.930> make<00:02:19.110> it

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
of a headlight this will also make it

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.289 
of a headlight this will also make it
easier<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.769> in<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.400> couple<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.819> years<00:02:21.030> after

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
easier that in a couple of years after

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.210 
easier that in a couple of years after
these<00:02:21.629> films<00:02:22.019> kind<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.409> get<00:02:22.590> embedded<00:02:23.040> with

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
these films kind of get embedded with

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.890 
these films kind of get embedded with
stuff<00:02:23.549> on<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> road<00:02:23.970> they'll<00:02:24.390> make<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.689> lot

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
stuff on the road they'll make it a lot

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.960 
stuff on the road they'll make it a lot
easier<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.409> line<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:25.920> replace<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
easier to line up and replace in the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.640 
easier to line up and replace in the
future<00:02:27.269> once<00:02:27.629> you<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.049> kind<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.319> in<00:02:28.439> place

future once you have it kind of in place

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.960 
future once you have it kind of in place
then<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.040> time<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.250> use<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.459> flattening

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
then it's time to use the flattening

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.330 
then it's time to use the flattening
tool<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> little<00:02:31.379> bit<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.560> heat<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.950> begin

outside of the headlight using quite a
bit<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.200> pressure<00:02:40.379> you'll<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.400> able<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.670> see

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
bit of pressure you'll be able to see

various areas on the headlight and that

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.860 
various areas on the headlight and that
is<00:02:46.769> totally<00:02:46.950> fine<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.879> want<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.420> just<00:02:48.599> keep

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
is totally fine you want to just keep

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.470 
is totally fine you want to just keep
working<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.409> out<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.829> just<00:02:50.549> keep<00:02:51.329> using

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
working it out and just keep using

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.360 
working it out and just keep using
overlapping<00:02:52.049> motions<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.889> work<00:02:53.069> your<00:02:53.250> way

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
overlapping motions and work your way

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.520 
overlapping motions and work your way
around<00:02:53.639> the<00:02:54.000> headlight<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.569> started<00:02:55.019> top<00:02:55.349> and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
around the headlight I started top and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.780 
around the headlight I started top and
then<00:02:55.620> work<00:02:55.769> towards<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.250> bottom<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.579> worked

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
then work towards the bottom that worked

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.729 
then work towards the bottom that worked
best<00:02:56.970> for<00:02:57.060> me<00:02:57.209> once<00:02:58.049> you<00:02:58.170> get<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.590> most

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
best for me once you get to the most

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.960 
best for me once you get to the most
difficult<00:02:59.189> part<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.489> headlight<00:02:59.730> which<00:02:59.849> is

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
difficult part of the headlight which is

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.000 
difficult part of the headlight which is
where<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.269> curves<00:03:00.709> again<00:03:01.709> you're<00:03:01.950> probably

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
where it curves again you're probably

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.410 
where it curves again you're probably
don't<00:03:02.310> have<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.489> go<00:03:02.579> over<00:03:02.790> multiple<00:03:03.239> errors

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
don't have to go over multiple errors

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.789 
don't have to go over multiple errors
multiple<00:03:03.959> times<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:05.340> lens<00:03:05.579> will<00:03:05.939> pop<00:03:05.970> up<00:03:06.799> even

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
multiple times the lens will pop up even

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.619 
multiple times the lens will pop up even
after<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.099> work<00:03:08.220> on<00:03:08.400> multiplier<00:03:08.849> is<00:03:09.090> that's

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
after you work on multiplier is that's

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.059 
after you work on multiplier is that's
okay<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.079> totally<00:03:10.200> normal<00:03:10.470> just<00:03:10.859> keep

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
okay it's totally normal just keep

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.580 
okay it's totally normal just keep
working<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.549> over<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.900> developed<00:03:13.319> a

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
working it over and I developed a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.800 
working it over and I developed a
textbook<00:03:14.069> bubble<00:03:14.579> this<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.299> also<00:03:15.599> pretty

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
textbook bubble this is also pretty

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.050 
textbook bubble this is also pretty
common<00:03:16.220> again<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.340> just<00:03:17.430> want<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.669> attack<00:03:17.879> it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
common again you just want to attack it

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.949 
common again you just want to attack it
from<00:03:18.090> multiple<00:03:18.690> angles<00:03:19.370> using<00:03:20.370> heat<00:03:20.669> and

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
from multiple angles using heat and

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.569 
from multiple angles using heat and
invert<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.199> varying<00:03:22.530> pressures<00:03:22.919> and<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.430> will

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
invert and varying pressures and it will

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.550 
invert and varying pressures and it will
work<00:03:23.760> itself<00:03:24.540> towards<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.049> bottom<00:03:25.199> and<00:03:25.470> when

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
work itself towards the bottom and when

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.250 
work itself towards the bottom and when
it<00:03:25.650> finally<00:03:25.919> dissipates<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:27.389> quite<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:28.049> nice

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
it finally dissipates it is quite a nice

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.069 
it finally dissipates it is quite a nice
feeling<00:03:28.879> it's<00:03:29.879> gone<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.419> just<00:03:30.629> kind<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:30.900> keep

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
feeling it's gone you just kind of keep

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.360 
feeling it's gone you just kind of keep
working<00:03:31.260> over<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> make<00:03:31.769> sure<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:32.220> is

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
working over to make sure that it is

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.830 
working over to make sure that it is
gone<00:03:32.609> for<00:03:32.909> good

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
gone for good

bottom edges to see I'll just go around

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.039 
bottom edges to see I'll just go around
the<00:03:41.099> headlight<00:03:41.370> multiple<00:03:41.819> times<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.389> make

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
the lens and the headlight itself

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.920 
the lens and the headlight itself
alright<00:03:47.250> guys<00:03:47.489> so<00:03:47.699> it's<00:03:47.879> been<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.269> couple<00:03:48.299> of

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
alright guys so it's been a couple of

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.000 
alright guys so it's been a couple of
weeks<00:03:49.349> since<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.949> put<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.479> clear<00:03:52.010> protective

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
weeks since I put the clear protective

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.430 
weeks since I put the clear protective
film<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:53.489> my<00:03:53.669> headlights<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.359> they<00:03:55.260> have

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
film on my headlights and they have

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.899 
film on my headlights and they have
cleared<00:03:55.739> up<00:03:55.799> nicely<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.280> failed<00:03:56.639> to<00:03:56.790> mention

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
cleared up nicely I failed to mention

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.020 
cleared up nicely I failed to mention
before<00:03:57.479> when<00:03:58.409> you<00:03:58.530> put<00:03:58.739> these<00:03:58.889> on<00:03:59.069> you<00:03:59.819> might

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
before when you put these on you might

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.189 
before when you put these on you might
get<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.419> kind<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.989> hazy<00:04:01.379> looking<00:04:03.109> kind<00:04:04.109> of

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
get this kind of hazy looking kind of

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.349 
get this kind of hazy looking kind of
like<00:04:04.260> cloudy<00:04:04.739> substance<00:04:05.400> that's<00:04:05.970> totally

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
like cloudy substance that's totally

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.039 
like cloudy substance that's totally
normal<00:04:06.510> that's<00:04:06.870> just<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.370> solution<00:04:09.049> between

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
normal that's just the solution between

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.699 
normal that's just the solution between
the

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
the

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.709 
the
and<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:11.890> film<00:04:12.159> itself<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:13.090> will<00:04:13.209> disappear

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:13.719 
and the film itself that will disappear

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.479 
and the film itself that will disappear
over<00:04:14.109> a<00:04:14.140> couple<00:04:14.469> days<00:04:14.620> took<00:04:14.799> about<00:04:15.010> three<00:04:15.340> days

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
over a couple days took about three days

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.969 
over a couple days took about three days
for<00:04:15.549> mine<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.209> clear<00:04:16.389> up<00:04:16.570> but<00:04:17.410> now<00:04:17.650> they<00:04:17.949> are

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
for mine and clear up but now they are

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.650 
for mine and clear up but now they are
totally<00:04:18.729> clear<00:04:19.030> there<00:04:19.209> are<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.299> couple<00:04:19.419> places

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
totally clear there are a couple places

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.020 
totally clear there are a couple places
I<00:04:20.019> made<00:04:20.259> small<00:04:20.979> mistakes<00:04:21.519> just<00:04:21.789> because<00:04:21.940> I

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
I made small mistakes just because I

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.290 
I made small mistakes just because I
wasn't<00:04:22.210> pressing<00:04:23.020> hard<00:04:23.830> enough<00:04:24.100> no<00:04:24.850> one<00:04:25.180> is

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
wasn't pressing hard enough no one is

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.090 
wasn't pressing hard enough no one is
right<00:04:25.570> here<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:26.350> can<00:04:26.440> kind<00:04:26.710> of<00:04:26.740> see<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:26.949> little

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
right here you can kind of see a little

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.820 
right here you can kind of see a little
bubble<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:28.360> one<00:04:28.720> is<00:04:28.930> right<00:04:29.110> there

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
bubble and one is right there

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.499 
bubble and one is right there
but<00:04:30.250> that's<00:04:30.430> okay<00:04:30.669> it<00:04:30.759> was<00:04:30.880> my<00:04:31.030> first<00:04:31.240> time

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
but that's okay it was my first time

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.439 
but that's okay it was my first time
doing<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.169> so<00:04:32.229> they're<00:04:32.590> really<00:04:32.740> minor<00:04:33.449> outside

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
doing it so they're really minor outside

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:35.850 
doing it so they're really minor outside
of<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:34.690> it's<00:04:34.900> kind<00:04:35.080> of<00:04:35.169> hard<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.470> tell<00:04:35.680> if<00:04:35.770> the

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
of that it's kind of hard to tell if the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.680 
of that it's kind of hard to tell if the
film<00:04:36.100> was<00:04:36.130> on<00:04:36.310> there<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.550> can<00:04:36.699> see<00:04:36.910> it<00:04:37.509> does

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
film was on there you can see it does

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.510 
film was on there you can see it does
how<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.050> doesn't<00:04:38.350> totally<00:04:38.560> cover<00:04:39.039> the<00:04:39.160> top<00:04:39.340> of

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
how it doesn't totally cover the top of

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.670 
how it doesn't totally cover the top of
the<00:04:39.580> headlight<00:04:39.940> here<00:04:40.210> but<00:04:41.169> that's<00:04:41.320> pretty

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
the headlight here but that's pretty

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.860 
the headlight here but that's pretty
minimal<00:04:42.310> chances<00:04:43.120> you're<00:04:43.270> gonna<00:04:43.389> get<00:04:43.600> a<00:04:43.660> lot

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
minimal chances you're gonna get a lot

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.320 
minimal chances you're gonna get a lot
of<00:04:43.930> snow<00:04:43.990> chips<00:04:44.320> they're<00:04:44.699> pretty<00:04:45.699> slim<00:04:46.030> that's

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
of snow chips they're pretty slim that's

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.159 
of snow chips they're pretty slim that's
appreciated<00:04:46.720> so<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:48.490> headlight<00:04:48.910> is<00:04:49.630> pretty

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
appreciated so the headlight is pretty

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.629 
appreciated so the headlight is pretty
well<00:04:50.440> protected<00:04:50.680> with<00:04:51.039> that<00:04:51.160> on<00:04:51.310> there<00:04:51.520> it's

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
well protected with that on there it's

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.629 
well protected with that on there it's
the<00:04:51.729> same<00:04:51.940> kind<00:04:52.360> of<00:04:52.449> story<00:04:52.660> over<00:04:53.020> on<00:04:53.110> this<00:04:53.289> side
