00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.480
 knew how to do anything that disabs kilo 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.380
 and today I'm bringing 6 purpose is that the text 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.680
 I know it's a modality their ancestors 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.989
 on the map in total 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.550
 a modality that 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.819
 has a salience to Brazilian journalists 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.329
 but few people make video 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.680
 and as the staff has a lot of people here, writing is not enough. 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:33.720
 asking for such 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.800
 the mission to bring you a video in your state clarifies that a part 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.649
 From here I already have mine like all some time not to have some more time 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.879
 it's on my last new lap already 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.120
 and I managed to make a great match 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.120
 ah the semapa that there is still a problem in the reservation 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.170
 in this range that already spoke with the problem 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.140
 Internet 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.339
 every month the side 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.809
 but even so after running over the long tiger inaccuracy cover 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:59.720
 red 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.420
 I was super aggressive 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.220
 the super determined forward to kill them treats them with a lot of desire to play 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.970
 the north of afghanistan 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.010
 the audience 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.290
 we will be fierce as far as possible because your first round 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.260
 made the goals scored 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.310
 other militants 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.549
 the very important instrument the next cover first quarter already in the 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.000
 first part of the day of presentation exits 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.410
 a good sequence from which they see them grow 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.700
 who see follow plate had low points high points 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.400
 I always the 60s simultaneously of elite citizenships 2 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.790
 only that often times the times do not work out with ends up dying then 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.360
 this strike had contusion of the most distant and aggressive points 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.930
 It is important to give an insured because the game was a bit complicated without your 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.140
 consent and we will not accept that the government does 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.180
 as 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.180
 the pressure increased the number of Brazilians are these advantages 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.470
 law that suspends meaning that is natural 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.910
 but even so I felt like I was hurting 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.960
 kind of equal to the same with the guys 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.329
 I do not know if they were not very good signs 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.669
 if it was incia collection it had taken a nice taste that the collection type case 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.089
 cool and I got it 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:16.759
 I think we play well 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:22.219
 fire leaves you accompany the executive speaks by the matter here or in namibe 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.349
 Just keep saying these things are 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.340
 but it's up I had commented on my other son of the team profession riva 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.029
 who did not have the time to talk about the use of 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.709
 - to vote for me I liked this listener favorite things like this 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:40.259
 I think it would be important that he had access transitional gifts are 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.889
 thank you here we have much less favorite 20 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.059
 but you know and when you are doing it for example 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.470
 she and I kind of have a ceasefire 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.779
 let's suppose that 4,000 enrolled in my character 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.099
 I'm going to click on the video you like about it. 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.259
 I'll be sad 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.439
 for all the people who are registered in the channel will appreciate the 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.499
 analyst on the first page 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.080
 keitel half a kilo 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.589
 you of victims 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.689
 so what happen 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.219
 this ends up escaping in one way or another 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.389
 this becomes a current for example implies respect 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.619
 the friend you have friends in the forest promises person will watch too 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:22.699
 then it's kind of like a half-propagated vial that way then 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.439
 so it's a chain in you will vote for others or watching then 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.969
 this is really cool and the coolest of all of the law here is not obviously think 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.179
 the person who has no habit of doing this 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:37.099
 because it is a simple gesture by promising more than five seconds doing silver 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.729
 that 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.519
 just click the you button if you want to be favored if it will help a lot 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:41.930
 also 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.799
 but you're not required to do this 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.359
 guimarÃ£es pt-ce fischer will help you a lot 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.370
 from simple 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.590
 teacher if you do not spend anything to do this integration 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.590
 so it does not cost me sometimes just that these people 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:00.009
 the entourage of the pt that through the video of the single 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.810
 the website 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.129
 I'd rather visit it really that helps 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.419
 and he has three stands in knowing gift of a simple gesture of clicking on a 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.629
 simple button 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.350
 that every day of about a year in one way or another 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.820
 ends up helping the person gets a little more difficult 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.330
 and for those who, for example, already have a lower vision level, we do not have 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.730
 said jalkh much the contrary we have people on youtube had you guys to 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.600
 comparsa of 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.080
 has much more experience 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.789
 But this is 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.150
 as you will suppose that you want through a quantity 

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.569
 reviews quantity favorite quantity 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.810
 It's all this helps in spreading your child so he can be more 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.879
 accessed by other people 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.909
 so folks if you can 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.520
 I always say I did not like it if you do not like sharing, no problem. 

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:53.119
 accurate click on like and also would like to ask does not imply no 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:57.259
 I like the do not like you have the right to be clear if the sales that 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.460
 the river will not like 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.110
 You have the right to do this. 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.830
 but who does not see anything making covenants doing that, right? 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.520
 Caetano does not 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.520
 and you there you will not have gained anything at all 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.330
 if you do not want to help at least the times you do not try not mess here 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.360
 have this campaign because 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.389
 in totem and is not that having nothing with it so neither bring at first guess 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.419
 that the person has to do this I think it has no logic is not funny at all 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:22.360
 then the subject in this 3rd 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.610
 I'm just saying that because 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.960
 This helps a lot not only for me 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.150
 like the other Brazilian companions 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.620
 if you're watching videos these may be costing the video 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.100
 of them this will help a lot I do this promises other people 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.060
 that make video also does as we have enough Brazilian that 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.050
 is beginning to make videos that already 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.260
 it's still a people always tries to make believe it's going to help people 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:51.169
 to continue making the videos now meets 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.639
 strength will to 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.440
 to seek new resources 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.129
 make some types of clothes 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:59.010
 the feline does not 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.619
 If you click, I'll let you know. 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:03.779
 the person starts to have a little more wine the piece the people start to 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:07.050
 enjoy the work aside but that way a little different 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.379
 and with this ends up making the person much more excited much more at ease 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.240
 It always was to keep fighting 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.960
 behind extinguished improvements passing the increasingly cool videos to you 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.600
 can 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.759
 is watching 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.439
 discovery provides more 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.369
 It's a matter the important thing to say to you, I hope you do not stay. 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.849
 bored cearÃ¡ 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.780
 and coming back on top of nobody 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.180
 salmoni first qualifier 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.779
 although it will end 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.050
 until now the funding in art to the final part of the training 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.360

 I'm going to stop talking I'll let you guys follow 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.939
 signal clause 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:46.110
 with those who in an intense way and galley was worth
