00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello and welcome they were 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.420
 protected to novelties this product in 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.910
 this video I told you about the tale 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.279
 press nt 2000 train while we press 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.710
 this is the high level range the war of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.840
 top of the train mark here born 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.100
 means die times so it's a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.269
 product to use at night all 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.730
 simply because this is about 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.470
 casino but this advantage is easy to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.119
 to put a basic but on the cazine 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.740
 micellar so he skates to denature 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.390
 which will be much more interesting 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 for the body and also at the level of 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.910
 our digestive system in terms of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.520
 dosage 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.450
 we're going to have on his 18% protein what 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.090
 is perfectly fine for a 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.739
 type products with 3.9 percent 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.120
 carbohydrates and 2% fat 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.129
 so we're really on a dosage 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.840
 interesting with I remind him of the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.030
 cazine serves me so it's really a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.460
 kind of almost more interesting than 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 the classic calcium casino after 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.969
 other advantage on this product 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.890
 we're going to have some loans and probiotics on 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.899
 aim being to improve the management of 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.250
 product but also more generally the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.559
 health of your digestive system 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.960
 so that's a positive point is a little bit 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.189
 negative at the same time because actually 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.080
 it's going to be everyone's duty some sells 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.280
 very well tolerated and other ports of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.140
 so worry about it but I want to 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.880
 to say to test you see what it gives 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.009
 I tested for several days 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.530
 I had no problem over there after at 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.280
 to say whether it will improve the effectiveness of the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.810
 digestive system 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.810
 there by cons I'm not able to 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.820
 read and finally other positively this 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.290
 product does not lag the code 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.890
 anti-doping then a little test so 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.420
 chocolate a pod in 200 mm more 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.420
 that d'oran 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.350
 so we have a mix that she really 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.690
 very well I have not his side the otan did not 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.970
 no point not all the bads or it's 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.260
 really very very fine to move on to 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.760
 the insignificant actually not the 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:03.740
 moment our mix is happening on 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:07.760
 fit well in the group I wanted 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.869
 not bad is it sweet enough I 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.619
 mean it is more loaded with sugar 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.000
 when chocolate 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.400
 not rather interesting for 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.720
 People who like very sweet taste 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.700
 so to conclude on this product 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.380
 we are on a product that is good 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.510
 concentrated in protein with the added 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.230
 micellar cathine the addition of near and 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.600
 ProMetic 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.860
 and then indicated smyrne really well I 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.020
 mix gives appointment on which of 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.580
