00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
all right anyone Cody here with some

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.829 
all right anyone Cody here with some
more<00:00:02.669> rocket<00:00:03.389> science<00:00:04.580> so<00:00:05.580> uh<00:00:05.609> yeah<00:00:06.600> I'm<00:00:06.720> about

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
more rocket science so uh yeah I'm about

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.470 
more rocket science so uh yeah I'm about
ready<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.440> perform<00:00:07.589> another<00:00:07.919> test<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.580> see

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
ready to perform another test you see

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.940 
ready to perform another test you see
here<00:00:09.719> I've<00:00:09.840> actually<00:00:10.050> got<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.349> propellants

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
here I've actually got the propellants

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.209 
here I've actually got the propellants
loaded<00:00:11.219> already<00:00:11.509> you<00:00:12.509> see<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.870> yellow

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
loaded already you see the yellow

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.490 
loaded already you see the yellow
yellowish<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:15.299> nitric<00:00:15.599> acid<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
yellowish is the nitric acid and the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.470 
yellowish is the nitric acid and the
dark<00:00:16.949> red<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:20.060> off-road<00:00:21.060> diesel<00:00:21.420> fuel<00:00:22.100> so

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
dark red is the off-road diesel fuel so

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.550 
dark red is the off-road diesel fuel so
yeah<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.779> before<00:00:25.170> I'm<00:00:25.320> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> be

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
yeah like before I'm going to be

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.859 
yeah like before I'm going to be
pressurizing<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:26.580> instead<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> using<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
pressurizing it but instead of using the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.630 
pressurizing it but instead of using the
copper<00:00:28.470> tanks<00:00:28.980> I'm<00:00:29.099> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.340> using<00:00:29.550> this

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
copper tanks I'm going to be using this

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.979 
copper tanks I'm going to be using this
propylene<00:00:30.330> tubing<00:00:31.520> because<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:32.989> something

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
propylene tubing because it's something

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.479 
propylene tubing because it's something
I<00:00:34.079> found<00:00:34.350> that's<00:00:34.530> very<00:00:34.829> resistant<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
I found that's very resistant to the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.860 
I found that's very resistant to the
acid<00:00:36.620> PVC<00:00:37.700> PVC<00:00:38.700> won't<00:00:39.180> handle<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.660> it'll

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
acid PVC PVC won't handle it it'll

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.690 
acid PVC PVC won't handle it it'll
actually<00:00:40.050> turn<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:40.920> charcoal<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
actually turn it to like charcoal and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.110 
actually turn it to like charcoal and
call<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> tree<00:00:42.120> brittle<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.660> also<00:00:43.100> explosive

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
call the tree brittle and also explosive

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.000 
call the tree brittle and also explosive
so<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> couldn't<00:00:45.390> use<00:00:45.510> PVC<00:00:45.930> pipe<00:00:46.170> which<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.890> why

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
so I couldn't use PVC pipe which is why

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.590 
so I couldn't use PVC pipe which is why
I<00:00:47.039> used<00:00:47.309> copper<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> begin<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.480> I'm

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
I used copper to begin with but and I'm

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.420 
I used copper to begin with but and I'm
just<00:00:51.840> using<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.140> coil<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.829> propylene

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
just using a coil of this propylene

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.209 
just using a coil of this propylene
tubing<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:55.820> hopefully<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.030> works

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
tubing and hopefully that works

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.160 
tubing and hopefully that works
hopefully<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.280> don't<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.460> any<00:00:59.640> leaks<00:01:00.170> that'd

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
hopefully I don't have any leaks that'd

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.369 
hopefully I don't have any leaks that'd
be<00:01:01.289> bad<00:01:02.329> all<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:03.510> yeah<00:01:03.719> we're<00:01:03.960> about<00:01:04.080> ready

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
be bad all right yeah we're about ready

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
be bad all right yeah we're about ready
to<00:01:04.559> pull<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> test<00:01:05.220> I'm<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.180> going<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.330> have

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
to pull the test I'm just going to have

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.380 
to pull the test I'm just going to have
this<00:01:06.570> hooked<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> air<00:01:07.710> tank<00:01:08.240> just<00:01:09.240> use

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
this hooked up to a air tank just use

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.380 
this hooked up to a air tank just use
compressed<00:01:09.810> air<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.140> run<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> fuel<00:01:10.619> through

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
compressed air to run the fuel through

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
compressed air to run the fuel through
that's<00:01:12.390> tight<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.560> water<00:01:13.830> again<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.460> water

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
that's tight this water again is water

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.109 
that's tight this water again is water
with<00:01:15.659> sodium<00:01:15.869> carbonate<00:01:16.439> mixed<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.030> I'll<00:01:18.030> be

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
with sodium carbonate mixed in I'll be

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.350 
with sodium carbonate mixed in I'll be
running<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> through<00:01:18.920> momentarily<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
running that through momentarily and the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.969 
running that through momentarily and the
igniter<00:01:25.640> instead<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.759> using<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.979> electric

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
igniter instead of using the electric

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.100 
igniter instead of using the electric
igniter<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.700> did<00:01:29.850> last<00:01:30.000> time<00:01:30.180> I'm

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
igniter like I did last time I'm

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.010 
igniter like I did last time I'm
actually<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.710> using<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.900> kind<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
actually going to be using a kind of a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
actually going to be using a kind of a
modified<00:01:34.350> DOX<00:01:34.860> acetylene<00:01:35.340> torch<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.000> I've<00:01:36.119> got

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
modified DOX acetylene torch so I've got

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.090 
modified DOX acetylene torch so I've got
actually<00:01:36.420> got<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> fire<00:01:37.020> burning<00:01:37.500> inside<00:01:37.650> there

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
actually got a fire burning inside there

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.550 
actually got a fire burning inside there
to<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:39.030> we'll<00:01:39.119> be<00:01:39.210> much<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:39.420> reliable

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:02:35.120 

okay<00:01:43.590> t-minus<00:01:44.579> one<00:01:44.790> minute<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.979> do<00:01:46.979> this

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:03:17.979 

you

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.050 

that<00:03:18.989> was<00:03:19.140> fun<00:03:19.380> wasn't<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:21.480> looks<00:03:21.630> like<00:03:21.870> I

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
that was fun wasn't it it looks like I

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.620 
that was fun wasn't it it looks like I
did<00:03:24.060> get<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.300> burn<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:26.069> acid<00:03:26.940> did<00:03:27.120> seem<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.480> burn

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
did get a burn the acid did seem to burn

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.290 
did get a burn the acid did seem to burn
with<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.840> fuel<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.500> did<00:03:28.709> produce<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.610> nice

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
with the fuel and it did produce a nice

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.040 
with the fuel and it did produce a nice
cone<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.810> flame<00:03:31.050> for<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.530> couple<00:03:32.099> of<00:03:32.130> seconds<00:03:32.520> I

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
cone of flame for a couple of seconds I

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.780 
cone of flame for a couple of seconds I
am<00:03:34.050> however<00:03:34.440> afraid<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.220> most<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.670> it

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
am however afraid that most of it

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.290 
am however afraid that most of it
actually<00:03:36.180> burned<00:03:36.480> out<00:03:36.989> here<00:03:37.940> like<00:03:38.940> for<00:03:39.150> some

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
actually burned out here like for some

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.240 
actually burned out here like for some
reason<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.720> fire<00:03:39.959> got<00:03:40.200> pushed<00:03:40.440> out<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.160> it

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
reason the fire got pushed out and it

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.650 
reason the fire got pushed out and it
didn't<00:03:41.489> burn<00:03:41.610> inside<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.209> combustion

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
didn't burn inside the combustion

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.250 
didn't burn inside the combustion
chamber<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.940> there's<00:03:45.599> still<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.780> lot<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:45.959> got<00:03:46.140> to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
chamber so there's still a lot I got to

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.110 
chamber so there's still a lot I got to
work<00:03:46.380> on<00:03:46.560> obviously<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:49.440> was<00:03:49.590> still<00:03:50.030> kind<00:03:51.030> of

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
work on obviously it was still kind of

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.590 
work on obviously it was still kind of
cool<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:51.980> think<00:03:53.030> what<00:03:54.030> I'm<00:03:54.120> going<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.269> do<00:03:54.390> right

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
cool I think what I'm going to do right

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.780 
cool I think what I'm going to do right
now<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:55.620> I'm<00:03:55.799> actually<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.250> going<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.459> fill

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
now is I'm actually just going to fill

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.210 
now is I'm actually just going to fill
up<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:58.470> diesel<00:03:59.069> fuel<00:03:59.420> and<00:04:00.420> do<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:00.959> burn<00:04:01.260> without

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
up the diesel fuel and do a burn without

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.309 
up the diesel fuel and do a burn without
any<00:04:02.430> acid<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.450> we<00:04:03.540> can<00:04:03.690> compare<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.140> sound<00:04:05.069> good

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
any acid so we can compare it sound good

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.870 
any acid so we can compare it sound good
okay<00:04:07.370> we<00:04:08.370> loaded<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.790> fuel<00:04:09.090> again<00:04:10.580> ready<00:04:11.580> for

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
okay we loaded the fuel again ready for

00:04:11.880 --> 00:05:02.990 
okay we loaded the fuel again ready for
the<00:04:12.000> control<00:04:12.720> test

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.350 

okay<00:05:05.190> how'd<00:05:06.190> that<00:05:06.340> do<00:05:07.440> never<00:05:08.440> look<00:05:08.680> it<00:05:08.830> here

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
okay how'd that do never look it here

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.830 
okay how'd that do never look it here
looks<00:05:10.360> like<00:05:10.599> I<00:05:10.720> just<00:05:10.750> ran<00:05:11.080> out<00:05:11.139> of<00:05:11.379> water<00:05:12.840> there

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
looks like I just ran out of water there

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.980 
looks like I just ran out of water there
all<00:05:14.530> right<00:05:15.690> well<00:05:17.430> make<00:05:18.430> sure<00:05:18.460> this<00:05:18.729> is<00:05:18.879> off<00:05:19.060> it

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
all right well make sure this is off it

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.010 
all right well make sure this is off it
is<00:05:23.430> say<00:05:24.430> yeah<00:05:24.610> looks<00:05:25.150> like<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.419> did<00:05:25.569> aerate<00:05:25.900> the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
is say yeah looks like it did aerate the

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.249 
is say yeah looks like it did aerate the
feel<00:05:26.229> a<00:05:26.259> little<00:05:26.530> bit<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:26.979> I<00:05:27.190> got<00:05:27.370> the<00:05:28.259> flashes

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
feel a little bit and I got the flashes

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:30.839 
feel a little bit and I got the flashes
from<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:29.530> torch<00:05:29.830> but<00:05:30.190> that<00:05:30.340> was<00:05:30.490> pretty<00:05:30.699> much

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
from the torch but that was pretty much

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.270 
from the torch but that was pretty much
it<00:05:30.909> on<00:05:31.180> this<00:05:31.389> run

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
it on this run

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.800 
it on this run
it<00:05:33.280> didn't<00:05:33.520> really<00:05:33.669> burn<00:05:33.940> most<00:05:34.330> of<00:05:34.509> the<00:05:34.569> fuel

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
it didn't really burn most of the fuel

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.180 
it didn't really burn most of the fuel
it<00:05:34.960> just<00:05:35.110> all<00:05:35.259> drained<00:05:35.650> out<00:05:37.680> all<00:05:38.680> right

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
it just all drained out all right

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.480 
it just all drained out all right
I<00:05:40.860> think<00:05:41.860> that<00:05:42.009> the<00:05:42.190> successful<00:05:42.729> test<00:05:44.490> and

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
I think that the successful test and

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.520 
I think that the successful test and
hopefully<00:05:46.449> my<00:05:46.569> next<00:05:46.599> design<00:05:47.080> will<00:05:47.229> be<00:05:47.319> far

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
hopefully my next design will be far

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.020 
hopefully my next design will be far
better<00:05:48.599> see<00:05:49.599> you<00:05:49.690> next<00:05:49.900> time
