everything like this necessarily works

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:21.319

they're<00:01:18.960> quite<00:01:19.170> big<00:01:19.249> tablet<00:01:20.249> so<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.240> know

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
that's something to note I guess as good

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.639 
that's something to note I guess as good
as<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.359> a<00:01:24.389> general<00:01:24.659> multivitamin<00:01:25.560> or

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
dieting or anything like that but maybe

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.099

if<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.799> maybe<00:01:29.399> lack<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.969> a<00:01:30.030> few<00:01:30.210> vitamins<00:01:30.509> then

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
if you maybe lack in a few vitamins then

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.989 
if you maybe lack in a few vitamins then
this<00:01:31.649> is<00:01:31.799> probably<00:01:32.039> a<00:01:32.189> good<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.639> it's<00:01:32.850> good

a<00:02:48.810> good<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.290> was<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.799> bit<00:02:49.920> worried<00:02:50.190> when<00:02:50.220> I

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
a good in I was a bit worried when I

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.830 
a good in I was a bit worried when I
first<00:02:50.549> pick<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.849> up<00:02:51.030> because<00:02:51.150> I've<00:02:51.540> tried<00:02:51.720> to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
first pick this up because I've tried to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.250 
first pick this up because I've tried to
balance<00:02:52.019> me<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.849> purifying<00:02:53.849> facial<00:02:54.450> cleanser

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
balance me and purifying facial cleanser

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.080 
balance me and purifying facial cleanser
i<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.860> was<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.040> irie<00:02:56.519> didn't<00:02:56.760> like<00:02:56.880> it

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
i think it was and irie didn't like it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.059 
i think it was and irie didn't like it
and<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:57.989> thought<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.319> was<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.650> but<00:02:58.950> it's

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
and so I thought it was this but it's

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.979 
and so I thought it was this but it's
actually<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.459> revitalizing<00:03:00.090> hand<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.840> body

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
actually the revitalizing hand and body

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.479 
actually the revitalizing hand and body
wash<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.410> again<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.650> could<00:03:01.799> probably<00:03:02.069> take<00:03:02.370> this

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
wash so again I could probably take this

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.640 
wash so again I could probably take this
away<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:02.819> me<00:03:02.910> tomorrow<00:03:03.290> let's<00:03:04.290> see<00:03:04.440> if<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.620> can

quite<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.750> good<00:05:30.930> box<00:05:31.140> I<00:05:31.440> think<00:05:31.950> it's<00:05:32.070> really

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
quite a good box I think it's really

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.590 
quite a good box I think it's really
good<00:05:32.430> obviously<00:05:32.940> if<00:05:33.180> you're<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.390> sort<00:05:33.510> of

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
good obviously if you're the sort of

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.180 
good obviously if you're the sort of
person<00:05:33.660> that<00:05:33.990> travels<00:05:34.410> around<00:05:34.500> i<00:05:34.830> think<00:05:35.040> if

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
person that travels around i think if

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.490 
person that travels around i think if
you<00:05:35.220> maybe<00:05:35.520> just<00:05:35.670> sort<00:05:36.060> of<00:05:36.120> don't<00:05:36.900> really<00:05:37.200> care

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
you maybe just sort of don't really care

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.260 
you maybe just sort of don't really care
about<00:05:37.740> beauty<00:05:38.130> products<00:05:38.430> all<00:05:38.640> that<00:05:38.820> much<00:05:39.000> and

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
about beauty products all that much and

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.580 
about beauty products all that much and
you<00:05:39.300> kind<00:05:39.510> of<00:05:39.540> just<00:05:39.690> use<00:05:39.930> what<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.200> know<00:05:40.230> then

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
you kind of just use what you know then

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.260 
you kind of just use what you know then
beauty<00:05:40.800> boxes<00:05:41.280> maybe<00:05:41.490> aren't<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:41.940> best<00:05:42.030> thing

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
beauty boxes maybe aren't the best thing

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.850 
beauty boxes maybe aren't the best thing
for<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:42.510> but<00:05:42.750> if<00:05:42.840> you're<00:05:42.960> like<00:05:43.140> me<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:43.680> you
