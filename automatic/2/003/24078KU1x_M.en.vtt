00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.799
 tree peony beautiful perennial 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:13.099
 plant which 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:16.039
 blooms in May and after flowering 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.560
 tree peony starts to bloom 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.600
 grass peonies 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.859
 This is a very beautiful plant which 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.869
 may be a bush and formed 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.630
 tree 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.780
 This is what the buds look like 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:41.300
 who are starting to wake up at the end 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.300
 March early April and the peony blooms in May 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 there are quite a few varieties of it 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.629
 be terry and 1 petal but all 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.899
 Of course all varieties look 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:02.789
 looks very nice can have 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:10.229
 trim bottom go as single-barreled or 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:13.460
 a lot of trunks shrub type this already 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.180
 optionally here you see what 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:22.610
 presented and the type of trees and similar 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.479
 on such a bush it all depends on the desire and 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.720
 correct pruning 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.890
 it is necessary to cut in the spring before blooming 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.460
 the kidneys and leave from the main trunk 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.920
 only 10 centimeters on each branch 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.890
 then the power of the plant will be 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.579
 pretty big and there will be many 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.850
 colors how to propagate multiplies 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:55.610
 dividing the bush if the bush is 68 years old 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:02:00.570
 also layering need to press the bottom 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.780
 twigs well deepen centimeters 15 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.690
 top layer of soil can be 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.110
 multiply 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.340
 seeds and after flowering is formed 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:16.270
 boll but if you bother them 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.180
 look if you don't want a lot of seeds 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.120
 leave at least one box in order 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.320
 to have an idea as seeds 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:31.440
 can be propagated but it will be pretty 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:35.440
 they will long bloom in the sixth year 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.760
 best layering and dividing the bush 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:44.050
 can also be grafting 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:48.270
 semi-woody cuttings but if my 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.270
 you liked the movie leave light
