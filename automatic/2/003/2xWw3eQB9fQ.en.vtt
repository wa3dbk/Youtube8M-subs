00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
if it has mechanical steering you're

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.210 
if it has mechanical steering you're
going<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.700> have<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.150> replace<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.800> steering

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
you've done that when you've measured

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.399 
you've done that when you've measured

the cables that you may take off of a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.340 
the cables that you may take off of a
boat<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:23.159> original<00:01:24.030> equipment<00:01:24.659> cables

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
boat are the original equipment cables

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.880 
boat are the original equipment cables
and<00:01:25.530> they<00:01:26.009> could<00:01:26.280> be<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.509> length<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and they could be in a length that is a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.730 
and they could be in a length that is a
foot<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.790> fraction<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:31.020> an<00:01:31.229> example<00:01:31.650> it

foot and a fraction as an example it

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.359 
foot and a fraction as an example it
could<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.130> 15<00:01:32.759> feet<00:01:33.150> 6<00:01:34.079> inches<00:01:34.259> or<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.920> could<00:01:35.130> be

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
could be 15 feet 6 inches or it could be

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.410 
could be 15 feet 6 inches or it could be
16<00:01:36.240> feet<00:01:36.509> 6<00:01:36.840> inches<00:01:37.400> all<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> replacement

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
16 feet 6 inches all of the replacement

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960 
16 feet 6 inches all of the replacement
cables<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.079> have<00:01:40.290> available<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.610> 1

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
cables that we have available are in 1

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.780 
cables that we have available are in 1
foot<00:01:42.240> increments<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.490> reason

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
foot increments so so that's the reason

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.670 
foot increments so so that's the reason
that<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.090> need<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> rounding<00:01:46.530> up

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that you need to to do the rounding up

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.160 
that you need to to do the rounding up
so<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.579> you've<00:01:47.700> got<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.970> 15<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.689> half<00:01:48.720> foot

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
so if you've got a 15 and a half foot

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.679 
so if you've got a 15 and a half foot
cable<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:49.680> 15<00:01:50.070> feet<00:01:50.100> 6<00:01:50.729> inches<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.450> need<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
cable or 15 feet 6 inches you need to

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.560 
cable or 15 feet 6 inches you need to
round<00:01:51.869> up<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> 16<00:01:52.590> feet<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.970> same<00:01:54.180> would<00:01:54.360> hold

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
round up to 16 feet the same would hold

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.160 
round up to 16 feet the same would hold
true<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.710> rack<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:55.890> pinion<00:01:56.399> cables<00:01:56.790> if

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
true on the rack and pinion cables if

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.990 
true on the rack and pinion cables if
you<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> replace<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> rack<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.670> pinion

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you have to replace the rack and pinion

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.440 
you have to replace the rack and pinion
cable<00:02:00.619> it's<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.860> same<00:02:02.130> type<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> measurements

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
cable it's the same type of measurements

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.389 
cable it's the same type of measurements
you<00:02:03.479> measure<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.990> plastic<00:02:04.469> jacket<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.100> to

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
you measure the plastic jacket and to

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.990 
you measure the plastic jacket and to
end<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.719> case<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.409> add<00:02:07.680> 30<00:02:08.550> inches

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
end but in this case you add 30 inches

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.390 
end but in this case you add 30 inches
and<00:02:09.239> then<00:02:09.929> round<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.890> nearest<00:02:11.099> foot

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and then round up to the nearest foot

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.330 
and then round up to the nearest foot
again

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
again
