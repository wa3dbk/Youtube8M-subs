00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:29.320
 Ninjago collection business which is 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:32.630
 elite 94 49 recommended from 8 years to 14 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.670
 which is the cultra assault vehicle 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:41.120
 sonic that includes 622 pieces and is a 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.250
 2 in 1 vehicle 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.040
 this is the part in front and let's see 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.370
 the back of the box that are us 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.250
 show some of the functions that 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.350
 has this set 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.400
 This is how we saw a little bit 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.610
 big so it includes two books like 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.890
 instructive and well let's see how it 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.890
 see the vehicle already armed 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.970
 ok then we can see the set here 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.070
 fully armed 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.500
 let's show you the cabins 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.540
 here in these cabins are sitting the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.880
 characters 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.880
 the second cabin can also be opened 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.120
 also these rockets that have the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.240
 back are completely 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.970
 We can move them from 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.210
 different ways like the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.790
 propellers and the sides we are also 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.130
 seeing that it comes with enough weapons to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.620
 the sides looks pretty awesome or 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.410
 aggressive I would not like to take the 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:51.670
 different and this is coming here to the 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:55.050
 canine sides we can rotate and throw 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 this is the back we're going to see her 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.570
 and the drop 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.560
 and we are seeing the vehicle by 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.229
 sides we are seeing the caterpillars the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.860
 razor mechanisms that I showed to your 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.860
 moment 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.750
 starting the cabins this piece of removes 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.170
 while also moving the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.600
 wings and the back tires that are 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.060
 quite large goes to a figure 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.270
 so they can more or less see the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.060
 size of the tires if it is enough 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.280
 big is like two and a half times more 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.270
 big than a normal figure 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.209
 the ego also the caterpillars here like 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.209
 can see they have a movement 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.209
 completely 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.050
 I wonder why a vehicle 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.090
 two in one let's see why here 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.870
 back this mechanism that I'm going to press 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.980
 open the wings as we are seeing is 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.650
 enough that is the insurance for 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.840
 detach the ship we are going to 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.740
 to see how she looked detached in the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.480
 ship and the terrain vehicle 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.440
 and that's how you both look 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.860
 vehicles detached this is the 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.190
 land vehicle and this is the other 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.140
 ship also in the ship we can see 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.800
 that here has one 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.980
 a small attachment that is like a 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.140
 to be able to appreciate the vipers here 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.370
 we can 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.379
 to put 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.629
 as we saw a little while ago the mechanism 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.200
 of the wings is activated by the part of 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.800
 back here 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.860
 and it's not just the mechanism of the cide uy 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.930
 that father but also that mechanism is 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:58.000
 as an insurance to allow assembly 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.300
 the ship in the vehicle and no longer 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.239
 undo with open wings is possible 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.030
 take out the ship but when we put the 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.340
 safe 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.380
 that the ship does not come out that's pretty 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.900
 cool I think it was a pretty idea 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.300
 creative me when I did this with the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.190
 wings I liked a lot but already after 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.549
 that made me sure better I thought 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.859
 something very very creative 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.859
 let's show you the mini figures 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.449
 now let's see the six figures that 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.000
 includes this c 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.230
 here we are seeing 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.610
 A) Yes 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.610
 let's educate him 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.840
 the mask of a day that we are 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:48.779
 seeing in report in the part for 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.779
 load to save the sabers 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.169
 and we are world someone 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:59.729
 no more to remove your hood 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:03.080
 the face and also his suit 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.080
 cows 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.420
 listen out 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.449
 has some small scars on the 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.830
 face 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.830
 now with 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:29.639
 Without hood 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.219
 and also includes 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.900
 two snakes here we are looking at the 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.900
 pita snake 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:43.830
 It is very similar or the same next 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:46.949
 in the spinners and this viper that is 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.990
 Pretty cool is very different from the 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:53.450
 others and bracista is called bugs 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.850
 we see that it is bigger by the tail than 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.360
 has the part of here behind the other 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:04.150
