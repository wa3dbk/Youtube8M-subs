00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
cleaner much safer any time in this

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.999 
cleaner much safer any time in this
industry<00:01:40.780> we<00:01:41.049> can<00:01:41.170> figure<00:01:41.380> out<00:01:41.500> a<00:01:41.619> better<00:01:41.860> way

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
industry we can figure out a better way

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.609 
industry we can figure out a better way
to<00:01:42.130> do<00:01:42.369> something<00:01:42.640> I'm<00:01:43.060> all<00:01:43.300> for<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.780> okay<00:01:44.590> I

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
to do something I'm all for it okay I

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.080 
to do something I'm all for it okay I
think<00:01:44.890> even<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.159> old-school<00:01:45.460> butchers<00:01:45.940> would

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
think even the old-school butchers would

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.460 
think even the old-school butchers would
agree<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:46.479> that's<00:01:46.569> a<00:01:46.720> much<00:01:46.929> easier<00:01:46.960> way<00:01:47.350> to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
agree that that's a much easier way to

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.160 
agree that that's a much easier way to
do<00:01:47.679> it<00:01:47.830> okay<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.420> only<00:01:49.479> thing<00:01:49.840> we<00:01:49.960> have<00:01:50.140> to

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
do it okay so the only thing we have to

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.480 
do it okay so the only thing we have to
clean<00:01:50.530> up<00:01:50.560> here<00:01:50.920> now<00:01:51.190> is<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:53.380> edge<00:01:53.740> which

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
clean up here now is this edge which

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.270 
clean up here now is this edge which
requires<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:54.970> little<00:01:55.149> bit<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.420> skill<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:57.159> we're

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
requires a little bit of skill so we're

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.440 
requires a little bit of skill so we're
going<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.429> do<00:01:57.550> is<00:01:57.670> going<00:01:57.789> to<00:01:57.880> run<00:01:58.060> our<00:01:58.210> knife

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
going to do is going to run our knife

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.350 
going to do is going to run our knife
down<00:01:59.259> all<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.069> way<00:02:00.190> till<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.550> hits<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:01.000> joint

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
down all the way till it hits that joint

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.359 
down all the way till it hits that joint
again<00:02:01.569> okay<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.289> hits<00:02:02.440> that<00:02:02.619> knuckle<00:02:02.950> we're

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
again okay it hits that knuckle we're

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.850 
again okay it hits that knuckle we're
going<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.549> move<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.789> over<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.860> heaviest

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
going to move it over to the heaviest

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.230 
going to move it over to the heaviest
side<00:02:06.069> of<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.250> knife<00:02:06.429> and<00:02:06.909> we're<00:02:07.030> just<00:02:07.090> going

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
side of the knife and we're just going

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.910 
side of the knife and we're just going
to<00:02:07.299> go<00:02:07.450> whack<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:09.600> okay<00:02:10.620> you've<00:02:11.620> got<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.830> be

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
to go whack it okay you've got to be

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.310 
to go whack it okay you've got to be
very<00:02:12.280> confident<00:02:12.850> with<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.209> with<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:13.900> slice

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
very confident with that with that slice

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.410 
very confident with that with that slice
through<00:02:14.650> otherwise<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.390> sacrifice<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
through otherwise you sacrifice the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.300 
through otherwise you sacrifice the
possibility<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.470> bone<00:02:17.709> splintering

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
possibility of the bone splintering

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.090 
possibility of the bone splintering
which<00:02:19.030> we<00:02:19.150> don't<00:02:19.299> want<00:02:19.540> okay<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:20.530> they<00:02:20.950> both

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
which we don't want okay so they both

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.190 
which we don't want okay so they both
look<00:02:21.340> nice<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:22.570> one's<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.900> little<00:02:23.019> bit

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
look nice this one's a little bit

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.630 
look nice this one's a little bit
cleaner<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.799> edge<00:02:23.920> actually<00:02:24.250> it's<00:02:24.579> a

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
cleaner on the edge actually it's a

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.240 
cleaner on the edge actually it's a
little<00:02:24.730> bit<00:02:24.880> fancier<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:26.260> one<00:02:26.530> we<00:02:27.130> could

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
little bit fancier and this one we could

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.130 
little bit fancier and this one we could
also<00:02:27.430> take<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:27.910> little<00:02:28.239> edge<00:02:28.420> off<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:28.959> you

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
also take that little edge off but you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.110 
also take that little edge off but you
really<00:02:29.350> don't<00:02:29.440> need<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.850> okay<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:30.910> really

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
until we get down to the wishbone which

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.410 
until we get down to the wishbone which
is<00:03:15.680> right<00:03:15.860> there<00:03:16.100> okay<00:03:16.940> that's<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.239> wishbone

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
is right there okay that's the wishbone

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.259 
is right there okay that's the wishbone
won't<00:03:17.840> go<00:03:17.930> any<00:03:18.080> further<00:03:18.880> all<00:03:19.880> right<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.180> you

won't go any further all right so you
can<00:03:20.390> see<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:21.410> we're<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.830> one<00:03:22.489> side<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.239> of

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
can see that we're on one side of the of

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.140 
can see that we're on one side of the of
the<00:03:24.410> sternum<00:03:24.769> right<00:03:24.920> here<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.310> then<00:03:26.030> we

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
the sternum right here and then we

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.789 
the sternum right here and then we
actually<00:03:26.299> need<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.690> open<00:03:26.959> up<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.200> second<00:03:27.620> side

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
actually need to open up the second side

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.270 
actually need to open up the second side
on<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.310> other<00:03:28.489> on<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:28.970> opposite<00:03:29.330> side<00:03:29.569> so<00:03:30.280> we

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
on the other on the opposite side so we

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.890 
on the other on the opposite side so we
have<00:03:31.430> access<00:03:31.760> now<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.000> both<00:03:32.299> sides<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.840> the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
have access now to both sides of the

knife<00:05:20.730> and<00:05:20.940> just<00:05:21.120> trim<00:05:21.330> it<00:05:21.540> up<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.750> little<00:05:21.930> bit

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.220 

trim<00:05:25.830> it<00:05:25.950> up<00:05:26.040> on<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.250> front<00:05:26.520> end

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.130 

fancy<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.820> on<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.120> back<00:05:33.300> here<00:05:33.660> you<00:05:33.900> can<00:05:33.930> see

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
fancy and on the back here you can see

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.360 
fancy and on the back here you can see
there's<00:05:34.320> a<00:05:34.350> little<00:05:34.500> extra<00:05:34.830> piece<00:05:34.980> of<00:05:35.040> skin

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
there's a little extra piece of skin

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.490 
there's a little extra piece of skin
hanging<00:05:35.580> off<00:05:35.820> here<00:05:36.120> as<00:05:36.240> well<00:05:36.420> in<00:05:36.570> fact<00:05:36.840> we're

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
hanging off here as well in fact we're

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.130 
hanging off here as well in fact we're
going<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.680> take<00:05:37.860> that<00:05:38.010> piece<00:05:38.220> off<00:05:38.400> as<00:05:38.580> well

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
going to take that piece off as well

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.270 
going to take that piece off as well
it's<00:05:40.140> now<00:05:40.410> it<00:05:40.560> looks<00:05:40.710> like<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:41.010> classic

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
it's now it looks like that classic

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.720 
it's now it looks like that classic
chicken<00:05:42.030> breast<00:05:42.270> French<00:05:43.110> bone<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:43.710> one<00:05:44.520> last

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
chicken breast French bone and one last

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.030 
chicken breast French bone and one last
thing<00:05:44.910> we<00:05:45.120> have<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:45.390> do<00:05:45.510> okay

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
thing we have to do okay

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.690 
thing we have to do okay
this<00:05:47.400> bone<00:05:48.210> tends<00:05:48.630> to<00:05:48.780> want<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:48.990> flop<00:05:49.290> down<00:05:49.700> so

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
this bone tends to want to flop down so

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.830 
this bone tends to want to flop down so
in<00:05:50.790> order<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.090> prevent<00:05:51.390> that<00:05:51.600> from<00:05:51.660> happening

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
in order to prevent that from happening

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.700 
in order to prevent that from happening
we<00:05:52.350> need<00:05:52.470> to<00:05:52.590> create<00:05:52.860> a<00:05:52.890> flat<00:05:53.190> surface<00:05:53.520> so

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
we need to create a flat surface so

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.810 
we need to create a flat surface so
here's<00:05:55.710> how<00:05:55.800> we're<00:05:55.890> going<00:05:55.980> to<00:05:56.040> do<00:05:56.160> that<00:05:56.340> we're

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
here's how we're going to do that we're

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.060 
here's how we're going to do that we're
going<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.000> turn<00:05:57.240> this<00:05:57.740> and<00:05:58.740> we're<00:05:58.890> just<00:05:58.920> going

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
going to turn this and we're just going

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.980 
going to turn this and we're just going
to<00:05:59.190> take<00:05:59.370> a<00:05:59.400> small<00:05:59.820> slice<00:06:00.720> that<00:06:00.990> off<00:06:02.720> the<00:06:03.720> bone

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
to take a small slice that off the bone

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.500 
to take a small slice that off the bone
okay<00:06:04.830> so<00:06:05.010> now<00:06:05.220> it<00:06:05.340> has<00:06:05.460> a<00:06:05.490> flat<00:06:05.880> now<00:06:06.270> it<00:06:06.390> has<00:06:06.480> a

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
okay so now it has a flat now it has a

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.780 
okay so now it has a flat now it has a
flat<00:06:06.840> edge<00:06:07.020> to<00:06:07.230> rest<00:06:07.440> on<00:06:07.680> so<00:06:08.250> when<00:06:08.400> it<00:06:08.490> cooks

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
flat edge to rest on so when it cooks

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.280 
flat edge to rest on so when it cooks
it's<00:06:09.600> going<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:09.870> sit<00:06:10.080> up<00:06:10.200> like<00:06:10.380> this<00:06:10.590> okay

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
it's going to sit up like this okay

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.170 
it's going to sit up like this okay
pretty<00:06:13.290> cool<00:06:13.440> huh<00:06:13.620> yeah<00:06:13.920> pretty<00:06:14.730> cool

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180

way cool okay

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.219 
way cool okay
that's<00:06:18.680> it<00:06:19.069> so<00:06:19.310> we'll<00:06:19.460> pan<00:06:19.699> sear<00:06:19.999> these<00:06:20.229> skin

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
that's it so we'll pan sear these skin

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:23.830 
that's it so we'll pan sear these skin
side<00:06:21.469> down<00:06:21.499> first<00:06:22.009> or<00:06:22.370> saute<00:06:22.819> finish<00:06:23.659> it<00:06:23.749> on

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
side down first or saute finish it on

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.149 
side down first or saute finish it on
the<00:06:23.960> other<00:06:24.050> side<00:06:24.139> or<00:06:24.530> we<00:06:24.590> can<00:06:24.710> poach<00:06:24.919> them

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
the other side or we can poach them

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:26.950 
the other side or we can poach them
whatever<00:06:25.520> it<00:06:25.639> is<00:06:25.729> we<00:06:25.849> want<00:06:26.030> to<00:06:26.060> do<00:06:26.180> we<00:06:26.689> don't<00:06:26.810> do

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
whatever it is we want to do we don't do

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.769 
whatever it is we want to do we don't do
it<00:06:27.080> to<00:06:27.169> any<00:06:27.289> other<00:06:27.379> part<00:06:27.740> of<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:28.449> chicken<00:06:29.449> as

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779 
it to any other part of the chicken as

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.689 
it to any other part of the chicken as
far<00:06:30.080> as<00:06:30.169> frenching<00:06:30.529> the<00:06:30.620> bone<00:06:30.770> you<00:06:31.310> can<00:06:31.340> French

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699 
far as frenching the bone you can French

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.420 
far as frenching the bone you can French
the<00:06:31.849> legs<00:06:32.029> also<00:06:32.499> but<00:06:33.499> that's<00:06:33.740> not<00:06:33.919> done<00:06:34.219> that

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
the legs also but that's not done that

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.969 
the legs also but that's not done that
often<00:06:34.849> because<00:06:35.240> typically<00:06:35.599> the<00:06:36.529> legs<00:06:36.740> will

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
often because typically the legs will

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.890 
often because typically the legs will
recede<00:06:37.400> on<00:06:37.550> their<00:06:37.729> own<00:06:37.879> when<00:06:38.599> during<00:06:38.810> the

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
recede on their own when during the

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.189 
recede on their own when during the
cooking<00:06:39.110> process<00:06:40.180> so<00:06:41.180> that'll<00:06:41.870> add<00:06:41.960> more

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
cooking process so that'll add more

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:43.689 
cooking process so that'll add more
flavor<00:06:42.469> to<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:42.830> chicken<00:06:42.860> it'll<00:06:43.460> have<00:06:43.580> more

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699 
flavor to the chicken it'll have more

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:44.980 
flavor to the chicken it'll have more
flavor<00:06:43.939> that's<00:06:44.360> exactly<00:06:44.749> right

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
flavor that's exactly right

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.140 
flavor that's exactly right
really<00:06:45.650> that<00:06:46.129> one<00:06:46.370> little<00:06:46.580> piece<00:06:46.669> of<00:06:46.909> one

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
really that one little piece of one

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:55.480 
really that one little piece of one
little<00:06:47.419> bone<00:06:47.569> more<00:06:48.289> flavor<00:06:48.620> more<00:06:48.919> juiciness

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.810 

it's<00:06:55.700> the<00:06:55.820> whole<00:06:56.000> thing

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.640 

so<00:07:00.090> the<00:07:00.180> tender<00:07:00.510> part<00:07:00.660> is<00:07:00.810> attached<00:07:01.080> right<00:07:01.410> now

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
so the tender part is attached right now

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.740 
so the tender part is attached right now
tender<00:07:02.340> part<00:07:02.550> is<00:07:02.610> attached

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.089 

and<00:07:06.750> we<00:07:06.870> could<00:07:06.990> take<00:07:07.110> the<00:07:07.229> tenors<00:07:07.530> off<00:07:07.740> if<00:07:07.949> it's

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099 
and we could take the tenors off if it's

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:09.950 
and we could take the tenors off if it's
too<00:07:08.250> just<00:07:08.490> too<00:07:08.580> much<00:07:08.729> meat<00:07:09.000> that's<00:07:09.449> pretty<00:07:09.840> big

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960

portion okay so you can always take the

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.339 
portion okay so you can always take the
tender<00:07:12.270> off<00:07:12.389> and<00:07:12.599> use<00:07:12.690> it<00:07:12.720> for<00:07:12.840> a<00:07:12.990> different
