00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.030
 millimeters in size she bounces 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.800
 taller than any dog ​​therefore 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.399

 percent temperature average 35 25-30 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.550
 degrees accordingly 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.330

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.450
 Bay today, the egg fell in 30 days 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.310

 streets she brings a new window block not 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.790
 goes out so it's closed 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.420
 ecosystem 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.030
 and fighting this parasite she is a little 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.370
 Different in what in a closed system 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.870
 we can use processing 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.420
 the territories on which the animal is located 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.990
 with an open ecosystem ie dogs 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.080
 this 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.600
