00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.990 

I<00:00:04.730> think<00:00:05.730> that<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.630> Lakers<00:00:06.840> were<00:00:07.140> resilient<00:00:07.590> I

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.000 
I think that the Lakers were resilient I

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.850 
I think that the Lakers were resilient I
think<00:00:09.000> they<00:00:09.660> came<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.050> with<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.320> size<00:00:10.559> the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
think they came in with the size the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
think they came in with the size the
length<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.930> really<00:00:13.040> the<00:00:14.040> sun's<00:00:14.340> chopped<00:00:14.730> him

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
length and really the sun's chopped him

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.650 
length and really the sun's chopped him
down<00:00:15.090> a<00:00:15.389> little<00:00:15.870> bit<00:00:16.430> but<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.699> think<00:00:18.210> Kobe

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
down a little bit but I think Kobe

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.880 
down a little bit but I think Kobe
Bryant<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.470> any<00:00:20.310> show<00:00:20.520> tonight<00:00:21.470> truly<00:00:22.470> the
