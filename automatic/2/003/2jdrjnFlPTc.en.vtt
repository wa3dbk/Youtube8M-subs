00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.390
 in the early 90's with the arrival 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.390
 of the cd-rom all kinds began to be created 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.339
 of interactive adventure video games 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.440
 you know the dragos style videogames 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.120
 read 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.190
 and this caused the disinterest of the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.010
 players first of all for the little action 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.010
 I had but this video game got 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.559
 perfect it and not only that too 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.260
 combined hand drawing and test to light 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.150
 hoisted creating a masterpiece of the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.300
 full monty or less 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.720
 it's called the sintes time was released 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.930
 for computers in 1993 created by 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.600
 cocktail vision the creators of adi and the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.370
 goblins and from the latter came the engine 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.260
 graphic 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.610
 the in the time is a videogame of 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.100
 graphic adventure that is managed 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.020
 only the mouse the view is of 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.360
 first person that we will get 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.049
 in the body of a girl called 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.920
 doralis 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:39.140
 everything starts in 1992 or 20 years ago 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.750
 the girl is exploring a boat 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.450
 shipwrecked near his house when 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.310
 soon it is transported until the year 1840 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.940
 at that time the ship was still 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.940
 intact 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.189
 The funny thing about this video game is that 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.859
 we will have to play a flashback and to 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.560
 that if we already know what is going to happen or 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:12.209
 it will be to know the good cause also 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.209
 the prequels are flash backs 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.250
 i 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.030
 during the video game we will have to 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.730
 combine all kinds of objects through 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.329
 of improvisation that is to say the style 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.329
 of macgyver 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.840
 ah 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.660
 Y 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.450
 the version of dis that I was divided 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:11.079
 in two parts while the version of 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:15.000
 cd-rom was completely complete and 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.000
 also had voices 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.350
 the M 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.860
 good only 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.860
 the 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.220
 and the 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:16.040
 the son of 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.040
 there is no limit 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.370
 let them pass 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.040
 Finally, it should be noted that 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.479
 with a limited number of wildcards the 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.830
 jokers are some clues that you 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.370
 will help to solve the 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.370
 videogame 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.720
 relying on the limitations of the era 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.880
 certainly have managed to make a game 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.540
 quite easy and at the same time quite 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.540
 interesting 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.520
 and 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.130
 when you buy a video game through 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.510
 download on the ipod or any 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.940
 another electronic device like 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.280
 consoles it is recommended that you have 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.420
 hands a backup since 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.270
 some devices when you have to 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.370
 update them this are formatted and if the 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.380
 video game ends discontinued no longer what 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.750
 you can put back and this is a 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.270
 loss of money and care with those 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.440
 items in which they include objects that 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.320
 you bought for the game through 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.750
 of the internet because if you lose them there is no 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.510
 spare parts so it would be more money 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.760
 lost by a tube and companies like 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.720
 Apple and Nintendo are already responsible 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.720
 of no loss
