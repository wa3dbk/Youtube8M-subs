00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.880
 the very meaning of the characters is a commemorative coin 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.070
 steve jobs here tells why 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.399

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.399
 typography well done here sticking in as 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.070

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.899
 of all here are coins like mine 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.469
 released two and a half thousand from me 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.019
 42 hunger 'frame 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.090
 because there is no genuine but really 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.220
 In fact, this coin has no 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.100
 I have a nominal value 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.570
 thousand dollars that's real in the store you 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.240
 buy something unlikely 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.350
 apple fans some ipod shuffle 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.330

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.060
 I do not remember nickel coin 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.710
 said no it's the easiest worth 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.570
 such an order quite well done 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.640
 worth such a coin 50 dollars there 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.870
 options more expensive silver 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.780
 gilded 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.830
 there is gold but there are societies of the order of three 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.570
 thousand dollars worth silver 200 s 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.510
 penny 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.250
 expensive expensive in fact and so in 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.380
 I didnâ€™t like this coin 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.110
 business here in all collectible coins 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.600
 yourself a collectible coin fits 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.230
 such plastic cases for what so 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.880
 she is 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.920
 material let's say its external 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.150
 kind of not scratched because here to me 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.500
 already a little dirty out of the box in 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.660
 the rest is very 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.760
 cool memorable souvenir especially 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.050
 if you are a fan or someone 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.010
 is an expert want to donate 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:23.730
 something like this is joyful 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.380
 news is my business such boxes 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.120
 not one but two but surely 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.850
 formulated now we raffle off 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.220
 but no matter why not because 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.280
 Now subscribers on the channel total 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.950

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.890
 when here are followers through five hundred 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.840
 maybe 1000 and surely somebody 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.320
 will be the happy owner of this 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.290
 a coin 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.720
