00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.110
 Corrective maintenance 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.150
 it's called corrective maintenance 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.040
 he who corrects the defects 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.770
 observed in the equipment or 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.480
 facilities is the most basic way of 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.970
 maintenance and it's about locating 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.270
 faults or defects and correct them or 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.460
 repair them historically is the first 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.080
 maintenance concept that arose 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.450
 and the only one until the first war 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.640
 worldwide given the simplicity of 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.399
 machinery equipment and installations 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.539
 of the time maintenance was synonymous 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.470
 to repair what was damaged 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.570
 later it was suggested that the 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.760
 maintenance not only had to correct 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.770
 the breakdowns but he had to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.989
 get ahead of them by guaranteeing 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.390
 correct operation of the machines 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.670
 avoiding the delay caused by the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.070
 faults and their consequences giving rise 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.050
 what was called maintenance 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.550
 preventive that is what is done 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.350
 preventively as a team in 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.750
 operation in election of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.840
 subsequent breakdowns guaranteeing a 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.060
 period of reliable use the process of 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.340
 corrective maintenance starts with 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.689
 the failure and a diagnosis of the lack 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.370
 to determine why the failure 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.500
 showed up 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.930
 The diagnostic process can include 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.910
 the physical inspection of a system the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.280
 use of a diagnostic equipment to 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.680
 evaluate the system the interviews with 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.350
 system users and a series of 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.110
 other measures it is important to determine 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.750
 what caused the problem in order to take the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.000
 appropriate measures and be aware of 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.070
 that multiple failures of components or of 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.160
 software may have occurred in a 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.350
 simultaneous the next step is the 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.650
 replacement of damaged components or 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.050
 software in some cases the damage can 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.550
 be irreparable either by bringing up the subject 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.730
 in question and do the repairs 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.800
 off-site in other cases the 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.230
 full replacement with a new point 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.410
 it may be necessary to restore the 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.630
 system functionality for example if 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.210
 an optical drive in a computer fails 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.399
 a technician can determine what part of 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.740
 the replacement or repair unit 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.020
 part of it may be enough or 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.060
 you may find that the whole unit should 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.050
 be discarded so that a new one 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.760
 can be inserted 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.070
 after the 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.140
 corrective maintenance a technician 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.080
 verify that the arrangement has worked for 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.420
 test the system this can be done in 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.490
 several stages to confirm that the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.280
 system is working slowly 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.170
 before the task overload the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.360
 verification is especially important 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.580
 in the systems sent to a 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.620
 installation for repair the 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.930
 technicians want to be sure that 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.150
 when users are sent back 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.150
 will be satisfied with the level of 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.430
 work done for some 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.380
 old systems may have more 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.630
 It makes sense to resort to operations of 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.490
 CORRECTIVE MAINTENANCE 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.400
 preventive maintenance can be 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.470
 expensive and with these systems can not 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.490
 make sense since it can be more 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.410
 profitable 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.710
 simply repair components of 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.590
 system since they go wrong on the contrary 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.000
 with a new maintenance system 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.860
 preventive can save money long 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.020
 term and extend the useful life of 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.670
 system by preventing failures 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.320
 in the system as much as possible 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.320
 before they happen
