00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.229 
went okay lot of people ask me about
these<00:00:38.760> portals<00:00:39.149> what's<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.170> meaning<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.620> it

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
these portals what's the meaning of it

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.680 
these portals what's the meaning of it
so<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:43.050> illustration<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.579> supposed<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.510> go

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so this illustration is supposed to go

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.310 
so this illustration is supposed to go
to<00:00:45.920> minecraft<00:00:46.920> server<00:00:47.160> list<00:00:47.520> dot<00:00:48.000> net<00:00:48.360> where

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
to minecraft server list dot net where

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.600 
to minecraft server list dot net where
it's<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:51.390> ranking<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
it's you know I like like ranking of

it's you know I like like ranking of
servers<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.960> Minecraft<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.960> imagine<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
servers of Minecraft so I imagine the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.060 
servers of Minecraft so I imagine the
wall<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> different<00:01:01.440> servers<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:02.010> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
wall the different servers as a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.119 
wall the different servers as a
different<00:01:02.699> world<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.690> different<00:01:04.409> portals<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
different world so different portals to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.500 
different world so different portals to
