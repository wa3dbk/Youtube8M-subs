00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.030
 sura 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.330
 not only makes very expensive 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.730
 machines but always very beautiful and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.310
 very nicely finished products 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.480
 the impressa c50 is an example of this 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.660
 sura 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.460
 what simple but factual often says 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 same parts in all machines 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.699
 processed in any case is this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.529
 very easy to use 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.649
 black 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.739
 has a water bowl that is above 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.379
 of no less than 1.9 liters which is also 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.809
 very easy to lift out 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.930
 he's wearing a bean container 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.969
 this side is then 200 grams 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.100
 You can find the adjustment of the grinding here 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.390
 we always like to set that to three-quarters 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.980
 nice 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.770
 that actually has to be when it is running 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.899
 but careful you are here now in the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.399
 correct position 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.520
 then you can also come with one 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.320
 ground spoon 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.659
 Administer two portions with which you 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.119
 2 cups at a time could also come 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.970
 give a portion then he switches 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.380
 automatically to one cup at a time 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.380
 spoon for this is included 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.110
 then we take a look at the operation 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.950
 this p which you press briefly and then stands 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.960
 in the menu 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.280
 You see there is a maintenance menu well then 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.030
 you know what we are talking about in may 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.920
 choose and set up the product 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.790
 you can place a filter or the filter 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.680
 do not post that you must state the 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.479
 hardness of the water which is also demand from 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.590
 the water company and you set that 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.759
 than in 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.030
 depending on where you are 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.030
 staying 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.409
 saving energy can set you up 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.880
 means the sleep mode goes after the 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.190
 time that you wish 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.810
 display and the language setting that sets it 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.220
 u undoubtedly in dutch and 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.539
 then we go out now 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.880
 the state he is currently on ground 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.670
 coffee we are not so crazy about that 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.080
 today, because we are heading more 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.580
 the espresso 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.580
 then we go for that espresso 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.430
 we make it for you 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 for you at 45 milliliters 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.820
 that's kind of my hobby 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.090
 the Italians and 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.700
 with an espresso lungo actually one 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.910
 espresso lungo from 50 milliliters 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.530
 and the regular espresso from 25 well we 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.840
 cheese heads find that a bit too tight 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.880
 I hear too 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.100
 and then we go to a 45ml must 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:43.170
 look like we always adjust them 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.650
 we do the same with all machines 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.650
 this jura 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.840
 walk up and we'll watch it 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.310
 the color is neat we see some flames 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.340
 which is good 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.660
 the extraction is therefore quite beautiful and the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.970
 cream layer 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.520
 well here soon is a millimeter 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.140
 or 8 may also not complain about seeing 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.590
 look very good 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.590
 then the taste 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.740
 fine with your spicy 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.489
 actually quite hot why do I say that 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.250
 what sura municipality has the machines on 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.810
 81 degrees on average 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.610
 they will be quite right about that 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.129
 some coffee should not be too hot of course 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.140
 then he also soured quickly during 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.099
 the operation 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.099
 he is nice he looks good 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:48.959
 Well, let's just show you how 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.579
 we have this espresso set look 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.079
 let's go on that p 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.079
 print german program that you understand 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:02.540
 product espresso with volume printing 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.200
 45 minutes we had set then kun 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.269
 you change 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.159
 look you see there we get change 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.730
 well that is handy but later and drifted 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.629
 stand him 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.629
 give that as ok 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:20.220
 and therefore it is actually done more 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.259
 can you increase the mortality 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.340
 so the intensity of the taste 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.190
 fine tune 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.570
 well then you press on this and then you say 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.990
 additional 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.990
 or mail 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.340
 Or normally well let us want knowledge 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.220
 because I just didn't do that 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.510
 ok mild then we go to the next 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.390
 point 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.700
 temperatures look well and that was high 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.200
 that's why you can look so hot 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.560
 we continue in the menu and the app is included 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.990
 the 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.870
 we just passed you by minute 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.220
 kind of personalized this kia to me 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:04.020
 adjusted but you do of course 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:07.290
 for yourself then you don't go on 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.720
 steam sign at that time 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.460
 says that steam heats up 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.720
 then you look here and if he does 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.680
 is hot 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.750
 turn the button or 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.200
 hot water but you do steam so it runs 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:26.280
 you check the button to the steam side now 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.100
 You will see that the light indicates that it is 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.290
 heating element is hot and then turns 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.979
 you turn the button to steam and then he gives 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.260
 that too and keep it on this button then you can 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:40.500
 you do not stand it now or steam 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.479
 refuel hot water for a cup of tea 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.750
 well you see a valve here well that 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.760
 true that you may like and can now 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.180
 a milk can as an accessory 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.120
 and purchase a tube and that whole 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.770
 business makes very beautiful in one go 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.780
 cappuccino milk foam 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.160
 now you are used to us that we are now the 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.680
 to show the brew group and remove it 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.840
 and tell you to clean it 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.460
 no cira a different opinion about that and 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.440
 of course they do that well 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.370
 They have a surfing system that you agree 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.740
 per year 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.540
 let me say a square 4000 heads and 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.160
 He counts that himself and then gives 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.930
 he also a warning 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.030
 the machine then goes to an acid 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.020
 radial, and that does for you 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.720
 service ticket 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.930
 that really extends the life of 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.930
 the machine 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.649
 very important is the maintenance of your 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.749
 coffee machine 

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:35.789
 in addition to rinsing the brewing group 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:38.009
 you must descale 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:40.469
 assume six or six times a year 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:44.699
 so very important every two months 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:46.289
 is that you also descale it 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.209
 the machine also several times a year 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:53.639
 needs cleaning 

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:56.369
 that is now happening with their pill and this pill 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.439
 depending on the machine is also 

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:59.969
 often added to the water or in one 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:02.159
 separate box 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:03.839
 Of course this descaling set is for 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:05.930
 a whole year of care with us 

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:05.930
 to gain 

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:13.199
 so then have an espresso latte 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:14.569
 macchiato cappuccino or a regular cup 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.569
 coffee from 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:17.569
