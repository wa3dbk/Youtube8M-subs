 [Music] 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.709
 hello to all today I reveal you 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.620
 the favorite recipe for muffins 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.099
 gluten-free chocolate so easy to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.139
 digest 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.189
 it's a perfect alternative to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.529
 industrial cakes 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.899
 perfect for 4 hours or breakfast 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.720
 frankly do not have a priori on the 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:30.110
 meaning brussels and felipe queeric does 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:33.090
 will not be disappointed so we need 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.910
 a soy yogurt that you can 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.700
 find in an organic store then 50 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.390
 grams of olive oil 160 g flour 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.450
 of rice 20 g of chestnut flour or 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.030
 find in an organic shop 80 g of 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.489
 brown sugar that you can replace with 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.060
 unrefined sugar that you can 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.440
 also find in the soul an organic store 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.630
 [Music] 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.630
 2nd of gluten-free baking powder 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.410
 70 g of dark chocolate so for the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.550
 favorite dark chocolate from real chocolate to 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.850
 70% minimum of cocoa avoid 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.580
 tablets from nestle or ya marked 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.950
 pastry chocolate it seems to me that he 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.360
 only 50% cocoa 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.280
 so here is the real favorite chocolate and 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.560
 molds to capture 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.560
 [Music] 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.979
 preheat the oven to 110 degrees so 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.030
 for my part it will be about 110 degrees 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.030
 it does not matter 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.030
 we start with yoghurt or soy 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.740
 that we will then mix with 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.330
 olive oil 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.920
 [Music] 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.190
 we mix well hole no 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.460
 vigorously to form a paste 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.070
 homogeneous 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:09.940
 then we add sugar like 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.940
 the dough is homogeneous 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.400
 then the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 you 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.640
 servitude the weaknesses hours 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.959
 I mix the two marines plus the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.959
 baking powder in the same flight 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.230
 here and and I add little by little to 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.670
 the dough 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.350
 after it's like you want you 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.770
 can master all of a sudden normally 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:52.229
 it must not form lumps 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.229
 [Music] 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.319
 once the dough is homogeneous 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.060
 that you mix well there you 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.250
 can incorporate the chips from 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.159
 dark chocolate that you can do you 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.680
 even you with a knife 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.599
 so be careful not to cut yourself 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.230
 fingers 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:15.620
 I have a knife that is not very 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.329
 sharpened so it does not cut easily 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.380
 and that's why I allow myself 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:28.300
 to take it this way 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:30.000
 [Music] 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.860

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.900
 OK and 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.430

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.810
 two each time like that when you 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.659
 put the dough in the mold the dough does not 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.989
 will not spread out as the 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:55.189
 video I realized that 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.560

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.469

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.359
 superimposed mussels that makes it the 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.730
