00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
wonderful look because again we're

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.950 
wonderful look because again we're
staying<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.940> same<00:02:30.120> color<00:02:30.390> palette<00:02:30.660> I

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
staying with the same color palette I

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.750 
staying with the same color palette I
added<00:02:31.410> these<00:02:31.500> beautiful<00:02:32.010> red<00:02:32.220> pumps<00:02:32.610> with

added these beautiful red pumps with
silver<00:02:33.150> heels<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.230> creates<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.710> nice

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
silver heels but it creates a nice

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.400 
silver heels but it creates a nice

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
to three colors this look incorporates

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.980 
to three colors this look incorporates
even<00:02:40.260> more<00:02:40.530> complex<00:02:41.160> print<00:02:41.640> layering<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.540> chose

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
even more complex print layering I chose

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.980 
even more complex print layering I chose
an<00:02:43.110> elaborately<00:02:43.770> geometric<00:02:44.520> printed<00:02:45.000> top<00:02:45.390> for

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
an elaborately geometric printed top for

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.140 
an elaborately geometric printed top for
this<00:02:46.110> look<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.980> paired<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.490> over<00:02:47.880> some

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
this look and I paired it over some

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.880 
this look and I paired it over some
shorts<00:02:48.630> now<00:02:48.900> because<00:02:49.140> there's<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.470> much<00:02:49.590> print

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
shorts now because there's so much print

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.560 
shorts now because there's so much print
going<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.760> were<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.090> pants<00:02:51.420> it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
going on if you were to have pants it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.150 
going on if you were to have pants it
would<00:02:51.690> probably<00:02:51.900> overwhelm<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.770> look<00:02:52.950> that's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
would probably overwhelm the look that's

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.920 
would probably overwhelm the look that's
why<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.340> went<00:02:53.550> for<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.790> high-waisted<00:02:54.360> short<00:02:54.720> I

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
why I went for the high-waisted short I

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.140 
why I went for the high-waisted short I
grounded<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> look<00:02:55.800> with<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> nice<00:02:56.310> solid<00:02:56.850> red

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
grounded the look with a nice solid red

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.220 
grounded the look with a nice solid red
bootie<00:02:57.570> because<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.840> don't<00:02:57.960> want<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.140> have

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
bootie because you don't want to have

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.470 
bootie because you don't want to have
too<00:02:58.470> much<00:02:58.620> pattern<00:02:58.950> going<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.640> here<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
too much pattern going on here it is

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.690 
too much pattern going on here it is
tucked<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.990> this<00:03:01.290> look<00:03:01.620> works<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.430> well

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
tucked in this look works so well

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.220 
tucked in this look works so well
because<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.240> pattern<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> shorts

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
because the pattern in the shorts

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.170 
because the pattern in the shorts
actually<00:03:04.650> mimics<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> geometric<00:03:05.700> pattern<00:03:06.060> at

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
actually mimics the geometric pattern at

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.610 
actually mimics the geometric pattern at
the<00:03:06.270> top<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.960> tank<00:03:07.400> that's<00:03:08.400> not<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.510> bad

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
the top of the tank that's not so bad

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.910 
the top of the tank that's not so bad

want to keep your layering pretty
minimal<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.330> this<00:03:24.510> case<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.050> just<00:03:25.350> opted<00:03:25.739> for

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
minimal so in this case I just opted for

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.490 
minimal so in this case I just opted for
a<00:03:25.980> simple<00:03:26.610> pop<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:27.060> color<00:03:27.330> in<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.780> bright<00:03:28.170> pink

skinny belt the skinny belt breaks up
the<00:03:31.020> pattern<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.560> gives<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.890> eye<00:03:31.920> something

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
the pattern and gives the eye something

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.060 
the pattern and gives the eye something
to<00:03:32.790> focus<00:03:33.360> on<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.260> granted<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.770> look<00:03:34.950> with

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
to focus on and I granted the look with

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.530 
to focus on and I granted the look with
a<00:03:35.100> solid<00:03:35.550> black<00:03:35.730> heel<00:03:35.970> again<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.300> don't<00:03:36.420> want

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
a solid black heel again you don't want

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.060 
a solid black heel again you don't want
to<00:03:36.690> have<00:03:36.810> too<00:03:37.050> much<00:03:37.200> pattern<00:03:37.500> going<00:03:37.830> on<00:03:37.950> in

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
to have too much pattern going on in

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.130 
to have too much pattern going on in
your<00:03:38.190> feet<00:03:38.400> for<00:03:38.610> something<00:03:38.910> like<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.270> now

a<00:05:10.590> very<00:05:11.100> dramatic<00:05:11.460> pattern<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.390> way<00:05:12.480> these

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
a very dramatic pattern the way these

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.660 
a very dramatic pattern the way these

case<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:17.040> chose<00:05:17.310> a<00:05:17.550> pattern<00:05:18.120> top<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.540> has<00:05:18.660> very

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
case I chose a pattern top that has very

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.409 
case I chose a pattern top that has very
tiny<00:05:19.500> concentric<00:05:20.340> pattern<00:05:20.520> so<00:05:20.850> it<00:05:20.940> feels<00:05:21.180> more

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
tiny concentric pattern so it feels more

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.480 
tiny concentric pattern so it feels more
like<00:05:21.480> a<00:05:21.810> total<00:05:22.200> solid<00:05:22.830> piece<00:05:23.070> versus<00:05:23.460> a

like a total solid piece versus a

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.670 
like a total solid piece versus a
pattern<00:05:23.940> piece<00:05:24.150> it<00:05:24.660> maintains<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.200> beige<00:05:25.470> in

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
pattern piece it maintains the beige in
