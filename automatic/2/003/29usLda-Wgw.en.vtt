00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.240 
what's interesting about that kind of
conversation<00:01:27.940> is<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:29.110> what<00:01:29.860> we're<00:01:30.040> seeing

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
conversation is that what we're seeing

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.310 
conversation is that what we're seeing
now<00:01:30.460> is<00:01:30.820> that<00:01:31.060> there<00:01:31.360> are<00:01:31.540> ways<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.840> publish

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
now is that there are ways to publish

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.520 
now is that there are ways to publish
much<00:01:32.740> faster<00:01:33.399> than<00:01:33.969> there<00:01:34.299> used<00:01:34.329> to<00:01:34.689> be<00:01:34.780> so

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
much faster than there used to be so

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.740 
much faster than there used to be so
there<00:01:35.770> could<00:01:36.009> be<00:01:36.040> something<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.850> writing<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.719> a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
there could be something to writing to a

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.560 
there could be something to writing to a
trend<00:01:38.170> I<00:01:38.500> would<00:01:39.009> say<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:39.670> something<00:01:40.270> perhaps

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
trend I would say that something perhaps

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.990 
trend I would say that something perhaps

teens<00:03:18.680> are<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.280> using<00:03:19.850> video<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.840> photos<00:03:21.560> to

teens are you using video and photos to

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.660 
teens are you using video and photos to
communicate<00:03:23.120> rather<00:03:23.780> than<00:03:24.170> texting<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.070> what

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
communicate rather than texting and what

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.390 
communicate rather than texting and what
teens<00:03:25.970> have<00:03:26.209> said<00:03:26.480> about<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.530> simpler

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
teens have said about this is it simpler

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.720 
teens have said about this is it simpler
and<00:03:29.050> they<00:03:30.050> love<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.500> power<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.310> picture

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
and they love the power of the picture

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.960 
and they love the power of the picture
so<00:03:32.450> that's<00:03:33.019> interesting<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.890> me<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:34.370> that's

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
so that's interesting to me that that's

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.540 
so that's interesting to me that that's
how<00:03:35.180> teens<00:03:35.570> are<00:03:35.959> thinking<00:03:36.320> about

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
how teens are thinking about

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.880 
how teens are thinking about
communicating<00:03:37.550> so<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:38.630> would<00:03:39.380> think<00:03:39.560> there's<00:03:39.830> a

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
communicating so I would think there's a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.069 
communicating so I would think there's a
natural<00:03:40.239> extension<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.510> thought<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:41.930> this

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
natural extension to the thought of this

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.710 
natural extension to the thought of this
is<00:03:42.260> how<00:03:42.410> teens<00:03:42.769> might<00:03:43.190> enjoy<00:03:43.720> experiencing

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
is how teens might enjoy experiencing

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.670 
is how teens might enjoy experiencing
story<00:03:45.370> is<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.640> through<00:03:47.269> more<00:03:47.480> picture<00:03:47.989> right

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
story is is through more picture right

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.860 
story is is through more picture right
purely<00:03:49.310> picture<00:03:49.820> but<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:51.320> combination<00:03:52.100> so<00:03:52.489> now

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
purely picture but in combination so now

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.390 
purely picture but in combination so now
authors<00:03:53.870> don't<00:03:54.140> worry<00:03:54.560> if<00:03:54.860> you're<00:03:55.040> not<00:03:55.070> an

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
authors don't worry if you're not an

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.940 
authors don't worry if you're not an
illustrator<00:03:56.120> that's<00:03:56.450> okay<00:03:56.959> but<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.680> think

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
illustrator that's okay but it I think

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.880 
illustrator that's okay but it I think
it<00:03:58.040> asks<00:03:58.610> authors<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.420> think<00:03:59.810> more<00:04:00.230> visually

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
it asks authors to think more visually

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.819 
it asks authors to think more visually
which<00:04:01.610> can<00:04:01.880> be<00:04:02.000> very<00:04:02.239> interesting<00:04:02.810> for<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:03.140> do

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
which can be very interesting for you do

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.490 
which can be very interesting for you do
and<00:04:04.310> I've<00:04:04.430> noticed<00:04:04.640> this<00:04:04.970> too<00:04:05.209> when<00:04:05.390> -<00:04:06.110> talking

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
and I've noticed this too when - talking

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.220 
and I've noticed this too when - talking
about<00:04:06.560> apps<00:04:06.980> where<00:04:07.970> authors<00:04:08.420> have<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.989> think

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
about apps where authors have to think

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.810 
about apps where authors have to think
more<00:04:09.350> visually<00:04:09.890> if<00:04:10.070> they're<00:04:10.280> going<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.549> start

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
more visually if they're going to start

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.770 
more visually if they're going to start
thinking<00:04:11.030> about<00:04:11.510> making<00:04:12.049> apps<00:04:13.209> in<00:04:14.209> other<00:04:14.360> in

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
thinking about making apps in other in

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.039 
thinking about making apps in other in
other<00:04:14.930> sort<00:04:15.320> of<00:04:15.380> trends<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.540> think<00:04:17.540> this

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
other sort of trends I think this

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.990 
other sort of trends I think this
doesn't<00:04:18.320> quite<00:04:18.620> answer<00:04:18.799> what<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.340> trends<00:04:19.910> are

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.540 
doesn't quite answer what the trends are
but<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.359> answers<00:04:20.870> how<00:04:21.530> do<00:04:21.590> we<00:04:21.890> find<00:04:22.130> out<00:04:22.340> about

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
but it answers how do we find out about

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.240 
but it answers how do we find out about
the<00:04:22.850> trends<00:04:23.419> there<00:04:24.320> are<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.410> couple<00:04:24.530> ways<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.860> do

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
the trends there are a couple ways to do

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.670 
the trends there are a couple ways to do

adding visuals to why a novels is a

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.670 
adding visuals to why a novels is a

wonderful idea and

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.920 
wonderful idea and
I<00:06:59.770> think<00:07:00.280> it<00:07:00.490> should<00:07:00.729> be<00:07:00.759> embraced<00:07:01.240> personally

I think it should be embraced personally
I<00:07:01.960> can<00:07:02.259> see<00:07:02.440> how<00:07:02.590> that<00:07:02.650> would<00:07:02.919> enhance<00:07:03.220> the

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
I can see how that would enhance the

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.950 
I can see how that would enhance the
whole<00:07:04.180> reading<00:07:04.780> experience<00:07:05.320> quite<00:07:05.530> a<00:07:05.590> bit
