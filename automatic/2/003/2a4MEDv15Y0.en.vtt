00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 and 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.400
 and 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.410
 Y 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.480
 hello friends today we are going to make a 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.699
 version that will serve as our base 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.399
 for many fish dishes to make 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.649
 the computer to add as a broth the 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.480
 fish dishes as we said and 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.940
 it's always good to have it in the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.820
 freezer takes it the jce in the successful 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.670
 with what you want more convenient and a 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.800
 just before you cook it, take it out 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.899
 you give a boil to avoid us 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.940
 would have spoiled what the 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.040
 you try and you can throw it in the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.730
 Easy stews while smoking 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.460
 We are going to need the following 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.460
 I have put a kilo and a half 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.570
 there are about here heads of 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.550
 snuff 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.010
 what can you do with any of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.110
 heads that you have in hake house 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.869
 of monkfish of any fish also 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.910
 even with scrapers and I put fish 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.550
 of rock that there is in approximately 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.140
 liquid man 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:22.400
 then we will need onion tomato 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:26.270
 carrot a piece of celery leek 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.610
 some granites of bay pepper 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.620
 parsley 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.620
 thyme that left me salt oil and water 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.950
 we will cut all the vegetables 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:45.140
 to irregular pieces 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.140
 it's more or less big that I care 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.060
 in a large pot we will put a little 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.820
 of olive oil in the background and we're going to 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.450
 saute the vegetables that we have cut 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.450
 we put them 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.090
 Y 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.480
 now we will expect that a 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.480
 bit 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.880
 when you see 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.680
 in them 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.680
 we're going to take the rock fish 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.870
 with 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.870
 and fast 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.000
 let's hope I have a little 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.350
 to fish what we will go around and 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.350
 Even if it breaks, nothing happens 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.050
 he did not say 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.730
 now we will have the time 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.730
 the silver straight 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.720
 we have turned the monk 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.690
 Now we're going to put it right away 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.790
 water cold water 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.860
 I put him in the moment two liters 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.860
 then we'll see I need more 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.430
 the bay leaf 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.020
 peppercorns parsley 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.730
 abundant 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.790
 and the thyme 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.410
 to the areas where we want later and 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.290
 now he has to boil 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.120
 when you see that a foam is made 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.660
 you have to go over the broth 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.660
 taking out 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.840
 and now he will have to boil more or less 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.300
 about 20 minutes you do not have to leave it 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.330
 boil the fish too much 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.070
 and always go dry the foam 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.070
 as you see it coming out 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.030
 we will lower the fire a little and now 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.030
 that goes boiling more slowly 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.560
 and they have spent the 20 minutes hare 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.299
 let's take a little bit in 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.450
 always to your liking the classrooms is 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.280
 better to be bland if we have to 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.470
 save while we can always add 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.790
 salt at the last moment we have already 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.880
 put out the fire and now it's just missing 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.880
 strain it very carefully this weighs 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.050
 or we will do it 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.889
 the video 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:57.100
 now we will fight so that they go forming 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.160
 discount all others 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.689
 all games fish that such a gift already 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.779
 practically undone no matter 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:09.389
 and finally we're going to strain it with a 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:12.199
 finny huy colander to leave 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.199
 all the impurities 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.440
 there are always some remains 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.360
 this is how we have left some perfumes 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.850
 in the end we have not added more water 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.540
 with the two liters there have been enough 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.700
 I do not raise because I'm not going to burn you 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.640
 I hope and wish you like it and you can 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.710
 keep it always ready for 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.710
 when you need it good
