00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.980

 caillou and I read the fantastic 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:15.419

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.039
 do not 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:33.889
 the captain who read the fantastic is 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.110
 they went to work, although not in 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.919
 team 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.919

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.880
 Cube 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.930
 and talk and less with the quick of the 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.930

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:01.119
 the child's powers 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.870
 today 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.560
 This fasting granted inhabitant 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.420
 the captain fell he realized that his 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.600
 superpowers were less super than what 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:21.530
 I thought and read the fantastic either 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.900
 I was having too much luck I read 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:29.110
 I have all the ogres fallen, I suppose 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:33.449
 I'm not a very good superhero, not me either 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:36.230
 I can not move the truck it weighs a lot 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.580
 and if we help each other 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.800

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.849
 I would help you collect the herbs that 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.849
 you have fallen and we will work as a team 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:51.740

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.669
 such 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:04.100
 the captain read the fantastic they formed a 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:05.840
 good team when they worked together 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:10.780
 to save the world 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.780
