00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.600
The LEAF is first model in the world
that had made special platform for EV.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.900
LEAF have high stability car.The battery are under the floor.
We could make a low center of gravity in this model.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.100
The weight balance is front 50% and rear 50%.
I guess you felt stability from steering wheel.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.300

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.600

The weight balance is very good.Rear seat passenger would be relax.
And gave quick response to body.You can control easy.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.500
