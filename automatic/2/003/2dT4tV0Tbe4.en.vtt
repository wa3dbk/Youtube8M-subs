00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720 

all<00:00:00.930> right<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.500> screencast<00:00:02.010> on<00:00:02.250> using

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
all right this is a screencast on using

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.309 
all right this is a screencast on using
the<00:00:02.820> law<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.030> reflection<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:04.279> protractor<00:00:05.279> and

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
the law of reflection a protractor and

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.379 
the law of reflection a protractor and
some<00:00:07.319> very<00:00:07.740> careful<00:00:08.220> measurements<00:00:08.760> to

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
some very careful measurements to

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.299 
some very careful measurements to
predict<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.139> path<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.620> light<00:00:10.860> would<00:00:11.010> take

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
predict the path that light would take

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.120 
predict the path that light would take
so<00:00:11.610> if<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.820> had<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> light<00:00:12.269> beam<00:00:12.480> coming<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.139> from

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
so if I had a light beam coming in from

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.820 
so if I had a light beam coming in from
this<00:00:14.309> direction<00:00:15.170> reflecting<00:00:16.170> off<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.379> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this direction reflecting off of a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.700 
this direction reflecting off of a
mirror<00:00:17.369> which<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.330> represented<00:00:19.020> by<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.199> this

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
mirror which is represented by the this

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.109 
mirror which is represented by the this
dark<00:00:19.980> line<00:00:20.130> here<00:00:21.830> what<00:00:22.830> would<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.220> path<00:00:23.850> of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
dark line here what would the path of

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.690 
dark line here what would the path of
light<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:26.539> this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.660> our<00:00:27.779> incident<00:00:28.199> beam<00:00:31.700> or

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
light do this is our incident beam or

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.180 
light do this is our incident beam or
our<00:00:32.910> incident<00:00:33.420> ray<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:37.100> everything<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
our incident ray and everything is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.709 
our incident ray and everything is
always<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:38.910> relative<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
always going to be relative to the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.060 
always going to be relative to the
normal<00:00:40.140> line<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:42.440> you're<00:00:43.440> going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.649> draw<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
normal line so you're going to draw a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.029 
normal line so you're going to draw a
normal<00:00:44.579> line<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.840> point<00:00:46.020> where<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.620> light

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
normal line at the point where the light

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.540 
normal line at the point where the light
ray<00:00:47.219> strikes<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.510> mirror<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:50.070> normal<00:00:50.430> line

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
ray strikes the mirror the normal line

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.950 
ray strikes the mirror the normal line
is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.210> line<00:00:52.079> an<00:00:52.559> imaginary<00:00:53.100> line<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.960> 90

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
is a line an imaginary line that is 90

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.990 
is a line an imaginary line that is 90
degrees<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.480> I<00:00:57.590> put<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> mark<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.340> at<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> 90

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
degrees so I put a mark there at the 90

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.359 
degrees so I put a mark there at the 90
degree<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:02.430> mark<00:01:02.730> there<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.379> where<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.650> Ray

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
degree that mark there and where the Ray

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.429 
degree that mark there and where the Ray
hits<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> mirror<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> two<00:01:06.900> lines<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
hits the mirror are the two lines that I

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.429 
hits the mirror are the two lines that I
need<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.860> make<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.310> normal<00:01:08.790> line<00:01:09.170> are<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> two

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
need to make my normal line are the two

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.960 
need to make my normal line are the two
points<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.920> need<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> make<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.460> normal<00:01:11.820> one

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
points that I need to make my normal one

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.240 
points that I need to make my normal one
I<00:01:12.290> usually<00:01:13.290> make<00:01:13.439> my<00:01:13.500> normal<00:01:13.920> line<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
I usually make my normal line as a

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.899 
I usually make my normal line as a
dotted<00:01:14.760> line<00:01:14.790> because<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.600> reference<00:01:16.909> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
dotted line because it's a reference the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.050 
dotted line because it's a reference the
light<00:01:18.119> never<00:01:18.299> actually<00:01:19.610> follows<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.790> path

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
light never actually follows this path

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.039 
light never actually follows this path
it's<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.659> reference<00:01:21.840> point<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:24.049> for

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
it's just a reference point for for

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.770 
it's just a reference point for for
everything<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> measure<00:01:27.000> my<00:01:27.240> angle

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
everything so now I measure my angle

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.340 
everything so now I measure my angle
relative<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:30.000> normal<00:01:30.180> line<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.900> measure

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
relative to the normal line I measure

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.819 
relative to the normal line I measure
the<00:01:31.590> angle<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> incident<00:01:34.439> beam<00:01:34.560> makes

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the angle that the incident beam makes

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.020 
the angle that the incident beam makes
with<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.040> normal<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.060> 10<00:01:36.299> 20<00:01:37.189> 35<00:01:38.189> 36

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
with the normal so this is 10 20 35 36

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:50.560 
with the normal so this is 10 20 35 36
degrees<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> angle<00:01:44.630> of<00:01:45.630> incidence

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:59.900 

or<00:01:51.570> theta<00:01:51.960> sub<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.890> equal<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.760> 36<00:01:55.040> degrees<00:01:58.910> so

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
or theta sub I is equal to 36 degrees so

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.910 
or theta sub I is equal to 36 degrees so
once<00:02:00.150> I<00:02:00.300> have<00:02:00.510> my<00:02:00.690> angle<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.140> incidence<00:02:01.620> I<00:02:01.740> can

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
once I have my angle of incidence I can

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.970 
once I have my angle of incidence I can
then<00:02:02.480> mark<00:02:03.480> my<00:02:04.380> angle<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.070> reflection<00:02:06.980> my

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
then mark my angle of reflection my

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.040 
then mark my angle of reflection my
angle<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.369> reflection<00:02:08.790> is<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.479> 36

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
angle of reflection is going to be 36

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.350 
angle of reflection is going to be 36
degrees<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.710> other<00:02:10.860> direction<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.310> 10<00:02:11.760> 20

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
degrees in the other direction so 10 20

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.680 
degrees in the other direction so 10 20
35<00:02:13.760> 36<00:02:14.760> degrees<00:02:15.210> will<00:02:15.420> be<00:02:15.570> right<00:02:15.810> here<00:02:17.690> so

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
35 36 degrees will be right here so

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.930 
35 36 degrees will be right here so
again<00:02:18.840> two<00:02:19.380> points<00:02:22.370> show<00:02:23.370> me<00:02:23.520> where<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.730> put<00:02:23.910> my

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
again two points show me where to put my

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.620 
again two points show me where to put my
line<00:02:25.040> where<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.190> race<00:02:26.430> rikes<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.060> mirror<00:02:27.390> and

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
line where the race rikes the mirror and

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.620 
line where the race rikes the mirror and
then<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.500> second<00:02:28.860> point<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.220> there<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:33.450> is

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
then the second point is there this is

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:42.170 
then the second point is there this is
my<00:02:33.780> brief<00:02:34.040> my<00:02:36.170> reflected<00:02:37.170> ray<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:40.970> again<00:02:41.970> this

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
my brief my reflected ray and again this

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.300 
my brief my reflected ray and again this
angle<00:02:43.220> theta<00:02:44.220> sub<00:02:44.580> R<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:44.850> equal<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.480> 36<00:02:46.380> degrees

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.610 

let<00:02:50.310> me<00:02:50.400> carefully<00:02:50.880> check<00:02:51.180> these<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.350> line

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
let me carefully check these so I line

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.960 
let me carefully check these so I line

one<00:02:56.070> degree<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.580> means<00:02:56.640> you're<00:02:57.030> getting<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.450> B

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
one degree that means you're getting a B

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.750 
one degree that means you're getting a B
instead<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.230> an<00:02:58.320> A<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.430> be<00:02:59.550> very

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
instead of an A so you have to be very

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.650 
instead of an A so you have to be very
precise<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.239> these<00:03:00.510> measurements<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.390> is

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
precise in these measurements so this is

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:14.540 
precise in these measurements so this is
10<00:03:04.620> 20<00:03:05.070> 35<00:03:05.989> 36<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.290> one<00:03:10.530> 10<00:03:11.340> 20<00:03:11.820> 35<00:03:12.750> 36<00:03:13.550> so

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
10 20 35 36 and this one 10 20 35 36 so

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.410 
10 20 35 36 and this one 10 20 35 36 so
let's<00:03:14.700> see<00:03:14.850> how<00:03:15.000> close<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.420> came<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:17.300> making<00:03:18.300> an

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
let's see how close I came to making an

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.830 
let's see how close I came to making an
accurate<00:03:18.780> prediction<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.470> put<00:03:19.650> my<00:03:19.769> target<00:03:20.160> here

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
accurate prediction I put my target here

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.100 
accurate prediction I put my target here
I'll<00:03:21.840> put<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.140> mirror<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.670> paper

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:35.920 

carefully<00:03:28.110> positioning<00:03:28.920> that

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.670 

there's<00:03:36.930> my<00:03:37.110> mirror<00:03:37.790> let's<00:03:38.790> see<00:03:38.970> how

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
there's my mirror let's see how

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.900 
there's my mirror let's see how
reflected<00:03:40.680> ray<00:03:41.150> does<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:43.340> line<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.370> up<00:03:44.610> with<00:03:44.790> the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
reflected ray does I line it up with the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.230 
reflected ray does I line it up with the
incident<00:03:45.500> look<00:03:46.500> at<00:03:46.620> that

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
incident look at that

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.960 
incident look at that
almost<00:03:48.240> perfect<00:03:48.660> not<00:03:48.870> quite<00:03:49.610> but<00:03:50.610> that's<00:03:50.820> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
almost perfect not quite but that's the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.960 
almost perfect not quite but that's the
process<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.630> go<00:03:51.660> through<00:03:51.810> in<00:03:52.170> order<00:03:52.410> to

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.850 

determine<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.300> reflected<00:03:58.040> or<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.130> angle<00:04:00.860> of

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
determine the reflected or the angle of

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.440 
determine the reflected or the angle of
reflection<00:04:07.190> now<00:04:08.190> while<00:04:08.430> it's<00:04:08.610> true<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.209> this

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
reflection now while it's true that this

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.490 
reflection now while it's true that this
angle<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:11.010> this<00:04:11.250> angle<00:04:11.310> are<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.940> same<00:04:12.500> when

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
angle and this angle are the same when

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.440 
angle and this angle are the same when
we<00:04:13.680> start<00:04:13.920> doing<00:04:14.040> refraction<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.030> can't

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
we start doing refraction you can't

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.680 
we start doing refraction you can't
measure<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:16.079> relative<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.890> surface

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
measure it relative to the surface

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.789 
measure it relative to the surface
everything<00:04:18.690> should<00:04:18.989> always<00:04:19.200> be<00:04:19.440> measured

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
everything should always be measured

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.550 
everything should always be measured
relative<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.640> normal<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.959> your<00:04:22.140> angle<00:04:22.530> is

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
relative to the normal so your angle is

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.170 
relative to the normal so your angle is
you<00:04:22.740> wanna<00:04:22.919> be<00:04:23.010> measuring<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.430> angle<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
you wanna be measuring this angle in the

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.720 
you wanna be measuring this angle in the
same<00:04:24.560> always<00:04:25.560> relative<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.550> blind

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
same always relative to the blind

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.360 
same always relative to the blind
perpendicular<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.840> surface<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:28.770> that's

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
perpendicular to the surface and that's

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.580 
perpendicular to the surface and that's
it
