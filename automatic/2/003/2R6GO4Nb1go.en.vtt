then you just cut this out I suggest
making<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.490> bunch<00:02:16.790> at<00:02:17.030> once<00:02:17.320> but<00:02:18.320> cut<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.680> out

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
making a bunch at once but cut it out

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.790 
making a bunch at once but cut it out
bake<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.520> according<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.930> directions<00:02:20.960> on

different ways you can use them to make
embellishments<00:02:34.459> for<00:02:35.360> paper<00:02:35.600> crafting<00:02:36.370> which

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
embellishments for paper crafting which

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.210 
embellishments for paper crafting which
is<00:02:37.580> what<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.820> tend<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.390> do<00:02:38.630> with<00:02:38.780> them<00:02:39.220> more

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.050 
over it put a little bead in there and
baked<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:07.810> this<00:03:08.810> clay<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.970> glitter<00:03:10.970> clay<00:03:11.570> and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
baked it this clay is a glitter clay and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.390

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
them all in one sitting you can make the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.210 
them all in one sitting you can make the
colors<00:03:35.600> coordinate<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.860> patterns

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
colors coordinate and the patterns

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.850 
colors coordinate and the patterns
coordinate<00:03:37.850> which<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:38.690> what<00:03:39.049> I'm<00:03:39.170> doing<00:03:39.380> for

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
coordinate which is what I'm doing for

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.130 
coordinate which is what I'm doing for
my<00:03:40.040> box<00:03:40.340> here<00:03:40.850> is<00:03:40.970> another<00:03:41.239> sunflower<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:42.110> I

did in silver and gold here's a piece of
white<00:03:46.190> clay<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:48.400> again<00:03:49.400> stamped<00:03:50.030> into<00:03:50.180> it

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
white clay and again stamped into it

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.810 
white clay and again stamped into it
brushed<00:03:52.299> lightly<00:03:53.299> very<00:03:54.260> very<00:03:54.530> lightly<00:03:54.829> with

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820

some purple artist pigment colors and

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.330 
some purple artist pigment colors and
that<00:03:58.820> way<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.150> catches<00:03:59.420> the<00:04:00.260> raised<00:04:00.500> portions

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
that way it catches the raised portions

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.330 
that way it catches the raised portions
so<00:04:02.299> your<00:04:02.510> image<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.590> you've<00:04:03.739> stamped<00:04:04.100> in

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
so your image that you've stamped in

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.780 
so your image that you've stamped in
there<00:04:04.579> really<00:04:04.820> stands<00:04:05.269> out<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.650> then<00:04:07.640> you

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
there really stands out and then you

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.860 
there really stands out and then you
bake<00:04:07.970> them<00:04:08.150> according<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.840> directions

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
and as you can see it is not going to

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.060 
and as you can see it is not going to
rub<00:04:13.010> off<00:04:13.750> well<00:04:14.750> already<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.290> full<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.799> mess

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070
