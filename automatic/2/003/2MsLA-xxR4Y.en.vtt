this<00:02:09.489> around<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.910> little<00:02:09.940> bit<00:02:11.519> alright<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.940> we

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
this around a little bit alright so we

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.240 
this around a little bit alright so we

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
have our dry ingredients and our wet

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.479 
have our dry ingredients and our wet
ingredients<00:02:18.690> mixed<00:02:19.690> up<00:02:19.810> at<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.049> point<00:02:20.489> so

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
ingredients mixed up at this point so

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.069 
ingredients mixed up at this point so
our<00:02:21.640> next<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.150> final<00:02:22.540> step<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:24.780> do<00:02:25.780> our

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
our next and final step is to do our

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.050 
our next and final step is to do our
apples<00:02:26.739> so<00:02:27.250> I'm<00:02:27.340> going<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.549> get<00:02:27.670> those<00:02:27.849> done

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
apples so I'm going to get those done

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.380 
apples so I'm going to get those done
and<00:02:28.239> I'll<00:02:28.329> be<00:02:28.450> back<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.810> I'm<00:02:31.930> using<00:02:32.140> two<00:02:32.440> apples

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
and I'll be back so I'm using two apples

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:47.720 
and I'll be back so I'm using two apples
for<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.540> recipe

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.839 

ludie<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.940> that's<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.300> for<00:02:52.480> our<00:02:52.510> Apple<00:02:53.849> get

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
ludie so that's it for our Apple get

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.050 
ludie so that's it for our Apple get
your<00:02:55.000> oven<00:02:55.300> preheated<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:56.670> 375<00:02:57.670> degrees

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
your oven preheated to 375 degrees

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.680 
your oven preheated to 375 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:59.430> so<00:03:00.430> I'll<00:03:00.760> be<00:03:00.970> back<00:03:01.150> we'll<00:03:01.390> be<00:03:01.420> on

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
Fahrenheit so I'll be back we'll be on

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.949 
Fahrenheit so I'll be back we'll be on
to<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.930> next<00:03:02.110> step<00:03:02.319> in<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.470> minute<00:03:03.900> all<00:03:04.900> right

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
to the next step in a minute all right

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.300 
to the next step in a minute all right
so<00:03:05.380> our<00:03:05.410> apples<00:03:06.400> are<00:03:06.760> all<00:03:06.970> diced<00:03:07.270> up<00:03:08.280> we've<00:03:09.280> got

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
so our apples are all diced up we've got

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.199 
so our apples are all diced up we've got
our<00:03:10.260> wet<00:03:11.370> batter<00:03:12.370> here<00:03:12.730> I'm<00:03:12.849> just<00:03:13.030> going<00:03:13.180> to

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
our wet batter here I'm just going to

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:25.370 
our wet batter here I'm just going to
mix<00:03:13.390> this<00:03:13.510> up<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.840> little<00:03:13.959> bit<00:03:14.140> more<00:03:22.530> all<00:03:23.530> righty

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
mix this up a little bit more all righty

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.140 
mix this up a little bit more all righty
and<00:03:26.380> then<00:03:26.560> we're<00:03:26.709> going<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.890> incorporate<00:03:30.150> that

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
and then we're going to incorporate that

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.830

impressive one that's the largest one
that<00:05:28.259> we<00:05:28.380> filled<00:05:29.000> so<00:05:30.000> there<00:05:30.120> we<00:05:30.240> go<00:05:30.270> and

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
that we filled so there we go and

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.749

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
difference so there we go

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.540
