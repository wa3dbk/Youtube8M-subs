00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
so let's just get on the next step as

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.340 
so let's just get on the next step as
also<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.000> want<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.330> add<00:03:07.450> lots<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.870> chest<00:03:08.140> so

also you want to add lots of chest so

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.110 
also you want to add lots of chest so
people<00:03:08.620> can<00:03:08.890> get<00:03:09.310> items<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.820> survive

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
people can get items and survive

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.760 
people can get items and survive
obviously<00:03:10.690> but<00:03:11.350> now<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:12.280> wanna<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:13.770> you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
obviously but now you wanna and you

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.990 
obviously but now you wanna and you
don't<00:03:14.920> have<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.190> do<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.430> but<00:03:15.489> I<00:03:15.670> would<00:03:15.790> really

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
get chest as the game starts where we

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.790 
get chest as the game starts where we
have<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.880> make<00:03:25.209> sure<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.600> if<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.080> have<00:03:26.170> lwc

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
okay a spawn five done ah where he go

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.320 
okay a spawn five done ah where he go
okay<00:04:32.669> 16

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
okay 16

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:45.420 
okay 16
and<00:04:35.840> right<00:04:36.439> here<00:04:37.720> spawn<00:04:38.720> seven<00:04:42.340> spawn<00:04:43.340> eight

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
and right here spawn seven spawn eight

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.890 
and right here spawn seven spawn eight
spawn<00:04:46.430> nine<00:04:46.849> and<00:04:48.969> spawn<00:04:49.969> 10<00:04:52.030> so<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.569> then

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
spawn nine and spawn 10 so and then

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.439 
spawn nine and spawn 10 so and then
there's<00:04:54.110> two<00:04:54.349> more<00:04:54.590> I<00:04:54.650> think<00:04:55.129> right<00:04:55.879> here<00:04:58.449> that

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
there's two more I think right here that

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.089 
there's two more I think right here that
spawn<00:04:59.719> next<00:05:00.110> past<00:05:00.409> it<00:05:00.590> okay<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.580> 11<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.800> 12<00:05:03.800> I

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099 
spawn next past it okay and 11 and 12 I

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.730 
spawn next past it okay and 11 and 12 I
think<00:05:04.400> 12<00:05:04.699> is<00:05:04.969> I'm<00:05:05.719> pretty<00:05:06.169> sure<00:05:06.319> started

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
think 12 is I'm pretty sure started

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.290 
think 12 is I'm pretty sure started
there<00:05:06.949> I<00:05:07.099> didn't<00:05:07.460> then<00:05:07.639> that<00:05:07.879> must<00:05:08.060> be<00:05:08.270> very

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
there I didn't then that must be very

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.010 
there I didn't then that must be very
odd<00:05:09.199> but<00:05:09.949> now<00:05:10.129> literally<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.449> arena<00:05:11.719> is
