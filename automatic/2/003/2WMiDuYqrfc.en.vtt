 hello everybody, we are here with regime 2 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.920
 which is the first smartphone of the key in the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.540
 Brazilian market 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.309
 we made an incomplete box of this 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.559
 product here in the week until our 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.650
 podcast check out all about it from 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.650
 from now 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.580
 good, the box is very simple, it has nothing 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.369
 of a year nothing apple in that sense 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.650
 except for the fact you pull in so it is 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.320
 it's a gadget have the traditional things 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.140
 as a certified warranty manual that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.760
 we found this envelope 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.210
 difficult to open at all times. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.239
 here you need and let's go 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.210
 to see him here is very light and he is not without 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.890
 His battery is here and there. 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.940
 I loose, I think I'm going to have problems 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.280
 open this 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.030
 this device let's see if it's easy to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.190
 Difficult to have a little place right is more 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.329
 easy than motogp has to give the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.820
 arm twisting 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.740
 It is very difficult today to open this 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.189
 battery battery that is capable of 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.790
 2,200 m heats 25% more than the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.049
 recognize this as they liked 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.900
 compare to this device here that is 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.520
 basic an iphone 6 just to say 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.030
 you do not have to buy a device 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.130
 very expensive to have advanced features and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.840
 fact of some things that you 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.619
 find on the android devices below 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.659
 cost that apple also offers here in 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.420
 when smartphones were launched 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.329
 they were practically exclusive of s 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.549
 so you did not have much choice 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.439
 up there is 4.7 inches with resolution 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.299
 hd is a device ends up being quite 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.009
 economic because it is one thing 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.590
 what is missing is more and more 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.750
 people see smartphones with large 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.310
 the economy ends up being harmed 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.229
 the municipality already the system that we are going to see 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.969
 it takes a long time to connect 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.890
 prepare the first time that he or she 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.479

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.399
 will be able to enjoy the space that is a 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.759
 Resource android 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.119
 lollipop fact this device not having 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.990
 he pop b with 14 points 4.4 kitkat one 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.030
 all the customization of mine and 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.100
 the buttons here we find in the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.180
 right side of the button 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.950

 Let's see they even have the camera that 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.700
 is with a protective plastic aggravates 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.030
 When you have to be plastic 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.440
 fissile alisson maciel question would be 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.320
 if there is anything about assistance 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.250
 explains this technique as it is a 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.180
 new without many points strip is this the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.160
 Brazil 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.240
 five people they will get the support 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.820
 a pick me that is exactly the same 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.860
 time a joke with the name and 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.050
 English expression be aware of 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.280
 look with them you had some problem 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.480
 in the thigh 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.780
 If you have any problems with your 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:14.630
 smartphone you can talk to them 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.610
 there and you are going to have a bearer of 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.800
 company on the doorstep of your house in 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.880
 you are to take him to only 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.070
 for assistance you can follow 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.510
 all the way with a smartphone that your 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.220
 smartphone is making an app 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.420
 android probably on the web too 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.340
 but this was not very clear in the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.900
 show some things here 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.100
 visual system like I said is 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.950
 pretty colorful 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:39.320
 it has 11 wire dee the s7 will because 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.420
 was the time that they changed the 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.130
 and made everything very colorful and 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.110
 the staff did not like it very much, right? 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.630
 but until the look of this type of 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.980
 system is cool and it's one thing 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.110
 interesting is that in China for reasons 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.770
 obvious they do not come with the 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.560
 Google 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.220
 Only here in Brazil, everything that 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.840
 google trends for you to use 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.610
 android smartphones usually have a 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.670
 series of other resources 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.760
 has even a timer procel was through the mud 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.760
 used in the presentation of l 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.840
 the sky is the people and the cool thing that I 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.419
 I will not be able to use water 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.520
 in the video but the cool thing is that the team 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.960
 appears here in the corner and then when 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.690
 You 're going to take people self. 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.150
 They are usually looking at screen 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.710
 That's when I look half-way up, then 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.990
 you keep an eye on the team 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.940
 you will look the first place right and 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.479
 we got a decent photo taken 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.160
 without much trouble and until the end 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.979
 I'm arriving here while you are 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.290
 speaking is made in Brazil yes 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.270
 manufactured by foxconn 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.949
 coincidentally they bought so many 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.930
 this appliance with the appliance. 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.820
 apple that is also made by foxconn 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.740
 the first wave of the animal in the portal 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.780
 first wave colorado blood just think 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.460
 which are 22 thousand consumers so you 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.419
 will put all the cases to produce here 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.490
 exactly 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.370
 and talking about other imported things 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.790
 that we will have here in the market 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.830
 Brazilian team is well aware that a 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.440
 smart bracelet very similar to 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.260
 more band stocks with oregon 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.740
 scientifically is also essentially a 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.050
 bluetooth accelerometer and you will be able to 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.150
 monitor your workouts and sleep 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.770
 with her and I think the most 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.389
 interesting about amy band 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.360
 plus the price that is a quarter of the price 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.880
 of Sony's offer is that it has a 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.669
 30-day battery life 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.950
 I only know users that I can 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.560
 report that this battery lasts 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.190
 40 days and I said the price did not say in 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.479
 how well the team costs 95 reais in the 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.490
 Brazilian market 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.930
 this product is imported and another product 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.430
 imported that will arrive here too 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:56.750
 is the power bank is an extra one 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:01.520
 of 10 thousand and 400 ma that can give 3,4 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:03.020
 loads on scheme 2 and will arrive for $ 99 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.539
 which is a price below the average of 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.240
 market that for example atp in which 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.590
 offers an extra battery with 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.510
 similar capacity here in the market 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.510
 Brazilian it costs more than 150 reais
