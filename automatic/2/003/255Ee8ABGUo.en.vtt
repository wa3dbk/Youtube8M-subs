yeah and in this video I'm going to show

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.999 
yeah and in this video I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.760> navigation<00:00:03.570> screen<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.140> some<00:00:04.859> of

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
you the navigation screen and some of

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.130 
you the navigation screen and some of
the<00:00:05.190> information<00:00:06.089> that's<00:00:06.480> displayed<00:00:06.839> there

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
the information that's displayed there

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.799 
the information that's displayed there
we're<00:00:07.980> looking<00:00:08.189> at<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.400> currently<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:09.059> 3d

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
we're looking at it currently in 3d

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.470 
we're looking at it currently in 3d
daytime<00:00:10.590> mode<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.190> as<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:12.000> see<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.300> gives

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
daytime mode and as you can see it gives

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.110 
daytime mode and as you can see it gives
you<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.630> nice<00:00:12.809> smooth<00:00:13.650> or<00:00:14.370> relatively<00:00:14.759> smoothly

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
you a nice smooth or relatively smoothly

you a nice smooth or relatively smoothly
updated<00:00:15.630> video<00:00:15.900> showing<00:00:16.199> your<00:00:16.379> position<00:00:16.850> just

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
updated video showing your position just

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.779 
updated video showing your position just
to<00:00:17.910> give<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.150> some<00:00:18.180> idea<00:00:18.949> let's<00:00:19.949> switch<00:00:20.580> over

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
to give you some idea let's switch over

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.620 
to give you some idea let's switch over
to<00:00:21.180> 2d<00:00:21.990> mode<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.539> I

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
to 2d mode and this is the one that I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.240 
to 2d mode and this is the one that I
typically<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.230> use<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.949> because<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
typically like to use just because I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.189 
typically like to use just because I
feel<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.760> shows<00:00:27.090> more<00:00:27.630> information<00:00:28.109> on

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
feel that it shows more information on

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.450 
feel that it shows more information on
the<00:00:28.260> mat<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.619> if<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.920> time<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.400> let

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the mat but if you get a time and let

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.759 
the mat but if you get a time and let
you<00:00:29.640> see<00:00:29.939> more<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.449> your<00:00:30.539> surroundings<00:00:30.810> now

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
you see more of your surroundings now

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.810 
you see more of your surroundings now
let's<00:00:31.920> take<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> look<00:00:32.130> around<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> map<00:00:32.640> here

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
let's take a look around the map here

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.990 
let's take a look around the map here
and<00:00:33.450> around<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> screen<00:00:33.960> first<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.410> all

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
and around the screen first of all

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000 
and around the screen first of all
you'll<00:00:36.000> notice<00:00:36.329> over<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> bottom

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
you'll notice over here on the bottom

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.500 
you'll notice over here on the bottom
left<00:00:38.160> we've<00:00:38.430> gotten<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> direction<00:00:39.360> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
left we've gotten to the direction of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.990 
left we've gotten to the direction of
our<00:00:39.629> next<00:00:39.870> turn<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.649> well<00:00:40.890> as<00:00:40.950> how<00:00:41.250> far<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.879> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
our next turn as well as how far it is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.200 
our next turn as well as how far it is
until<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> next<00:00:42.750> turn<00:00:43.050> we've<00:00:44.040> got<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.850> total

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
until that next turn we've got the total

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.180 
until that next turn we've got the total
distance<00:00:45.390> remain<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.989> our<00:00:46.110> trip<00:00:46.379> we've<00:00:47.010> got

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
distance remain on our trip we've got

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
distance remain on our trip we've got
how<00:00:47.340> long<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.760> expected<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.390> take<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
how long it's expected to take that to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.040 
how long it's expected to take that to
make<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.800> trip<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.850> current<00:00:51.449> time<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.899> well

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
make that trip the current time as well

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.410 
make that trip the current time as well
as<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.500> estimated<00:00:53.190> time<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.399> arrival<00:00:53.670> or

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
as the estimated time of arrival or

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.689 
as the estimated time of arrival or
current<00:00:54.780> speed<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:55.770> had<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> GPS<00:00:56.100> signal

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
current speed and if we had a GPS signal

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.510 
current speed and if we had a GPS signal
it<00:00:56.789> shows<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> strength<00:00:57.449> signal<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.520> you

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it shows the strength signal here you

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
it shows the strength signal here you
also<00:00:59.670> notice<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.120> we've<00:01:00.329> got<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> compass<00:01:00.930> on

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
also notice that we've got a compass on

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.299 
also notice that we've got a compass on
the<00:01:01.170> map<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.800> configured

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the map and this is configured

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.680 
the map and this is configured
configurable<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.570> different

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
configurable so you can see different

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.090 
configurable so you can see different
information<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.739> currently

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
information but this is currently

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.730 
information but this is currently
showing<00:01:05.570> our<00:01:06.570> direction<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.110> travel<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
showing our direction of travel in the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.340 
showing our direction of travel in the
arrow<00:01:07.950> points<00:01:08.460> north<00:01:08.750> at<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> bottom<00:01:10.170> we've

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
arrow points north at the bottom we've

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.260 
arrow points north at the bottom we've
gotten<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.799> street<00:01:11.130> name<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.520> highway<00:01:11.850> name<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
gotten a street name or highway name and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
gotten a street name or highway name and
this<00:01:12.390> seems<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.409> bit<00:01:13.619> flaky<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> me

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
this seems a little bit flaky to me

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.560 
this seems a little bit flaky to me
sometimes<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.729> shows<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> street<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
sometimes it shows you the street that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.910 
sometimes it shows you the street that
you're<00:01:15.720> currently<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.080> sometimes<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.770> shows

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
you're currently on sometimes it shows

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170 
you're currently on sometimes it shows
you<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> street<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.520> you're<00:01:17.759> about<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.000> turn

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you the street that you're about to turn

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.170 
you the street that you're about to turn
on<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.490> it's<00:01:20.490> getting<00:01:20.790> some<00:01:20.939> current

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
on so it's getting some current

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.490 
on so it's getting some current
information<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.720> may<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:21.960> based<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
information and that may be based a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.380 
information and that may be based a
little<00:01:22.740> bit<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.009> how<00:01:23.220> far<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.759> until<00:01:24.180> your

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
little bit on how far it is until your

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.870 
little bit on how far it is until your
next<00:01:24.540> turn<00:01:24.860> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.040> upper<00:01:26.369> right<00:01:26.580> hand<00:01:26.729> corner

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
next turn in the upper right hand corner

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.060 
next turn in the upper right hand corner
you'll<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:28.049> we've<00:01:28.229> got<00:01:28.259> what<00:01:28.950> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
you'll see that we've got what is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
you'll see that we've got what is
supposed<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.610> our<00:01:29.790> next<00:01:30.000> street<00:01:30.540> signs<00:01:30.869> of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
supposed to be our next street signs of

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.770 
supposed to be our next street signs of
this<00:01:31.200> next<00:01:31.590> major<00:01:31.829> street<00:01:32.280> sign<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.630> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
this next major street sign that is of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
this next major street sign that is of
importance<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.380> us<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.799> shown<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.310> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
importance to us to and shown there you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.429 
importance to us to and shown there you
also<00:01:36.270> notice<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:38.630> as<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.780> approach<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.229> turn
