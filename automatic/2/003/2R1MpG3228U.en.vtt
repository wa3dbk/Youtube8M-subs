00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.270
 arteriosclerosis is a life-threatening disease that can begin 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.540
 to develop during childhood this disease is a process in which the 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.150
 Deposits of fatty material called plaque 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.220
 they accumulate in the walls of the arteries reducing ob what I walk by 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.909
 complete the blood flow 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:24.970
 and the exact causes of arteriosclerosis are not clear many 

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:28.729
 scientists claim that it starts with the pipe to the inner wall of a 

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:32.879
 Yamada artery endothelium to substances transported through the blood 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.150
 like cholesterol and you're like that the cellular waste products 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
 accumulate in the damaged area of â€‹â€‹the arterial wall 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.140
 the chemical sessions that occur within the accumulation of material 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.620
 so the cholesterol molecules are displayed 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.379
 this results in an inflammatory response 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.210
 in which the industrial cells said damaged site releases substances 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.210
 Chemicals that indicate a distress call 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.420
 in response the municipalities of the bloodstream are heading towards the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.090
 damaged site 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.880
 the stimulation of oxidized cholesterol 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 converts monocytes into macrophages 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 the macrophages commented insist on the cholesterol molecules 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.189
 as a result of this process the macrophages become cells 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.090
 scaly which accumulate to form the plate 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.810
 to the extent that the place does not interest me anymore 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.810
 the couple wanted to say is an experience that is needed 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.620
 at the same time the smooth muscle cells within the filial parity 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.619
 they begin to multiply 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.780
 most smooth muscle cells move towards the surface of the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.170
 plaque these cells contribute to the formation of a fibrous layer 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.419
 finalize the plant 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:16.609
 finally the corridor through art is this fact enough to 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.519
 reduce blood flow and the amount of oxygen received by 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.299
 organs of justice 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.689
 the stage by eroding and prison leading plaque in the torrent 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.119
 blood 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.509
 the position plate and he trusted that the formation of a promissory note 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.289
 near the end 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.849
 the unlimited supply of Christ's blood and in this sense cemetery in 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:42.979
 the international scene 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.159
 I told the titular guy where they have most resisted design 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.710
 Jack 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.410
 Jack 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.429
 at present
