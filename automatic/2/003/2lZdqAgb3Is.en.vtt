 to limit my mythical franci ruiz 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.599

 tag 15 strange questions bertazzo bar del 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.869
 case and I liked it because it wasn't the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.000
 classic test that like what we do 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.180

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.580
 beautiful though that sucks 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.730
 a bit dull we say respect Italy that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.399
 I like to ask myself these questions 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.660
 interesting so let's start right away 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.129
 then question 1 which is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.420
 what is the nickname he calls you with 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.930

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.510
 because but we can say yes we can 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.180
 to say it can be attributed to me is not 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:57.480
 gem already kind of the long bitch e 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:00.090

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.789

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.619
 confident in the next then question 2 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.299
 a strange car habit 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.920
 then when I get hungry I want 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.630
 I don't want to eat a snack 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.610
 sweets because I am not crazy about so much 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.619

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.860
 I add oil to the oregano 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.270
 garlic and it crumbles into gods 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 crackers but they all come out eat 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.280

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.950
 which you secretly love with which you are unleashed 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.170
 home alone 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.180

 side but then I do the tarantella 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.020
 affection goes well so sometimes 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.370
 not now put forward but the time I 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.810
 I found myself with the omi of the place of the 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.060
 head card instead of sticking it in 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.190
 physical sense in the sense that where there was 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.430

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:26.500

 useless if canova snowflake now 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.130
 since the lake is very dirty 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.860
 ricotto is not nicknamed a staple of 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:44.520

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.920

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.880
 you can do it if you don't know what it is 

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.420

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.390

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.860

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.180
 coming three hundred shots of acidity that 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.890

 then and then or the waffle in the end then it is 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.790
 time to sleep what you wear these are 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.430
