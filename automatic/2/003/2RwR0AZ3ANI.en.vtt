 minecraft 0.7 point 1 in the new 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.920
 update is simply the least the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.930

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:26.320
 I'm going to give them mediafire the folder or 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.660

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.610
 that give them the rar file they will have 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.579
 to decompress with some manager 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.470
 files that do not come by default 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.370
 and here I have 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.010
 what is let me see and organized a little 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.540

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.540

 It is very good to do it but more 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.120
