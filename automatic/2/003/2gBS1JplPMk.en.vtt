00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.510
 friends as they are I am luis gg and good 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.390
 you have seen it we have mentioned 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 the different characteristics of the choose 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.080
 three on different platforms but for 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.090
 finally arrived in Mexico and I'm here with 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.990
 Arming marchi that will tell us a lot 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.160
 more of this release that the truth is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.690
 see very interesting 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.019
 putting together the first thing that I love you 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.660
 ask is that you have told me that 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.390
 for him and the 5.2-inch screen 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.899
 it was perfect and now well with bands of 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.120
 5.5 because the change looks at the truth is 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.460
 that we realized that the hands of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.149
 human being have mutated from one year to another 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.609
 no it is not true we realized that no 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.140
 is that the size of the 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.810
 chassis the chassis was increased very 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.260
 little what increased was 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.200
 the surface of the screen we eliminate 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.900
 edges and inside a chassis a little more 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.970
 22 centimeters large one is left 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.880
 much larger screen we use the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.010
 76.4 percent of the surface of the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.580
 screen than any other smartphone 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.800
 occupy us we have realized that for a 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.600
 on the other hand we also review the 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.250
 radio that the phone should have on 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.420
 phone on the back in the part 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.119
 in order to have a good grip and 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.990
 we also work a lot on the width of the 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.360
 18 mm device 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.579
 I did not do it fat we had a 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.979
 larger screen we will occupy more 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.979
 surface space and that this 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.830
 could have a greater grip with the radio 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.829
 of the curvature of the phone and it's a 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.500
 evolution last year because that's how it came out 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.820
 the g2 but the truth is an evolution and 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.950
 also with the casing that we are 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.740
 putting metallic that you do not have left 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.869
 recorded the fingerprints also 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.970
 gives you a rough texture that allows you 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.280
 also have greater grip and ergonomics 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.000
 already brings us as little butchery already 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.680
 no longer no longer scratch the truth is that 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.819
 We give one one touch of style very 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.400
 interesting to the device and we know that 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.830
 for the Mexican market is a market 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.959
 aspirational in which style counts 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.360
 it's a sophisticated market and being at 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.510
 side of the us is a market they are looking for 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.590
 new trends and the g3 brings this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.590
 new is new 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.340
 form design and new materials that 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.910
 for the Mexican market they are very 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.980
 attractive 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.480
 Now let's see operators right now 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.580
 until it's with telcel tables too 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.959
 that will be with more operators but 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.550
 from when a company 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.380
 some months with telcel or how to be the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.870
 subject not the truth will be from the 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.670
 day 1 this with the three most operators 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.130
 important of mexico 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.810
 and on the other hand now with the new law 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.790
 of telecommunications the issue of 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.320
 unlocked phones 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.600
 mentioned also that are opening 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.060
 channels for accessories there will be the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.630
 possibility of acquiring it unlocked 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.720
 somewhere 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.190
 Look, you know better the law than I already 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.680
 there are operators that sell phones 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.540
 unlocked we continue with 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.570
 our traditional business of selling to 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.590
 through the operators nothing more than the 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.120
 part of peripherals that we are 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.530
 doing business with operators but 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.810
 we are also doing business 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.190
 direct with retailers and with 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.620
 distributors but for the part 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.210
 particular of cell phones and we continue with 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.860
 the traditional business and this is that this is 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.600
 I ask because there are different stores 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.400
 online that suddenly the 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.410
 free way sale unlocked 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.210
 teams that in the end good what is 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.300
 detect are teams that are bought in 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.800
 mondo x in usa and in the end then the 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.630
 user when he wants to claim guarantees 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.970
 come with you I'm being me 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.050
 but you did not buy it here you said it 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.710
 perfect for us I say there's a 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:05.069
 clear relationship between the cost of sale 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.079
 in Mexico plus after-sales service 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.510
 we have found lots of phones 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.069
 unlocked that are sold over the internet 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.099
 we as the Chinese are doing 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.440
 against those guarantees and especially a 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.769
 device that is worth the price 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.630
 that you want as we speak your device 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.820
 It's priceless because you keep all your 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.940
 life you keep your photos your videos you 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.639
 everything in it then put in 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.560
 risk the part that they no longer cost 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.030
 anything for us is 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.160
 important that we follow the channels 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.780
 traditional and that people do not run 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.090
 risks 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.680
 for saving a few pesos today by putting together 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.260
 I hope that after this question I 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.660
 keep talking about a question that is 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.100
 most politically correct but for 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.040
 all the features that we 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.180
 3 They taught the select team 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.180
 perfect for the infidels 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.469
 well look 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:01.510
 It is 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.730
 I would say that for the very discreet 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.520
 well believe for politicians to people who 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.289
 wants to be discreet for the infidels 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.689
 well 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.479
 I send you all the luck of this planet 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:15.309
 but the issue is that the truth is that what 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.080
 they handled the issue very well 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:18.819
 soon there is a lot of valuable information and 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.409
 I think we have to cover a way 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.689
 important that information with where there is 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.189
 photos where there are messages where things that 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.749
 The truth is that suddenly you want 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.999
 do not know all the world not then that 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:31.059
 sense I think it has different 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:33.399
 spaces to be able to eat the information 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.990
 I think we cover in the spaces 

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:37.330
 one from 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.580
 how to access the phone 2 how to access 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.700
 to the content and 3 how to find the 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.010
 phone and unlock in case of any 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.360
 contingency I would not call it a 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.580
 phone for infidels I would call it 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.310
 that for a phone is one is a subject 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.950
 it is a device for any user 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.730
 mexican which we are exposed to all 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:01.270
 the days which we want to keep the 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.880
 low profile every day and so the jee 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.760
 has developed this strategy for 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.610
 be able to control and take care of the content of 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.690
 your device hears last question the 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.480
 The truth is that the 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.400
 accessories the watch looks great and if 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.750
 surely here they are seeing it no longer 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.300
 he's showing off he's already throwing it 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.430
 on the face it looks pretty nice it's very very 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.720
 nice furnish, if I say ok 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.760
 Google 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.180
 ok google 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:32.640
 search 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.640
 good not looking for the g3 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.409
 He pulled something else because he does not speak well and 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:42.110
 there is a lot of noise but it works a lot 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:44.180
 well today the important point with this is 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.009
 that the time it's coming back to me 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.360
 a trend that is selling in 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:48.849
 bond uses some products are 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.520
 thinking about there being that kind of 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:54.710
 strategy look at the truth is that we are 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.650
 thinking a lot of things we are 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.539
 thinking from standalone that it 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.240
 sells itself we are just thinking about 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:04.039
 bonn doll the great advantage of the watch is 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.020
 who works with any android 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:08.689
 then we do not have it that we 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.810
 limit to only our portfolio what 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:13.779
 we can limit the universe so big 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.949
 of myroid and my competition 

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:18.409
 because it's a great experience me that what 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:20.689
 I've been using, I do not have to take out 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:22.219
 the work phone I know when I'm driving 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:22.849
 I am already in a meeting and nothing else I see of 

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:25.159
