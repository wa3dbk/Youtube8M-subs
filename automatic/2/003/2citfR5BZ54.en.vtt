you<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:14.070> I'd<00:02:14.520> better<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:14.970> talk<00:02:15.180> about<00:02:15.330> this

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
you know I'd better not talk about this

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.540 
you know I'd better not talk about this
anymore<00:02:15.930> because<00:02:16.590> what<00:02:16.920> I'm<00:02:17.040> really<00:02:17.340> doing

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
anymore because what I'm really doing

it<00:02:25.400> they<00:02:26.400> hole<00:02:26.610> up<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.910> watch<00:02:27.090> TV<00:02:27.300> they<00:02:28.140> drive

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
it they hole up and watch TV they drive

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.210

too<00:02:28.590> fast<00:02:28.770> they<00:02:29.040> drink<00:02:29.280> too<00:02:29.460> much<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:32.040> they

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
too fast they drink too much and they

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.710 
too fast they drink too much and they
express<00:02:32.490> their<00:02:32.670> depression<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> different

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
kind of way they I think should begin to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.240 
kind of way they I think should begin to
find<00:02:36.180> somebody<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.600> talk<00:02:37.140> more<00:02:37.470> about<00:02:37.740> it

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
find somebody to talk more about it

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
way I mean the brain is built for this

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
what I've gained what I've lost how to

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.610 
what I've gained what I've lost how to
move<00:03:26.040> on<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.810> lot<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.080> trouble<00:03:28.320> people
