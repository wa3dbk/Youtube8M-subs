love you g mall and the reason i was
standing<00:05:59.250> back<00:05:59.550> in<00:05:59.700> the<00:05:59.760> beginning<00:05:59.850> is

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
standing back in the beginning is

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.670 
standing back in the beginning is
because<00:06:00.450> i<00:06:00.630> didn't<00:06:00.870> know<00:06:00.930> she<00:06:00.960> had<00:06:01.200> a<00:06:01.350> granite

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
because i didn't know she had a granite

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.050 
because i didn't know she had a granite
mall<00:06:01.800> even<00:06:02.280> though<00:06:02.370> she<00:06:02.460> looked<00:06:02.700> like<00:06:02.790> a<00:06:02.820> nub

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
mall even though she looked like a nub

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.240 
mall even though she looked like a nub
which<00:06:03.420> she<00:06:03.750> kind<00:06:04.020> of<00:06:04.530> wasn't<00:06:04.710> risking<00:06:05.070> much

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
which she kind of wasn't risking much

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.370 
which she kind of wasn't risking much
but<00:06:05.970> hey<00:06:06.210> you<00:06:06.480> know<00:06:06.600> i<00:06:06.630> do<00:06:06.990> that<00:06:07.170> too<00:06:07.350> sometimes
