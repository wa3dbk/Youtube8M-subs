00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.580 
like you need right now and it's kind of
a<00:02:01.110> magic<00:02:01.469> question<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.789> it<00:02:03.600> forces<00:02:04.259> me<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
a magic question so that it forces me to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.109 
a magic question so that it forces me to
stop<00:02:04.979> Furman<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.429> think<00:02:05.700> about<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.090> I

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
stop Furman and think about what I

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.750 
stop Furman and think about what I
actually<00:02:06.390> need<00:02:06.959> to<00:02:07.530> feel<00:02:07.770> more<00:02:08.369> peaceful<00:02:08.929> and

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
actually need to feel more peaceful and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.089 
actually need to feel more peaceful and
verbalize<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.480> gives<00:02:13.140> me<00:02:13.440> pause<00:02:13.650> and

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
verbalize it so it gives me pause and

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.039 
verbalize it so it gives me pause and
then<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.370> gives<00:02:14.549> him<00:02:14.819> some<00:02:15.030> tangible<00:02:15.420> tools<00:02:15.750> so

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
then it gives him some tangible tools so

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.350 
then it gives him some tangible tools so
he<00:02:16.140> knows<00:02:16.290> what<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> do<00:02:16.769> because<00:02:17.010> he<00:02:17.459> loves<00:02:17.910> me

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
he knows what to do because he loves me

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.839 
he knows what to do because he loves me
and<00:02:18.660> he<00:02:18.750> wanted<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.769> do<00:02:20.010> something<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.519> help

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
and he wanted to do something to help

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.539 
and he wanted to do something to help
and<00:02:21.260> didn't<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.349> what<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.739> do<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.370> like

look at the broader picture of like

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.100 
look at the broader picture of like
maybe<00:04:15.000> even<00:04:15.180> going<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.690> worst-case

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
maybe even going to the worst-case

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.140 
maybe even going to the worst-case
scenario<00:04:16.500> what<00:04:17.190> happens<00:04:17.550> if<00:04:17.700> we<00:04:17.850> do<00:04:18.000> get

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
scenario what happens if we do get

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.940 
scenario what happens if we do get
married<00:04:18.360> in<00:04:18.720> your<00:04:18.870> time<00:04:19.140> frame<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.710> can't

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
are you gonna you know beat yourself up

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.370 
are you gonna you know beat yourself up
because<00:04:26.040> that'll<00:04:27.000> be<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.120> huge<00:04:27.450> stress<00:04:27.840> stress

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
because that'll be a huge stress stress

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.480 
because that'll be a huge stress stress
around<00:04:28.530> marriages<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.100> there's<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:29.400> many

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
around marriages and there's so many

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.790 
around marriages and there's so many
marriages<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:29.940> struggle<00:04:30.390> with<00:04:30.480> infertility

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
marriages that struggle with infertility

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.890 
marriages that struggle with infertility
so<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.220> think<00:04:32.610> her<00:04:32.880> character<00:04:33.390> will<00:04:33.540> come<00:04:33.720> out

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
so I think her character will come out

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.260 
so I think her character will come out
when<00:04:34.170> you<00:04:34.290> ask<00:04:34.560> her<00:04:34.860> like<00:04:35.100> let's<00:04:35.820> let's<00:04:36.060> go<00:04:36.180> to

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
when you ask her like let's let's go to

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.700 
when you ask her like let's let's go to
the<00:04:36.360> worst-case<00:04:36.720> scenario<00:04:37.170> here<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.440> just

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
the worst-case scenario here and just

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.080 
the worst-case scenario here and just
see<00:04:37.830> how<00:04:37.860> she<00:04:38.070> processes<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:38.910> think

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
see how she processes and I think

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.150 
see how she processes and I think
allowing<00:04:39.390> her<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.660> process<00:04:40.140> will<00:04:40.380> be<00:04:40.560> life

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
allowing her to process will be life

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.560 
allowing her to process will be life
hopefully<00:04:41.730> life-giving<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.330> her<00:04:42.420> unless

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
hopefully life-giving to her unless

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.470 
hopefully life-giving to her unless
she's<00:04:42.870> just<00:04:43.080> straight-up<00:04:43.320> psychotic<00:04:44.480> entire

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
she's just straight-up psychotic entire

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.180 
she's just straight-up psychotic entire
