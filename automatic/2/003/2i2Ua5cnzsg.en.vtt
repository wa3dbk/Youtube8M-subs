00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hi this is Peter and I'm gonna show you

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.369 
hi this is Peter and I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.110> use<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.859> vacuum<00:00:05.640> syringe<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:07.049> prime

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
how to use a vacuum syringe to prime

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.100 
how to use a vacuum syringe to prime
your<00:00:07.770> continuous<00:00:08.429> ink<00:00:08.670> system<00:00:09.019> when<00:00:10.019> you

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
your continuous ink system when you

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.720 
your continuous ink system when you
receive<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> continuous<00:00:11.010> ink<00:00:11.309> systems

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
receive a continuous ink systems

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.499 
receive a continuous ink systems
sometimes<00:00:12.599> you'll<00:00:13.469> receive<00:00:13.860> an<00:00:14.070> airline<00:00:14.580> such

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
sometimes you'll receive an airline such

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.230 
sometimes you'll receive an airline such
as<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.870> right<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.820> you<00:00:17.820> see<00:00:17.970> there's<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
as this right here you see there's a

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.380 
as this right here you see there's a
considerable<00:00:18.990> amount<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.910> air<00:00:20.910> bubbles<00:00:21.300> in

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
considerable amount of air bubbles in

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.130 
considerable amount of air bubbles in
this<00:00:21.539> line<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.140> which<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.689> hinder<00:00:24.689> your<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
this line so which can hinder your the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.830 
this line so which can hinder your the
performance<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.800> your<00:00:25.920> CIS<00:00:26.189> system<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.539> in

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
performance of your CIS system so in

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.679 
performance of your CIS system so in
order<00:00:28.080> for<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.429> if<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.970> you

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
order for you to do that and if you you

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.479 
order for you to do that and if you you
need<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.929> prime<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.380> system<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.399> you

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
need to prime your system and if you

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.459 
need to prime your system and if you
happen<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> vacuum<00:00:33.690> syringe<00:00:34.140> such<00:00:34.320> as

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
happen to have a vacuum syringe such as

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.580 
happen to have a vacuum syringe such as
this<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.829> yeah<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.809> would<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.380> will

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
this one yeah it's it would be it will

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.889 
this one yeah it's it would be it will
help<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.070> terminus<00:00:38.730> tremendously<00:00:39.570> as

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
help you all terminus tremendously as

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.850 
help you all terminus tremendously as
far<00:00:40.350> as<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> comes<00:00:40.890> down<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.329> priming<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.420> system

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
far as it comes down to priming a system

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.410 
far as it comes down to priming a system
how<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.010> vacuum<00:00:44.219> syringe<00:00:44.670> works<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.180> when<00:00:45.390> I

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
how this vacuum syringe works is when I

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.779 
how this vacuum syringe works is when I
draw<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.090> plunger<00:00:48.510> out<00:00:49.370> its<00:00:50.370> gonna<00:00:50.520> go

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
draw the the plunger out its gonna go

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.470 
draw the the plunger out its gonna go
ahead<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> draw<00:00:51.539> air<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.440> through<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.010> way

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
ahead and draw air in through this way

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.560 
ahead and draw air in through this way
but<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.690> push<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.230> back<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:56.420> it's<00:00:57.420> gonna

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
but when I push it back out it's gonna

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.840 
but when I push it back out it's gonna
shoot<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> air<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.649> push<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> air<00:00:59.820> out

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
shoot the air it push the air out

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.910 
shoot the air it push the air out
through<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.930> exhaust<00:01:01.260> from<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.710> different

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
through to and exhaust from a different

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.690 
through to and exhaust from a different
hole<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.930> gonna<00:01:04.080> help<00:01:04.260> us<00:01:04.519> prime<00:01:05.519> our

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
hole and that's gonna help us prime our

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.960 
hole and that's gonna help us prime our
system<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.530> by<00:01:07.530> inspecting<00:01:08.070> first<00:01:08.610> inspect

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
system so by inspecting first inspect

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.760 
system so by inspecting first inspect
your<00:01:09.090> CIS<00:01:09.479> systems<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.200> which<00:01:10.380> color<00:01:10.650> you

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
your CIS systems see which color you

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.260 
your CIS systems see which color you
need<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.299> prime<00:01:12.299> first<00:01:13.430> by<00:01:14.430> looking<00:01:14.820> at<00:01:14.939> here

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
need to prime first by looking at here

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.640 
need to prime first by looking at here
it<00:01:15.360> looks<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> prime<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
it looks like at the prime one of the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.130 
it looks like at the prime one of the
blacks<00:01:16.979> right<00:01:17.520> now<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> I'm<00:01:18.840> gonna<00:01:18.930> go<00:01:19.080> ahead

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
blacks right now so I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.499 
blacks right now so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.970> make<00:01:20.970> sure<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.240> some

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and do that make sure you have some

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.200 
and do that make sure you have some
napkins<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:22.020> handy<00:01:22.259> too<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.590> well<00:01:23.060> I'm<00:01:24.060> gonna

go ahead and first take out the big
plunger<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> CIS<00:01:29.009> system<00:01:29.659> it's<00:01:30.659> gonna<00:01:30.810> go

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
plunger for the CIS system it's gonna go

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.340 
plunger for the CIS system it's gonna go
in<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.200> wipe<00:01:31.610> down<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:33.780> area<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.229> it's

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
in a wipe down the this area so it's

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.609 
in a wipe down the this area so it's
clean<00:01:34.619> when<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> insert<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:35.460> vacuum<00:01:36.030> syringe

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.090 

okay<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.130> clean<00:01:44.939> enough<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> I'm<00:01:46.860> gonna<00:01:46.950> go

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
okay I was clean enough so I'm gonna go

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.530 
ahead and insert my vacuum syringe on
top<00:01:50.180> right<00:01:51.180> here<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:52.970> have<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.090> hold<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> with

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
top right here I have to hold it with

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.130 
top right here I have to hold it with
the<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.590> hand<00:01:55.830> just<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:57.020> there's<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the one hand just so it there's a

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.469 
the one hand just so it there's a
airtight<00:01:58.920> seal<00:01:59.460> right<00:01:59.700> here<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.030> when<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.180> start

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
airtight seal right here so when I start

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.580 
airtight seal right here so when I start
extracting<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.009> plunger<00:02:06.500> ain't<00:02:07.500> no

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
extracting the the plunger ain't no

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.669 
extracting the the plunger ain't no
problem<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> zoom<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.630> air<00:02:09.989> this

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
problem if you zoom in on this air this

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.410 
problem if you zoom in on this air this
ink<00:02:10.950> reservoir<00:02:11.430> here<00:02:11.640> you're<00:02:11.819> gonna<00:02:11.940> see<00:02:12.000> some

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
ink reservoir here you're gonna see some

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.820 
ink reservoir here you're gonna see some
bubbles<00:02:12.630> pop<00:02:12.989> up<00:02:13.230> bubble<00:02:13.680> up<00:02:13.950> as<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.550> do<00:02:14.610> this

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
bubbles pop up bubble up as I do this

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.910 
bubbles pop up bubble up as I do this
see<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.980> bubble<00:02:18.230> that's<00:02:19.230> actually<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.739> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
see that bubble that's actually that the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.960 
see that bubble that's actually that the
air<00:02:20.160> bubbles<00:02:20.640> from<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.120> line<00:02:21.299> popping<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:22.970> so

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
air bubbles from the line popping out so

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.809 
air bubbles from the line popping out so
I'm<00:02:24.060> gonna<00:02:24.299> push<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.380> plunger<00:02:25.680> back<00:02:25.950> down<00:02:26.160> and

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
I'm gonna push the plunger back down and

I'm gonna push the plunger back down and
extract<00:02:27.330> more<00:02:27.480> hair<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:28.040> know<00:02:29.040> see<00:02:29.190> more

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
extract more hair you know see more

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.660 
extract more hair you know see more
bubbles<00:02:29.640> pop<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:29.970> right<00:02:30.120> here<00:02:30.239> watch<00:02:31.670> see

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
bubbles pop up right here watch see

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.820 
bubbles pop up right here watch see
those<00:02:32.819> air<00:02:32.940> bubbles<00:02:33.290> it's<00:02:34.290> coming<00:02:34.560> out<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.739> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
those air bubbles it's coming out to the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.800 
those air bubbles it's coming out to the
top<00:02:37.220> I'm<00:02:38.220> gonna<00:02:38.370> keep<00:02:38.519> doing<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:38.940> one<00:02:39.660> more

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
top I'm gonna keep doing that one more

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.240 
top I'm gonna keep doing that one more
time

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
time

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.710 
time
terrible<00:02:43.130> go<00:02:44.130> ahead<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.459> pop<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.060> out<00:02:45.120> be

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
terrible go ahead and pop it out be

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.509 
terrible go ahead and pop it out be
careful<00:02:46.049> when<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.260> remove<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.890> vacuum

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
careful when you remove this vacuum

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.069 
careful when you remove this vacuum
syringe<00:02:47.970> because<00:02:48.060> right<00:02:48.690> now<00:02:48.840> there's

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
syringe because right now there's

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.750 
syringe because right now there's
parachute<00:02:49.560> built<00:02:49.769> up<00:02:49.980> into<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> system<00:02:50.640> right

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
parachute built up into the system right

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.400 
parachute built up into the system right
now<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:52.230> would<00:02:52.350> just<00:02:52.380> carefully<00:02:54.410> expose

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
now so you would just carefully expose

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.949 
now so you would just carefully expose
little<00:02:56.040> air<00:02:56.190> gaps<00:02:56.489> or<00:02:56.850> air<00:02:57.030> could<00:02:57.269> go<00:02:57.780> back

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
little air gaps or air could go back

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:05.809 
little air gaps or air could go back
into<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.350> system<00:03:00.890> like<00:03:01.890> that

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.559 

so<00:03:06.510> I'm<00:03:06.599> gonna<00:03:06.719> go<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:06.930> clean<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.230> up<00:03:08.360> as<00:03:09.360> you

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
so I'm gonna go and clean this up as you

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.319 
so I'm gonna go and clean this up as you
can<00:03:09.689> see<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.129> mean<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.219> CIS<00:03:11.549> system<00:03:11.849> it

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
can see I mean the CIS system it

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.759 
can see I mean the CIS system it
actually<00:03:12.420> pulled<00:03:12.900> all<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.230> air<00:03:13.349> bubbles<00:03:13.379> so

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
actually pulled all the air bubbles so

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.619 
actually pulled all the air bubbles so
we<00:03:13.859> can<00:03:14.099> allow<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.549> escape<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.390> shot

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
we can allow it to escape and the shot

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.229 
we can allow it to escape and the shot
ink<00:03:15.930> into<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.319> hosts<00:03:16.590> whole<00:03:16.920> line<00:03:17.189> so<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.090> you

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
ink into the hosts whole line so as you

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.289 
ink into the hosts whole line so as you
can<00:03:18.329> see<00:03:18.390> from<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.689> line<00:03:19.939> for<00:03:20.939> this<00:03:21.090> black

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
can see from the line for this black

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.759 
can see from the line for this black
line<00:03:21.510> right<00:03:21.659> here<00:03:21.900> it's<00:03:22.049> all<00:03:22.140> full<00:03:22.439> and<00:03:22.470> it's

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
line right here it's all full and it's

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.569 
line right here it's all full and it's
all<00:03:22.829> primed<00:03:23.159> with<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:24.510> black<00:03:24.689> cartridge<00:03:25.579> and

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
all primed with a black cartridge and

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.830 
all primed with a black cartridge and
the<00:03:27.540> black<00:03:27.720> cartridge<00:03:27.930> right<00:03:28.170> here<00:03:28.379> it's<00:03:28.980> full

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
the black cartridge right here it's full

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.240 
the black cartridge right here it's full
so<00:03:30.840> that's<00:03:31.019> how<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.200> use<00:03:31.439> a<00:03:31.470> back<00:03:31.739> mr.<00:03:32.099> Ainge

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
so that's how you use a back mr. Ainge

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.370 
so that's how you use a back mr. Ainge
and<00:03:33.049> well<00:03:34.049> for<00:03:34.319> your<00:03:34.409> continuous<00:03:34.889> ink<00:03:35.040> system
