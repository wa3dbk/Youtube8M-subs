the<00:02:08.879> rendering<00:02:09.300> speed<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.190> i'm<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.459> sure<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the rendering speed so i'm not sure the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.920 
the rendering speed so i'm not sure the
user<00:02:12.599> interface<00:02:12.840> differences<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.739> can

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
user interface differences you can

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.130 
user interface differences you can
see<00:02:14.049> them<00:02:14.260> here<00:02:14.409> this<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.859> version<00:02:15.069> 11<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.180> get

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
see them here this is version 11 and get

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.740 
see them here this is version 11 and get
a<00:02:17.170> good<00:02:17.379> look<00:02:17.530> at<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.359> this<00:02:19.359> is<00:02:19.510> version

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
a good look at that and this is version

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.470 
a good look at that and this is version
12<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.739> looks<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.340> operates<00:02:21.549> very

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
12 and it looks and operates very

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.509 
12 and it looks and operates very
similar<00:02:23.019> there's<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.290> slight<00:02:23.650> differences

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
similar there's a slight differences

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.490 
similar there's a slight differences

I've dragged and dropped the windows and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.160 
I've dragged and dropped the windows and

resized the various art panels in

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.369 
resized the various art panels in
different<00:02:30.040> ways<00:02:30.159> but<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.609> seems<00:02:30.849> to<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:32.260> know

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379

kilohertz 32-bit AAC audio 69 so we'll

just<00:03:24.099> call<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.979> EV<00:03:26.979> blog<00:03:27.220> 340<00:03:27.879> test<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.510> what

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
just call that EV blog 340 test and what

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.449 
just call that EV blog 340 test and what
i<00:03:28.870> want<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.199> do<00:03:29.379> is<00:03:29.620> I'm<00:03:30.040> going<00:03:30.159> to<00:03:30.220> use<00:03:30.430> a

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
i want to do is I'm going to use a

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.229 
i want to do is I'm going to use a
stopwatch<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.870> time<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.560> first<00:03:32.829> 1000<00:03:33.639> frames

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
stopwatch to time the first 1000 frames

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.839 
stopwatch to time the first 1000 frames
so<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:35.079> should<00:03:35.319> give<00:03:35.470> us<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.799> good<00:03:36.099> idea<00:03:36.310> how

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
so that should give us a good idea how

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.300 
so that should give us a good idea how
long<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.120> takes<00:03:37.359> to<00:03:37.540> encode<00:03:38.139> so<00:03:38.769> let's<00:03:39.010> render

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
long it takes to encode so let's render

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.860 
long it takes to encode so let's render
that<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:41.970> start<00:03:42.970> my<00:03:43.090> stop<00:03:43.359> watching<00:03:43.720> and

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
that and I start my stop watching and

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.439 
that and I start my stop watching and
see<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.199> frame<00:03:44.439> counter<00:03:44.889> going<00:03:45.819> up<00:03:45.970> just

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
see the frame counter going up just

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.289 
see the frame counter going up just
there<00:03:46.659> like<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.290> I'll<00:03:48.189> time<00:03:48.579> that<00:03:48.849> when

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
there like that and I'll time that when

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.420 
there like that and I'll time that when
it<00:03:49.419> gets<00:03:49.569> to<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.750> thousand<00:03:50.259> okay<00:03:50.949> that<00:03:51.220> took

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
it gets to a thousand okay that took

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.890 
it gets to a thousand okay that took
smack<00:03:51.849> on<00:03:52.030> 60<00:03:52.810> seconds<00:03:53.560> they're<00:03:53.829> so<00:03:54.400> nice<00:03:55.389> even

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
smack on 60 seconds they're so nice even

might<00:05:32.449> normalize<00:05:33.199> a<00:05:33.229> bit<00:05:33.650> of<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.860> sound<00:05:34.130> here

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
might normalize a bit of the sound here

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.939 
might normalize a bit of the sound here
and<00:05:34.669> there<00:05:34.849> in<00:05:35.090> each<00:05:35.419> ins<00:05:35.840> various<00:05:36.440> are<00:05:36.650> clips

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
and there in each ins various are clips

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.279 
and there in each ins various are clips
but<00:05:37.220> that's<00:05:37.699> about<00:05:38.000> all<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.780> way<00:05:38.840> out<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:39.020> it

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
but that's about all the way out to it

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.100 
but that's about all the way out to it
so<00:05:39.440> there<00:05:39.590> you<00:05:39.680> go<00:05:39.830> that<00:05:40.070> is<00:05:41.110> thirty-three

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
so there you go that is thirty-three

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.820 
so there you go that is thirty-three
percent<00:05:42.560> quicker<00:05:43.490> now<00:05:44.110> just<00:05:45.110> through<00:05:45.530> using

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
know that's a very measurable difference

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.550 
know that's a very measurable difference
in<00:06:48.520> rendering<00:06:49.520> speed<00:06:50.150> from<00:06:50.780> the<00:06:50.810> software<00:06:51.380> but

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
in rendering speed from the software but

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.310 
in rendering speed from the software but
I<00:06:51.680> do<00:06:51.740> a<00:06:51.890> two-part<00:06:52.820> rendering<00:06:53.360> rendering

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 
I do a two-part rendering rendering

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.470 
I do a two-part rendering rendering
process<00:06:54.740> and<00:06:55.220> i'll<00:06:55.460> do<00:06:55.940> another<00:06:55.970> video

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.480 
process and i'll do another video

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.920 
process and i'll do another video
actually<00:06:57.260> are<00:06:57.740> explaining<00:06:58.490> that<00:06:58.580> as<00:06:58.760> well<00:06:59.450> so

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
actually are explaining that as well so

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.800 
actually are explaining that as well so
there<00:07:00.290> you<00:07:00.380> go<00:07:00.440> the<00:07:01.220> new<00:07:01.370> version<00:07:01.580> 12<00:07:02.270> platinum

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
there you go the new version 12 platinum

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.310 
there you go the new version 12 platinum
is<00:07:03.200> definitely<00:07:04.160> quicker<00:07:04.880> the<00:07:05.300> 64-bit<00:07:05.990> version

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 
is definitely quicker the 64-bit version

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.400 
is definitely quicker the 64-bit version
then<00:07:06.500> version<00:07:07.070> 11<00:07:07.520> so<00:07:08.120> that<00:07:08.150> alone<00:07:08.690> I<00:07:08.900> think<00:07:09.260> is

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
then version 11 so that alone I think is

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.370 
then version 11 so that alone I think is
worth<00:07:10.010> the<00:07:10.190> upgrade<00:07:10.220> I'll<00:07:10.850> go<00:07:11.000> check<00:07:11.450> out<00:07:11.780> what

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
worth the upgrade I'll go check out what

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.680 
worth the upgrade I'll go check out what
other<00:07:12.620> new<00:07:13.040> features<00:07:13.070> and<00:07:13.760> bug<00:07:14.000> fixes<00:07:14.060> it

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
other new features and bug fixes it

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.540 
other new features and bug fixes it
might<00:07:14.990> have<00:07:15.230> and<00:07:15.530> I<00:07:15.650> will<00:07:16.090> process<00:07:17.090> this<00:07:17.960> video

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
might have and I will process this video

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.310 
might have and I will process this video
using<00:07:19.550> the<00:07:19.670> new<00:07:19.820> version<00:07:20.060> 12<00:07:20.540> using<00:07:21.170> my
