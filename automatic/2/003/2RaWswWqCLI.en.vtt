got on this long-tailed McLaren it is it
is<00:00:56.989> I<00:00:57.170> think<00:00:57.410> this<00:00:57.560> is<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.980> development<00:00:58.640> car

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
is I think this is the development car

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.240 
is I think this is the development car
that<00:00:59.270> McLaren<00:00:59.780> used<00:01:00.110> for<00:01:00.380> when<00:01:00.620> they<00:01:00.739> did<00:01:01.100> this

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.350 
so kenny brack ended up in third place
but<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.310> was<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.430> great<00:03:18.580> battle<00:03:18.760> with<00:03:19.000> michael

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
but it was a great battle with michael

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.300 
but it was a great battle with michael
bottles<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:20.020> maybe<00:03:20.590> no<00:03:20.770> one<00:03:20.920> could<00:03:21.100> have<00:03:21.190> got

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
bottles and maybe no one could have got

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.280 
bottles and maybe no one could have got
close<00:03:21.490> to<00:03:21.640> Sebastien<00:03:22.090> Loeb<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.570> don't<00:03:23.020> think<00:03:23.200> I

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
close to Sebastien Loeb I don't think I

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.290 
close to Sebastien Loeb I don't think I
could<00:03:23.470> go<00:03:23.590> get<00:03:23.830> close<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.430> any<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.730> them<00:03:24.880> but<00:03:25.060> it

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
could go get close to any of them but it

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.560 
could go get close to any of them but it
