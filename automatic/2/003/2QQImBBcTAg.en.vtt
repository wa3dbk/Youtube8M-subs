00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
here to remove the memory module you

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.289 
here to remove the memory module you
slide<00:00:50.030> these<00:00:50.239> clips<00:00:50.570> out<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:53.030> memory

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
slide these clips out and the memory

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.810 
slide these clips out and the memory
module<00:00:53.690> will<00:00:54.049> slide<00:00:54.290> up<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:54.739> 45<00:00:55.640> degree

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
module will slide up to a 45 degree

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.410 
module will slide up to a 45 degree
angle<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:57.220> move<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.369> to<00:00:58.729> remove<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.210> memory

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
angle to move the to remove the memory

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.890 
angle to move the to remove the memory
you<00:00:59.930> pull<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.260> memory<00:01:00.530> straight<00:01:00.949> out<00:01:01.159> and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
you pull the memory straight out and

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.830 
you pull the memory straight out and
pull<00:01:02.900> it<00:01:02.930> out<00:01:03.140> of<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:03.290> machine<00:01:04.600> next<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:05.659> take

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
pull it out of the machine next you take

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.240 
pull it out of the machine next you take
a<00:01:05.869> new<00:01:06.170> memory<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.750> line<00:01:08.750> up<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.200> notches<00:01:09.830> in

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
a new memory and line up the notches in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.249 
a new memory and line up the notches in
the<00:01:10.369> memory<00:01:10.700> with<00:01:11.509> the<00:01:11.600> matches<00:01:11.960> in<00:01:12.140> the

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
the memory with the matches in the

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.099 
the memory with the matches in the
memory<00:01:12.560> socket<00:01:13.450> you'll<00:01:14.450> install<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.960> memory

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
memory socket you'll install the memory

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.459 
memory socket you'll install the memory
at<00:01:15.380> about<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.619> 45<00:01:16.159> degree<00:01:16.310> angle<00:01:17.320> pressing<00:01:18.320> them

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
at about a 45 degree angle pressing them

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.239 
at about a 45 degree angle pressing them
in<00:01:18.649> until<00:01:18.890> they<00:01:19.189> snap<00:01:19.700> into<00:01:19.909> place<00:01:21.100> then<00:01:22.100> you

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:22.249
