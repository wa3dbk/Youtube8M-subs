00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.160 
really know if they're both working
together<00:00:29.279> or<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:30.240> card<00:00:30.510> taking<00:00:30.900> all<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
video card 1 in video card - I believe

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.349 
video card 1 in video card - I believe
that's<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.109> order<00:00:58.500> top<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.550> bottom<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
that's the order top and bottom but you

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.250 
that's the order top and bottom but you
never<00:01:00.539> know<00:01:00.780> right

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
never know right

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.070 
never know right
but<00:01:02.129> anyway<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:02.969> want<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.329> check<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
but anyway so now we want to check that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.600 
but anyway so now we want to check that
load<00:01:04.260> within<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.250> game<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.720> maximizes<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.159> SLI

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
load within a game the maximizes the SLI

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.770 
load within a game the maximizes the SLI
so<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.630> I'm<00:01:09.750> just

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
so what I'm going to do is I'm just

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.990 
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
gonna<00:01:09.960> load<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.850> game<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.590> kind<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.680> strike

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
gonna load a game of kind of strike

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.770 
gonna load a game of kind of strike
against<00:01:15.000> spots<00:01:17.270> because<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.390> don't<00:01:18.570> need<00:01:18.630> to

in fact is the visual SLI indicator in
action<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.310> game<00:01:51.229> really<00:01:52.229> quick

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
action for a game really quick

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.200 
action for a game really quick
I<00:01:52.710> didn't<00:01:53.220> get<00:01:53.310> mine<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.700> show<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.000> right<00:01:54.149> away

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
I didn't get mine to show up right away

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.280 
I didn't get mine to show up right away
until<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.689> closed<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.320> game<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.149> then

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
until I closed the game and then

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.929 
until I closed the game and then
restarted<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.100> might<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.850> do

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
restarted it so you might have to do

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.660 
restarted it so you might have to do
that<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.299> make<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> work<00:02:00.750> properly<00:02:01.100> but<00:02:02.100> really

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
that to make it work properly but really

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.800 
that to make it work properly but really
quick<00:02:02.850> let's<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.390> test<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:05.790> couple<00:02:06.570> of

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:17.030 

couple<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.900> BOTS<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.370> see<00:02:15.980> how<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
couple of BOTS here you can see how the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.150 
couple of BOTS here you can see how the
cards<00:02:17.490> are<00:02:17.610> evenly<00:02:18.650> receiving<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:21.660> load

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
cards are evenly receiving the load

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.250 
cards are evenly receiving the load
necessary<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.400> load<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.760> up<00:02:23.960> let's<00:02:24.960> do<00:02:25.140> it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260
