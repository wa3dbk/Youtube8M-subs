00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.360 

so<00:00:04.500> there's<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.950> instrument<00:00:05.430> cluster<00:00:07.370> that's

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
so there's the instrument cluster that's

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.080 
so there's the instrument cluster that's
what<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.590> headlight<00:00:10.590> housing<00:00:10.820> looks<00:00:11.820> like

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
what the headlight housing looks like

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.470 
what the headlight housing looks like
when<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.509> instrument<00:00:12.719> clusters<00:00:13.200> removed

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
when the instrument clusters removed

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.779 
when the instrument clusters removed
this<00:00:15.480> plugs<00:00:15.809> into<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.650> back<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
this plugs into the back of the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.519 
this plugs into the back of the
instrument<00:00:18.090> cluster<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.869> got<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> rubber

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
instrument cluster it's got a rubber

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.849 
instrument cluster it's got a rubber
seal<00:00:20.130> around<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.640> these<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:22.590> this

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
seal around it these as you can see this

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.460 
seal around it these as you can see this
is<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.519> adjusting<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.869> tilt<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
is for adjusting that the tilt of the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.880 
is for adjusting that the tilt of the
headlights<00:00:25.859> or<00:00:26.480> dial<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.740> a

here<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.219> some<00:00:50.399> zap<00:00:50.700> straps<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.660> this

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
here there are some zap straps like this

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.069 
here there are some zap straps like this
one<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:53.370> some<00:00:53.520> others<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.539> now<00:00:55.050> you

rubbing<00:00:56.940> against<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.899> faring<00:00:58.550> or<00:00:59.550> you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
rubbing against the the faring or you

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
rubbing against the the faring or you
gonna<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.210> vibration<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:00.870> well<00:01:01.129> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
gonna get that vibration as well and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.939 
gonna get that vibration as well and
some<00:01:02.399> people<00:01:02.699> they'll<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.680> put<00:01:04.680> some

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
some people they'll actually put some

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.330 
some people they'll actually put some
some<00:01:05.640> gorilla<00:01:06.270> tape<00:01:06.540> around<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.170> outside<00:01:07.950> or

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
some gorilla tape around the outside or

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.240 
some gorilla tape around the outside or
the<00:01:08.640> backing<00:01:08.880> backing<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.320> where<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
the backing backing in there where the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.590 
the backing backing in there where the
seal<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:13.610> sort<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:17.210> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> back<00:01:18.570> here

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
seal is sort of see in the back here

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.499 
seal is sort of see in the back here
right<00:01:19.530> around<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.950> outer<00:01:20.130> let<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:21.299> around

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
right around the outer let right around

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.690 
right around the outer let right around
the<00:01:21.600> outer<00:01:21.750> edge<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.009> see<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.540> there

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
the outer edge you can see there there

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.910 
the outer edge you can see there there
there<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:26.850> hooks<00:01:27.200> yeah<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.439> too<00:01:28.590> hard<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
there are hooks yeah it's too hard to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.780 
there are hooks yeah it's too hard to
see<00:01:29.810> there<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> whole<00:01:31.170> bunch<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.470> hooks

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
see there are a whole bunch of hooks

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.420 
see there are a whole bunch of hooks
underneath<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.710> mount<00:01:35.400> points<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
underneath the the mount points for the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.819 
underneath the the mount points for the
for<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> fairings<00:01:38.880> are<00:01:39.799> down<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
for the fairings are down in here and

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.899 
for the fairings are down in here and
there<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> instrument<00:01:44.460> cluster<00:01:44.520> rather

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
there for the instrument cluster rather

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.319 
there for the instrument cluster rather
and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:47.820> are<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.000> bunch<00:01:48.210> of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and then and then there are a bunch of

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.639 
and then and then there are a bunch of
hook<00:01:49.170> points<00:01:49.820> all<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.119> around<00:01:51.689> actually

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
hook points all the way around actually

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.050 
hook points all the way around actually
you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:52.979> see<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> owners<00:01:53.579> manual<00:01:53.729> they

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you can see it in the owners manual they

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.969 
you can see it in the owners manual they
outline<00:01:54.360> where<00:01:55.320> they<00:01:55.439> are<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.680> everything

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
outline where they are and everything

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.830 
outline where they are and everything
just<00:01:56.670> make<00:01:56.909> sure<00:01:57.030> everything<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.390> heated<00:01:57.750> in

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
just make sure everything is heated in

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
just make sure everything is heated in
there<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.140> well<00:01:58.350> you're<00:01:58.829> paranoid<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
there really well you're paranoid you

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.569 
there really well you're paranoid you
can<00:01:59.850> run<00:02:00.030> some<00:02:00.360> gorilla<00:02:01.170> tape<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:02.040> wouldn't<00:02:02.460> use

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
can run some gorilla tape I wouldn't use

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.609 
can run some gorilla tape I wouldn't use
electrical<00:02:03.030> tapes<00:02:03.210> not<00:02:03.450> thick<00:02:03.689> enough<00:02:03.899> duct

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
electrical tapes not thick enough duct

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.520 
electrical tapes not thick enough duct
tape<00:02:04.860> or<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> black<00:02:05.520> gorilla<00:02:06.060> duct<00:02:06.509> tape<00:02:06.750> would

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
tape or a black gorilla duct tape would

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.700 
tape or a black gorilla duct tape would
work<00:02:07.649> pretty<00:02:07.860> well<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.819> then

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
work pretty well for that and then

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.240 
work pretty well for that and then
and<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:11.090> can<00:02:11.270> probably<00:02:11.770> bet<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:13.010> you're<00:02:13.100> not

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and you can probably bet that you're not

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.600 
and you can probably bet that you're not
going<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.430> have<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:13.670> vibration<00:02:14.210> anymore
