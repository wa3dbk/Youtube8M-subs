00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:10.889
 three cylinders upside down the revolution 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.049
 it is called nembo 32 this bike that to the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.610
 moment is still a few prototype 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.460
 motorcycling has tried a preview 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.850
 world advances solutions 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.519
 interesting and innovative mechanics 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.640
 engines first named super 32 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.210
 reverse it is a three-cylinder of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.110
 nearly 2,000 cc air-cooled and with 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.620
 single-shaft distribution on head la 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.000
 peculiarity of being above 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.760
 allows substantial centralization 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.730
 of the flywheel masses ie crankshaft 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.840
 with plates or change that come to 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.340
 find very close to the rider's body 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.940
 the theoretical advantages of this solution 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.969
 the part is manifold first 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.199
 more solid than the motor, ie the base 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.989
 acts as an element stressed by 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.199
 chassis by reducing the chassis to just a few 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.060
 steel tubes the reversal of the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.159
 engine allows you to use a 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.430
 swingarm in this case in fiber 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 very long carbon thus improving the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.670
 traction the cylinders thus turned are 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.830
 completely exposed to the air 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 optimizing cooling 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.310
 finally this architecture allows to 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.310
 raise the displacement a lot 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.370
 obtaining relevant performance without 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.890
 stress the mechanics 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.980
 in fact we talk about 200 horses of 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.230
 power and over 190 newton meters of 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.560
 maximum torque 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.290
 but dynamically how it works a lot 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.540
 well we have to admit we tried 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.980
 the nimbus 32 on the track and we have it 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.980
 made pleasant sensations 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.220
 the engine with a lot of torque from the most 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.320
 low rpm is elastic and done 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.409
 except for a hinton irregularity e 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.360
 2,500 rpm due to a mapping from 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.360
 final and also linear 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.560
 all 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.070
 in the curves the bike is rather 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.720
 manageable and quick even in the changes of 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.030
 direction 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.890
 excellent traction on exit of curve e 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.320
 the stability known painful the price there 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.980
 nembo 32 will be built only on 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.340
 commission and will cost the beauty of 320 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.340
 thousand euros
