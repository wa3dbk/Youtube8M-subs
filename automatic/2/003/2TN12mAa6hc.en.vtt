alright<00:00:05.940> let<00:00:06.089> me<00:00:06.150> demonstrate<00:00:06.560> mending<00:00:07.560> with

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
alright let me demonstrate mending with

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.770 
alright let me demonstrate mending with
an<00:00:07.830> indicator<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.490> nymphs<00:00:08.790> Marianne<00:00:09.510> talked

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
an indicator and nymphs Marianne talked

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.499 
an indicator and nymphs Marianne talked
about<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.400> the<00:00:11.400> objectives<00:00:11.940> with<00:00:12.090> dry<00:00:12.269> fly

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
about the the objectives with dry fly

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.650 
about the the objectives with dry fly
mending<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.679> mend<00:00:13.920> line<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.880> can<00:00:15.089> take

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
mending you can mend line you can take

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.779 
mending you can mend line you can take
in<00:00:15.839> line<00:00:16.049> feed<00:00:16.470> line<00:00:16.710> out<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:17.670> raise

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
in line feed line out and you can raise

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.880 
in line feed line out and you can raise
and<00:00:17.970> lower<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.180> rod<00:00:18.420> tip<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.650> nymph

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and lower your rod tip and with nymph

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.560 
and lower your rod tip and with nymph
fishing<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:20.369> fairly<00:00:20.670> similar<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.210> use<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
fishing it's fairly similar you use a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.420 
fishing it's fairly similar you use a
lot<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> same<00:00:22.170> kind<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> practices<00:00:23.010> but

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
lot of the same kind of practices but

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.500 
lot of the same kind of practices but
there's<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.699> few<00:00:23.850> things<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.240> are<00:00:24.330> different

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
there's a few things that are different

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.240 
there's a few things that are different
to<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.350> let<00:00:25.470> me<00:00:25.560> demonstrate<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
to it so let me demonstrate it to you a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.820 
to it so let me demonstrate it to you a
few<00:00:26.400> things<00:00:26.580> for<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.939> here<00:00:27.500> so<00:00:28.500> we're<00:00:28.710> gonna

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
few things for you here so we're gonna

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.700 
few things for you here so we're gonna
cast<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.340> we've<00:00:29.519> got<00:00:29.550> an<00:00:29.760> indicator<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.449> there

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
cast out we've got an indicator on there

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.260 
cast out we've got an indicator on there
flies<00:00:31.710> are<00:00:31.920> down<00:00:32.070> about<00:00:32.340> five<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.759> six<00:00:32.880> feet<00:00:33.120> in

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
flies are down about five or six feet in

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.440 
flies are down about five or six feet in
this<00:00:33.390> case<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.820> indicator<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.390> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
this case and the indicator is going to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.670 
this case and the indicator is going to
drift<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> speed<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.260> current<00:00:37.469> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
drift at the speed of the current you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.619 
drift at the speed of the current you
just<00:00:37.860> kind<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.070> let<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.250> go<00:00:38.629> if<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.870> use

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
just kind of let it go if you use

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.580 
just kind of let it go if you use
techniques<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.690> Marianne<00:00:43.050> talked<00:00:43.350> about

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
techniques that Marianne talked about

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.860 
techniques that Marianne talked about
earlier<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.090> mend<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> line<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> little

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
earlier we can mend the line a little

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.360 
earlier we can mend the line a little
bit<00:00:46.110> look<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.680> straight<00:00:46.950> line<00:00:47.160> between

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
bit look for that straight line between

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.569 
bit look for that straight line between
your<00:00:47.610> indicator<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.390> rod<00:00:48.570> tip<00:00:49.579> maybe

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
your indicator and your rod tip maybe

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.369 
your indicator and your rod tip maybe
you<00:00:50.730> want<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> downstream<00:00:51.899> end<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.289> an

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you want to do a downstream end or an

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.529 
you want to do a downstream end or an
upstream<00:00:52.739> end<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.730> get<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> good<00:00:54.120> drift<00:00:54.420> of

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
upstream end to get a good drift of

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.529 
upstream end to get a good drift of
those<00:00:54.660> nibs<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> easy<00:00:56.760> way<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> man<00:00:57.300> is

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
those nibs so the easy way to man is

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.500 
those nibs so the easy way to man is
follow<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> same<00:00:58.370> practices<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.640> dry<00:01:00.270> fly

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
follow the same practices as dry fly

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.189 
follow the same practices as dry fly
mending<00:01:01.039> get<00:01:02.039> your<00:01:02.219> indicator<00:01:02.730> out<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.199> do

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
mending get your indicator out there do

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.050 
mending get your indicator out there do
an<00:01:04.320> upstream<00:01:04.680> end<00:01:04.979> or<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.519> downstream

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
an upstream end or a downstream

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.120 
an upstream end or a downstream
whichever<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.540> appropriate<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.770> feed

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
whichever is appropriate you can feed

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.190 
whichever is appropriate you can feed
line<00:01:08.340> out<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.390> raise<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> rail<00:01:09.990> lower

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
line out you can raise the rail lower

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
line out you can raise the rail lower
the<00:01:10.380> rod<00:01:10.560> tip<00:01:10.860> whatever<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> feel

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the rod tip whatever you feel

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
the rod tip whatever you feel
comfortable<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.510> use<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> best<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
comfortable with use the best kind of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.280 
comfortable with use the best kind of
technique<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> works<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:16.049> there's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
technique that works for you now there's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.539 
technique that works for you now there's
a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.530> more<00:01:16.740> advanced<00:01:17.159> technique

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
a little bit more advanced technique

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.789 
a little bit more advanced technique
where<00:01:18.360> instead<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.930> mending<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> line

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
where instead of just mending the line

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.499 
where instead of just mending the line
we're<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> move<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> indicator<00:01:21.090> itself

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
we're going to move the indicator itself

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.990 
we're going to move the indicator itself
to<00:01:21.720> not<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> Flies<00:01:22.470> put<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> indicator<00:01:23.159> let's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
to not the Flies put the indicator let's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.120 
to not the Flies put the indicator let's
call<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> stack<00:01:24.540> men<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.799> need<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> little

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
call a stack men and you need a little

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.679 
call a stack men and you need a little
bit<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.340> slack<00:01:26.549> light<00:01:26.820> relying<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
bit of slack light relying right here to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.510 
bit of slack light relying right here to
do<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.229> couple<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.950> feet<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.250> usually

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
do this a couple of feet is usually

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.020 
do this a couple of feet is usually
about<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> normal<00:01:31.350> cast<00:01:31.939> get<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
about right you do a normal cast get it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
about right you do a normal cast get it
out<00:01:33.180> there<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:33.960> we're<00:01:34.110> gonna<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
out there then we're gonna like do a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.469 
out there then we're gonna like do a
little<00:01:35.159> flip<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> line<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
little flip of the line like this and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.300 
little flip of the line like this and
what<00:01:36.869> we're<00:01:36.960> gonna<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> get

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
what we're gonna do is it's going to get

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.050 
what we're gonna do is it's going to get
all<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> line<00:01:38.729> behind<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.240> indicator<00:01:39.750> and

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
all the line behind the indicator and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.340 
all the line behind the indicator and
hopefully<00:01:42.060> get<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> indicator<00:01:42.750> behind<00:01:43.170> where

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
hopefully get the indicator behind where

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.530 
hopefully get the indicator behind where
the<00:01:43.470> flies<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:44.009> when<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> cast<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.299> flies

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the flies are when you cast the flies

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
the flies are when you cast the flies
are<00:01:45.780> straight<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.470> line<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
are straight out in line with the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.710 
are straight out in line with the
indicator<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:47.909> want<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.149> indicator<00:01:48.479> straight

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
indicator we want the indicator straight

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.200 
indicator we want the indicator straight
above<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.170> flies<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.399> cast<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.030> help

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
above the flies so this cast is to help

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.770 
above the flies so this cast is to help
with<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> little<00:01:52.350> bit<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.530> slack<00:01:53.780> do

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
with that get a little bit of slack do

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.010 
with that get a little bit of slack do
your<00:01:54.960> cast<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.820> little<00:01:56.820> bit<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:56.969> slack<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.149> do

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
your cast a little bit of slack here do

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.679 
your cast a little bit of slack here do
a<00:01:58.049> flip<00:01:58.320> cast<00:01:58.590> like<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.460> our<00:02:00.090> goal<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.329> to

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
a flip cast like that and our goal is to

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.810 
a flip cast like that and our goal is to
just<00:02:01.049> move<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.500> line<00:02:01.829> behind<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> indicator

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
just move that line behind the indicator

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.639 
just move that line behind the indicator
move<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> indicator<00:02:03.450> back<00:02:04.110> upstream<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
move the indicator back upstream a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.709 
move the indicator back upstream a
little<00:02:04.950> bit<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.850> if<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> good<00:02:06.509> one

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
little bit see if I can do a good one

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.170 
little bit see if I can do a good one
here<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:09.649> takes<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.739> lot<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.860> practice

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
here for you takes a lot of practice

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.720 
here for you takes a lot of practice
now<00:02:12.569> we'll<00:02:13.230> flip<00:02:13.439> cast<00:02:13.769> now<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.370> indicator

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
now we'll flip cast now that indicator

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.449 
now we'll flip cast now that indicator
what<00:02:14.819> way<00:02:15.030> behind<00:02:15.450> now<00:02:16.079> it's<00:02:16.319> flies<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.220> drop

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
what way behind now it's flies can drop

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.789 
what way behind now it's flies can drop
down<00:02:17.610> really<00:02:17.970> fast<00:02:18.269> because<00:02:19.079> that<00:02:19.319> indicator

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
down really fast because that indicator

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.550 
down really fast because that indicator
is<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:19.980> affecting<00:02:20.519> them<00:02:20.670> at<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:21.019> it's<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.230> this

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
is not affecting them at all it's a this

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.009 
is not affecting them at all it's a this
stack<00:02:22.980> man<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> little<00:02:24.420> bit<00:02:24.629> more<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.900> an

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
stack man is a little bit more of an

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.270 
stack man is a little bit more of an
advanced<00:02:25.349> one<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.769> does<00:02:25.920> take<00:02:26.129> practice

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
advanced one and it does take practice

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.319 
advanced one and it does take practice
but<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.780> way<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.989> get<00:02:28.290> even<00:02:28.560> better

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
but it's a way to get even better

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.750 
but it's a way to get even better
drifting<00:02:30.329> of<00:02:30.510> nymphs<00:02:31.109> when<00:02:31.290> you're<00:02:31.409> fishing

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
drifting of nymphs when you're fishing

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.089 
drifting of nymphs when you're fishing
little<00:02:32.760> slack<00:02:33.379> get<00:02:34.379> that<00:02:34.530> indicator<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
little slack get that indicator to

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.740 
little slack get that indicator to
bounce<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.459> out<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.790> water<00:02:36.000> if<00:02:36.569> you're

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
bounce up out of the water if you're

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.330 
bounce up out of the water if you're
fishing<00:02:37.079> heavy<00:02:37.260> nymphs<00:02:37.620> they'll<00:02:37.799> stay<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
fishing heavy nymphs they'll stay in the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.099 
fishing heavy nymphs they'll stay in the
water<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:39.180> don't<00:02:39.329> have<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.510> worry<00:02:39.689> about<00:02:39.810> them

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
water you don't have to worry about them

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.839 
water you don't have to worry about them
moving<00:02:40.319> at<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:40.739> then<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.489> can<00:02:41.640> mend<00:02:41.819> your

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
moving at all then you can mend your

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.629 
moving at all then you can mend your
line<00:02:42.090> normal<00:02:42.569> as<00:02:43.079> you<00:02:43.349> would<00:02:43.560> as<00:02:44.159> you<00:02:44.370> follow

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
line normal as you would as you follow

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.810 
line normal as you would as you follow
your<00:02:44.879> indicator<00:02:45.239> downstream
