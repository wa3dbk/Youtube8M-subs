00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
for a while I thought that this is this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.070 
for a while I thought that this is this
since<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> pokemen<00:00:15.389> related

long<00:01:25.439> long<00:01:25.710> time<00:01:25.860> ago<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.840> here<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.290> we

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
long long time ago and here you think we

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.090 
long long time ago and here you think we
have<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> pokewalker<00:01:30.439> I'm<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.770> sure<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
have is the pokewalker I'm not sure if I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.940 
have is the pokewalker I'm not sure if I
was<00:01:32.220> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.490> use<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.470> but<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> still

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
I think if they step on and click on to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.450 
I think if they step on and click on to
