00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
thought about and I thought well because

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
thought about and I thought well because
the<00:01:02.210> prospect<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.690> wrap<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.930> around

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the prospect of if you wrap it around

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.719 
the prospect of if you wrap it around
like<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:05.090> then<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.460> move<00:01:08.460> around

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
like this then it's going to move around

anything about the tape that tapes a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.719 
anything about the tape that tapes a
great<00:01:36.420> idea<00:01:37.159> that's<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.520> greatest

to<00:02:09.020> not<00:02:10.020> having<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> lot<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.440> resources<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.340> if

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
to not having a lot of resources and if

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.760 
to not having a lot of resources and if
you<00:02:12.120> were<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.300> have

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you were to have

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.140 
you were to have
at<00:02:14.160> least<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.610> way<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.820> have<00:02:15.120> my

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
at least this is the way I have my

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.260 
at least this is the way I have my
disaster<00:02:15.990> bank<00:02:16.530> setup<00:02:16.950> if<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.910> were<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.090> have

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
disaster bank setup if you were to have

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.100 
disaster bank setup if you were to have
bleach<00:02:18.960> in<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:20.130> water<00:02:20.340> bottle

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
bleach in a water bottle

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.190 
bleach in a water bottle
watch<00:02:22.110> her<00:02:22.290> bottle<00:02:22.680> then<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.930> you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
watch her bottle then you know and you

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.810 
watch her bottle then you know and you
have<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.380> cloth<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.800> some<00:02:26.010> sort<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.310> can<00:02:26.490> siphon

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
have a cloth of some sort you can siphon

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.270 
have a cloth of some sort you can siphon
out<00:02:27.060> some<00:02:27.300> clear<00:02:28.080> out<00:02:28.200> some<00:02:28.350> filter<00:02:28.920> out<00:02:29.040> some

out some clear out some filter out some

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
out some clear out some filter out some
sediment<00:02:30.000> you're<00:02:30.840> pretty<00:02:31.020> good<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> go

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
sediment you're pretty good to go

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.030 
sediment you're pretty good to go
whereas<00:02:33.300> if<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.570> had<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> metal<00:02:33.990> one<00:02:34.170> number

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
whereas if you had a metal one number

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.220 
whereas if you had a metal one number
one<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.550> know<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.820> devised<00:02:36.090> something<00:02:36.480> it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
one you know that devised something it

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.490 
one you know that devised something it
to<00:02:37.350> find<00:02:37.560> some<00:02:37.800> kind<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.690> tape<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:40.110> wrap<00:02:40.230> around

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
to find some kind of tape to wrap around

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.920 
to find some kind of tape to wrap around
the<00:02:40.560> top<00:02:40.710> type<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.070> paracord<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:42.270> drop<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.840> in

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the top type of paracord to drop it in

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.180 
the top type of paracord to drop it in
and<00:02:43.020> get<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.320> water<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.740> you're<00:02:43.860> gonna<00:02:43.950> do

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
and get the water if you're gonna do

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.370 
and get the water if you're gonna do
that<00:02:44.340> which<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:44.970> found<00:02:45.180> some<00:02:45.480> tape<00:02:45.720> that's<00:02:45.930> 400

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
that which I found some tape that's 400

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.290 
that which I found some tape that's 400
degrees<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.980> think<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.370> silicon<00:02:47.820> tape<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
degrees I think it's silicon tape and

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.840 
degrees I think it's silicon tape and
I've<00:02:49.110> actually<00:02:49.230> been<00:02:49.410> debating<00:02:49.860> about<00:02:49.980> making

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
I've actually been debating about making

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.790 
I've actually been debating about making
something<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.080> seeing<00:02:52.260> how<00:02:52.410> holds

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
something like that and seeing how holds

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.340 
something like that and seeing how holds
up<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.190> campfire<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.790> all<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.200> since<00:02:55.200> up

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
up to the campfire and all that since up

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.800 
up to the campfire and all that since up
here<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.650> not<00:02:55.800> direct<00:02:56.300> down<00:02:57.300> here<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.630> more

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
here is not direct down here is more

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.130 
here is not direct down here is more
direct<00:02:58.110> Heat

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
direct Heat

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.080 
direct Heat
but<00:03:01.140> you'd<00:03:01.350> have<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.590> create<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.860> fire<00:03:02.100> which<00:03:02.580> if

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
but you'd have to create a fire which if

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.120 
but you'd have to create a fire which if
you<00:03:03.210> read<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.510> book<00:03:03.690> you'd<00:03:04.020> know<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.260> he

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
you read the book you'd know that he

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.810 
you read the book you'd know that he
explains<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.790> as<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> complex<00:03:06.890> skill<00:03:07.890> versus

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
explains it as a complex skill versus

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.750 
explains it as a complex skill versus
something<00:03:09.090> simple<00:03:09.600> as<00:03:10.220> tying<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.340> knot<00:03:11.490> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
something simple as tying a knot and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.290 
something simple as tying a knot and
dropping<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.870> down<00:03:12.900> getting<00:03:13.440> water<00:03:13.770> and

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
dropping it down getting water and

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.050 
dropping it down getting water and
dropping<00:03:15.300> some<00:03:15.690> bleach<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.800> which<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.520> kinda

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
dropping some bleach in which I kinda

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.900 
dropping some bleach in which I kinda
would<00:03:18.240> say<00:03:18.950> dropping<00:03:19.950> some<00:03:20.250> drops<00:03:20.520> of<00:03:20.700> bleach

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
would say dropping some drops of bleach

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.410 
would say dropping some drops of bleach
into<00:03:21.830> water<00:03:22.830> actually<00:03:23.340> getting<00:03:23.580> drops<00:03:24.000> might

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
into water actually getting drops might

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.080 
into water actually getting drops might
be<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.630> complex<00:03:25.910> motor<00:03:26.910> skill<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:29.790> could<00:03:29.940> be<00:03:30.000> to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
be a complex motor skill it could be to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.510 
be a complex motor skill it could be to
be<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.300> its<00:03:30.420> finer<00:03:30.660> complex<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.320> either<00:03:31.590> way<00:03:31.800> a

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
be of its finer complex but either way a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.060 
be of its finer complex but either way a
few<00:03:33.510> drops<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.840> bleach<00:03:33.990> into<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.890> lot

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
few drops of bleach into this is a lot

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.440 
few drops of bleach into this is a lot
simpler<00:03:35.400> than<00:03:35.550> creating<00:03:36.240> a<00:03:36.300> fire<00:03:36.540> for<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:38.450> so

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
simpler than creating a fire for this so

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.050 
simpler than creating a fire for this so
there<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.370> other<00:03:41.550> thing<00:03:41.790> with<00:03:41.910> this

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
there is that the other thing with this

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.460 
there is that the other thing with this
water<00:03:42.330> bottle<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:44.480> it's<00:03:45.480> gonna<00:03:45.660> last<00:03:45.930> forever

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
water bottle is it's gonna last forever

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.840 
water bottle is it's gonna last forever
I<00:03:46.770> mean<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.950> both<00:03:47.130> can<00:03:47.310> last<00:03:47.459> forever<00:03:47.670> so

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
I mean the both can last forever so

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.900 
I mean the both can last forever so
they're<00:03:48.240> kind<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.480> even<00:03:48.600> there<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:50.310> those<00:03:50.760> are

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
they're kind of even there so those are

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.830 
they're kind of even there so those are
my<00:03:51.000> thoughts<00:03:51.240> on<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.900> water<00:03:52.140> bottle<00:03:53.630> I've<00:03:54.630> had

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
my thoughts on the water bottle I've had

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.980 
my thoughts on the water bottle I've had
I've<00:03:55.230> had<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> lot<00:03:55.740> of<00:03:55.770> people<00:03:56.300> just<00:03:57.300> discuss

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
I've had a lot of people just discuss

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.270 
I've had a lot of people just discuss
this<00:03:58.140> with<00:03:58.320> me<00:03:58.470> I've<00:03:58.590> never<00:03:58.740> had<00:03:59.040> one<00:03:59.250> until

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
this with me I've never had one until

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.580 
this with me I've never had one until
this<00:03:59.700> moment<00:03:59.910> where<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.720> made<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.350> for<00:04:01.500> the

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
this moment where I made it for the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.140 
this moment where I made it for the
camera<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.540> guess<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.690> added<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.050> my<00:04:04.170> kit<00:04:05.150> you

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
camera so I guess I added to my kit you

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.030 
camera so I guess I added to my kit you
know<00:04:06.270> because<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:06.660> do<00:04:06.720> believe<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.440> I

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
know because I do believe in the I

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.020 
know because I do believe in the I
honestly<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.239> never<00:04:09.870> had<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.290> thought<00:04:10.560> of

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
honestly I never had the thought of

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.229
