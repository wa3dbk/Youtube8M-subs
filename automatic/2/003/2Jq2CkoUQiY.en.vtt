00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
today we're going to talk a little bit

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.880 
today we're going to talk a little bit
about<00:00:05.700> Vitamix<00:00:06.330> blenders<00:00:06.750> where<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.529> started

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
about Vitamix blenders where we started

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.100 
about Vitamix blenders where we started
where<00:00:08.010> we<00:00:08.069> came<00:00:08.220> from<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.580> eventually<00:00:09.389> thank

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
where we came from and eventually thank

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.749 
where we came from and eventually thank
everybody<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.530> smoothie<00:00:10.950> here's<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.340> show<00:00:11.550> how

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
everybody a smoothie here's a show how

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.089 
everybody a smoothie here's a show how
the<00:00:11.820> operation<00:00:12.420> works

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
the operation works

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.189 
the operation works
so<00:00:14.099> basically<00:00:14.400> Vitamix<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> guys<00:00:15.150> start<00:00:15.540> on

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
so basically Vitamix the guys start on

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.960 
so basically Vitamix the guys start on
time<00:00:16.440> go<00:00:16.619> with<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> standard<00:00:17.430> blender

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
time go with just the standard blender

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.120 
time go with just the standard blender
here<00:00:18.359> no<00:00:18.960> bells<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.410> whistles<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.010> is

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
here no bells and whistles but this is

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.700 
here no bells and whistles but this is
our<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.580> beaten<00:00:20.880> potatoes<00:00:21.410> we<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
our and beaten potatoes we have the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.429 
our and beaten potatoes we have the
on/off<00:00:23.039> switch<00:00:23.310> here<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.480> our<00:00:24.840> high-low

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
on/off switch here and our high-low

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.099 
on/off switch here and our high-low
switch<00:00:25.820> from<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.939> point<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.390> got<00:00:27.539> into<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
switch from this point we got into the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.910 
switch from this point we got into the
same<00:00:28.289> footprint

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
same footprint

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
same footprint
however<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.429> involve<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.119> timer<00:00:30.779> now<00:00:31.050> for

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
however we involve a timer now for

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.950 
however we involve a timer now for
convenience<00:00:31.980> purposes<00:00:32.030> set<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> timer<00:00:33.360> start

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
convenience purposes set the timer start

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.860 
convenience purposes set the timer start
the<00:00:34.050> blending<00:00:34.410> walk<00:00:34.739> away<00:00:35.480> from<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.540> point

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the blending walk away from that point

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.330 
the blending walk away from that point
we<00:00:36.960> got<00:00:37.079> into<00:00:37.380> what's<00:00:37.590> called<00:00:37.800> our<00:00:37.860> advanced

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
we got into what's called our advanced

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.069 
we got into what's called our advanced
series<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.030> our<00:00:39.510> advanced<00:00:39.780> theories

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
series and our advanced theories

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.869 
series and our advanced theories
obviously<00:00:40.410> has<00:00:40.530> changed<00:00:40.860> quite<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.070> bit<00:00:41.160> we've

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
obviously has changed quite a bit we've

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.810 
obviously has changed quite a bit we've
changed<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.570> configuration<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.100> cup<00:00:44.309> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
changed the configuration of the cup so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.420 
changed the configuration of the cup so
that<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> blends<00:00:45.329> more<00:00:45.539> efficiently<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
that it blends more efficiently and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
that it blends more efficiently and
smoother<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:48.390> also<00:00:48.600> changed<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> footprint

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
smoother we also changed the footprint

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.069 
smoother we also changed the footprint
of<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> bottom<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.760> incorporate<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.809> six

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
of the bottom to incorporate the six

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.560 
of the bottom to incorporate the six
most<00:00:52.320> popular<00:00:52.829> programs<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.850> smoothie

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
most popular programs that smoothie

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.590 
most popular programs that smoothie
operators<00:00:55.020> use<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.850> we've<00:00:57.120> increased<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
operators use and we've increased the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.760 
operators use and we've increased the
horsepower<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.649> peak<00:00:59.219> three<00:00:59.550> horsepower

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
horsepower to a peak three horsepower

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.349 
horsepower to a peak three horsepower
from<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.949> point<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.489> into<00:01:02.850> where<00:01:03.090> we're

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
from that point we get into where we're

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.350 
from that point we get into where we're
utilizing<00:01:03.870> our<00:01:04.290> blenders<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.949> food<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
utilizing our blenders to do food so

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.929 
utilizing our blenders to do food so
this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.750> called<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> fighter<00:01:07.290> prep<00:01:07.939> devided

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
this is called a fighter prep devided

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000 
this is called a fighter prep devided
prep<00:01:09.090> 3<00:01:09.420> actually<00:01:09.659> has<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.350> peak<00:01:10.680> 3

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
prep 3 actually has the peak 3

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.100 
prep 3 actually has the peak 3
horsepower<00:01:11.250> motor<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.820> well<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.689> use<00:01:12.869> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
horsepower motor as well we use this

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.210 
horsepower motor as well we use this
machine<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:14.000> new<00:01:15.000> purees<00:01:15.450> sauces<00:01:16.380> sort<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
machine for new purees sauces sort of

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.570 
machine for new purees sauces sort of
creams<00:01:17.820> things<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> soups<00:01:19.400> chefs<00:01:20.400> most

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
creams things like that soups chefs most

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.240 
creams things like that soups chefs most
likely<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.150> use<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.380> again<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.979> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
likely to use this and again we have a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
likely to use this and again we have a
lot<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.090> programs<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.689> are<00:01:24.869> already

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
lot of the programs that are already

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.679 
lot of the programs that are already
included<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:27.000> will<00:01:27.330> allow<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
included here and this will allow the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.910 
included here and this will allow the
chef<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.259> actually<00:01:28.770> make<00:01:29.729> his<00:01:30.470> product<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.829> at

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
chef to actually make his product and at

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.100 
chef to actually make his product and at
the<00:01:31.979> same<00:01:32.189> time<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.909> take<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.509> lid<00:01:33.689> off<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the same time but take the lid off and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.010 
the same time but take the lid off and
add<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.619> while<00:01:34.979> he's<00:01:35.189> doing<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.869> just

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
add to it while he's doing it it's just

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.010 
add to it while he's doing it it's just
like<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.350> flexibility<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.780> point

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
like that flexibility and for that point

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.219 
like that flexibility and for that point
we<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:40.829> was<00:01:41.180> our<00:01:42.180> sound<00:01:42.509> deadening<00:01:42.810> or

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
we get into was our sound deadening or

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.499 
we get into was our sound deadening or
our<00:01:43.380> enclosed<00:01:43.829> devices<00:01:44.670> which<00:01:45.270> basically

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
our enclosed devices which basically

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.249 
our enclosed devices which basically
will<00:01:45.689> drowned<00:01:45.930> out<00:01:46.079> about<00:01:46.259> 40%<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> noise

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
will drowned out about 40% of the noise

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.300 
will drowned out about 40% of the noise
so<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.439> time<00:01:49.590> I'm<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:49.920> ahead<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
so this time I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010 
so this time I'm going to go ahead and
blend<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.000> guys<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> drink<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.750> then<00:01:51.869> we'll

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
blend you guys a drink and then we'll

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
blend you guys a drink and then we'll
see<00:01:52.200> how<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> operation<00:01:52.649> works<00:01:52.950> again<00:01:53.820> this

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
see how the operation works again this

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.670 
see how the operation works again this
is<00:01:54.149> all<00:01:54.299> digital<00:01:54.509> now<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> same

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
is all digital now so we have the same

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.830 
is all digital now so we have the same
six<00:01:56.009> programs<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.670> are<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.850> our<00:01:57.390> advanced

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
six programs that are on our advanced
