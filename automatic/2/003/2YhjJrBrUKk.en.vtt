00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.049
 hello friends this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:10.500
 show below is to install 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:15.930
 the original mexcel telcel stock for 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.480
 the galaxy fan gts 68 10m 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.240
 if you have another version of Galax 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.580
 of your galaxy can search on a page 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.160
 that I'm going to leave in a file 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.570
 well once we have this one time 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.730
 that we have downloaded the file that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.820
 I leave you video below us 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.750
 this will appear unzip it and now 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.030
 we will have the folder here we open it 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.430
 inside it we will find four 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.199
 files one are this is the one of the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.199
 drivers that are universal drivers 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.610
 for all samsung among the odin is 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.949
 which we will we will serve 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.570
 install our telcel stock and for 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.720
 course this is our telcel stock 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.060
 the original that comes from the factory 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.200
 and this is a file where I leave you some 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.120
 tips 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.309
 read it please 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.159
 this step these methods serve us to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.960
 when our phone has not been 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.610
 deleted some applications and no longer 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.890
 we can return simply with this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.619
 We can restore it to the factory 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.140
 or also when our ours 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.520
 phone was locked and no not 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.860
 it does not go beyond the android logo too 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.750
 it seems to serve us 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.450
 good let's start 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.590
 first first what are we going to do is 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.580
 install the universal driver 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.620
 we just click right 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.620
 we give you to run with administrator 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.960
 we give that if I'm going to give you not 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.560
 because I already have it installed 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.659
 they give him that if they give next next to everything and 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.220
 alone is installed not to do anything 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.110
 after 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.640
 let's open the odin that is the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.640
 principal 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.280
 we do not have here we give you right click 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.230
 execute as administrator we give you that 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.200
 yes 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.720
 and it will open this window that is the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.310
 truth of the program here and so we're going 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.440
 to leave everything as it is, we are not going to 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.910
 move nothing the only thing we're going to do is 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.550
 give it where it says pda 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.370
 that's where our where we're going is going 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.370
 To extract our stock we give pda 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.620
 let's hope we give 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.000
 When it was here, it seemed to me because 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.760
 I did it for a while but for example 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.010
 you see them like that they look for their 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.760
 folder where they have their stock 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.110
 once they have it, they click on it and 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.870
 they open 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.030
 let's wait for it to load sometimes it takes a 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.460
 little bit 2 inside that will be a minute or 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.460
 two minutes do not despair 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.820
 two hours later 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.900
 do not do not believe it does not take long 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.070
 as you see here is telling me that we 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.070
 let's wait a moment 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.260
 there they are as you see, we already have it 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.180
 here if in case you get them 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.130
 to appear here that they say respond us 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.830
 because a moment ago like this happened to me 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.680
 here they tell you not to move anything alone 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.360
 the good program reacts again 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.670
 as you see here we already have everything 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.830
 you have to do now we're just going to 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.850
 connect our phone in mode 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.370
 discharge 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.860
 to enter download mode only 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.740
 we need to press the power key 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.800
 the volume down and the home key 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.100
 for about 34 seconds and once 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.220
 the wolf comes out we give him the 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:54.200
 volume up key accept for 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.200
 can enter download mode 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.330
 once we have our phone in 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.000
 double mode we connect it to the cable with the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.069
 usb cable to the pc let's hope that 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.110
 install the drivers also appeared already 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.150
 because he already has them installed hopefully 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.920
 to recognize the phone that only 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.850
 it will take about 30 seconds 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.109
 here you can find 0917 the number 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.090
 that you appear here does not 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.709
 worry how to put them on 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.180
 this color or any other color 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.780
 but what it stays with is marked 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.460
 box they already made it as you see here 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.780
 now only the only thing they are going to do 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.540
 is to give it here in star and start 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.270
 and here I'm not going to give you here 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.910
 because I already have it done already configure it 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.919
 again and then I already do so 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.410
 again would be to go back to the 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.560
 back passes if it's not a little bit more 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.810
 complicated but I do not want to do it anymore 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.330
 Once we give here these lines 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.400
 here this line will begin to fill up like this 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.930
 start filling it begins dialing a 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.500
 sometimes marked a percentage sometimes not 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.960
 here you will also unmark some more 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.790
 things are going to appear here 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.370
 is filling and on the screen of your 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.750
 phone is also going to be based on a 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.540
 small bar where will you go showing 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.050
 the process that leads and the both 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.690
 hundred once we already have this and it 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.220
 I have filled here and filled here 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.500
 simply the phone is going to 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.180
 restart and it goes to this as it is called it 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.010
 they will restart the phone is going to 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.400
 turn on I was going to decide setting 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.680
 android one of 21 9 22 so know if it's going 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.410
 mind until you light alone goes to 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.419
 say samsung and it's going to turn on and they're going 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.270
 to appear this one will appear to you all 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.320
 the applications that they had before 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.560
 practically the factory system 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.180
 his phone was surrounded or well and his 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.130
 modifications because root is going to 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.050
 lose and you can return it to 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.790
 do next I'm going to upload a video of 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.550
 a way to surround the phone via 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.630
 easy good this is all friends like
