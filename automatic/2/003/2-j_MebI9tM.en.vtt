00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 5 today on the channel is enough 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.160
 inexpensive knife is quite ordinary 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.599
 of the company 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.719
 sour cream with Yandex written quality 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.300
 cutting tool really guys from 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.800
 smith and wesson they use very 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.189
 interesting decisions on their knives but to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.990
 Unfortunately, they are made in China from 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.710
 not very high quality materials 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.590
 but also try to be original yet 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.600
 what is the difference between this company and that 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.559
 guys do not bother with the names 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.079
 models they put here such 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.750
 alphanumeric code and in general so 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.350
 coming up with names conditionally therefore 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.070
 today on the channel here is such a knife 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 if I remember correctly the series is called 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:02.180
 black ops aluminum lug 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:06.530
 interesting processing well, in general, such 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.780
 a kind of knife well, which is enough 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.590
 deep clip 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.020
 it is an assisted knife with 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.710
 spring right here with us 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.159
 fuse to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.650
 prevent opening if you pay 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.930
 attention then this fin he is even different 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.110
 colors are a separate detail for me personally 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.750
 not really like it because the more 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.140
 details in our topics in my opinion he 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.659
 becomes less reliable well and let's 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.439
 let's see how flip pu or this little knife with 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.700
 an assistant and what new wedge 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.700
 In general, here is such an interesting 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.090
 We have a wedge with us 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.560
 fin and if you look i'm here 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.860
 day 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:04.070
 to the end did not understand but at that moment 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:06.890
 when the fin develops it remains 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.880
 here on this side we have nothing 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.500
 nowhere sticks out is a separate part 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.500
 which when folded 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.640
 so pressed and pushed to the top 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.640
 and the moment we open once 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.480
 parnichok gone here so very 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.350
 interesting in my opinion the shape of the blade 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.780
 standard blade 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:38.500
 3 385 in my opinion 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.470
 interesting in the hand is a good knife 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.360
 small not heavy but aluminum 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.470
 blade shape but really very 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.950
 here we see an interesting inscription 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.010
 smith and wesson black ops 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.030
 here here we have modelka and now 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.959
 the most interesting knife series with such 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.060
 the number of patents I am a thousand times 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.510
 a thousand years probably have not seen even I have 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.150
 not seen one knife with so many 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:17.480
 patents on the wedge you see that 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:22.160
 decided by guys also let's say so surprise 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.870
 all use here tanku 4034 4034 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:30.049
 it's the same as 420 high carbon 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.959
 similar to how to use the tank here again 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.510
 why am I saying that the knives are made 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.389
 China, although nowhere is the inscription 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.340
 what has been done in China but not 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.590
 one inscription what is made in the usa 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.350
 I climbed on the forums I looked at 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.549
 site and it says that there are no plants 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.660
 in taiwan 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.150
 the island of taiwan and in china but he himself 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.560
 the fact that such a table is very 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.410
 interesting really 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.319
 so simple but at the same time the form itself 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.390
 the knife and the wedge itself cause a very 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.410
 interesting feeling despite the fact that 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:10.610
 aluminum let's say so but my view is a knife 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.349
 made more interesting than the same let's 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.549
 anything take such an aluminum 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:19.489
 inexpensive and with similar if where even 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.580
 take kalashnikov from booker who are there 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.669
 you 101 up is called here he wants 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.860
 more thicker in the butt but not 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.290
 less than they really look like 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.080
 they cost roughly the same around 60 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.270
 US dollars are not worth these both knives when 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.900
 this knife is made by interesting 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.820
 In my opinion such a serious enough 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.560
 the spring of the name is this chip although 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.130
 said I don't like when superfluous 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.770
 parts on this so cool 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.950
 the system that when I open time but here 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.700
 leaves the hiding place 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:59.210
 Here is such a linerock also comes on 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.120
 the very beginning of the heel so I do not know what 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.620
 You can make such a knife, I basically do not 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.450
 I love the record in terms of complexity and 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.960
 sharpening well, not exactly the complexity of say 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:15.620
 so the only thing I sharpen Rica ru 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.800
 this spider kathryn gl speech is wonderful 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.900
 comfortable quite fit here but not 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.460
 less i like to grind on apex 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.570
 But at the same time, the knife is comfortable to hold as 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.260
 reverse grip so direct grip and 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.240
 precise grip 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.020
 So I think that if a little is exactly what some 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.389
 plan a little finger will suffer a little 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.610
 because such a rough notch and 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.919
 such a powerful bend of the handle at the very 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.930
 in fact these are all things even with your bare hand 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.520
 these notches don't comfortably commemorate 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.840
 we move the clip only to the left 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.510
 on the right to change the type of optic yes we do not 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.340
 You get only one position here 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.010
 so interesting legs 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.120
 well fitting fit 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.370
 good too 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.780
 I understand that aluminum inside everything 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.780
 how it should be styled 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.710
 to reduce weight well well well weighs on 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.350
 really not very much so here 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.979
 such a cool little knife thank you all 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.979
 until
