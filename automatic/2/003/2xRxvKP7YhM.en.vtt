going to talk us through the new
speedster<00:00:14.219> range<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.839> speedster<00:00:16.350> it's

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
speedster range that the speedster it's

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.960 
speedster range that the speedster it's
it's<00:00:17.609> all<00:00:17.699> new<00:00:17.880> for<00:00:18.150> 2013<00:00:18.900> yeah<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.160> completely

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
it's all new for 2013 yeah we completely

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.179 
it's all new for 2013 yeah we completely
redesigned<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.869> year<00:00:22.170> took<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.039> off<00:00:23.160> of

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
redesigned it this year took it off of

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.689 
redesigned it this year took it off of
last<00:00:23.670> year's<00:00:23.910> foil<00:00:24.210> design<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:25.670> wanted<00:00:26.670> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
last year's foil design and wanted to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.080 
last year's foil design and wanted to
bring<00:00:27.080> affordability<00:00:28.080> into<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.939> equation<00:00:29.939> of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
bring affordability into the equation of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.910 
bring affordability into the equation of
the<00:00:30.240> perfect<00:00:30.570> bike<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.230> take<00:00:31.740> us<00:00:31.769> through

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the perfect bike can you take us through

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.100 
the perfect bike can you take us through
what<00:00:32.130> has<00:00:32.730> been<00:00:32.850> added<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.450> speedster<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
what has been added to the speedster to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.500 
what has been added to the speedster to
make<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.410> more<00:00:34.590> aerodynamic<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.579> year<00:00:35.820> yeah

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
make it more aerodynamic this year yeah

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.709 
make it more aerodynamic this year yeah
for<00:00:36.780> sure<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.290> we've<00:00:37.590> taken<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.760> NACA<00:00:39.180> profile

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
for sure so we've taken the NACA profile

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.639 
for sure so we've taken the NACA profile
and<00:00:40.079> trim<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.860> trailing<00:00:41.700> edge<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.649> saves

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and trim the trailing edge of it saves

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.369 
and trim the trailing edge of it saves
weight<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.489> well<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.090> still<00:00:45.450> maintains<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.200> nice

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
weight as well as still maintains a nice

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.830 
weight as well as still maintains a nice
separated<00:00:47.010> flow<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.340> air<00:00:47.520> air<00:00:48.090> keeps<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> bike

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
separated flow of air air keeps the bike

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.920 
separated flow of air air keeps the bike
nice<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.260> aerodynamic<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.940> making<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
nice and aerodynamic so making the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.930 
nice and aerodynamic so making the
speedster<00:00:52.440> more<00:00:52.590> aerodynamic<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.699> sort

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
speedster more aerodynamic it's the sort

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
speedster more aerodynamic it's the sort
of<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.180> entry<00:00:54.510> level<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> Scott<00:00:55.379> serious

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
of the entry level to the Scott serious

acquired synchros this winter and you'll

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.069 
acquired synchros this winter and you'll
see<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.340> throughout<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.000> range<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.600> Road<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
see it throughout the range in Road and

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.749 
see it throughout the range in Road and
mountain<00:01:35.119> wheels<00:01:36.119> bar<00:01:36.990> stems<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:38.159> lot<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
mountain wheels bar stems a lot of

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.300 
mountain wheels bar stems a lot of
effort<00:01:39.090> gone<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.290> saddles<00:01:40.740> being<00:01:41.040> good

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
effort gone in to the saddles being good

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.770 
effort gone in to the saddles being good
and<00:01:41.460> comfortable<00:01:41.670> had<00:01:42.119> great<00:01:42.329> feedback<00:01:42.570> on

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and comfortable had great feedback on

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.730 
and comfortable had great feedback on
those<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.520> new<00:01:45.030> exciting<00:01:45.740> division

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
about the genius yeah so we started this

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.830 
about the genius yeah so we started this
project<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.990> all<00:01:58.409> three<00:01:58.740> wheel<00:01:58.920> sizes<00:01:59.329> 26<00:02:00.329> 27

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
project with all three wheel sizes 26 27

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.100 
project with all three wheel sizes 26 27
and<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.079> half<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
and a half and

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.620 
and a half and
tested<00:02:02.560> them<00:02:02.650> all<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.070> decided<00:02:03.850> their<00:02:04.360> way<00:02:04.570> to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
tested them all and decided their way to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.100 
tested them all and decided their way to
go<00:02:04.840> was<00:02:05.080> definitely<00:02:05.500> 27<00:02:06.010> 1/2<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.490> 29<00:02:06.880> due<00:02:07.840> to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
go was definitely 27 1/2 and 29 due to

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.130 
go was definitely 27 1/2 and 29 due to
the<00:02:08.700> benefits<00:02:09.700> of<00:02:10.030> rolling<00:02:10.600> over<00:02:10.720> square

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
the benefits of rolling over square

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.650 
the benefits of rolling over square
edges<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.740> just<00:02:12.209> traction<00:02:13.209> from<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.510> bigger

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
edges and just traction from the bigger

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.970 
edges and just traction from the bigger
wheel<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.709> basically<00:02:15.100> both<00:02:15.580> bigger<00:02:15.880> wheels

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
wheel so basically both bigger wheels

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.800 
wheel so basically both bigger wheels
why<00:02:17.980> have<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.160> gone<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.459> two<00:02:18.820> why<00:02:19.209> not<00:02:19.600> just

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
why have you gone for two why not just

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.410 
why have you gone for two why not just
29<00:02:20.260> why<00:02:20.680> not<00:02:20.860> just<00:02:21.040> 27<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> half<00:02:21.670> oh<00:02:22.000> well

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
29 why not just 27 and a half oh well

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.820 
29 why not just 27 and a half oh well
there's<00:02:22.600> all<00:02:22.959> sorts<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.410> different<00:02:23.560> trail

there's all sorts of different trail
riders<00:02:24.190> out<00:02:24.310> there<00:02:24.520> there's<00:02:24.760> guys<00:02:24.940> who<00:02:25.209> are

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
riders out there there's guys who are

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
want to switch from 26 to 29 after our

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.300 
want to switch from 26 to 29 after our
two<00:02:57.820> demos<00:02:58.180> here<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> US<00:02:59.830> we've<00:03:00.130> had

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
two demos here and in the US we've had

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.509 
two demos here and in the US we've had
tremendous<00:03:01.260> feedback<00:03:02.260> on<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.800> 27<00:03:03.370> inch

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
tremendous feedback on the 27 inch

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.449 
tremendous feedback on the 27 inch
twenty<00:03:04.060> seven<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.450> half<00:03:04.480> inch<00:03:04.780> wheel<00:03:04.989> so<00:03:05.890> I

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
twenty seven and a half inch wheel so I

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.340 
twenty seven and a half inch wheel so I
think<00:03:07.299> there's<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.720> lot<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.959> people<00:03:08.200> out<00:03:08.320> there

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
think there's a lot of people out there

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.280 
think there's a lot of people out there

who are gonna feel the benefits from

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.110 
who are gonna feel the benefits from
traction<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.100> momentum<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.820> twenty

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
traction and momentum of the twenty

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.710 
traction and momentum of the twenty
seven<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.600> half<00:03:13.630> inch<00:03:13.959> wheel<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.970> still

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
seven and a half inch wheel and still

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.350 
seven and a half inch wheel and still
have<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.079> playfulness<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.950> they<00:03:18.459> liked<00:03:19.000> in

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
have the playfulness that they liked in

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.710 
have the playfulness that they liked in
the<00:03:19.799> agile<00:03:20.799> 26<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:22.030> if<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.239> got<00:03:22.329> any<00:03:22.420> sort<00:03:22.690> of

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
the agile 26 and if you got any sort of

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.759 
the agile 26 and if you got any sort of
ideas<00:03:23.200> which<00:03:23.500> one's<00:03:23.739> going<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.160> sell<00:03:24.700> more<00:03:24.910> oh

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
ideas which one's going to sell more oh

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.140 
ideas which one's going to sell more oh
that's<00:03:26.769> that's<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.610> question<00:03:28.000> it's

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
that's that's the question it's

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.910 
that's that's the question it's
definitely<00:03:28.690> up<00:03:29.200> in<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.470> air<00:03:29.620> they're

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
definitely up in the air they're

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.250 
definitely up in the air they're
neck-and-neck<00:03:30.250> right<00:03:30.760> now<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.329> we'll<00:03:32.049> find

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
neck-and-neck right now so we'll find

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.050 
neck-and-neck right now so we'll find
out<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.920> it's<00:03:33.160> obviously<00:03:33.489> it's<00:03:33.579> not<00:03:33.700> just<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
out and it's obviously it's not just the

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.420 
out and it's obviously it's not just the
wheel<00:03:34.209> size<00:03:34.709> what<00:03:35.709> else<00:03:35.860> have<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.040> done<00:03:36.100> so

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
wheel size what else have you done so

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.650 
wheel size what else have you done so
that<00:03:36.579> the<00:03:36.790> genius<00:03:37.180> we<00:03:38.140> we<00:03:38.799> definitely<00:03:39.660> looked

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
that the genius we we definitely looked

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.940 
that the genius we we definitely looked
at<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.989> again

at it again

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.920 
at it again
completely<00:03:42.670> revamped<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.540> now<00:03:43.660> has<00:03:43.900> a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
completely revamped it it now has a

successful<00:03:55.390> spark<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.140> we<00:03:56.670> still<00:03:57.670> have<00:03:57.850> the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
successful spark and we still have the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.289 
successful spark and we still have the
twin<00:03:58.810> lock<00:03:58.989> lever<00:03:59.260> which<00:04:00.100> functions<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.910> fork

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
twin lock lever which functions the fork

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.140 
twin lock lever which functions the fork
and<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:02.230> shock<00:04:02.890> in<00:04:03.220> three<00:04:03.610> modes<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.940> travel

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
and the shock in three modes of travel

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.390 
and the shock in three modes of travel
in<00:04:04.450> full<00:04:05.110> lockout<00:04:05.530> mode<00:04:05.560> you're<00:04:06.070> upright

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
in full lockout mode you're upright

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.559 
in full lockout mode you're upright
you're<00:04:06.880> going<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.180> quick

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
you're going to be quick

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.479 
you're going to be quick
going<00:04:08.409> to<00:04:08.500> be<00:04:08.560> able<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.799> climb<00:04:09.010> up<00:04:09.219> things

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
going to be able to climb up things

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.449 
going to be able to climb up things
quickly<00:04:09.819> get<00:04:10.209> around<00:04:10.450> technical<00:04:10.930> sections

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
quickly get around technical sections

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.890 
quickly get around technical sections
traction<00:04:12.459> control<00:04:12.849> you<00:04:12.879> get<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.390> little<00:04:13.659> bit<00:04:13.780> of

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
traction control you get a little bit of

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.189 
traction control you get a little bit of
a<00:04:13.989> sag<00:04:14.969> but<00:04:15.969> it<00:04:16.090> will<00:04:16.150> ramp<00:04:16.359> up<00:04:16.600> nice<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:16.930> quick

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
a sag but it will ramp up nice and quick

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.319 
a sag but it will ramp up nice and quick
so<00:04:17.530> it's<00:04:17.680> an<00:04:17.799> efficient<00:04:18.250> pedal<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.729> then

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
so it's an efficient pedal and then

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.279 
so it's an efficient pedal and then
you've<00:04:19.780> got<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.019> fully<00:04:20.799> open<00:04:21.039> mode<00:04:21.430> which<00:04:22.389> opens

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
you've got a fully open mode which opens

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.409 
you've got a fully open mode which opens
up<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.620> damper<00:04:24.039> and<00:04:24.400> gives<00:04:24.759> you<00:04:24.910> your<00:04:25.150> full

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
up the damper and gives you your full

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.680 
up the damper and gives you your full
travel<00:04:26.259> and<00:04:26.740> you<00:04:27.190> can<00:04:27.400> brush<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.419> down<00:04:28.449> the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
travel and you can brush it down the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.990 
travel and you can brush it down the
downhills<00:04:29.050> really<00:04:29.889> interesting<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.520> thanks
