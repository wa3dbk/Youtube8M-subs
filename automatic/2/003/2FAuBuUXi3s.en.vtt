that<00:01:38.280> glide<00:01:38.520> maybe<00:01:38.759> by<00:01:38.970> hovering<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that glide maybe by hovering the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.550 
that glide maybe by hovering the
buildings<00:01:39.689> above<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.439> going

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
buildings above it but that's not going

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.289

to<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.680> successful<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.579> i<00:01:41.790> think

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
to be successful you can see i think

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.520 
to be successful you can see i think
he's<00:01:42.390> trying<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.630> run<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.899> glide<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.380> that

he's trying to run that glide to that
dark<00:01:43.740> swarm<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.189> isn't<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.670> able<00:01:44.759> to

dark swarm but isn't going to be able to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.609 
dark swarm but isn't going to be able to
manage<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:46.049> i<00:01:46.140> think<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:46.500> his

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
manage to do so and i think that's his

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
manage to do so and i think that's his
plan<00:01:46.740> at<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:46.979> point<00:01:47.070> he's<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.790> move

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
plan at this point he's going to go move

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.880 
plan at this point he's going to go move

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that factory into the dark swarm and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.929 
that factory into the dark swarm and
then<00:01:50.009> once<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.250> gets<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> factory<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
then once it gets the factory in the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.090 
then once it gets the factory in the
dark<00:01:51.240> swarm<00:01:51.479> planted<00:01:51.840> down<00:01:51.960> builds<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> glass

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.280

so<00:02:13.459> if<00:02:13.730> he<00:02:13.849> does<00:02:14.030> push<00:02:14.269> up<00:02:14.420> there<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:14.840> building

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
so if he does push up there and building

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.420 
so if he does push up there and building
land<00:02:15.410> closer<00:02:15.620> looks<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:15.980> he's<00:02:16.129> going<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.310> try

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
land closer looks like he's going to try

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.970 
land closer looks like he's going to try
to<00:02:16.459> take<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> secondary<00:02:17.120> but<00:02:18.080> again<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.410> don't

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
to take a secondary but again I don't

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.530 
to take a secondary but again I don't
think<00:02:19.190> if<00:02:19.310> up<00:02:19.640> magic<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.030> do<00:02:20.090> anything<00:02:20.300> and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
think if up magic can do anything and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.970 
think if up magic can do anything and

storm<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.310> guess<00:02:25.459> we<00:02:25.640> can<00:02:25.760> build<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.120> units<00:02:26.390> and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
storm I guess we can build the units and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.930 
storm I guess we can build the units and
then<00:02:26.599> hope<00:02:27.010> hope<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.190> pull<00:02:28.370> those<00:02:28.519> units<00:02:28.790> into

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
then hope hope to pull those units into

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.220 
then hope hope to pull those units into

try to push up and we'll see if he
managed<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.989> make<00:02:48.110> their<00:02:48.290> he<00:02:48.410> does<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.739> fact

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
managed to make their he does in fact

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.110 
managed to make their he does in fact
managed<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.280> make<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.430> there<00:02:49.640> he<00:02:49.760> has<00:02:49.880> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
managed to make it there he has the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.420 
managed to make it there he has the
command<00:02:50.690> center<00:02:50.810> hovering<00:02:51.230> above<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:52.220> was

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
command center hovering above that was

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.520 
command center hovering above that was
interesting<00:02:53.269> interesting<00:02:54.049> move<00:02:54.200> for<00:02:54.440> up

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
interesting interesting move for up

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.589 
interesting interesting move for up
magic<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:55.610> has<00:02:55.790> like<00:02:55.819> Goliath<00:02:56.120> camped

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
magic I just has like Goliath camped

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.900 
magic I just has like Goliath camped
underneath<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.170> dark<00:02:57.410> swarm<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.519> produced

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
underneath that dark swarm and produced

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.670 
underneath that dark swarm and produced
another<00:02:59.180> vulture<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.569> guess<00:02:59.810> he<00:02:59.930> realizes<00:03:00.319> he

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
another vulture I guess he realizes he

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.430 
another vulture I guess he realizes he
needs<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.920> go<00:03:01.540> harass<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.810> front<00:03:03.079> but<00:03:03.230> only<00:03:03.410> a

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
needs to go harass that front but only a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.960 
needs to go harass that front but only a
sliver<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.829> help<00:03:04.069> left<00:03:04.310> kind<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.549> plant<00:03:04.790> mines

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
sliver of help left kind of plant mines

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.880 
sliver of help left kind of plant mines
to<00:03:05.329> that<00:03:05.690> was<00:03:05.780> clever<00:03:05.959> going<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.410> plant<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.709> mine

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
to that was clever going to plant a mine

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.710 
to that was clever going to plant a mine
right<00:03:07.069> there<00:03:07.099> to<00:03:07.340> defend<00:03:07.489> against<00:03:07.970> any

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
right there to defend against any

right there to defend against any
zerglings<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.410> might<00:03:09.560> come<00:03:09.709> out<00:03:09.829> and<00:03:10.010> just

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
zerglings that might come out and just

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.350 
zerglings that might come out and just
kind<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.310> camp<00:03:10.640> everything<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.180> think

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
kind of camp everything that I think

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.780 
kind of camp everything that I think
that<00:03:11.480> Goliath<00:03:11.950> might<00:03:12.950> be<00:03:13.129> dead<00:03:13.340> now<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.700> might

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
that Goliath might be dead now it might

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.039 
that Goliath might be dead now it might
have<00:03:13.910> gotten<00:03:14.060> drawn<00:03:14.360> out<00:03:14.510> by<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.690> rest<00:03:14.900> of<00:03:14.989> the

have gotten drawn out by the rest of the
muta<00:03:15.230> lists<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.620> now<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.400> mule<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:16.760> going<00:03:16.940> to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
muta lists and now the mule is going to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.250 
muta lists and now the mule is going to
go<00:03:17.090> down<00:03:17.120> take<00:03:17.480> out<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.660> rest<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.079> base
