00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.330
 the Peruvian beach soccer team will 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.080
 prepares for the South American championship 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.269
 to be played from 10 to 17 February 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.840
 the village of merlo in the city of good 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.420
 airs 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.880
 the national team will debut with the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.250
 Argentine selection by the group to 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.079
 awaits an auspicious participation of 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.480
 the Peruvians because this tournament 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.610
 will classify three teams for the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.369
 world of taiping for this week 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.660
 We have been working hard on this 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.300
 we have been doing matches almost 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.590
 diaries trying to place the scheme 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.330
 of game that we are going to have the system 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.040
 which is very similar what we had in what 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.900
 Bolivarian is a series of five and one 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.360
 series of four has corresponded us the 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.220
 group with Argentine house owner with them 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.320
 we debuted the second match is with 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.060
 Chile the third with Colombia the fourth 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.329
 with Paraguay we are in the series of 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.640
 five pass two then the other seat is 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.400
 like two that pass we play crossed 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.840
 semifinal and then for the first and 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.090
 second place or always will see 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.230
 two dates and two opportunities to 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.659
 to be able to access the world cup because 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.270
 only three are the Peruvian team 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.130
 has many expectations to reach 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.259
 a quota to the world 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.840
 will not be easy considering that 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.630
 Brazil is one of the favorites for its 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.610
 high competitive level expectations 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.310
 ours are the best we 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.020
 we go with the head up to look 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.729
 a classification 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.829
 we understand that things do not just 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.049
 they deserve the things they look for they earn 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.210
 they do is a little bit what we are getting 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.460
 to the head to all everyone I think we 're going 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.829
 to look for the same goal now the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.649
 work of the Bolivarians left it well 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.789
 strengthened psychologically and we hope 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.840
 that may be useful for us but the 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.869
 expectations that we have 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.319
 they are always to win by levels 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.509
 Brazil that is world champion that 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.890
 he lost the last world championship what 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.439
 lost to Russia but that is still 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.450
 the strongest team in South America on 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.819
 they all play we really are 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.009
 when for 22 places Brasilia has one 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.179
 inside and then come a team like 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.209
 Argentina that have always been about 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.130
 mundial uruguay is a strong team 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.860
 venezuela that was the last World Cup and 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.920
 who landed in Uruguay is paraguay 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.019
 that does not the Bolivarians here won and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.569
 he was second in blanket in the game of 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.609
 summer 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.650
 and good and in relation are the teams 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.629
 stronger but all beach soccer 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.749
 it has been shrinking what they have been 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.030
 technical difference those selected are 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:29.999
 almost the same ones who participated in the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.459
 Bolivarian games 2012 but also 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:35.609
 have two revelations that 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.799
 promise to contribute to the good triumph 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.319
 this process that there are players that 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.419
 come with a 6 year process in the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.389
 case for example of dragon leader that he 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:47.459
 has been playing since 2013 we are two 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.939
 ten years ago they play there are others 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.959
 players who come playing like rooms 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.829
 rodolfo rooms that have been playing since 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.829
 the year 2007 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.070
 this spark that comes from playing 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.020
 2006 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.790
 Héctor Hernández that 2004 has covered 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.290
 in beach soccer then it has been a 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.840
 Collection process during all 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.880
 these years and have been taken out of the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.290
 internal championships that we have had in 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.320
 some cases of some players that 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.360
 they came to try their luck here and they were 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.520
 finding a space and as I said 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.560
 a moment ago of this last league 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.290
 guys who appeared with conditions 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.420
 that they have shown that they do not wrinkle 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.660
 are inside in this selection by 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.670
 example five players travel that never 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.000
 they were in eliminatory and of the 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.730
 which two guys are one of 20 years 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.760
 one of 19 that in the last league that what 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.400
 ended the last week ended 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.050
 as a scorer and now for his performance 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.790
 and by the level and by the possibility that 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.130
 may have been summoned the 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.930
 selection the strength and its union of 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.150
 group the humility you have for 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.610
 work its simplicity the way you look 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.100
 football very different I think this is 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.660
 a selection of beach soccer that we have 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.160
 could achieve after a long time 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.500
 which it has its own identity and 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.640
 game and a different style not with 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.250
 ball 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.250
 of the floor with speed and very good mark
