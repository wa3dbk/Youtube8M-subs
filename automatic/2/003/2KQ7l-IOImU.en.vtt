00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
motorcycles so we have a good base

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.110 
motorcycles so we have a good base
setting<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.719> we've<00:00:40.320> learned<00:00:40.730> some<00:00:41.730> things<00:00:41.910> up

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
setting and we've learned some things up

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610 
setting and we've learned some things up
to<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.390> point<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.780> Martine<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.320> he<00:00:43.410> likes

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620

to this point with Martine what he likes
and<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:44.460> he<00:00:44.520> hit<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:44.850> he<00:00:44.879> doesn't<00:00:45.210> like

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
and what he hit what he doesn't like

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.900 
and what he hit what he doesn't like
instead<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> bike<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.489> little<00:00:47.760> bit

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
instead of the bike it's a little bit

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.779 
instead of the bike it's a little bit
you<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.239> little<00:00:48.600> bit<00:00:48.750> less<00:00:48.960> time<00:00:49.760> we<00:00:50.760> have

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you have a little bit less time we have

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.040 
you have a little bit less time we have
had<00:00:50.940> only<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:52.789> one<00:00:53.789> session<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.719> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
had only like one session and I have to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.790 
had only like one session and I have to
set<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> bike<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.360> I<00:00:57.360> think<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> bike<00:00:58.620> is

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
set up the bike but I think the bike is

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.939 
set up the bike but I think the bike is
pretty<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.329> we<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.449> made<00:01:00.719> no<00:01:01.260> significant

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
pretty good we have made no significant

pretty good we have made no significant
changes<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.730> setup<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.420> he's<00:01:03.539> working

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
changes to the setup and he's working

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:25.370 
changes to the setup and he's working
fine

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.890 

typical<00:01:26.490> high<00:01:27.490> speed<00:01:27.760> circuit<00:01:28.240> it's<00:01:28.630> very

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
typical high speed circuit it's very

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:41.300 
typical high speed circuit it's very
very<00:01:29.860> safe<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.430> very<00:01:30.520> fun<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.060> ride

everybody<00:02:30.690> it's<00:02:31.690> just<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.930> hunter<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:33.190> think

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
everybody it's just a hunter I I think

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.740 
everybody it's just a hunter I I think
he<00:02:34.150> rode<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:35.500> maximum<00:02:35.920> visibility<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:37.540> bike

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
he rode the maximum visibility the bike

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.789 
he rode the maximum visibility the bike
was<00:02:37.900> not<00:02:38.110> nearly<00:02:38.709> as<00:02:39.430> perfect<00:02:40.120> as<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.390> could<00:02:40.540> be

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
was not nearly as perfect as it could be

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.759 
was not nearly as perfect as it could be
he<00:02:41.799> went<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:43.019> second<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.140> half<00:02:44.170> faster<00:02:44.650> in

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
he went a second and a half faster in

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.610 
he went a second and a half faster in
the<00:02:44.860> race<00:02:45.010> than<00:02:45.250> he<00:02:45.340> did<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:45.959> qualifying<00:02:46.959> so

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
the race than he did in qualifying so

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.850 
the race than he did in qualifying so
that<00:02:47.890> introduces<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.519> lot<00:02:48.670> more<00:02:48.790> problems<00:02:49.860> that

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
that introduces a lot more problems that

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.660 
that introduces a lot more problems that
we<00:02:51.160> can't<00:02:51.430> correct<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.980> visibility

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
we can't correct but the visibility

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.760 
we can't correct but the visibility
he<00:02:55.120> could<00:02:55.510> make<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.690> work<00:02:55.900> for<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.410> most<00:02:56.590> part

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
he could make it work for the most part

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.949 
he could make it work for the most part
