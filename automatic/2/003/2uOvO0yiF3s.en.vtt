00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
logo straight down with that so that

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.820

when<00:02:27.060> it's<00:02:27.180> remounted<00:02:27.720> into<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.960> cabinet

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
when it's remounted into the cabinet

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.550 
when it's remounted into the cabinet
it<00:02:29.130> sits<00:02:29.810> appropriately<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:30.960> cabinet<00:02:31.410> so

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
it sits appropriately in the cabinet so

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160 
it sits appropriately in the cabinet so
that<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.770> logo<00:02:32.300> sits<00:02:33.300> straight<00:02:33.450> across<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:34.020> it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170

little<00:04:07.950> bit<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.250> tricky<00:04:08.490> part<00:04:08.700> here<00:04:08.880> on

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
little bit of the tricky part here on

little bit of the tricky part here on
this<00:04:09.150> one<00:04:09.330> we<00:04:10.290> want<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.530> nice<00:04:10.709> black<00:04:11.640> glue<00:04:11.910> line

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
this one we want a nice black glue line

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.220 
this one we want a nice black glue line
to<00:04:12.209> go<00:04:12.330> around<00:04:12.600> there<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.080> looks

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
to go around there so that it looks

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.110 
to go around there so that it looks
factory<00:04:13.650> this<00:04:14.580> takes<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.820> little<00:04:14.910> bit<00:04:15.030> of

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
factory this takes a little bit of

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.300 
factory this takes a little bit of
practice<00:04:15.530> but<00:04:16.530> if<00:04:16.620> you're<00:04:16.739> careful<00:04:16.859> with<00:04:17.160> it

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
practice but if you're careful with it

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.430 
practice but if you're careful with it
it's<00:04:17.640> not<00:04:17.730> too<00:04:18.060> difficult<00:04:18.320> usually<00:04:19.320> we'll

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
it's not too difficult usually we'll

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.650 
it's not too difficult usually we'll
start<00:04:19.799> at<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.580> bottom<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.060> logo<00:04:21.390> on<00:04:21.540> the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
start at the bottom of the logo on the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.540 
start at the bottom of the logo on the
cap<00:04:21.840> here<00:04:22.169> and

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
cap here and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.160 
cap here and
squeeze<00:04:24.550> an<00:04:24.760> even<00:04:25.150> amount<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.540> adhesive<00:04:25.690> all

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
squeeze an even amount of adhesive all

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.700 
squeeze an even amount of adhesive all
the<00:04:26.320> way<00:04:26.440> around<00:04:26.740> spinning<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.670> speaker<00:04:28.090> as

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
the way around spinning the speaker as

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:38.070 
the way around spinning the speaker as
we<00:04:29.710> work<00:04:29.950> around<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.770> let<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:36.040> adhesive<00:04:37.080> rest

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
we work around and let the adhesive rest

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.870 
we work around and let the adhesive rest
into<00:04:38.380> place<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:39.070> don't<00:04:39.160> want<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:39.430> force<00:04:39.670> it

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
into place you don't want to force it

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.760 
into place you don't want to force it
and<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.870> just<00:04:41.110> takes<00:04:41.320> a<00:04:41.410> little<00:04:41.530> bit<00:04:41.680> of

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
and it just takes a little bit of

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.770 
and it just takes a little bit of
adhesive<00:04:41.950> to<00:04:42.280> make<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.490> work<00:04:42.610> properly<00:04:42.780> so

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
adhesive to make it work properly so

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.090 
adhesive to make it work properly so
this<00:04:43.900> is<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.140> look<00:04:44.290> you<00:04:44.410> want<00:04:44.560> at<00:04:44.710> this<00:04:44.830> point

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
this is the look you want at this point

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.930 
this is the look you want at this point
and<00:04:45.790> we'll<00:04:46.480> need<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.720> let<00:04:46.870> this<00:04:47.020> sit<00:04:47.320> overnight

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
and we'll need to let this sit overnight

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.820 
and we'll need to let this sit overnight
before<00:04:48.940> we<00:04:49.270> can<00:04:49.480> reinstall<00:04:50.140> this<00:04:50.350> back<00:04:50.590> into

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
before we can reinstall this back into

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.010 
before we can reinstall this back into
the<00:04:51.040> cabinet<00:04:51.400> but<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.180> is<00:04:52.330> exactly<00:04:52.480> what<00:04:52.900> you

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
the cabinet but that is exactly what you

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.190 
the cabinet but that is exactly what you
want<00:04:53.230> right<00:04:53.980> there<00:04:54.040> on<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.580> eb<00:04:54.850> caps<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.600> lot<00:04:56.110> of
