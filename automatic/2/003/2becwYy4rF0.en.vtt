working the whole time when you're doing
those<00:02:13.819> reps<00:02:14.150> not<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:14.959> one<00:02:15.020> lift

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
those reps not just in that one lift

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.920 
those reps not just in that one lift
were<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.489> going<00:02:16.819> up<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.239> controlling<00:02:17.840> it

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930

were you going up and controlling it
back<00:02:18.140> down<00:02:18.760> but<00:02:19.760> think<00:02:20.720> about<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:21.170> especially

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
back down but think about it especially

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.070 
back down but think about it especially
I<00:02:21.770> do<00:02:21.920> ten<00:02:22.250> sets<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.580> ten<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.120> I'm<00:02:23.540> going<00:02:23.930> up

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
I do ten sets of ten so I'm going up

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.890 
I do ten sets of ten so I'm going up
coming<00:02:24.440> back<00:02:24.590> down<00:02:25.000> ten<00:02:26.000> times<00:02:26.390> with<00:02:28.510> with<00:02:29.510> a

coming back down ten times with with a

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.890 
coming back down ten times with with a
moderate<00:02:30.470> weight<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:31.400> how<00:02:32.000> come<00:02:32.239> my<00:02:32.360> court<00:02:32.660> not

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
moderate weight so how come my court not

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.830 
moderate weight so how come my court not
be<00:02:33.170> strong<00:02:33.590> by<00:02:34.340> constantly<00:02:35.120> maintaining

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
be strong by constantly maintaining

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.840 
be strong by constantly maintaining
weight<00:02:36.290> okay

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
weight okay

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.100 
weight okay
that's<00:02:38.600> how<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> think<00:02:39.050> about<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.900> word

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
that's how I think about it and the word

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.759 
that's how I think about it and the word
maintaining<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.190> very<00:02:43.489> important<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:45.290> me<00:02:45.500> and

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
maintaining is very important to me and

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.240 
maintaining is very important to me and
I<00:02:45.920> use<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.370> word<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.910> lot<00:02:47.239> because<00:02:48.250> thinking

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
I use that word a lot because thinking

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.530 
I use that word a lot because thinking
about<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.670> way<00:02:49.910> if<00:02:50.769> if<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:52.160> can<00:02:52.400> maintain<00:02:52.730> a

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
about this way if if you can maintain a

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.180 
about this way if if you can maintain a
weight<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:56.150> just<00:02:56.959> hold<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.470> for<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.950> certain

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
weight and just hold it for a certain

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.020 
weight and just hold it for a certain
amount<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.640> time<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.360> a<00:03:00.730> certain<00:03:01.730> amount<00:03:01.760> of

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
amount of time and a certain amount of

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.240 
amount of time and a certain amount of
time<00:03:02.239> then<00:03:02.540> what<00:03:03.170> do<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.440> think<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:03.860> can<00:03:04.040> do

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250

maintain weight well building that core

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.770 
maintain weight well building that core
to<00:03:24.799> maintain<00:03:25.280> weight<00:03:25.579> is<00:03:25.989> everything<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:29.090> like

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
to maintain weight is everything so like

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.890 
to maintain weight is everything so like
I<00:03:29.900> said<00:03:29.959> my<00:03:30.530> touching<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.400> going<00:03:31.900> constantly

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
I said my touching and going constantly

I said my touching and going constantly
holding<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.410> weight<00:03:33.650> filling<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.310> weight

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
holding that weight filling that weight

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.690 
holding that weight filling that weight
letting<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.120> core<00:03:35.480> hold<00:03:36.290> that<00:03:36.530> weight<00:03:36.829> okay

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
letting that core hold that weight okay

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.720 
letting that core hold that weight okay
and<00:03:37.970> when<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:38.269> say<00:03:38.510> core<00:03:38.810> it's<00:03:39.049> here<00:03:39.560> okay

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
and when I say core it's here okay

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.810 
and when I say core it's here okay
some<00:03:41.480> people<00:03:41.750> don't<00:03:41.900> think<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.410> know<00:03:42.820> they

some people don't think you know they

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.460 
some people don't think you know they
should<00:03:44.030> go<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.299> should<00:03:44.329> call<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:44.720> cool<00:03:45.170> but

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
should go you should call that cool but

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.500 
should go you should call that cool but
that's<00:03:46.040> core<00:03:46.310> that's<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.730> central<00:03:47.180> part<00:03:47.420> of

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
that's core that's the central part of

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.759 
that's core that's the central part of
your<00:03:47.630> body<00:03:47.810> that<00:03:48.019> connects<00:03:48.380> everything

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
big deal as force controlling that

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.590 
big deal as force controlling that
misses<00:04:03.260> for<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.709> building<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.850> core<00:04:07.480> like<00:04:08.480> I

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
misses for is building that core like I

limitless filling of Drive is if you
have<00:05:04.139> correct<00:05:04.590> technique<00:05:05.069> so<00:05:05.370> you<00:05:06.210> have<00:05:06.750> to

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
have correct technique so you have to

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.689 
have correct technique so you have to
have<00:05:07.020> good<00:05:07.349> technique<00:05:07.740> in<00:05:07.919> order<00:05:08.099> to<00:05:08.400> do<00:05:08.520> that

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
have good technique in order to do that

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.969 
have good technique in order to do that
it's<00:05:08.909> about<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.389> balance<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.080> body<00:05:10.110> so

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
it's about the balance of the body so

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.719 
it's about the balance of the body so
the<00:05:11.610> weight<00:05:12.229> the<00:05:13.229> bar<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.190> body<00:05:14.430> has<00:05:14.699> to

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
the weight the bar and the body has to

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.670 
the weight the bar and the body has to
be<00:05:14.879> one<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.599> that's<00:05:16.080> what<00:05:16.259> a<00:05:16.289> lot<00:05:16.440> of<00:05:16.500> people

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
be one and that's what a lot of people

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.159 
be one and that's what a lot of people
don't<00:05:16.979> give<00:05:17.219> especially<00:05:18.210> in<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.780> technique

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
don't give especially in the technique

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.939 
don't give especially in the technique
that<00:05:19.199> I<00:05:19.440> talked<00:05:19.680> about<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.280> deadlift<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:22.650> my

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
that I talked about and deadlift and my

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.010 
that I talked about and deadlift and my
positioning<00:05:23.580> I'll<00:05:24.060> make<00:05:24.330> sure<00:05:24.690> I'm<00:05:24.870> making

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
positioning I'll make sure I'm making

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.649 
positioning I'll make sure I'm making
sure<00:05:25.349> that<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.680> body<00:05:25.919> in<00:05:26.099> the<00:05:26.190> bar<00:05:26.400> is<00:05:26.550> one<00:05:26.880> so

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
sure that the body in the bar is one so

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:33.559 
sure that the body in the bar is one so
the<00:05:28.380> body<00:05:28.590> have<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:28.889> balance<00:05:29.190> out<00:05:30.650> so<00:05:32.449> in<00:05:33.449> order

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
the body have to balance out so in order

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.899 
the body have to balance out so in order
to<00:05:33.750> get<00:05:33.990> that<00:05:34.169> that<00:05:34.500> real<00:05:34.919> strong<00:05:35.279> core<00:05:35.610> make

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
to get that that real strong core make

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.670 
to get that that real strong core make
sure<00:05:36.060> you<00:05:36.210> do<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.630> technique<00:05:37.110> correctly<00:05:37.380> and

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
sure you do the technique correctly and

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.149 
sure you do the technique correctly and
you<00:05:40.680> you<00:05:41.130> create<00:05:41.639> the<00:05:42.740> leverage<00:05:43.740> that<00:05:43.770> you

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
you you create the leverage that you

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.480 
you you create the leverage that you
need<00:05:44.370> and<00:05:44.729> you<00:05:45.000> will<00:05:45.029> be<00:05:45.930> able<00:05:46.139> to<00:05:46.500> train<00:05:47.039> that

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
need and you will be able to train that

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:55.100 
need and you will be able to train that
core<00:05:48.240> if<00:05:49.580> if<00:05:50.690> you<00:05:51.690> continue<00:05:52.259> with<00:05:52.469> that<00:05:54.110> I'll

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
core if if you continue with that I'll

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.050 
core if if you continue with that I'll
touch<00:05:55.319> the<00:05:55.560> legs<00:05:55.830> when<00:05:56.099> you<00:05:56.190> coming<00:05:56.520> down<00:05:56.550> and

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
touch the legs when you coming down and

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.480 
touch the legs when you coming down and
don't<00:05:57.750> let<00:05:58.110> the<00:05:58.289> weight<00:05:58.500> bring<00:05:58.800> you<00:05:58.979> down<00:05:59.219> you

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
don't let the weight bring you down you

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.550 
don't let the weight bring you down you
bring<00:05:59.789> the<00:06:00.000> weight<00:06:00.180> down<00:06:00.210> so<00:06:03.229> with<00:06:04.229> core

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
bring the weight down so with core

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.379 
bring the weight down so with core
strength<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:05.610> strengthening<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:06.240> core

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389
