just<00:03:51.750> me<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.530> end<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:53.159> get<00:03:53.879> why<00:03:54.060> they're

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
just me in the end I get why they're

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.820 
just me in the end I get why they're
doing<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.720> they're<00:03:54.780> trying<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.290> make<00:03:55.379> sure<00:03:55.620> the

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
doing it they're trying to make sure the

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.250 
doing it they're trying to make sure the
Xbox<00:03:56.340> remains<00:03:56.760> relevant<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.540> competitive

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
Xbox remains relevant and competitive

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.420 
Xbox remains relevant and competitive
but<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:58.920> think<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.810> the<00:04:00.810> long<00:04:01.049> run<00:04:01.189> this<00:04:02.189> is

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
but I think in the long run this is

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.399 
but I think in the long run this is
going<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.640> bite<00:04:02.879> them<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.269> ass<00:04:03.360> I<00:04:03.840> don't

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
going to bite them in the ass I don't

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:05.960 
going to bite them in the ass I don't
know<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.500> think<00:04:05.010> they<00:04:05.099> should<00:04:05.280> drop<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.640> parity

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
know I think they should drop the parity

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.399 
know I think they should drop the parity
close<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.420> be<00:04:06.540> perfectly<00:04:06.900> honest<00:04:07.200> with<00:04:07.319> you
