 to download the game already but what 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:35.500
 I'm climbing 55 minutes and weighs 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.420
 300 41.4 megabits or megabytes and good 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.150
 you download it and leave them a 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.580
 sip point file that can extract it 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.860
 with winrar or winzip in this case I 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.739
 I have installed winrar remember 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.660
 install it if not we can not extract 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.129
 our files good since what 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 let's have a folder we click on 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.660
 right and extract here 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.340
 we wait for a moment that if you do not 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.460
 extract in this case will leave us a 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.210
 folder another folder if you want or can 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.210
 extract on the desktop or just like me 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.040
 in another folder aside and let good 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.710
 wait a moment for the end of 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.909
 extract our files 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.150
 that if you start a little 349 megabits 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.070
 megabytes if there are enough download 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.440
 I do not know how long it takes depends on the internet 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.350
 of each and good in this 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.509
 folder also comes the direct x 81 that 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.090
 they should install it but good who 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.100
 Now we see it has already been extracted 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.950
 and we're going to open our folder in the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.080
 what will these files of the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.149
 which are we going to execute the one is 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.240
 folding bleu click and we will ask 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.360
 permissions we give you yes 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.799
 and if not open this window in here we 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.470
 it's going to seem like the 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.200
 windows installer 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.020
 is the game of throwing your park the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.700
 graphics are not not very good are 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.140
 regular because good this game already 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.840
 have the time in case they expected 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.300
 were they like here not 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.370
 they are less hd for you to understand but 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.239
 well the game is very entertaining 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.030
 I like to play it 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.099
 I entertain myself in my spare time when 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.440
 I do not have to play but well we're going 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.460
 to see what is left over from the installer 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.040
 windows 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.050
 and well , our 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.510
 installer we will give in next 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.440
 here we see the license agreement if 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.980
 he does not want to read 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.500
 read it I'm not going to read the edar that yes 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.880
 appears this we read next here I what 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.830
 I will leave in this folder 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.470
 if they want to change it in examining and 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.140
 they choose their folder and well I will work 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.790
 if I'm going to give the next one here 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.770
 next I leave everything as is and good 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.430
 we will begin our process of 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.430
 installation 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.380
 it will take around 12 minutes three 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.690
 minutes for the five minutes and our 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.360
 computer is very slow but they continue 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.970
 saves very quickly look at her and nothing 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.040
 more than it reaches 100% if they go half slow 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.620
 but 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.909
 Well, it does not take long, I'm going to pass the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.420
 video so it does not get so long and 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.760

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.030
 message that appears I resumed the video 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.709

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.270

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.770
 facilities will look like this that 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.540
 want is to create a shortcut you 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.880

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.970

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.520
 message which tells us is needed 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.560
 microsoft say that x 8.1 and you're 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.270

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.680
