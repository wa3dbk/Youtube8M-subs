00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.620
 Good morning friends and friends of the 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.950
 channel the kitchen of joselo on youtube 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.890
 today we are going to prepare 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.990
 a cake 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 of fruits 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.400
 initially it was going to be a country of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.710
 apple but since we have this dough 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.710
 for empanadas but ready-made dough 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.200
 that we can use as for cakes or 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.750
 as also as its name says 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.480
 empanadas 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.500
 I have here banana or orange banana 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.130
 and apple 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.130
 sesame 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.360
 ground cinnamon 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.280
 aniseed aniseed sugar and sugar then hands 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.160
 the work we are going to extend the mass we are going to 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.710
 cut the fruit and we're going to add the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.130
 sugar on the fruit to make the 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.400
 effect of the here we have already the mass 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.620
 all right 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.230
 we are just going to spread it over the 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.700
 mold we spread vegetable paper 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.600
 In our country 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.600
 chopped up 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.610
 I do not know how our mass has been 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.610
 vertical shape not horizontal 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.620
 a large mass and over the center 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:49.210
 we will apply the fruits for this cake 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.750
 fruit cake in the kitchen too 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.900
 we already have the apples cut 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.470
 with which we are going to make a bed of 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.010
 apples 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.670
 thus 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.260
 always from the center 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.190
 only with apples 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.190
 cut 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.710
 thus 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.910
 we have put the first layer of apple 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:20.430
 let's add some anise 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.859
 a bit of ground cinnamon 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.859
 on the first layer of fruit 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.680
 and a little sesame 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.450
 about this let's add focus if 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.700
 we have brown sugar 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.210
 or blonde as you want to call the best 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:47.120
 in this case white that is the same 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:49.310
 for the effect of honey on the fruit 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.440
 because this kitchen now we 're going with 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.799
 the bands ready for slicing let's 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.290
 to cut the banana or banana and let's go 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.400
 to incorporate 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.400
 over the apple 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.380
 making a flame 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.540
 with all the slices 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.340
 of the banana or the banana 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.160
 good about this layer 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.050
 Banana banana 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.050
 we add more sugar 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.330
 require the sweet a little cinnamon 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.430
 and the orange that I cut in 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.430
 squares 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.810
 that it will be cooked in the oven and 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.860
 will release just a little juice because not 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.200
 we want it to be watery bread 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.780
 and we have been and so we put the orange 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.830
 that we have continued to sting 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.830
 a square 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.260
 about this orange 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.260
 we add sugar 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.280
 we go with the sugar and now we are going to 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.820
 cover 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.019
 one is after our fruit cake 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.019
 it can help 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:36.200
 but I'll fix it soon 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.200
 but now the edges will do the same no 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.839
 the fingers 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:53.379
 as in the mass and in asia 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.509

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.360

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.800
 will 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.650
 the surface 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.300

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.820
 of fruits 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.180

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.810
 Now I will prick some holes 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.320
