now do people live on the moon or not is
this<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> some<00:00:30.689> pixelated<00:00:31.700> nonsense<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:33.059> is

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690

that a structure or two or a thousand on

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.110 
that a structure or two or a thousand on
the<00:00:37.200> moon<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.309> right<00:00:38.460> above<00:00:38.700> your<00:00:38.910> head

I<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.000> called<00:00:42.210> Petraeus<00:00:43.129> Canyon<00:00:44.129> or

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
I think it's called Petraeus Canyon or

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
I think it's called Petraeus Canyon or
crater<00:00:45.030> Petraeus<00:00:45.750> Cait<00:00:46.050> crater<00:00:47.059> right<00:00:48.059> above

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
crater Petraeus Cait crater right above

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.120 
looking right at them they can see us
but<00:03:06.330> we've<00:03:06.570> been<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:06.990> blinded<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.740> we've<00:03:07.890> been

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
but we've been so blinded and we've been

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.820 
but we've been so blinded and we've been
so<00:03:08.450> bullied<00:03:09.450> really<00:03:09.870> into<00:03:10.200> thinking<00:03:10.650> that

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
so bullied really into thinking that

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.710 
so bullied really into thinking that
it's<00:03:11.010> not<00:03:11.070> true<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.760> can't<00:03:12.030> possibly<00:03:12.270> be

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
it's not true and it can't possibly be

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.990 
it's not true and it can't possibly be
true<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.710> lot<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.920> people<00:03:14.250> jester<00:03:14.730> they

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
true that a lot of people jester they

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.150 
true that a lot of people jester they
can't<00:03:15.540> see<00:03:15.690> what<00:03:15.840> their<00:03:15.990> eyes<00:03:16.170> show<00:03:16.440> them<00:03:16.680> so

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
can't see what their eyes show them so

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.410 
can't see what their eyes show them so
those<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.670> who<00:03:17.700> couldn't<00:03:18.090> see<00:03:18.240> what<00:03:18.390> I

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
those of you who couldn't see what I

showed you last night that pipe line

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.490 
showed you last night that pipe line
coming<00:03:20.370> out<00:03:20.580> of<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> top<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.330> pyramid<00:03:21.570> going

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
coming out of the top of a pyramid going

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.140 
coming out of the top of a pyramid going
across<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.980> moon<00:03:23.160> who<00:03:23.610> knows<00:03:23.820> what<00:03:24.030> that

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
across the moon who knows what that

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
across the moon who knows what that
really<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.540> but<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:24.990> what<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.380> see<00:03:25.590> there

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
here is a structure of central structure

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.990 
here is a structure of central structure
on<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.840> surface<00:03:37.020> of<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.470> Moon<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:38.850> not

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
on the surface of the Moon this is not

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.550 
on the surface of the Moon this is not
the<00:03:39.180> only<00:03:39.300> thing<00:03:39.600> here<00:03:39.870> but<00:03:40.050> this<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.350> all<00:03:40.470> I'm
