my<00:01:45.390> opinion<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.899> selfish<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.130> put

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
my opinion was selfish and when you put

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.550 
my opinion was selfish and when you put
your<00:01:47.909> team<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.390> risk<00:01:48.689> late<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> game<00:01:49.170> like

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
think that John Tortorella now has a

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.300 
think that John Tortorella now has a
meeting<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.149> Sean<00:01:57.479> Avery<00:01:58.189> continues<00:01:59.189> to

define<00:01:59.670> his<00:01:59.939> role<00:02:00.149> given<00:02:00.360> another

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
define his role given another

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.389 
define his role given another
opportunity<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.619> he'll<00:02:01.950> be<00:02:02.040> back<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.219> the
