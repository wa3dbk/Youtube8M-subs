00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.049
 that they are so interesting and so beautiful and me 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.539

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.569

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.759
 but some things that i really like you 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.250
 just get emotional about how 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.140
 miraculous 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.000
 interesting that's what I look so 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.549
 I find it difficult to start blogging 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.320
 him and I really am a very deep dark 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.840
 and I do a lot of philosophy 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.189
 and of course to be happy to share 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.570
 I find it difficult to put into words 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.820
 or I don't know if people either 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.070

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.630
 in a vlog we see it is from 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.230
 very large part of who I am 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.150
 and we'll see 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.950
 to do but now I am feeling well 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.110
 slugs 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.240

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.040

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.200

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.850
 what you whether 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.310

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.510
 ok would you rather be famous orb in the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.000
 best friend or someone who schedules 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.370
 so bailey famous or legged 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.080
 prefer the best friend girlfriend of 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.660
 someone who is very famous 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.250
 I think I prefer to be the best 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.260
 friend of someone who brothers 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.570
 let me say it differently i need 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.660
 not to be famous it seems real to me 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.670
 not nice that you can't live a normal life 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.860
 say but I want to be known 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.910
 but I do n't really have to be famous 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.730
 do you understand 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.930
 so a difference so and you this I want 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.709
 also of the some things that i think 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.540
 from yes 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.920
 are there people who don't think so? 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.030
 I really wonder 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.760
 of course the people do it too 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.890

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.860
 in alder 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.390
 for who should lay here and notting hill 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.900
 although it actually says stupid 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.760
 So you would prefer for all that you 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.660
 all are famous and rich 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.430
 that's all 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.830
 or would you rather have the rest of you 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.750
 live with your loved one with that one 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.239
 person and nothing else 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.739
 then you choose for love or not yes 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.770
 you are famous there and you have a lot of fat 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.390
 money and nothing else 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.790
 neither does anyone share a blemish 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.709
 nevertheless everyone opts for it 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.020
 where your beloved picks up brings 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.910
 this is interesting would you rather quite 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.280
 go far back in time and you 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.280

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.280
 where I come from and how they got back then 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.720

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.300
