00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello to you asana, I recently came out 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.860
 application for windows phone a but 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.800
 Purely for the phone lumia here is the application 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.029
 which allows you to control gestures in 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.199
 some applications in particular 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.500
 Caller call it Destur with beta 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.720
 so far but it is very, very developed 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.940
 by English, which functions are shown 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:36.120
 there is also possible to answer calls and well 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.820
 come on now it's just with you and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.460
 check how functions work 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.579
 I will say right away they are still not working 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.579
 ok, so here I see you phone 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:57.300
 blocked state here we are calling 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.879
 take the tray fly here is like 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.579
 imitate what we bring to your ear but i 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:09.260
 I'll try to bring this to my ear here 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:14.220
 so here we all do with you answered 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:17.790
 you just need to get it better where 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.070
 so that everything was ok 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.670
 there is so in this position you will 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.409
 does the ear funk have to work when we 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.759
 can we have it like that everyone wants a signal 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.009
 I will drink it because the phone is very 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.900
 close is therefore by no but you 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.119
 see the fact that it all works very well 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.220
 when we turn it over like this 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.700
 we have him turn over he must 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.630
 After all, turn off the microphone, he turns off 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.329
 vibration is everything here everything works everything 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.790
 very great no feature very 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:59.219
 much like that is, you do not need 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.680
 make and excess movement when in winter 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.049
 Not all phones are wearing gloves 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.649
 support here is an example of cheap phones 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.700
 they do not support the work of gloves and 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.960
 so you don't even need to do anything 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.740
 hands just bring to your ear 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.830
 everything is all very awesome everything works 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.330
 Well that's pretty good so far, that even in beta 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.340
 for some can phones 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.240
 optimizes but everything works for me 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.360
 great this is very very cool 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:36.240
 application but advise everyone to download 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:39.090
 Whom lumi 630 for example she without sensor 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.020
 approximation will of course be sad then 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.090
 that there it will not function and a 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.920
 so on all the other siphon works on 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.200
 who have this sensor 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.730
 here that is it is very cool even if 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.860
 the square to work gloves has everything 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.920
 equal typos can be fat they 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.440
 will work with you we are with her for your 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.390
 phone and so you bring all the ficken 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.240
 works i mean you all the parameters of the function 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.190
 now that there may not be everything but 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.100
 I think everything would be all 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.100
 that is, we put it down so it turns on 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.450
 speaker here is the main speakerphone 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.980
 when we turn it over it is a speaker 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.760
 our microphone stays on and off 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.550
 this example so that if the noise is to 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.050
 only you heard 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.120
 back we take a cuck we bring it all 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.360
 turns off and only from this 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.910
 dynamics and this is very very cool 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.220
 the app with all its video download 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.950
 sprawled of course but it really 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.350
 cool application called destur with 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:52.110
 beta 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:54.030
 so all shaking him 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.210
 was sled don't forget to subscribe 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.130
 put like 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:04.640
