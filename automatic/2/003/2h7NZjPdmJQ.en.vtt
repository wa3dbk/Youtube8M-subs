00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
much it and you can just transform it

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.089 
much it and you can just transform it
you<00:02:01.879> know<00:02:01.970> right<00:02:02.390> here<00:02:02.470> there's<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.530> eyes<00:02:03.709> and

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
you know right here there's the eyes and

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.180 
you know right here there's the eyes and
you<00:02:04.190> lift<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:04.489> up<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:06.140> one<00:02:06.289> thing<00:02:06.470> it's

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
you lift this up and the one thing it's

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.650 
you lift this up and the one thing it's
kind<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.550> weird<00:02:07.789> is<00:02:07.879> that<00:02:07.910> these<00:02:08.239> scissors

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
kind of weird is that these scissors

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.229 
kind of weird is that these scissors
hands<00:02:09.020> don't<00:02:09.349> actually<00:02:09.560> open<00:02:10.250> up<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:10.789> all<00:02:11.060> you

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
hands don't actually open up so all you

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.860 
hands don't actually open up so all you
do<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.450> just<00:02:11.599> turn<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:13.819> that's<00:02:14.660> pretty

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
do is just turn this this that's pretty

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.600 
do is just turn this this that's pretty
much<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.200> but<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.709> also<00:02:15.860> has<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.099> hard<00:02:16.400> time

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
much it but it also has a hard time

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.030 
much it but it also has a hard time
standing<00:02:16.910> up<00:02:17.180> sometimes<00:02:17.690> best<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:18.920> like

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
standing up sometimes best to do it like

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.220 
standing up sometimes best to do it like
this<00:02:19.250> but<00:02:19.580> if<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.790> do<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.000> like<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.230> then

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
this but if you do it like this then

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.750 
this but if you do it like this then
it's<00:02:21.410> gonna<00:02:21.500> drop<00:02:21.769> down<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.340> gonna<00:02:22.459> cry

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
it's gonna drop down and it's gonna cry
