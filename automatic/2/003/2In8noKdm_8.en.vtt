 I have already started reading it and just 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.280
 I can't tear myself away because I don't 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.290
 absolutely was a fan of leonardo di caprio 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.540
 but when i started reading this book when 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.000
 I started reading his biography, I realized that 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.440
 this is a man of legend so here is a very 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.540
 I advise you this book because she 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.200
 really very interesting but I can 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.200

 I know that there is an adaptation of this book 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.299

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.720

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.109

 I really wanted to read just something on 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.470
 English but decided to start of course 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.450
 but it is very interesting from fairy tales 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.790
 that when I read there are some phrases 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.880
 which I don't know here anyway 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.270
 surely their translation is displayed below 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.490
 so it is very convenient I advise everyone 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.590

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.960
