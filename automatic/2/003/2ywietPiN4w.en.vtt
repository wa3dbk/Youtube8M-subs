attempt at a reconstructed tup board

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.280 
attempt at a reconstructed tup board
where<00:00:36.230> game<00:00:36.760> touch<00:00:37.760> just<00:00:38.480> means<00:00:38.690> board<00:00:41.290> but

where game touch just means board but

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.610 
where game touch just means board but
the<00:00:42.730> it's<00:00:43.730> quite<00:00:43.970> similar<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.870> chess<00:00:45.110> you<00:00:45.440> have

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
the it's quite similar to chess you have

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.369 
the it's quite similar to chess you have
a<00:00:45.650> sort<00:00:46.040> of<00:00:46.100> king<00:00:46.970> piece<00:00:47.390> in<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.720> center<00:00:48.080> here

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
a sort of king piece in the center here

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.430 
a sort of king piece in the center here
and<00:00:51.070> these<00:00:52.070> are<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.420> defenders<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:53.690> these

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
and these are the defenders and these

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.069 
and these are the defenders and these
white<00:00:55.070> pieces<00:00:55.390> are<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.719> attackers<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
white pieces are the attackers and the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.260 
white pieces are the attackers and the
attackers<00:01:00.079> are<00:01:00.110> trying<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:01.010> surround<00:01:01.879> the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
attackers are trying to surround the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.410 
attackers are trying to surround the
king<00:01:02.539> and<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:03.559> King<00:01:03.800> is<00:01:04.100> trying<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:04.699> get<00:01:04.910> to

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
king and the King is trying to get to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.820 
king and the King is trying to get to
the<00:01:05.509> outside<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.020> board<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.570> whoever<00:01:08.830> is

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
the outside of the board so whoever is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.999 
the outside of the board so whoever is
playing<00:01:09.979> defense<00:01:10.960> they<00:01:11.960> get<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.200> King<00:01:12.410> to<00:01:12.920> the

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
playing defense they get the King to the

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.510 
playing defense they get the King to the
edge<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.369> board<00:01:13.610> then<00:01:14.270> they<00:01:14.509> went<00:01:14.869> if

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
edge of the board then they went if

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.150 
edge of the board then they went if
whoever<00:01:16.520> is<00:01:16.670> playing<00:01:16.820> attack<00:01:17.680> surrounds<00:01:18.680> the

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
whoever is playing attack surrounds the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.850 
whoever is playing attack surrounds the
King<00:01:19.399> and<00:01:19.640> they<00:01:20.450> win<00:01:20.660> and<00:01:21.289> you<00:01:21.500> can<00:01:21.530> capture

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
King and they win and you can capture

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:30.820 
King and they win and you can capture
pieces<00:01:22.610> by<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:25.310> like<00:01:25.550> if<00:01:28.179> you<00:01:29.179> surround<00:01:29.959> one

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
pieces by so like if you surround one

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.430 
pieces by so like if you surround one
piece<00:01:32.500> this<00:01:33.500> piece<00:01:33.740> could<00:01:34.009> then<00:01:34.160> be<00:01:34.310> captured

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
piece this piece could then be captured

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.100 
piece this piece could then be captured
things<00:01:36.440> like<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.830> obviously<00:01:37.459> the<00:01:38.030> rules<00:01:38.330> we

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
things like that obviously the rules we

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.960 
things like that obviously the rules we
don't<00:01:39.229> really<00:01:39.590> know<00:01:39.920> what<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.550> rules<00:01:40.729> are

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
don't really know what the rules are

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.089 
don't really know what the rules are
because<00:01:41.599> they<00:01:42.259> weren't<00:01:42.500> written<00:01:42.619> down<00:01:42.830> and

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
because they weren't written down and

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.210 
because they weren't written down and
there<00:01:44.030> may<00:01:44.149> have<00:01:44.240> been<00:01:44.360> many<00:01:44.929> different

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
there may have been many different

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.070 
there may have been many different
variations<00:01:46.220> but<00:01:46.429> this<00:01:47.179> is<00:01:47.360> just<00:01:47.569> sort<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:47.810> one

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
variations but this is just sort of one

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.880 
variations but this is just sort of one
attempt<00:01:49.009> at<00:01:49.160> a<00:01:49.910> reconstruction<00:01:50.599> of<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.679> game

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
attempt at a reconstruction of the game

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.260 
attempt at a reconstruction of the game
and<00:01:52.160> its<00:01:52.429> rules<00:01:53.860> we<00:01:54.860> do<00:01:55.039> have<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.849> know<00:01:55.970> pieces

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
and its rules we do have you know pieces

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.160 
and its rules we do have you know pieces
and<00:01:56.750> boards<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.739> some<00:01:58.220> images<00:01:59.179> here<00:01:59.780> and

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
and boards and some images here and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.240 
and boards and some images here and
there<00:02:00.560> of<00:02:01.250> various<00:02:01.640> board<00:02:01.880> games<00:02:02.229> but<00:02:03.250> it's

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
there of various board games but it's

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.600 
there of various board games but it's
hard<00:02:04.489> to<00:02:04.729> know<00:02:05.119> exactly<00:02:05.149> how<00:02:06.340> they<00:02:07.340> would<00:02:07.489> have

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
hard to know exactly how they would have

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.350 
hard to know exactly how they would have
been<00:02:07.729> played<00:02:09.759> one<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:10.940> interesting

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
been played one of the interesting

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.479 
been played one of the interesting
things<00:02:11.660> about<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.170> scenario<00:02:12.620> presented<00:02:12.770> in

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
things about the scenario presented in

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.970 
things about the scenario presented in
this<00:02:13.819> board<00:02:14.090> game<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.349> king<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.830> his

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
this board game of the king and his

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.850 
this board game of the king and his
retainers<00:02:16.040> in<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.879> center<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
retainers in the center and the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.460 
retainers in the center and the
attackers<00:02:19.400> coming<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.940> from<00:02:20.150> outside<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.780> that

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
attackers coming in from outside is that

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.160 
attackers coming in from outside is that
it's<00:02:21.770> very<00:02:21.950> similar<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:23.060> situation<00:02:23.360> found

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
it's very similar to a situation found

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.230 
it's very similar to a situation found
in<00:02:24.520> many<00:02:25.520> sagas<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:27.440> king<00:02:28.150> having<00:02:29.150> two

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
in many sagas of a king having two

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.030 
in many sagas of a king having two
and<00:02:30.330> an<00:02:30.630> attack<00:02:31.350> on<00:02:31.590> his<00:02:31.920> Hall<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
and an attack on his Hall and the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.360 
and an attack on his Hall and the
burning<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.670> halls<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:37.050> very<00:02:37.320> common<00:02:38.070> trying

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
burning of halls is very common trying

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.440 
burning of halls is very common trying
to<00:02:38.490> burn<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:39.060> king<00:02:39.810> or<00:02:40.140> or<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.770> farmer<00:02:41.310> inside<00:02:42.270> his

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
to burn a king or or a farmer inside his

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.560 
to burn a king or or a farmer inside his
Hall<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:43.080> his<00:02:43.350> family<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:43.980> men<00:02:44.240> that's<00:02:45.240> it's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
Hall with his family and men that's it's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.890 
Hall with his family and men that's it's
very<00:02:45.630> very<00:02:46.290> common<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.920> many<00:02:47.400> sagas<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.150> so

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
very very common in many sagas and so

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.800 
very very common in many sagas and so
it's<00:02:49.350> interesting<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:50.010> see<00:02:50.630> essentially<00:02:51.630> that

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
it's interesting to see essentially that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.130 
it's interesting to see essentially that
scenario<00:02:52.590> played<00:02:53.070> out<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.520> board<00:02:53.940> game<00:02:54.150> where

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
scenario played out in board game where

scenario played out in board game where
the<00:02:55.980> king<00:02:56.520> has<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:57.050> escape<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:59.420> it's<00:03:00.420> even

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
the king has to escape it's it's even

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.350 
the king has to escape it's it's even
the<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.230> subject<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.370> famous<00:03:02.610> Finn's
