good<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.700> traffic<00:02:18.120> actually<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.840> know<00:02:18.930> there

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
good in traffic actually you know there

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.480 
good in traffic actually you know there
was<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.410> lot<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.560> talk<00:02:19.800> about<00:02:19.950> how<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.190> car<00:02:20.460> is

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490

going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:20.910> traffic<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.420> my<00:02:21.810> initial

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
going to be in traffic but my initial

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.170 
going to be in traffic but my initial
impression<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.920> pretty<00:02:23.040> good<00:02:23.280> it's

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
impression is that it's pretty good it's

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.480 
impression is that it's pretty good it's
certainly<00:02:24.480> not<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:25.530> know<00:02:25.620> too<00:02:25.650> violent<00:02:26.310> or

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
certainly not you know too violent or

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.340 
certainly not you know too violent or
doesn't<00:02:27.180> bite<00:02:27.300> at<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.540> as<00:02:27.660> aggressively<00:02:28.260> as

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
doesn't bite at you as aggressively as

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.620 
doesn't bite at you as aggressively as
you<00:02:28.500> think<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.920> would<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.210> that's<00:02:30.360> good

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
you think it would so that that's good

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.720 
you think it would so that that's good
as<00:02:30.750> well<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.930> really<00:02:31.230> hope<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.280> car<00:02:32.520> is

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
as well I really hope that the car is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.430 
as well I really hope that the car is
tame<00:02:32.970> enough<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.480> able<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.720> race<00:02:34.050> well<00:02:34.290> with

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.900 
tame enough to be able to race well with
everyone<00:02:34.650> else<00:02:34.950> during<00:02:35.130> race<00:02:35.400> day<00:02:35.610> because

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
everyone else during race day because

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.430 
everyone else during race day because
that's<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:36.840> want<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.380> know

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
that's what you really want you know

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.780 
that's what you really want you know
aside<00:02:37.709> from<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:38.010> speeds<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.400> really<00:02:38.580> want<00:02:38.730> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
aside from the speeds you really want to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.070 
aside from the speeds you really want to
be<00:02:38.880> able<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.090> put<00:02:39.240> on<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.360> good<00:02:39.510> show<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.990> be

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
be able to put on a good show and be

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.780 
be able to put on a good show and be
able<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.320> battle<00:02:40.530> people<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.490> know<00:02:41.610> have

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
able to battle people and you know have

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.610 
able to battle people and you know have
good<00:02:42.030> clean<00:02:42.300> racing<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.020> really<00:02:43.380> think<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
good clean racing and I really think the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.690 
good clean racing and I really think the
car<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:43.800> going<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.010> produce<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.490> think

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
car is going to produce that I think

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.830 
car is going to produce that I think
we're<00:02:44.790> going<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.000> an<00:02:45.150> okay<00:02:45.420> time<00:02:45.600> with

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
we're going to have an okay time with

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.960 
we're going to have an okay time with
that<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.230> that's<00:02:47.130> another<00:02:47.400> side<00:02:47.640> that's<00:02:47.820> just

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
that so that's another side that's just

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.040 
that so that's another side that's just
going<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.300> be<00:02:48.390> developed<00:02:48.810> also

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
going to have to be developed also

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.150

this erika storm

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.729 
this erika storm
I<00:03:07.239> was<00:03:08.239> in<00:03:08.359> a<00:03:08.420> pretty<00:03:08.629> pretty<00:03:08.989> good<00:03:09.260> draft<00:03:09.590> to

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
I was in a pretty pretty good draft to

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.949 
I was in a pretty pretty good draft to
knock<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:09.950> number<00:03:10.400> down<00:03:10.549> so<00:03:10.609> you<00:03:11.030> know<00:03:11.569> we<00:03:11.750> I

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
knock that number down so you know we I

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.839 
knock that number down so you know we I
think<00:03:12.109> we<00:03:12.260> sort<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.650> expected<00:03:13.129> that<00:03:13.159> that<00:03:13.549> that

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
think we sort of expected that that that

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.630 
think we sort of expected that that that
was<00:03:14.030> in<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.299> car<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.680> be<00:03:16.040> honesty<00:03:16.310> we<00:03:16.459> just

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
was in the car and be honesty we just

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.770 
was in the car and be honesty we just
ran<00:03:16.760> out<00:03:16.909> of<00:03:16.939> gear<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.269> mean<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.510> was<00:03:17.629> probably

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
ran out of gear I mean that was probably

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.869 
ran out of gear I mean that was probably
the<00:03:17.900> only<00:03:18.019> reason<00:03:18.409> we<00:03:18.500> didn't<00:03:18.739> go<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.189> 20

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
the only reason we didn't go to 20

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.720 
the only reason we didn't go to 20
something<00:03:20.239> but<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:21.739> know<00:03:21.859> that's<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.459> beat

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
something but you know that's that beat

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.059 
something but you know that's that beat
that<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.329> aside<00:03:23.719> I<00:03:23.780> think<00:03:24.019> our<00:03:24.349> speed<00:03:24.859> on<00:03:24.950> our

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
that that aside I think our speed on our

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.440 
that that aside I think our speed on our
own<00:03:25.189> today<00:03:25.489> was<00:03:25.670> pretty<00:03:25.849> good<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.299> that

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
own today was pretty good and that

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.390 
own today was pretty good and that
that's<00:03:26.569> what<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.590> know<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.980> in<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.159> end<00:03:28.189> is

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
that's what you know that in the end is

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.089 
that's what you know that in the end is
kind<00:03:28.579> of<00:03:28.639> what<00:03:28.760> matters<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:30.799> know<00:03:30.920> we'll

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
kind of what matters so you know we'll

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.500 
kind of what matters so you know we'll
just<00:03:31.129> we'll<00:03:31.459> kind<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:31.760> see<00:03:31.909> how<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.180> how<00:03:32.389> it

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
just we'll kind of see how it how it

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.849 
just we'll kind of see how it how it
plays<00:03:32.689> out<00:03:32.870> through<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.170> rest<00:03:33.319> of<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:33.469> week<00:03:33.590> I

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
plays out through the rest of the week I

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.339 
plays out through the rest of the week I
think<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.849> big<00:03:35.120> thing<00:03:35.150> for<00:03:35.389> us<00:03:35.629> is<00:03:35.930> just<00:03:36.170> you

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
think a big thing for us is just you

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.229 
think a big thing for us is just you
know<00:03:36.439> what<00:03:36.530> last<00:03:36.709> year's<00:03:36.829> car<00:03:37.280> even<00:03:38.120> myself

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
know what last year's car even myself

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.300 
know what last year's car even myself
being<00:03:38.689> a<00:03:38.780> rookie<00:03:38.959> stepping<00:03:39.530> into<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.739> seat<00:03:40.099> with

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
being a rookie stepping into a seat with

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.069 
being a rookie stepping into a seat with
a<00:03:40.340> good<00:03:40.579> team<00:03:40.819> he<00:03:41.389> kind<00:03:41.599> of<00:03:41.659> came<00:03:41.810> here

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079

figuring that you know the car is ninety
percent<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.109> way<00:03:45.169> there<00:03:45.379> already<00:03:45.680> you

know you just got to kind of work on

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.420 
know you just got to kind of work on
that<00:03:47.329> last<00:03:47.510> ten<00:03:47.750> percent<00:03:48.139> whereas<00:03:48.439> now<00:03:48.650> it's

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
that last ten percent whereas now it's

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.830 
that last ten percent whereas now it's
only<00:03:49.579> fifty<00:03:49.970> percent<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.389> way<00:03:50.480> there<00:03:50.720> and

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
only fifty percent of the way there and

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.360 
only fifty percent of the way there and
there's<00:03:50.959> a<00:03:51.049> lot<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.319> things<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:52.010> are<00:03:52.099> still

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
there's a lot of things that are still

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.179 
there's a lot of things that are still
unknowns<00:03:52.819> for<00:03:52.969> us<00:03:53.239> so<00:03:53.599> we<00:03:53.709> got<00:03:54.709> through<00:03:54.919> a<00:03:54.950> few

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
unknowns for us so we got through a few

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:56.379 
unknowns for us so we got through a few
of<00:03:55.219> those<00:03:55.340> things<00:03:55.579> today<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:55.969> we're<00:03:56.239> just
