most people fought before world walking
out<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:17.009> meant<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.630> there

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
course ascending would mean because I

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.850

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
darkness um the the zombies because

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.179 
darkness um the the zombies because
darkness<00:01:29.880> equals<00:01:30.360> evil<00:01:30.770> was<00:01:31.770> linked<00:01:32.100> to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
darkness equals evil was linked to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.760 
darkness equals evil was linked to
darkness<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.350> easy

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
darkness you know you know that easy

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.219 
darkness you know you know that easy
link<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.119> basically<00:01:36.509> that's<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:36.960> most

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
link there so basically that's what most

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.710 
link there so basically that's what most
people<00:01:37.650> thought<00:01:37.860> before<00:01:38.340> first<00:01:39.180> strike<00:01:39.479> came

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
people thought before first strike came

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.510 
people thought before first strike came
up<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.079> or<00:01:40.229> ascension<00:01:40.530> came<00:01:40.890> out<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.280> call

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
up with or ascension came out for call

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.910 
up with or ascension came out for call
of<00:01:41.549> duty<00:01:41.850> black<00:01:41.939> holes<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:43.079> people<00:01:43.590> started

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
of duty black holes then people started

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.370 
of duty black holes then people started
making<00:01:44.280> links<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.759> knock<00:01:44.909> down<00:01:44.939> totem<00:01:45.570> because

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
making links to knock down totem because

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.899 
making links to knock down totem because
before<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.009> turn<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> power<00:01:47.610> on

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
before you turn on the power on

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.069 
before you turn on the power on
ascension<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.560> black<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.310> white<00:01:51.079> ok

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
ascension it is all black and white ok

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.249 
ascension it is all black and white ok
so<00:01:53.149> black<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.180> white<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.600> course<00:01:54.780> would<00:01:55.110> be

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
so black and white of course would be

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.340 
so black and white of course would be
the<00:01:55.409> darkness<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.159> ascend<00:01:56.909> would<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.840> to

the darkness and ascend would be to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.800 
the darkness and ascend would be to
ascend<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.130> rocket<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.579> ascension<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
ascend in the rocket of ascension so a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.220 
ascend in the rocket of ascension so a
lot<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.409> lot<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.619> people<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.000> mum

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
der riese had some reference because

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.870 
der riese had some reference because
they<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:25.740> pictures<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.160> call<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.700> dead

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
they have pictures of call of the dead

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.120 
they have pictures of call of the dead
and<00:02:27.150> pictures<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.110> ascension<00:02:28.650> pictures<00:02:28.980> of

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and pictures of ascension pictures of

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.080 
and pictures of ascension pictures of
key<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.610> der<00:02:29.790> toten<00:02:30.030> etc<00:02:30.690> etc<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:32.090> they

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
key to der toten etc etc so they

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.150 
key to der toten etc etc so they
definitely<00:02:33.450> did<00:02:33.840> plans<00:02:34.110> omnimax<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.830> advance

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
definitely did plans omnimax in advance

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.090 
definitely did plans omnimax in advance
but<00:02:35.820> i'm<00:02:35.940> not<00:02:36.090> sure<00:02:36.150> how<00:02:36.600> if<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.110> was<00:02:37.440> added<00:02:38.010> for

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
but i'm not sure how if it was added for

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.580 
but i'm not sure how if it was added for
hunts<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:39.360> not<00:02:39.480> burn<00:02:39.690> totem<00:02:40.170> was<00:02:40.350> I

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
hunts and it's not burn totem was I

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.620 
hunts and it's not burn totem was I
think<00:02:41.130> not<00:02:41.370> burn<00:02:41.550> totem<00:02:41.880> may<00:02:42.090> have<00:02:42.270> just<00:02:42.450> been

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
think not burn totem may have just been

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.930 
think not burn totem may have just been
a<00:02:42.660> test<00:02:43.020> but<00:02:43.920> I'm<00:02:44.040> not<00:02:44.130> quite<00:02:44.310> sure<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.580> may<00:02:44.730> or

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
a test but I'm not quite sure it may or

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.970 
a test but I'm not quite sure it may or
may<00:02:45.060> not<00:02:45.090> have<00:02:45.420> some<00:02:45.600> reference<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.230> doubt<00:02:46.950> it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
may not have some reference I doubt it

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.000 
may not have some reference I doubt it
but<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:47.940> not<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.140> I'm<00:02:49.440> not<00:02:49.620> saying<00:02:49.890> it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
but I'm not like I'm not saying it

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.300 
but I'm not like I'm not saying it
definitely<00:02:50.490> does<00:02:50.790> not<00:02:50.820> have<00:02:51.120> any<00:02:51.300> reference

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
whether this means anything but I think

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.890 
whether this means anything but I think
look<00:03:42.570> at<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.560> end<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.450> right<00:03:45.690> what

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
look at that the end to the right what

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.560 
look at that the end to the right what
the<00:03:45.930> P<00:03:46.260> would<00:03:46.470> be<00:03:46.620> if<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.890> was<00:03:47.010> help<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.570> look

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
the P would be if it was help and look

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.160 
the P would be if it was help and look
at<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.780> Grim<00:03:48.959> Reaper<00:03:50.540> see<00:03:51.540> there<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.870> link
