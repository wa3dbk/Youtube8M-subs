00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.130
Once upon a time, at the end of the year 2005,
the developers of World of Warcraft decided

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.990
to add a new dungeon that would constitute 
a challenge for high-level players.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.309
They introduced a new end of the dungeon boss
lovingly named

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:16.970
"Hakkar the Soulflayer".

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.480
That boss was able to cast a spell,
the aptly named "Corrupted blood". 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.730
Why was this spell aptly named?

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.179
Because the girls playing the game MENSTRUATED.

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.179
This spell was named "Corrupted Blood" because
it had a noxious effect and was able

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.579
to pass from a player to another,
which was originally planned as
an effect limited to this area.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.550
That spell was not suppose to leave
the boss dungeon, but a small bug made it

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.420
capable of contaminating the player's pets.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.620
The pets were healthy carriers,
meaning simply that they were able

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.340
to carry the disease, but were not
affected by the symptoms.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.120
When those players came back
in the game cities, after completing the dungeon,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.550
their pets transmitted the toxic effect
to the other players, thus starting

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.520
the first epidemic
inside a videogame.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.000
The low-level characters were
almost instantly killed, because 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.500
this spell was originally made for
high-level players.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.100
Quickly, the cities grounds were covered
with the skeletons of low-level characters,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.890
and in the end the event became so big
that the developers tried 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.380
to control it with quarantines.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.509
Unfortunately for developers,
the players could move very fast

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.550
from a continent to another,
and most of the time with their contaminated pets.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.520
In a few days it was over, the epidemic
had spread on all continents,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.860
and was becoming a pandemic.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.030
The effects were so important that the game
experience became, for a while,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.000
completely transformed. The cities
were emptied of their players,
these ones having preferred to leave 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.600
to the countryside to wait for the pandemic
to settle.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.030
The players' behaviors were
very close to real people behaviors

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.730
in real-life events. Some players fled
the infected zones, other players

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.140
were trying to help the infected characters,
by healing them, and some assholes tried

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.380
to transmit the disease to as many people
as possible.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.520
Anyway, it was total panic, and paradoxically
maybe one of the best game experience

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.340
proposed in an online game.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.680
Panicking at this situation, the developers
did a big reset on the servers,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.159
and released a patch to make disappear
any trace of the epidemic. On the sly,

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.530
they threw away the dust under the carpet,
and napalmed the carpet.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.049
However, the event made some noise,
and eventually reached the ears of several researchers.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.729
2 years after the epidemic, in 2007, several
scientific articles got published
in prestigious journals

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.390
to talk about the event.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.920
Because there are very prestigious
scientific journals, and scientific journals

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.979
that smell like horse shit.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.750
In fact, the world of research
works like this.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.209
You work very very hard on a
subject for several months, and at the end

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.180
you write an article that you will try
to publish in the best possible journal.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.079
If your article is good, you can publish it
in a super classy journal like

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:21.920
Nature or Science.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.639
However, if your article smells like pâté,
you'll only be able to publish in Picsou

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:26.529
Magazine, or Toboggan.

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:30.799
I'm kidding, there are specific journals
made for bad quality articles,

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.909
but that's not what will help your
career as a scientist.

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.640
So here, several articles got published in
very prestigious journals like Science and The Lancet.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.560
In those articles, the scientists noticed
the many commonalities

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.959
between this virtual epidemic
in World of Warcraft and the real epidemics

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.519
that happen in real life.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.669
In real life, an epidemic goes like this: 
there's a bacteria or

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.829
a virus that will trail along in nature
that we will call a pathogen. 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.389
"Pathos" means "pain" in Greek, so "pathogen"
is the thing that creates the pain.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.879
So this pathogen strolls around in the forest,
strolls around in the mountains,

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.849
and will at some point encounter a wild animal
that will be its first victim, its first host.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.689
It will quickly proliferate in the animal

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.049
and spread throughout the entire population.
In the case of the swine flu of 2009,

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.829
we don't really know which wild animal
got infected first, but what we're sure of

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.659
is that it was infected real bad.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.430
If the pathogen is good at its job,
it will infect several species of wild animals

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.309
and will eventually meeting
a domestic animal.

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.620
In the case of swine flue, we're
almost sure that the meeting happened

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.450
in a pig farm in Mexico. It's not easy to
know exactly how the transmission happened,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.809
but what's sure is that
it must have been a very romantic moment.

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:31.879
Quickly there will be a contact
between those pets and humans. 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.459
Then humans will go to clubs, to hypermarkets,
to school, they take planes, and will

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.579
transmit this pathogen to everyone.

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.529
Anyway, in the case of World of Warcraft,
the commonalities between real pandemics

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:44.189
and the virtual pandemic were so flagrant
that the researchers downright proposed

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.409
to use multi player games
for research on pandemics.

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.870
One researcher especially, Nina Fefferman,
was extremely motivated to use

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.340
the online games in pandemic research,
and quickly contacted Blizzard,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.849
the company that produces World of Warcraft,
to work on this research, together.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.680
At first the folks over at Blizzard were extremely
motivated, then they let things drag

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.909
and they eventually refused this
collaboration between researchers and developers.

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.049
At first it could seem normal,
 after all World of Warcraft is a game,

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.139
not a laboratory to experiment on players.
Its first goal is to entertain people, 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.480
not to use them as guinea pigs.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.150
Still, I don't see exactly where the problem is,
one does not preclude the other.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.739
If we cut corners briefly,
the main job of a scientist is to propose

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.530
a whole bunch of hypotheses about a phenomenon
that is not very well understood, and confront

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.310
those hypotheses to real life.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.490
To do that, a scientist constantly needs
models that can be for instance

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.599
computer simulations.

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.530
The researcher will create a simulation
with very simple starting rules,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.650
let the software work for a while
and then compare the results of

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.449
his simulation with real life.

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.819
To oversimplify, if his situation
is very close to reality, then

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.520
it can allow himself to think that the rules
he set at the beginning in his simulation are also

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.449
the underlying rules to his phenomenon.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.509
In the case of pandemics, there are
a ton of simulations that are used

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.150
everyday by researchers, and that
allow them to make estimations about

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.129
the number of casualties or the countries
that will pay the higher price.

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:57.180
The big issue is that those computer simlations
are too rational. 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.810
They're not stupid enough.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.289
A computer program cannot yet
reproduce the very complex and

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.080
sometimes very stupid behavior
of a human being.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.210
And it obviously limits its interest to
make predictions about... humans.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.870
An example with World of Warcraft:
during the epidemic, they noticed that

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.370
many players were running towards the
infected areas, driven by curiosity,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.439
and then came back to healthy areas
to report what they had seen.

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.840
That kind of behavior is maybe stupid,
but it's real: we can observed for instance

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.979
with journalists, that will sometimes
witness an epidemic and come back

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.629
to report their findings in healthy areas,
and sometimes spread the disease.

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:30.120
At the time of the Corrupted Blood episode,
no epidemic model could take into consideration

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.740
that kind of behavior, 
which caused researchers to seriously

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.189
underestimate the diseases
propagation speed.

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.919
In fact, we could let researchers
experiment in online games. It would 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.460
allow them to incorporate in their models
behaviors they would have

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.030
never thought of, and they could then
improve their models.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.150
By the way it could be good for players too.
After the episode of the Corrupted Blood, 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.990
many players confessed that
the pandemic was the funniest event

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.919
that they had ever lived in the game.

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.509
So there we go, maybe the solution
to the coming epidemic of real zombies

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.090
is in the hands, the mice and the keyboards of gamers.
Gamers that will find the solution... 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.780
by playing zombie games.
Not bad, right?
