00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the live blog that they had running with

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.220 
the live blog that they had running with
all<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> pictures<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.000> unless<00:00:33.899> sure<00:00:34.050> how<00:00:34.170> many

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
all the pictures so unless sure how many

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.990 
all the pictures so unless sure how many
pictures<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.100> page<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.670> believe

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
pictures are on this page but I believe

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.540 
pictures are on this page but I believe
there<00:00:36.329> had<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.170> been<00:00:37.320> over<00:00:37.680> 50<00:00:38.070> or<00:00:38.190> 75

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
there had to have been over 50 or 75

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.420 
there had to have been over 50 or 75
pictures<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.690> quite<00:00:40.350> heavy<00:00:40.829> web<00:00:41.190> page

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
pictures so it's a quite heavy web page

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.400 
pictures so it's a quite heavy web page
with<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> lot<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.510> pictures<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.110> text

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
with the with a lot of pictures and text

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.440 
with the with a lot of pictures and text
so<00:00:44.160> let's<00:00:44.370> run<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> comparison<00:00:45.239> let's<00:00:45.390> see

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
so let's run the comparison let's see

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.640 
so let's run the comparison let's see
how<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:45.629> do

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.350 

we<00:00:53.220> can<00:00:53.400> see<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.880> droid<00:00:54.480> x<00:00:54.660> loads<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.830> a<00:00:56.360> little

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
we can see the droid x loads up a little

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.240 
we can see the droid x loads up a little
bit<00:00:57.480> quicker<00:00:57.660> at<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.080> beginning<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:01.770> trophy

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
bit quicker at the beginning the trophy

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.720 
bit quicker at the beginning the trophy
is<00:01:02.400> not<00:01:02.910> much<00:01:03.390> far<00:01:03.660> behind<00:01:04.250> what<00:01:05.250> we'll<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.520> is

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
is not much far behind what we'll do is

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.660 
is not much far behind what we'll do is
we'll<00:01:05.880> start<00:01:06.840> scrolling<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:09.230> Android<00:01:10.670> as

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
we'll start scrolling on the Android as

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.950 
we'll start scrolling on the Android as
we<00:01:11.940> can<00:01:12.090> see<00:01:12.270> even<00:01:12.480> though<00:01:12.660> it's<00:01:12.810> still

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
we can see even though it's still

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.100 
we can see even though it's still
loading<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.890> pretty<00:01:14.130> far<00:01:14.900> with<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
loading we can get pretty far with the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.550 
loading we can get pretty far with the
scrolling<00:01:16.530> quite<00:01:17.310> smooth<00:01:17.670> also<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:19.020> page<00:01:19.350> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
scrolling quite smooth also as a page is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.870 
scrolling quite smooth also as a page is
loading<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.400> finished<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:20.910> on<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.330> Android<00:01:22.880> if

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
loading it finished up on the Android if

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.770 
loading it finished up on the Android if
we<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:24.270> same<00:01:24.450> thing<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:26.030> mango<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.540> see

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
we do the same thing on mango we can see

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.990 
we do the same thing on mango we can see
