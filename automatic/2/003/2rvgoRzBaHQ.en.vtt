ability then they what they will do well

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.819 
ability then they what they will do well
right<00:00:31.059> that's<00:00:31.599> one<00:00:31.869> dimension<00:00:32.380> the<00:00:32.469> Academy

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
right that's one dimension the Academy

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.430 
right that's one dimension the Academy
dimension<00:00:33.370> second<00:00:34.360> if<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.840> schools<00:00:35.080> provide

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
dimension second if the schools provide

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.350 
dimension second if the schools provide
many<00:00:35.620> more<00:00:36.370> opportunities<00:00:36.610> for<00:00:37.030> them<00:00:37.300> to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
many more opportunities for them to

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.780 
many more opportunities for them to
develop<00:00:37.630> areas<00:00:38.260> of<00:00:38.410> strength<00:00:38.710> develop<00:00:39.610> them

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
develop areas of strength develop them

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.850 
develop areas of strength develop them
holistically<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.690> in<00:00:40.900> sports<00:00:41.230> in<00:00:41.410> us<00:00:41.590> in

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
holistically and in sports in us in

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.160 
holistically and in sports in us in
whatever<00:00:42.280> they<00:00:42.610> are<00:00:42.640> good<00:00:42.910> at<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.900> school

whatever they are good at the school

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.720 
whatever they are good at the school
will<00:00:44.350> be<00:00:44.380> able<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.800> add<00:00:44.950> a<00:00:44.980> lot<00:00:45.280> of<00:00:45.340> value<00:00:45.700> to

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
will be able to add a lot of value to

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.840 
will be able to add a lot of value to
the<00:00:45.940> child<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.230> why<00:00:47.410> is<00:00:47.470> that<00:00:47.620> not<00:00:47.980> possible<00:00:48.040> of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
the child so why is that not possible of

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.020 
the child so why is that not possible of
course<00:00:49.810> it<00:00:50.020> is<00:00:50.110> possible<00:00:50.400> you<00:00:51.400> know<00:00:51.520> it<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.820> but

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
course it is possible you know it is but

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.200 
course it is possible you know it is but
we<00:00:52.180> have<00:00:52.329> to<00:00:52.450> work<00:00:52.630> at<00:00:52.810> it<00:00:52.840> because<00:00:53.770> then<00:00:54.280> this

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
we have to work at it because then this

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.880 
we have to work at it because then this
is<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.420> when<00:00:55.930> we<00:00:56.050> say<00:00:56.200> we<00:00:56.230> wander<00:00:56.739> anywhere

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
is the when we say we wander anywhere

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.360 
is the when we say we wander anywhere
every<00:00:57.400> Singaporean<00:00:57.700> to<00:00:58.030> succeed<00:00:58.950> it<00:00:59.950> must<00:01:00.250> be

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
every Singaporean to succeed it must be

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.340 
every Singaporean to succeed it must be
that<00:01:00.489> our<00:01:00.880> schools<00:01:01.329> that<00:01:01.840> we<00:01:01.989> don't<00:01:02.140> have

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
that our schools that we don't have

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.679 
that our schools that we don't have
feelings<00:01:02.620> schools<00:01:03.100> schools<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.089> do<00:01:04.180> so<00:01:04.420> badly

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
feelings schools schools and do so badly

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.330 
feelings schools schools and do so badly
that<00:01:04.839> you<00:01:05.229> know<00:01:05.350> nobody<00:01:05.710> would<00:01:05.920> dare<00:01:06.040> send

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
that you know nobody would dare send

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.320 
that you know nobody would dare send
their<00:01:06.490> kids<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:07.330> those<00:01:07.810> schools<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:09.330> again

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
their kids to those schools and again

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.000 
their kids to those schools and again
this<00:01:10.570> change<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:10.960> mindset<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.409> very<00:01:11.590> important

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
this change of mindset is very important

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.250 
this change of mindset is very important
because<00:01:12.130> if<00:01:12.430> we<00:01:12.550> expect<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.600> every<00:01:13.720> child<00:01:14.110> to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
because if we expect that every child to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.250 
because if we expect that every child to
come<00:01:14.440> off<00:01:14.590> from<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:14.920> school<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:16.780> all<00:01:16.990> a's

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
come off from that school with all a's

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.190 
come off from that school with all a's
then<00:01:18.250> obviously<00:01:18.760> cannot<00:01:19.420> be<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.630> good<00:01:19.930> school

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
then obviously cannot be a good school

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.500 
then obviously cannot be a good school
if<00:01:20.409> you<00:01:20.500> measure<00:01:20.680> purely<00:01:21.280> by<00:01:21.430> that<00:01:21.640> but<00:01:22.390> we

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
if you measure purely by that but we

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.390 
if you measure purely by that but we
mustn't<00:01:22.720> measure<00:01:22.990> school<00:01:23.380> in<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.650> way<00:01:23.860> we

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
mustn't measure school in that way we

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.640 
mustn't measure school in that way we
must<00:01:24.580> measure<00:01:24.729> school<00:01:25.180> by<00:01:25.330> how<00:01:25.510> well<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:26.530> know

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
must measure school by how well you know

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.050 
must measure school by how well you know

so<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> think<00:02:15.060> if<00:02:15.180> we<00:02:15.300> work<00:02:15.600> on<00:02:15.810> having<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.590> you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
so I think if we work on having this you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.070 
so I think if we work on having this you
know<00:02:17.400> as<00:02:17.610> parents<00:02:17.820> we<00:02:18.150> want<00:02:18.450> our<00:02:18.570> child<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.930> get

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
know as parents we want our child to get

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.170 
know as parents we want our child to get
the<00:02:19.170> best<00:02:19.290> week<00:02:19.530> he<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.340> she<00:02:20.520> can<00:02:20.670> possibly<00:02:20.820> get

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the best week he or she can possibly get

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.020 
the best week he or she can possibly get

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
but I think as fellow Singaporeans we

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.020 
but I think as fellow Singaporeans we
should<00:02:24.270> wish<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:24.540> every<00:02:25.440> child<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.550> Singapore
