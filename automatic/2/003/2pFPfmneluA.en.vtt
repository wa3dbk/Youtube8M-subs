00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
character just in the past year and he

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.500 
character just in the past year and he
came<00:00:44.230> to<00:00:44.440> us<00:00:44.560> and<00:00:44.590> asked<00:00:45.250> it<00:00:45.910> would<00:00:46.030> if<00:00:46.450> we

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
came to us and asked it would if we

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.620 
came to us and asked it would if we
could<00:00:46.780> possibly<00:00:47.110> do<00:00:47.590> a<00:00:48.000> version<00:00:49.000> of<00:00:49.210> the<00:00:49.360> saber

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
could possibly do a version of the saber

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.390 
could possibly do a version of the saber
so<00:00:49.900> you<00:00:50.050> could<00:00:50.170> have<00:00:50.320> an<00:00:50.440> accurate<00:00:50.800> saber<00:00:51.070> for

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
so you could have an accurate saber for

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.550 
so you could have an accurate saber for
it<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:51.850> we<00:00:52.210> loved<00:00:52.390> his<00:00:52.510> armor<00:00:52.810> so<00:00:53.020> much<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.500> we

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
it and we loved his armor so much and we

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.370 
it and we loved his armor so much and we
thought<00:00:53.740> well<00:00:53.980> there<00:00:54.310> is<00:00:54.460> definitely<00:00:54.490> a<00:00:54.970> need

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
thought well there is definitely a need

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.040 
thought well there is definitely a need
for<00:00:56.380> that<00:00:56.860> saber<00:00:57.250> in<00:00:57.580> the<00:00:58.120> community<00:00:58.570> for<00:00:58.960> any

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
for that saber in the community for any

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.830 
for that saber in the community for any
of<00:00:59.230> people<00:00:59.980> who<00:01:00.130> want<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:00.430> dress<00:01:01.390> up<00:01:01.570> in<00:01:01.720> that

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
of people who want to dress up in that

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.990 
of people who want to dress up in that
armor<00:01:02.140> set<00:01:02.350> or<00:01:02.590> cosplay<00:01:02.860> as<00:01:03.190> that<00:01:03.400> character

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
armor set or cosplay as that character

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.150 
armor set or cosplay as that character
so<00:01:04.210> we<00:01:05.019> thought<00:01:05.199> why<00:01:05.379> not<00:01:05.410> it<00:01:05.860> would<00:01:05.980> make<00:01:06.130> a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
so we thought why not it would make a

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.890 
so we thought why not it would make a
great<00:01:06.340> addition<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.970> combat<00:01:07.300> class<00:01:07.570> and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
great addition to the combat class and

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.530 
great addition to the combat class and
supply<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.620> need<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.670> costuming<00:01:10.060> community

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
supply a need in the costuming community

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.050 
supply a need in the costuming community
hmm<00:01:11.290> so<00:01:11.530> here<00:01:11.710> we<00:01:11.770> go<00:01:11.920> after<00:01:12.280> toiling<00:01:12.670> over

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
hmm so here we go after toiling over

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
hmm so here we go after toiling over
many<00:01:13.870> screen<00:01:14.260> grabs<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:15.010> concept<00:01:16.000> art<00:01:16.240> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
many screen grabs and concept art and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.230 
many screen grabs and concept art and
putting<00:01:18.040> it<00:01:18.130> all<00:01:18.250> together<00:01:18.370> and<00:01:18.640> scaling<00:01:19.180> it

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
putting it all together and scaling it

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.320 
putting it all together and scaling it
up<00:01:19.800> it<00:01:20.800> actually<00:01:21.010> fits<00:01:21.430> quite<00:01:21.610> nicely<00:01:21.700> in<00:01:22.240> our

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
combat class line it scaled out to be

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.580 
combat class line it scaled out to be
about<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.210> same<00:01:25.390> dimensions<00:01:25.990> that<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.260> very
