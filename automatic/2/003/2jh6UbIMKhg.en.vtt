possible their tcp/ip stack is corrupted
on<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> client<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> also<00:01:26.009> happens

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
on the client so it also happens

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.889 
you'd only use this for troubleshooting
to<00:02:01.860> see<00:02:02.040> whether<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.549> VPN<00:02:02.909> piece<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
to see whether or not the VPN piece is

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.399 
to see whether or not the VPN piece is
broken<00:02:04.200> or<00:02:04.590> whether<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> server<00:02:07.110> or

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
broken or whether it's on the server or

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.109 
broken or whether it's on the server or
whether<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.979> client<00:02:08.429> issue<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.030> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
whether it's a client issue so if you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.609 
whether it's a client issue so if you
check<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.450> box<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.110> only<00:02:10.289> way<00:02:10.560> you

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
check this box and it's the only way you

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.960 
check this box and it's the only way you
can<00:02:10.950> get<00:02:11.160> in

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
can get in

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.420 
can get in
and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:12.510> typically<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.190> PC<00:02:14.190> or<00:02:14.370> the

and then typically the PC or the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.920 
and then typically the PC or the
computer<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:14.910> you're<00:02:15.060> connecting<00:02:15.480> from<00:02:15.630> is

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
computer that you're connecting from is

computer that you're connecting from is
having<00:02:16.260> problems<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.980> should<00:02:17.820> be<00:02:17.940> updated<00:02:18.480> or

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
having problems and should be updated or

repaired<00:02:19.200> if<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:20.070> still<00:02:20.370> can't<00:02:20.640> get<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.940> even

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
repaired if you still can't get in even

then that typically means that there's
