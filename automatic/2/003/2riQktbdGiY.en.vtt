00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
twenty percent and I'm going to keep a

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.960 
twenty percent and I'm going to keep a
fairly<00:01:07.369> small<00:01:07.430> brush<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.630> can<00:01:09.430> put<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:10.759> on

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
fairly small brush so I can put it on

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.090 
fairly small brush so I can put it on
the<00:01:11.600> eyeshadow<00:01:12.080> on<00:01:12.259> without<00:01:12.560> getting<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.920> lot

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
the eyeshadow on without getting a lot

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.520 
the eyeshadow on without getting a lot
of<00:01:13.130> mistakes<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.119> twenty<00:01:14.869> percent<00:01:15.229> allows

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
of mistakes and twenty percent allows

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.010 
of mistakes and twenty percent allows
for<00:01:15.860> me<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.220> just<00:01:16.460> get<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.670> soft<00:01:17.090> look<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:17.840> can

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
for me to just get a soft look and I can

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.960 
for me to just get a soft look and I can
always<00:01:18.200> go<00:01:18.500> back<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.860> change<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.340> if<00:01:19.520> I<00:01:19.640> want

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
always go back and change that if I want

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.920 
always go back and change that if I want
so<00:01:20.690> I<00:01:20.720> picked<00:01:21.289> a<00:01:21.409> very<00:01:21.740> dramatic<00:01:21.950> purple<00:01:22.729> here

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930
