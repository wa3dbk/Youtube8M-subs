ourselves so we're cleaning in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
ourselves so we're cleaning in
essentially<00:01:17.909> half<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> time<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.750> we're

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
essentially half the time because we're

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.200 
essentially half the time because we're
cutting<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.680> having<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> rag<00:01:20.610> works

it<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.759> over<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> house<00:01:27.299> better<00:01:27.720> than<00:01:27.960> going

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it all over the house better than going

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.780 
it all over the house better than going
out<00:01:28.320> maybe<00:01:28.530> buying<00:01:28.829> specialty<00:01:29.520> cleaners

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
out maybe buying specialty cleaners

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
out maybe buying specialty cleaners
again<00:01:30.630> everything<00:01:31.229> gets<00:01:31.380> trapped<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
again everything gets trapped in that
