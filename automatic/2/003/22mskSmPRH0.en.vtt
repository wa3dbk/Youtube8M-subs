00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
a huge breakthrough so this is in the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.550 
a huge breakthrough so this is in the
future<00:03:22.270> it<00:03:22.360> may<00:03:22.510> be<00:03:22.570> possible<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:23.140> use<00:03:23.410> the

device to reconnect the brain to the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.810 
device to reconnect the brain to the

their own paralyzed limbs our goal with

their own paralyzed limbs our goal with
brain<00:03:31.300> gate<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.690> eventually<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.410> have<00:03:32.590> a

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
brain gate is eventually to have a

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.590 
brain gate is eventually to have a
system<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.190> is<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.370> physical<00:03:33.970> replacement

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
system that is a physical replacement

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.690 
system that is a physical replacement
for<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.870> broken<00:03:35.170> biological<00:03:36.040> nervous<00:03:36.340> system

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
for a broken biological nervous system

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.750 
for a broken biological nervous system
so<00:03:37.210> we'd<00:03:37.360> like<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.690> have<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:38.590> physical<00:03:39.070> system

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
so we'd like to have a physical system

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.370 
so we'd like to have a physical system
that<00:03:40.060> senses<00:03:40.510> what's<00:03:40.690> going<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.050> in<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.260> brain

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
that senses what's going on in the brain

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.410 
that senses what's going on in the brain
takes<00:03:42.040> those<00:03:42.250> signals<00:03:42.670> inside<00:03:42.850> your<00:03:43.240> body

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
takes those signals inside your body

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.630 
takes those signals inside your body
routes<00:03:43.870> them<00:03:44.110> off<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.530> muscles<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:45.490> when

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
routes them off to the muscles so when

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.010 
routes them off to the muscles so when
you<00:03:45.730> think<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.150> move<00:03:46.330> well<00:03:46.510> that's<00:03:46.690> just<00:03:46.780> what

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
you think you move well that's just what

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.780 
you think you move well that's just what
you<00:03:47.050> or<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.320> do<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:48.100> one<00:03:48.310> day<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.520> could<00:03:48.730> be

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
you or I do so one day you could be

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.010 
you or I do so one day you could be
sitting<00:03:49.000> here<00:03:49.239> with<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.420> person<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:49.930> you

sitting here with a person and you
