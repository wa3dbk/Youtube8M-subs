00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.029
 know what love is if you never 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.370
 did you swell in a flow how are you going 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.920
 know what pain is if you hamas a 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.480
 defender broke your tibia and fibula and 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.530
 you were in a barrier and the ball 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.350
 hit right there 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.789
 how are you going to know what is pleasure if 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.320
 you never gave an Olympic round of 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.990
 visitor 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.939
 how are you going to know what love is if 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.439
 never caresses let you in 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.140
 with the reverse of the river to leave it 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.689
 silent on the line 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.090
 listen how are you going to know what is the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.329
 solidarity and you never went out to give 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.329
 face by a fellow really beaten 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.480
 as a step to know what is poetry 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.160
 follow more delay to the goal 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.620
 how are you going to know what in the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.590
 humiliation and they never got you a spout 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.050
 how are you going to know what is half if 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.230
 never return a wall 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.090
 as you'll know what a panic if 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.710
 you were never surprised wrong standing in a 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.040
 kickback 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.960
 how are you going to know what it is to die a little 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.420
 if you could never look for the ball inside 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.540
 long 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.330
 tell me how old you will know what it is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.000
 loneliness if you never stopped under the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.340
 three sticks twelve steps away from one that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.200
 I wanted to cook and finish with your 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.350
 hopes 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.060
 how are you going to know what mud is 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.810
 you never threw yourself at the feet of anyone 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.020
 to send a ball on the side 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.700
 as you will know what is selfishness if 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.220
 you never did one besides when you had 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.530
 than give it to 9 who was just how 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.579
 you will know what art is if you never 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.130
 but you never invented a rabona how 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:49.170
 you will know what music is if you never 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.290
 You sang from the popular 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.990
 How will you know what injustice is? 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.830
 if I never take a red card for a referee 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.750
 parochial 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.800
 tell me how you are going to know what is the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.050
 insomnia and you never went to the descent 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.800
 how are you going to know what this one did not give 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.670
 If you never made a goal down as 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.550
 but how are you going to know what it is to cry 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.140
 yes cry if you never missed a final of 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.569
 a world cup on time with a penalty 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.290
 doubtful 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.150
 how are you going to know dear friend how are you going 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.629
 to know what life is if never again 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.629
 you played soccer
