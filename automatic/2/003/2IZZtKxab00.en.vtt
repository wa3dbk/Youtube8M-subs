designer he's tried to implement the
both<00:02:14.950> things<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.670> his<00:02:15.940> new<00:02:16.570> design<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.320> new

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
both things in his new design a new

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.130 
both things in his new design a new
concept<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.460> new<00:02:19.120> modeling<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.660> serious

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
concept in this new modeling is serious

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.190 
concept in this new modeling is serious
so<00:02:20.680> he<00:02:20.770> just<00:02:20.950> took<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.220> look<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:22.000> make<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.510> new<00:02:23.020> way

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
so he just took a look to make a new way

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.350 
so he just took a look to make a new way
of<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.650> user<00:02:23.980> interface<00:02:24.250> as<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> notebook<00:02:24.940> he

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
of the user interface as a notebook he

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.270 
of the user interface as a notebook he
use<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.870> implement<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.410> touch<00:02:26.650> pad<00:02:26.920> left<00:02:27.130> and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
use the implement to touch pad left and

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.699 
use the implement to touch pad left and
right<00:02:27.430> side<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.270> he<00:02:28.390> also<00:02:28.540> took<00:02:29.140> care<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.530> make

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
right side and he also took care to make

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.070 
right side and he also took care to make
a<00:02:29.790> new<00:02:30.790> design<00:02:31.150> notebook<00:02:31.540> in<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.720> new<00:02:31.840> design

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
a new design notebook in the new design

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.360 
a new design notebook in the new design

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
the notebook we chose the bamboo it is

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.920 
the notebook we chose the bamboo it is
very<00:03:45.610> very<00:03:45.700> hard<00:03:46.060> materials<00:03:46.570> it's<00:03:46.750> very

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
very very hard materials it's very

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.930 
very very hard materials it's very
difficult<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.440> produce<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.489> make<00:03:48.610> it<00:03:48.730> in<00:03:48.850> a

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
form usable for the notebook we develop

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.610 
form usable for the notebook we develop
a<00:03:52.150> new<00:03:52.329> way<00:03:52.959> how<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.440> produce<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.610> in

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
a new way how to produce it of the in

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.990 
a new way how to produce it of the in
producing<00:03:56.620> way<00:03:56.890> so<00:03:57.790> we<00:03:57.970> are<00:03:58.060> now<00:03:58.180> able<00:03:58.209> to<00:04:00.000> to

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
producing way so we are now able to to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.520 
producing way so we are now able to to
choose<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.269> bamboo<00:04:01.690> for<00:04:01.930> parts<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.410> the

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
choose a bamboo for parts of the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.350 
choose a bamboo for parts of the
notebook<00:04:02.799> instead<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.489> usual<00:04:03.640> plastic

notebook instead of the usual plastic

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.990 
notebook instead of the usual plastic
it's<00:04:04.570> more<00:04:04.720> natural<00:04:04.900> it's<00:04:05.350> it's<00:04:06.220> nice<00:04:06.549> nice

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
it's more natural it's it's nice nice

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.580 
it's more natural it's it's nice nice
fulfilling<00:04:07.600> its<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.840> better<00:04:08.049> feeling<00:04:08.290> that

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
fulfilling its a better feeling that
