00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.420
 today we have new statements from 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.220
 minci analyst works on the light 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.900
 watch we will tell you what the 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.360
 new program that started pool for 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.009
 replace the batteries of the iphone 5 and 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.599
 we'll end up talking about iphone 6 with 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.769
 several headlines dealing with a 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.899
 possible delay on your date of 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.660
 launch an increase in capacity and 

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:22.759
 new images that come from fosco 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.800
 hello everyone welcome to point 5 x 1 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:29.050
 I am fernando in moral and these are the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.050
 most important news of today 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.690
 we started talking about light words and 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.579
 the statements of my coffee boy and 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.559
 securities that have claimed that Paul 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.570
 will delay the commercialization of this 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.030
 device until the beginning of the year that 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.350
 it seems that this delay is due to 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.629
 problems with production according to 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.359
 say sources close to the chains 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.519
 of paper production the delay in 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.070
 marketing does not imply a delay 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.289
 in the presentation that is, we can be 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.000
 optimists and still maybe we could 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.199
 see the iwork presented in one of the 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.840
 two that we do not have yet 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.069
 pending this year you just have to see the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.140
 cases for example from the original iphone 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:11.509
 that showed up and came out months later 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.700
 or for example the mac pro the macro that 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.630
 we know with the coffee machine was presented in 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.220
 a wwf and then it came out at the end of the year 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.259
 had started a replacement program 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.850
 of batteries for limited units of 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.569
 with five that were commercialized 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.690
 from September 2012 to January 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.759
 2013 apparently this program is only 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.890
 available for the moment in the usa but 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.770
 it is expected to reach the rest of the countries 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.050
 over the next few weeks as 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.240
 You can know if your device is 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.040
 of those of those limited units that 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.690
 they can opt for that battery replacement 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.490
 you just have to go to the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.770
 apple website and on the tab 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.570
 where they talk about this replacement or this 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.830
 replacement program you simply have 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.020
 to enter the serial number of your 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.490
 iphone 5 if it is within the chosen ones 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.280
 all you have to do is go 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.960
 to gaga for being closer and opt and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.210
 ask to replace them in the battery without 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.710
 cost none that you have replaced 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.720
 the battery of your iphone 5 during 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.550
 all this time you can also choose to 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.380
 this replacement system not for you 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.460
 replace it but yes so that you 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.800
 return the money so you already know 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.060
 and we go there with the iPhone 6 and a series 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.390
 of headlines we want to comment 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.730
 we started with a possible delay in the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.950
 sale of this device apparently 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.960
 according to reports reuters a rumor that 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.210
 comes from the sources of supply 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.430
 of apple pieces are having 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.170
 problems with the number of screens that 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.530
 he has asked Paul to these chains 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.990
 apparently apple at first 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.500
 He asked managers screens 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.730
 that their screens had a layer of 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.220
 backlighting a single layer of 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.560
 Backlight 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.770
 once apple has seen that layer has 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.240
 seemed insufficient and has asked for those 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.360
 companies that supply their 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.000
 screens that add another layer plus the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.400
 problem of are in that all this is 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.020
 adhere to some measures that a pola taxes 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.700
 and that they can not exceed their limit and 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.790
 that there is the problem that they are 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.430
 having therefore the administrators for 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.340
 can assemble the new iphone 6 with 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.410
 its new screens in order what not 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.600
 we know very well is if this is going to 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.030
 cause a delay in the implementation 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.440
 sale or may cause units 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.450
 very limited from the start 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.670
 but that if it goes more or less in the 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.090
 dates he had planned on his doorstep 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.370
 We will wait for iPhone 6 could have 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.349
 capacity of 128 gigabytes as it has filtered 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.860
 that through the Chinese website 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.540
 weibo this is the document that indicates 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.239
 precisely the capabilities that 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:45.640
 we could see in the new iphone indicates 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.080
 16 64 and 128 gb be true or not not 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.970
 we know what we do know some 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.030
 documents that appear to be freehand 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.680
 loaded the iphone of 32 gigas is that or 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.530
 maybe these capabilities correspond 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.370
 only the 55-inch model does not 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.980
 we know 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.850
 we will see and we go with another photo that you 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.310
 I also put now of the possible 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.319
 prototypes that Apple had in post com a 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.840
 when preparing the new iPhone 6 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.819
 there you are seeing three prototypes the 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.310
 first it would correspond to iphone 6 of 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.370
 5.5 inches the second would correspond 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:23.410
 4.7 and the third would correspond to 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.120
 iphone 5 s the weights are then 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.470
 indefinable ie they have not 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.240
 specified the weight of those two 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.849
 prototypes what we do know is of layman 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.039
 5 s so we do not know the certainty 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.860
 have this document comes from foxconn 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.649
 so good maybe that document is 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.240
 real but we do not know if it corresponds to 

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:41.860
 the final prototypes in which he has 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.929
 put working who saves the 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.509
 places a strategy of dismissal by 

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:47.800
 part of support and good guys that has 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.990
