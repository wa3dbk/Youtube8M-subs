00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.880
 maneuver 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:16.350
 Good, I do not know let's make amaranth 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:23.039
 and we connected the case again 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:25.439
 or ceramic is to have a medium fire not 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.640
 very high in the high case would be this 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.669
 received a medium at one point we can not 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:39.600
 for very little heat or heat have 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:48.410
 a heat is for the grains which in the case 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:50.390
 the degree of amaranth a little told the 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.879
 tiny 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.879
 there's a different 4 degrees from here 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.900
 the little one it burst like it was a 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.950
 popcorn 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:17.140
 so we have to wait for who is 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:18.460
 that is very hot but does not burn the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.770
 grain 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.630
 This is difficult only to find temperature 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.000
 to become the water dog. 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.430
 marathon is correct 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.820
 so what's the first high on the fire? 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.820
 high 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.200
 burst the amaranth grain but it does not 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.320
 burn 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.970
 in case if it was not even if it would be very 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.520
 strong 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:58.000
 if the hob is not ceramic hob 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:01.270
 normal the search is for a fiery mouth 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.500
 other than my little big to 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.570
 average also interesting window have the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.230
 bottom 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.250
 beyond the background is this is a word that 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.800
 I use only make a background that is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.810
 technique is not playing the background. 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.620
 fire that has the diffuser what the people 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.120
 flame nor the heat party is a 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.900
 pan I picked up special just for 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.110
 do with amaranth why is because 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.450
 perfect, you'll see about him 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.030
 minutes 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.270
 How easy is it to warm up? 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:50.800
 I'll wait and a minute or so. 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:56.020
 still came back on for a minute more 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.660
 hot and correcting only everything low fire 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.190
 really have another fire medium and 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:07.780
 down exactly the mouth of the fire is low 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.240
 is to find the best way is what I 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.230
 I'll make you see how I do it. 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.370
 to know if we are or not 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.820
 It's the right temperature as I do it. 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:34.750
 I picked up a little of us had a 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:36.790
 bit here and when a little bit already 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.230
 it's in the right temperature for us 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:44.100
 to do so I have to remove it from the fire 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.100
 and in reality 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:56.810
 better then we made a little bit of people 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.660
 will do more in this story 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:05.170
 teachers and one from now we already have 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.170
 temperature to pass here only to help me 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:26.510
 the company thus removing rock and 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:31.280
 It has a good temperature to blow the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:38.470
 and they will see when the 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.470
 burst not even a minute 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.540
 I'm still not looking all raised in the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.070
 Fire a little 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.000
 they are bursting to take 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.260
 petraglia owner of a talent goes 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.740
 exploring how they are going 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.280
 installing all I'm stirring says get 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:07.039
 a little but it does not always push the world away 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:10.880
 keeping the heat take a look here 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.050
 inside, you 've already removed something from the fire. 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.680
 that did not end 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.680
 it's a problem 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:44.190
 and we repeat the same process 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:46.140
 we got one we took a spoon too 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.480
 of the boot in the hotel that is regulating the 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.450
 fire if fire is the ideal is it then me 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.570
 keeps burning was understood is keeping 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.160
 It is small, keeping the temperature 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:05.630
 you do not have what you're downloading and decreasing 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:10.590
 increasing and rising it starts there 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:12.920
 I invented with the victory. 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.920
 a little 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:21.240
 was a bit to give the first to 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:25.700
 first burst and then lift the 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.700
 and support when I'm over 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:39.890
 another little conquered despite the 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.890
 line 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.280
 sometimes takes a little burn because 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.790
 some meat balls on the fire and give a 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:57.040
 bit of smell to burn but it's because 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:07:25.270
 the balls sometimes fall on the fire already 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:30.010
 I removed my ball and little demand 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:33.100
 potatoes are made very burnt and made 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:38.070
 little she does not burst at all ora all 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:41.260
 they will not burst so that's it folks 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.680
 Until next time we'll do it. 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.680
 here in the
