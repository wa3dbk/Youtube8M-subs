00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:23.010
 the cicada and the ant in a splendid one 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.630
 summer day a cicada was sitting 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.830
 his blade of grass enjoying the sun and beautiful 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.230
 time this year said between sexes not 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.050
 I understand just why everyone works 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:43.050
 with a similar time they should do like 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 me and having fun happy he played sang and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.100
 he jumped from one blade of grass to the other 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.219
 at one point he jumped right over one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.910
 little black ant dragging a 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.820
 great effort a grain of wheat for 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:04.080
 add it to your supplies stop it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.270
 to work so much cried the cicada you come 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.360
 to rejoice in this wonderful one too 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:14.180
 the ant day 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.180
 I look up at her and sigh 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.090
 I think about the future he said and you should 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.360
 do the same if you don't start 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.299
 you will not have to store food now 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.439
 nothing to eat this winter but the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.479
 cicada laughs thinks of the present 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.479
 he exclaimed and squirts away 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.840
 a few months later on a cold morning 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.740
 the treat the strip goes on the ground 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.130
 ice cream while laboring laboriously 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.410
 near a group of ants he saw that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.479
 they were gathered around a meal of 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:03.509
 wheat and please give me some of yours 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:09.300
 food implored you have so much and I do not 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:12.630
 I have nothing I know I cry one of the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.030
 ants you laughed at me when I told you 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:20.220
 to think about the future 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:24.110
 I think of the present soldier now go to 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.510
 look for the food alone and the ant 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.010
 turning my back to the cicada I will finish 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.010
