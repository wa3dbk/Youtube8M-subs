going<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.170> actually<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:13.889> capital<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
going to actually do this capital a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.279 
going to actually do this capital a
little<00:00:15.210> differently<00:00:15.570> I've<00:00:15.870> never<00:00:16.020> really

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
little differently I've never really

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.750 
little differently I've never really
covered<00:00:16.560> kappa<00:00:16.770> play<00:00:16.980> too<00:00:17.039> much<00:00:17.400> even<00:00:17.670> though

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
covered kappa play too much even though

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.859 
covered kappa play too much even though
I<00:00:17.789> played<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.210> quite<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> bit<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.660> modern

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
I played it quite a bit of modern

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.340 
I played it quite a bit of modern
warfare<00:00:18.990> 2<00:00:20.000> but<00:00:21.000> as<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.960> mentioned<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.320> my

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
warfare 2 but as I mentioned in my

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.599 
warfare 2 but as I mentioned in my
previous<00:00:22.590> video<00:00:22.830> I'm<00:00:23.070> quite<00:00:23.400> disappointed

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
previous video I'm quite disappointed

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.529 
previous video I'm quite disappointed
that<00:00:24.980> Treyarch<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.220> put<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.430> 3<00:00:26.970> cap<00:00:27.300> limit

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that Treyarch have put that 3 cap limit

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.689 
that Treyarch have put that 3 cap limit
on<00:00:27.900> cap<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> flag<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:29.099> mean<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.429> really

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
on cap the flag I mean they really

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.870 
on cap the flag I mean they really
should<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.179> maybe<00:00:31.140> even<00:00:31.470> another<00:00:31.880> playlist

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
should be maybe even another playlist

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.400 
should be maybe even another playlist
type<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.570> know<00:00:33.660> unlimited<00:00:34.110> cap<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
type that you know unlimited cap the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.590 
type that you know unlimited cap the
flag<00:00:34.440> perhaps<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.520> hike<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.820> figure<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.450> you

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
flag perhaps we hike this figure as you

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200 
flag perhaps we hike this figure as you
can<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.170> only<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.700> half<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.850> minute<00:00:39.000> in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
can see we're only a half a minute in

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.560 
can see we're only a half a minute in
we've<00:00:39.510> already<00:00:39.629> got<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:39.960> flip<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.500> cap<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
we've already got one flip one cap and

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.000 
we've already got one flip one cap and
I'm<00:00:42.570> gonna<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> second<00:00:43.379> cap<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I'm gonna get the second cap in in a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.220 
I'm gonna get the second cap in in a
second<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.520> then<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.660> game's<00:00:45.840> pretty<00:00:46.020> much

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
second and then the game's pretty much

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.650 
second and then the game's pretty much
over<00:00:46.440> well<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.770> round<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.190> pretty<00:00:47.370> much<00:00:47.460> over

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
over well this round is pretty much over

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.819 
over well this round is pretty much over
so<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:48.809> quite<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.989> disappointing<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
so that's quite a disappointing but the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
so that's quite a disappointing but the
enemy<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> end<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.449> match<00:00:51.629> i'm

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
enemy and at the end of this match i'm

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.170 
enemy and at the end of this match i'm
going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.020> show<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.579> overview<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.820> theater

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
going to show you overview the theater

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.340 
going to show you overview the theater
mode<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.449> actually<00:00:54.719> great<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.170> but

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
mode is actually great for this but

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.500 
mode is actually great for this but
we'll<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> direct<00:00:56.879> fundamental

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
we'll see the direct fundamental

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.660 
we'll see the direct fundamental
mistakes<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.170> idea<00:00:58.410> opposition<00:00:58.920> position

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
mistakes that idea opposition position

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.080 
mistakes that idea opposition position
makes<00:01:00.180> straight<00:01:00.750> from<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> start<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:02.090> its

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
makes straight from the start and its

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.549 
makes straight from the start and its
most<00:01:03.480> itude<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.049> fact<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.320> they're

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
most itude of the fact that they're

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
most itude of the fact that they're
probably<00:01:04.860> an<00:01:05.189> uncoordinated<00:01:05.519> team<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.119> mean

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
probably an uncoordinated team I mean

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.030 
probably an uncoordinated team I mean
there<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> rounds<00:01:07.110> done<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.920> was

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
there you go the rounds done that was

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.039 
there you go the rounds done that was
just<00:01:08.220> ridiculously<00:01:08.760> cause<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> hell<00:01:09.510> out<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
just ridiculously cause the hell out of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.320 
just ridiculously cause the hell out of
less<00:01:10.350> than<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.560> minute<00:01:10.740> Inc<00:01:11.040> day<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.580> believe<00:01:12.060> all

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
less than a minute Inc day I believe all

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.929 
less than a minute Inc day I believe all
up<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.100> size<00:01:14.310> switch<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.850> no

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
up so with the size switch it's no

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.190 
up so with the size switch it's no

now<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:34.980> make<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> mistake<00:01:35.640> coming<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.720> here

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
now I do make a mistake coming up here

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.020 
now I do make a mistake coming up here
because<00:01:37.230> they<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> very<00:01:38.160> tight<00:01:38.370> spawn

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
because they have a very tight spawn

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.300 
because they have a very tight spawn
around<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.720> area<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.500> think<00:01:40.890> choosing<00:01:41.070> this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
around this area I think choosing this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.130 
around this area I think choosing this
window<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.030> coming<00:01:42.510> around<00:01:42.660> was<00:01:42.870> actually

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
window and coming around was actually

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.510 
window and coming around was actually
the<00:01:43.230> best<00:01:43.350> approach<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:43.710> me<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:44.310> way<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the best approach for me the way it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.670 
the best approach for me the way it
spawns<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.480> I<00:01:45.510> didn't<00:01:45.750> clear<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.960> corner<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
spawns but I didn't clear the corner and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.980 
spawns but I didn't clear the corner and
that<00:01:47.070> takes<00:01:47.340> me<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.300> coordinate<00:01:48.870> with

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
that takes me out so I coordinate with

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.110 
that takes me out so I coordinate with
my<00:01:49.110> team<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.620> got<00:01:49.860> shot<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.370> that<00:01:50.850> corner

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
my team that I got shot on that corner

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.810 
my team that I got shot on that corner
and<00:01:51.480> as<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.110> spawn<00:01:52.440> back<00:01:52.620> here<00:01:52.860> linda<00:01:53.550> was<00:01:53.640> about

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and as I spawn back here linda was about

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.460 
and as I spawn back here linda was about
a<00:01:53.850> 10<00:01:54.060> second<00:01:54.360> spawn<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> apologize

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
a 10 second spawn and this I apologize

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.130 
a 10 second spawn and this I apologize
but<00:01:56.220> as<00:01:56.340> i<00:01:56.460> spawned<00:01:56.760> back<00:01:56.910> here<00:01:57.270> i<00:01:57.300> coordinate

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
but as i spawned back here i coordinate

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.470 
but as i spawned back here i coordinate
with<00:01:58.230> my<00:01:58.350> teammates<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.000> one<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:00.150> Rosa

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
with my teammates and one I think Rosa

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.570 
with my teammates and one I think Rosa
made<00:02:01.080> right<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> corner<00:02:01.830> kills<00:02:02.250> them<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
made right in the corner kills them and

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.100 
made right in the corner kills them and
then<00:02:02.670> gets<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:03.690> takes<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:03.990> flag<00:02:04.200> ready<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.190> run

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
then gets it takes the flag ready to run

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.840 
then gets it takes the flag ready to run
and<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.620> mentioned<00:02:07.650> kept<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> flag<00:02:08.490> of<00:02:08.700> it

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
and as I mentioned kept the flag of it

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.200 
and as I mentioned kept the flag of it
which<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.630> three<00:02:10.560> caps<00:02:10.890> live<00:02:11.760> comment<00:02:12.090> about

that was a bad sport that first unless

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.530 
that was a bad sport that first unless
they<00:03:05.220> jumped<00:03:05.489> out<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.820> we<00:03:06.120> know<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.300> don't

55mm even I didn't kill him so we're

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.110

and<00:03:22.210> it's<00:03:22.720> not<00:03:22.930> right<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:24.510> don't<00:03:25.510> really<00:03:26.550> really

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
and it's not right I don't really really

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.370 
and it's not right I don't really really
know<00:03:27.670> if<00:03:27.820> it's<00:03:27.880> worth<00:03:28.120> while<00:03:28.330> talking<00:03:29.110> about

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
know if it's worth while talking about

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.080 
know if it's worth while talking about
too<00:03:29.560> much<00:03:29.710> I<00:03:29.890> mean<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.160> is<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.490> game<00:03:30.670> type<00:03:30.880> than

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
too much I mean it is the game type than

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.190 
too much I mean it is the game type than
what<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.270> is<00:03:31.390> but<00:03:32.910> we'll<00:03:34.020> choose<00:03:35.020> another

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
what it is but we'll choose another

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.440 
what it is but we'll choose another
route<00:03:35.470> around<00:03:35.620> ok<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:36.520> it<00:03:36.760> seems<00:03:36.940> coordinated

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
route around ok so it seems coordinated

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.760 
route around ok so it seems coordinated

which routes to run as well and which

which routes to run as well and which

routes that we need to run back to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
up on so that they can we have to fend

up on so that they can we have to fend
your<00:03:46.959> route<00:03:47.110> back<00:03:47.290> pick<00:03:47.770> up<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.980> flower<00:03:48.190> you

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
your route back pick up the flower you

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.110 
your route back pick up the flower you
happen<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.760> drop<00:03:48.910> it

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
the spy planes make a lot of sense and

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.479 
the spy planes make a lot of sense and

of the map to run using microphones is

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.860 
of the map to run using microphones is
obviously<00:03:57.890> important<00:03:58.340> as<00:03:58.430> well<00:03:58.610> and<00:03:59.150> having

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
obviously important as well and having

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.110 
obviously important as well and having
people<00:04:00.080> play<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.500> midfield<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.489> can<00:04:01.970> back

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
people play the midfield so you can back

you up as as party running something
else<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.269> funny<00:04:05.540> is<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:05.750> when<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:06.049> cut<00:04:06.200> the

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
else is funny is that when you cut the

flag I'm stuck at the air here and

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.580 
flag I'm stuck at the air here and
slowly<00:04:08.209> floating<00:04:08.690> down<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.140> that<00:04:09.260> happens

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
slowly floating down and that happens

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.670 
slowly floating down and that happens
quite<00:04:09.799> a<00:04:09.860> bit<00:04:10.870> all<00:04:11.870> right<00:04:12.019> so<00:04:12.200> in<00:04:12.379> terms<00:04:12.530> of

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
quite a bit all right so in terms of

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.140 
quite a bit all right so in terms of
what<00:04:12.890> i<00:04:12.920> wanted<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.280> show<00:04:13.489> in<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.819> overview

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
what i wanted to show in the overview

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.000 
what i wanted to show in the overview
i'm<00:04:14.810> going<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:15.019> speed<00:04:15.319> it<00:04:15.349> up<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.680> little<00:04:15.829> bit

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
i'm going to speed it up a little bit

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.729 
i'm going to speed it up a little bit
and<00:04:16.370> we<00:04:17.060> can<00:04:17.090> see<00:04:17.419> you<00:04:18.109> will<00:04:18.260> analyze<00:04:18.590> it

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
and we can see you will analyze it

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.780 
and we can see you will analyze it
together<00:04:18.829> and<00:04:19.100> see<00:04:19.220> what<00:04:19.250> happens<00:04:19.639> straight

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
together and see what happens straight

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.640 
together and see what happens straight
up<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.970> start<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.780> it's<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:20.930> direct<00:04:21.109> line<00:04:21.320> flag

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
up to start so it's a direct line flag

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.760 
up to start so it's a direct line flag
the<00:04:21.799> flag<00:04:21.919> almost<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:23.240> maps<00:04:23.419> fairly<00:04:23.840> linear

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
the flag almost the maps fairly linear

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.200 
the flag almost the maps fairly linear
in<00:04:25.100> that<00:04:25.220> respect<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.699> you<00:04:25.760> can<00:04:25.850> get<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.090> it

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
in that respect that you can get to it

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.700 
in that respect that you can get to it
quite<00:04:26.389> easy<00:04:26.539> and<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:26.840> entire<00:04:27.139> team<00:04:27.470> even

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
quite easy and that entire team even

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.560 
quite easy and that entire team even
though<00:04:27.740> they<00:04:27.919> got<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.280> flag<00:04:28.610> cap<00:04:28.910> claim<00:04:29.419> or

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
though they got the flag cap claim or

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.620 
though they got the flag cap claim or
texting<00:04:29.930> out<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.710> can<00:04:30.889> see<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.310> entire<00:04:31.630> red

so that was the grenade that was thrown

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.890 
so that was the grenade that was thrown
from<00:05:34.670> me<00:05:35.670> talking<00:05:36.060> about<00:05:36.300> who's<00:05:36.540> going<00:05:36.690> to<00:05:36.810> be

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
from me talking about who's going to be

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.480 
from me talking about who's going to be
there<00:05:37.080> but<00:05:37.500> I<00:05:37.560> still<00:05:37.770> got<00:05:37.920> taken<00:05:38.130> out<00:05:38.310> because

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
there but I still got taken out because

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.890 
there but I still got taken out because
it<00:05:38.580> didn't<00:05:38.790> kill<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.060> guy<00:05:39.090> so<00:05:39.660> that<00:05:39.780> was<00:05:39.870> just

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
it didn't kill the guy so that was just

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.170 
it didn't kill the guy so that was just
poor<00:05:40.170> coordination<00:05:40.550> but<00:05:41.550> on<00:05:41.700> the<00:05:41.850> very<00:05:41.880> next

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
poor coordination but on the very next

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.300 
poor coordination but on the very next
attack<00:05:42.630> attempt<00:05:43.380> when<00:05:43.710> we<00:05:43.830> try<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.040> get<00:05:44.220> the

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
attack attempt when we try to get the

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.790 
attack attempt when we try to get the
flag<00:05:44.960> someone<00:05:45.960> is<00:05:46.110> successful<00:05:46.620> in<00:05:46.710> getting

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
flag someone is successful in getting

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.970 
flag someone is successful in getting
that<00:05:47.010> guy<00:05:47.640> off<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:47.850> flag<00:05:48.210> in<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.510> corner<00:05:48.980> and

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.330 
that guy off the flag in the corner and

I think that's about to come up now
there<00:05:53.340> we<00:05:53.430> go<00:05:53.580> has<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:54.060> grenade<00:05:54.330> from<00:05:54.600> Wayne

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
and he caps flag and it runs back the

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.330 
and he caps flag and it runs back the
