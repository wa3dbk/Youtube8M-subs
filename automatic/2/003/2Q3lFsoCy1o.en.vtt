00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.229 
will throw in an immediate throw just
clicked<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.790> let<00:02:22.910> go<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:24.849> so<00:02:25.849> now<00:02:25.880> if<00:02:26.060> we<00:02:26.150> do

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
clicked and let go and so now if we do

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.880 
clicked and let go and so now if we do
about<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.450> two<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.870> half<00:02:26.989> second<00:02:27.470> throw<00:02:27.650> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
about a two and a half second throw a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.780 
about a two and a half second throw a
little<00:02:28.190> bit<00:02:28.400> farther

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.360 

and<00:02:34.790> if<00:02:35.569> you<00:02:35.660> hold<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:35.959> for<00:02:35.989> 4<00:02:36.440> seconds<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.220> can

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
and if you hold it for 4 seconds you can

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:47.220 
and if you hold it for 4 seconds you can
even<00:02:37.520> farther<00:02:37.880> throw

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.119 

so<00:02:47.860> essentially<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:49.000> longer<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.860> hold<00:02:50.860> of

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
so essentially the longer the hold of

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.070 
so essentially the longer the hold of
the<00:02:51.159> last<00:02:51.549> fire<00:02:51.909> as<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.450> are<00:02:52.569> about<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.840> throw

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
the last fire as you are about to throw

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.990 
the last fire as you are about to throw
it<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.769> farther<00:02:54.159> the<00:02:54.700> grenade<00:02:55.060> will<00:02:55.209> go

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
it the farther the grenade will go

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.089 
it the farther the grenade will go
that's<00:02:58.000> all<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.360> have<00:02:58.540> for<00:02:58.569> now<00:02:58.750> stay<00:02:59.110> tuned<00:02:59.680> for

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
that's all I have for now stay tuned for

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.430 
that's all I have for now stay tuned for
more<00:03:00.370> updates
