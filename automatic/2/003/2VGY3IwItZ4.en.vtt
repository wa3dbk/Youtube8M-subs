worth<00:01:48.720> about<00:01:48.810> 40,000<00:01:49.380> actually<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:49.770> I'm<00:01:49.829> just

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
worth about 40,000 actually but I'm just

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.899 
worth about 40,000 actually but I'm just
gonna<00:01:50.040> try<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.280> sell<00:01:50.369> him<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.700> low<00:01:50.759> and

gonna try and sell him for a low and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.039 
gonna try and sell him for a low and
more<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.420> make<00:01:51.450> some<00:01:51.659> profit<00:01:51.810> and

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
thousand we also got a bow down there

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.830 
thousand we also got a bow down there
and<00:04:41.310> convert<00:04:41.910> him<00:04:41.940> from<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.240> center<00:04:42.480> forward<00:04:42.750> to

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
and convert him from a center forward to

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.540 
and convert him from a center forward to
a<00:04:42.870> cam<00:04:43.230> in<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.470> four<00:04:43.680> triple<00:04:44.010> till<00:04:44.160> we<00:04:44.280> listen
