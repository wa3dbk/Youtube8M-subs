was<00:00:03.929> different<00:00:04.380> you<00:00:04.440> see<00:00:04.770> do<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.609> see<00:00:05.759> you<00:00:06.359> do

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
was different you see do you see you do

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.350 
was different you see do you see you do
as<00:00:07.560> if<00:00:07.710> all<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.919> down<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.639> all<00:00:08.910> these<00:00:09.030> turn

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
as if all the down and all these turn

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.970 
as if all the down and all these turn
again<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.929> they<00:00:10.110> still<00:00:10.469> don't<00:00:10.650> make<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.889> look

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
again and they still don't make it look

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.700 
again and they still don't make it look
like<00:00:11.130> we<00:00:11.250> mesh<00:00:11.400> together<00:00:12.049> around<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.290> rotate

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
like we mesh together around the rotate

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.890 
like we mesh together around the rotate
and<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.639> closes<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.269> one<00:00:15.480> that

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and that just closes that one that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.480 
and that just closes that one that

alright so we're going to the moon door
now<00:00:54.870> again<00:00:55.379> perfect<00:00:55.800> timing<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.699> get

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
now again perfect timing you have to get

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.479 
now again perfect timing you have to get
it<00:00:56.879> right<00:00:57.440> if<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> don't<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:59.070> then

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
it right if you don't get it right then

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.799 
it right if you don't get it right then
you'll<00:00:59.579> get<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.789> wrong<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.629> don't

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
you'll get it wrong and if you don't

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.270 
you'll get it wrong and if you don't
score<00:01:00.960> more<00:01:01.109> points<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.410> other<00:01:01.559> team<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.039> can

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
score more points the other team you can

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.109 
score more points the other team you can
win<00:01:03.110> right<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.710> furthermore<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.820> will<00:01:05.970> climb

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
win right so furthermore we will climb

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.969 
win right so furthermore we will climb
this<00:01:06.299> tower<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.439> there<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.770> actually

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
this tower now and there are actually

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.120 
this tower now and there are actually
several<00:01:08.250> configurations<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.150> tower

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
several configurations to this tower

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.740 
several configurations to this tower
much<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> other<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.640> whether<00:01:12.510> there

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
much like the other one whether there

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.210 
much like the other one whether there
are<00:01:12.780> sit<00:01:13.140> where<00:01:13.380> there<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.740> blocks<00:01:14.040> in

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
are sit where there are blocks in

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.440 
are sit where there are blocks in
certain<00:01:14.460> places<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.119> order<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.420> which

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
certain places and the order in which

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.020 
certain places and the order in which
they<00:01:15.689> turn<00:01:15.950> some<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.250> turn<00:01:17.610> orders<00:01:17.909> are

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
they turn some of the we turn orders are

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330 
they turn some of the we turn orders are
much<00:01:18.270> harder<00:01:18.630> than<00:01:18.689> others<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.140> also<00:01:19.340> it's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
much harder than others and also it's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.399 
much harder than others and also it's
only<00:01:20.610> occasionally<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.810> there's<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.080> turning

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
only occasionally that there's a turning

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.990 
only occasionally that there's a turning
block<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.189> usually<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.700> decide

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
block there it's usually if you decide

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.490 
block there it's usually if you decide
you<00:01:24.150> want<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:24.540> whatever<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you want to get whatever it is in the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.649 
you want to get whatever it is in the
torch<00:01:25.710> though<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.939> decided<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.360> didn't

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
torch though because I decided I didn't

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.749 
torch though because I decided I didn't
it<00:01:28.020> wasn't<00:01:28.409> fair<00:01:28.590> okay<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:29.430> we've<00:01:29.549> got<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it wasn't fair okay now we've got the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.730 
it wasn't fair okay now we've got the
four<00:01:29.909> blocks<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> rest<00:01:31.350> chicken

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
four blocks here with the rest chicken

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.859 
four blocks here with the rest chicken
that's<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.250> rose<00:01:32.460> beef<00:01:32.759> often<00:01:33.360> lean<00:01:33.540> back<00:01:33.720> on

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that's all rose beef often lean back on

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.270 
that's all rose beef often lean back on
there<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.200> don't<00:01:34.470> forget<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.860> look<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.070> again

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
there but don't forget to look at again

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.280 
there but don't forget to look at again
this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> nicer<00:01:36.689> orders<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> has

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
this is one of the nicer orders it has

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.469 
this is one of the nicer orders it has
rather<00:01:38.130> than<00:01:38.280> say<00:01:38.490> spitting<00:01:39.030> when<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> step

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
rather than say spitting when you step

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.499 
rather than say spitting when you step
on<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:39.750> something<00:01:40.049> stupid<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
on or something stupid like that and

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.219 
on or something stupid like that and
