 hello ipad ipad tips dot com on 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.040
 Today I have a very tutorial 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.099
 Nice to teach you how to use 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.610
 exponential numbers on ipad keyboard 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.610
 and iphone 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.260
 good we have to create keyboard shortcuts 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:23.950
 for this we will copy the symbols 2 and 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.520
 3 exponentials to then create these 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.039
 touch shortcuts on the number 1 in safe 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.789
 and even look like a magnifying glass then chose 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.960
 copy 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.890
 open the settings there in general keyboard and 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.199
 then downstairs add new keyboard 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.129
 in sentence let's touch the white space 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:49.510
 and then choose paste in shortcut 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.090
 Let's write one less and this will be the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.920
 our shortcut to access this 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.590
 number is exponential state 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.520
 Let's do this with all three 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.370
 exponential numbers 2 and 3 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.820
 we will go back to the settings we will add 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:11.200
 a new shortcut we touched a space in 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.640
 white because we touch paste in shortcut 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.470
 less pain 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.470
 we will do this also with the number 3 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.319
 Let's play here carefully because we do not 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:27.880
 it's so easy to hit it right 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:32.080
 when we get the 3 copy the bible of the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:36.009
 settings add a new shortcut we play 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.789
 in white space paste in therefore less 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.050
 three 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.720
 I saved all three and now it 's time to test 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.720
 to see how these shortcuts work 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.130
 get reminders here to use 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:56.440
 as an example when playing - one of them suggests 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.929
 already the exchange by the exponential then you 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.970
 press space bar he swaps 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:05.110
 automatically let's put it here 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.039
 it's also number two in third 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.000
 example 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:14.050
 we subscribe at least three it suggests three 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.270
 okubo we give space that works is easy 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.370
 Is not it 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.110
 if you learn something new do not forget 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.879
 to give your little jewel and follow our 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.519
 channel on youtube 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:28.799
 I want to thank your audience for a 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.799
 big hug and to have such
