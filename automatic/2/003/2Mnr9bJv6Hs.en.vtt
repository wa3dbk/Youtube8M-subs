00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.830
 hello youtube friends though the e-tron 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.810
 it was a new video this time with a 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.910
 tutorial on how to enter the games of the 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.260
 hungry 'in what would be michael pocket 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.850
 edition version 0.11 point 1 so what 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.670
 only that we should be first 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.360
 it would be already inside the microsoft 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.129
 obviously we are going to click on play and as 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.420
 come here I have the servers but that 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.660
 you have to be to enter because here already 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.250
 is not the option of goodbye server or as 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.260
 it was called before because I did not either 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.730
 agreement the only thing we have to do 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.630
 is to hit the button again 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.100
 and here it gives us about three buttons without 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.790
 count those who are here in the menu 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.559
 creation of the world that would be behind 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.400
 advanced and this button here that is 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.860
 in white point is the one that we need 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.510
 that has a cross and an arrow the only thing 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.509
 what we have to do is give him in that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.810
 button and how they sold I know that you 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.050
 we can add an external server to a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.729
 external server by your ip or address 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.770
 for the periodic course that we have 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.289
 that being first is seeing the port 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.119
 it is ok it can be any port I 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.730
 I always say that this is the same well 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.030
 that this does not change it at all 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.470
 the ip would just put it here that would be 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.220
 the description of the video if not 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.050
 they want to see here 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.780
 the ip that I use for games 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.010
 hunger would be play point lbs dot net 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.010
 here is the addict 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.890
 after this the only thing that we have to 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.780
 to do is give the fact and put a 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.690
 name for example here we have to 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.690
 put on hunger games ' 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.910
 and this now the only thing that we would touch 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.710
 so that we are already in function would 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.860
 put him in the option that he says scratching 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.500
 server so we just have to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.840
 give it to come server and as you see already what 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.690
 we have and in fact here you have it too 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.600
 but we're going to erase this one 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.450
 we just did and we have here what 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.700
 that would be the server yes yes we already have 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.190
 a few servers like this one like 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.140
 identify it very simple only here we 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.930
 tell 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.110
 instant budapest and here also that 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.880
 sky wars splif etc so not here not 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.459
 is specified but the hunger games 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.370
 technically this server play point 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.620
 lbs dot net 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.569
 would not be directed to what would be 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.819
 different servers in case one is already 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.500
 full now it looks like it's not just 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.380
 give a click 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.210
 and as you see, he has already put everything 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.400
 only one thing to do now to play is 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.500
 this account is registered write you 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.910
 dreaming account change your name would be 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.590
 everything to do so only 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.640
 we would have to put here our 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.630
 password for example I know 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.840
 cats 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:09.230
 and give the following place the tutorial 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.230
 of how to teach you register but vote 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.970
 good technically it would be all for 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.620
 things get so hungry 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.720
 As you can see, the lobby is very well done 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.159
 it's something that I liked a lot have 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.900
 the different servers but for 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.780
 enter these we need to have the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.049
 servers for example sky wars we have it 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.540
 the server in our director not only 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.159
 we go to the store we have the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.670
 deployment we also leave alone and 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.829
 there and ready dewar's I do not know the ip 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.200
 so if anyone knows please pass 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.150
 I the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.670
 and the main game mode that would be 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.170
 the hunger games or survival game is 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.319
 that we just have to go to 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.540
 here and ready to enter a game 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.250
 we just have to give it in joint but if 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.860
 we have not registered we have not put 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.900
 our password obviously if you 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.230
 we give would not be that we would have to 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.720
 access first so technically 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.810
 it would be all for today's tutorial I hope 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.090
 that has served you very much please 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.040
 comment subscribe give yourself like and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.480
 they share the video with their friends in case 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.980
 Some do not know how to enter what 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.000
 would be the games of hunger in wake up 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.549
 because the edition 0.11 point 1 good 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.650
 it would be 0.11 point 1 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:27.229
 I think it had done well and good 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.229
 well this would be all this is not a gamers 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.400
 good to see let's see if the server 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.710
 carries 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.240
 he took us like this he got us well we 're already 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.820
 in what would be the sky wars server 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.070
 for example 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.320
 we just have to have it already in the 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.300
 micro was the server and technically no longer 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.780
 it is directed to the brain that we 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.850
 we have 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.260
 well now yes this would be all for the 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.910
 tutorial today I hope that I have you 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.090
 liked as I said already share with your 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.910
 friends like and subscribe is because I 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.080
 to climb all this time that is the gone 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.340
 of the official version of minecraft 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.340
 because of edition version 0.11 point 1 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.380
 then tutorials and motorcycles just like 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.050
 textures as well as things with the pad 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.300
 launcher and different game modes 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.030
 that already go from sky words to you 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.430
 same if someone passes it the ip 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.680
 and it's good but now I say goodbye and 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.670
