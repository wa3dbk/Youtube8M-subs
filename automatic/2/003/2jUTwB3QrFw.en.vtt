00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.380
 john people your race kieran and welcome to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.609
 another new complete you by mine 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.839
 channel varieties gaming 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.130
 in the background game-play look 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.500
 of course just back to an old one 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.090
 trusted chem-dry headline rejects him 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.469
 son and i find him on so there is 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.429
 of course you really mind playing 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.960
 I think 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.180
 game-play they pick this folder up at the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.410
 one side a little newbie 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.970
 treat side also a bit pro 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.590
 because rejecting him is of course very bad 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.880
 small there is a lot of action and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.039
 repeat people over 100 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.539
 knows travel stories is therefore quite 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.859
 easy 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.590
 because obviously a lot of action is 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.360
 in a lot and miss may come across 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.430
 kemps get likes and 100 plus go 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.899
 this folder also becomes more difficult because 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.550
 lots of humus come running towards you 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.540
 and because there is so much action between max 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.309
 we like that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.050
 is of course exactly like a mug 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.879
 just a little differently decorated different 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.129
 put down house and do what I can 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.170
 exactly the same on you will break well 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.370
 you pick it up and games look like you 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.800
 breaks bad and you just stand 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.180
 negative that is mike so you have to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.770
 just be lucky that you cup against it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.910
 good and miss that comes to you a bit 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.430
 against chilling 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.870
 team is coming or sitting and can also 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.609
 just get a nice score of course 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.500
 the website they but here i have site you 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.150
 let's put the brakes ton there 5 x and external 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.860
 suppressor of course on town itself too 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.119
 one can see the just nice campsite 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 a few pieces are out of it 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.540
 cut and that is because then I just 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.490
 really for a minute no one encounter 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.960
 that i always try when i am pastors 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.700
 want as I do here 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.770
 check the sponge of course if you like 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.330
 with a sl Drive plays myzone 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.710
 It is never handy to take a card 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.970
 to go and if you like sites and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.890
 plays a wind faster core mud 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.900
 to pick up you must go players they machine 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.460
 such as effects such as tempo such as the k7 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.409
 but is just m pool 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.240
 chill campsite you get me and spans 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.220
 webcams she who wants to get like here so 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.930
 was also doing a bit then must 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.210
 just with an STD players as the brake 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.220
 it us like the dog bed like the a12 and 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.780
 So you see a few pieces are there 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.850
 a few loops cut out in between 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.799
 just go through at once because sometimes if 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.020
 so you apply this tactic to you 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.460
 just keep walking with the nmi flag 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.899
 does not stick 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.090
 there's a shout it's going to run through it 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.290
 you'll sometimes just for him 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.820
 no one against and then you should not 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.409
 just believe what i am about my 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.360
 someone encountered run up to malan 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.770
 no, just stay nice and quiet 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.079
 sven keep you stay focused 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.790
 because after a while you will see them 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.810
 just stretch in asia and 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.149
 had this a bit in the background 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.970
 lost and that is, among other things 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.800
 my fault 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.450
 I also say honest man so I was 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.670
 times running between that flag 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.860
 of enemy heavy and I did not grab them and 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.060
 yes i usually want every jar 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.530
 but sometimes I think of it 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.760
 getting a known corpse is also again 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.800
 that's nice to do that was me 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.240
 doing here and sometimes your best 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.040
 straw or if you are just enjoying yourself 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.480
 then you look through healed but the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.190
 point limit and was a bit after 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.840
 you lose double as a result 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.610
 some jars then you think wow i am 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.930
 I shake almost 100 plus cubans 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.010
 Kem Strike and I watch the politely 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.900
 with a think of 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.010
 shit the porsche about two points 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.810
 and then you go stress and 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.430
 of course it's the same as a 10 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.500
 that's the best thing you are doing 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.300
 their team just with street you have to 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.990
 the chem-dry and look at polymer tessy 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.430
 from 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.350
 shit increased 10 kills how ease you 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.580
 sport also run and what do you know I go 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.500
 Of course not within will be a 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.030
 bit of those moments you need everywhere 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.010
 remains just like the call of duty plays 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.300
 it is a bit irritating of course 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.920
 because you must look like your m oh my 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.240
 laptop turkish should pay attention to the throat 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.740
 feature should watch your throat cover 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.180
 must with the minimap you have to laptop 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.800
 field or must pay attention to the point limit 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.030
 you are concerned about your environment you need 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.110
 pay attention that you see mora you have to 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.640
 watch your team bit with the construction 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.110
 mean that you have so many things 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.490
 pay attention when you play call of duty and that 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.080
 I personally find the 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.180
 difficulty level i can do it one 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.010
 little multi-tasking of course but if 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.380
 you want to be a good cozy to play then 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.269
 you really have to go on everything at the same time 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.340
 You can watch your one on your minimum 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.000
 je m nice because sometimes when you whose 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.739
 soil stripping 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.690
 is also simply no longer an ammo in and 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.560
 as with my found format getting sick with 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.510
 a car without 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.070
 and moko bisai the cousin of shit i can 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.410
 no more sliedrecht 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.540
 call of duty is just a multi bag 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.310
 now word made up by Jan 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.049
 multi-touch Turning 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.880
 game what you have to stay led and everywhere 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.950
 I find that so challenging with this game with 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.209
 you can really just train yourself to 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.980
 do things at the same time as you 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.269
 of course sitting on the toilet you can do it too 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.769
 do you just go there pooping 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.959
 to play on your mobile game 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.370
 also two things at the same time so train it 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.290
 yourself that you have several things 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.760
 at the same time I can do it 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.220
 strike here again almost within the cap 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.930
 itself lasted about five and one 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.430
 half a minute so I have another or 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.080
 minutes between printed mesh 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.400
 nice can drag it to the look you 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.290
 I see it was good the spawn 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.239
 check I was good just at the and 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.350
 level go it may only unfortunately what 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.940
 so pick it up then we are 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.709
 so kill teammates 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.470
 I'm very sorry you're the best you will 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.840
 co and myself because he is by me 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.800
 you just lost the game 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.720
 I have brought in a core site 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.160
 so i think own good except look 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.450

 subscribers already met and city is

 a call or duty channel 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.450

 the gamepad you stuck because we 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.950
 start playing the flag 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.460
 dangerous taxi driver to heart 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.870
