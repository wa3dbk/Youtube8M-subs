the ring now changes and therefore this

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.830 
the ring now changes and therefore this
recipient<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> call<00:01:36.030> knows<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.689> they

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.700 
why if some song bothered to put a
transfer<00:01:48.270> key<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> system<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
transfer key on the system and the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.230 
transfer key on the system and the
reason<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.040> course<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.000> not

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
reason of course is is that not

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.550 
reason of course is is that not
everybody<00:01:51.659> might<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> phone<00:01:52.320> with

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
everybody might have a phone with

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.370 
everybody might have a phone with
sufficient<00:01:53.100> soft<00:01:53.790> keys<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
sufficient soft keys on there to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.080 
sufficient soft keys on there to
represent<00:01:55.530> each<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.369> extensions<00:01:56.909> they've

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
represent each of the extensions they've

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.160 
represent each of the extensions they've
got<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> building<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:57.899> you've<00:01:58.020> got<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
got in the building if you've got a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.719 
got in the building if you've got a
couple<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.560> hundred<00:01:58.680> extensions<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.579> might

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
couple of hundred extensions you might

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
couple of hundred extensions you might
not<00:01:59.880> have<00:01:59.969> enough<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.630> might<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:00.930> have

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
not have enough you might not have

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.990 
not have enough you might not have
enough<00:02:01.350> buttons<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> reason

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
enough buttons for that so the reason

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.850 
enough buttons for that so the reason
you<00:02:03.119> would<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> transfer<00:02:03.899> key<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you would have a transfer key is to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.709 
you would have a transfer key is to
transfer<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.520> specific<00:02:06.000> extension<00:02:06.540> so

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
transfer to a specific extension so

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.900 
transfer to a specific extension so
let's<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> call<00:02:08.429> comes<00:02:08.670> in

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
let's just do that so a call comes in

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.300 
let's just do that so a call comes in
and<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> call<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.500> answered

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.590 

you<00:02:15.310> can<00:02:15.490> then<00:02:15.610> hit<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:15.910> transfer<00:02:16.330> key

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
you can then hit the transfer key

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600 
you can then hit the transfer key
followed<00:02:17.260> by<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.830> extension<00:02:18.340> number<00:02:18.580> you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
followed by the extension number you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.910 
followed by the extension number you
wish<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.270> transfer<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.840> call<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.710> again

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
wish to transfer the call to and again

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.440 
wish to transfer the call to and again
if<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.130> wish<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.280> blind<00:02:21.610> transfer<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.210> just

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
if you wish to blind transfer it just

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.600 
if you wish to blind transfer it just
put<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.660> phone<00:02:22.840> down<00:02:22.900> immediately<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.800> there

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
put the phone down immediately and there

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.990 
put the phone down immediately and there
you<00:02:24.700> go

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
you go

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.580 
you go
does<00:02:25.180> she<00:02:25.300> call<00:02:25.510> through<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.930> transfer<00:02:26.470> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
does she call through to transfer the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.220 
does she call through to transfer the
extension<00:02:27.130> another<00:02:28.060> reason<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.750> would

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
extension another reason that you would

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
need the transfer key is the ability to

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.440 
need the transfer key is the ability to
transfer<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.620> call<00:02:32.680> out<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.550> building<00:02:33.940> so
