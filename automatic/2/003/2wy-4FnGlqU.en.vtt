00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.799
 Australian scientists gave an account 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.440
 of an island in the South Pacific that forms 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.000
 part of surprisingly appears in 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.369
 the maps for more than a decade 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.289
 but that does not really exist for 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.349
 check the scientists traveled 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.250
 for 25 days on board a vessel for 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:31.190
 study the coral sea ​​area 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.140
 the nonexistent island appears regularly 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.940
 in scientific publications since 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.710
 the year 2000 and even the maps 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.320
 Meteorologists mention it 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.719
 it is suggested that the island appeared in the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.570
 map as a trap of rights of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.780
 author but has remained unopposed 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 Since then, it is normal practice 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.940
 cartography placing a brand starts in 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.730
 the map in order to catch the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.730
 possible violators of copyright without 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.589
 However, the hydrographic service 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.110
 Australian a department of the navy 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.509
 real from australia said that this is not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.909
 used to make the 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.390
 nautical charts 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.390
 or 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.840
 André in the selection 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:36.840
 on the island it should be there between 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.460
 australia and new caledonia in the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.150
 cartographic program 'google earth' 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.760
 appears with the name of sandy 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.740
 the problem is that it does not appear in the 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.750
 documents of the French government country that 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.970
 would have jurisdiction over her either 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.040
 is in the navigation charts that are 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.260
 elaborate from measurements of 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.030
 depth a team member 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.160
 scientist from the university of 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.500
 Western Australia said that after a 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.360
 good laugh he and his companions 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.910
 they started studying the seabed 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.260
 to send later that 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.960
 information to the authorities 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.490
 competent authorities and modify the respective 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.490
 world maps
