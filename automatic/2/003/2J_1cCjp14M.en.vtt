00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.080
 servus list remained the ocher and 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.580
 this video is directed again 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 especially to the car drivers the no 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.509
 that's why they often ride a motorcycle 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.160
 ask a question why the 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.560
 Motorcyclists always so funny 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.300
 drive snake lines and the first 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.029
 reason that I just started 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.230
 the tires are just and you want the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.129
 Ride a train if you go now 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.510
 times such a mature look at the car 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.269
 then of course he puts it completely on the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.650
 is a pretty rectangular thing and 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.750
 so that the mature is even 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.940
 warm and he also has at any time 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.829
 in each curve almost the same area 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.219
 which hangs up, that means it's faster 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.960
 was 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.989
 and when it's warm, it's everywhere 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.480
 equally warm motorcycle tires on the other hand 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.760
 it means that's about it when I'm like this 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.039
 then only the middle one of the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.500
 middle part of the tire warm and the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.789
 edges remain cold and cold tires 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.949
 or not warm driven tires 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.600
 At least that makes sure that you have the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.030
 Bends easily crashes therefore if I 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.580
 then a little snaking lines 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.009
 Can I heat the edges well? 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.860
 first reason the second reason also serves 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.020
 times that safety as a motorcyclist 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.670
 namely at intersections and junctions 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.189
 if I'm a bit of a snake 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.930
 I think the people think I am handicapped 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.659
 or drunk or anything but 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.880
 at least it does not overlook me and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.920
 that's the advantage you think so 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.680
 a angeber or what but you see me 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.850
 because I'm just going to snake lines 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.770
 and then becomes easy as a motorcyclist 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.810
 poorly recognized by the silhouette ago 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.490
 that's why snake lines drive by 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.140
 junction and further I highly recommend 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.970
 you tend to get less 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.160
 overlook 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.530
 point 3 it is also a very good exercise 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.320
 in the motorcycle driving school you learn 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.360
 precisely on such maneuvers 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.730
 I do not want anymore because of that 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.440
 Exercise just so that my feeling for that 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.180
 Motorcycle gets the agile is at 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.560
 which speed as me with 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.970
 Lenka must steer properly that 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.250
 motorcycle exactly what I want 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.150
 and of course you can do that if one 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.220
 just boring it 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.430
 a bit on the street practice with it 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.420
 yes gets better and get more feeling 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.280
 servus crowe has noticed very horny 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.110
 the fourth point is also with longer ones 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.670
 I like to do snakes 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.620
 just to focus on my concentration 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.220
 uphold you know it if your car 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.920
 drive etc 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.570
 then you do it even when it is night 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.380
 or so on you do not want to 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.780
 fall asleep 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.610
 then an air conditioner will turn you on 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.130
 makes the radio louder with a loud drop 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.780
 and so on to keep it simple and 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.190
 Now, of course, like on motorcycle 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.200
 but it also just helps 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.640
 really quite aware of the motorcycle 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.680
 to control all the time 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.000
 if you stop on the highway you drive 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.830
 has all the time straight ahead and so 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.390
 further then one arrives in such a way 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.700
 despite rain man now synonymous guitar hero 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.260
 Effect because everything flies past one 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.880
 you do not take the movement at all 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.920
 therefore, was more properly from the same 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.720
 And at some point you feel safe yes 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.239
 like now maybe you drive the 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.040
 the same speed you see 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.330
 But things are flying past you 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.190
 assumes it was no longer conscious and 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.140
 snake lines make sure that is 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.500
 keep my concentration upright again 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.500
 get 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.020
 yes and the fifth and last point 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.710
 it just makes a lot of fun, of course 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.300
 strong folk so drivers drive 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.430
 I am not bothered by it 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.260
 simply a matter of safety it is 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.880
 a matter of exercise and so on and 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.380
 it just lacks a nice feeling to 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.880
 to be able to drive in serpentine lines 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.830
 you do not really experience that in the car 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.600
 actually the feeling of that 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.400
 flying mocha I wish you one 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.620
 Accident-free season makes you feel good 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.430

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.430
