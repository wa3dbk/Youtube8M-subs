00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 in order to reduce the harm from 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.400
 mobile phones uk kids 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.880
 up to nine to forbid not to use 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.469
 and in the United States create special phones 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.040
 who control the amount 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.259
 of talk 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.870
 but all these measures are useless if one 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.080
 child does not have a mobile phone and his 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.670
 neighbor on the desk there are both get 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.670
 equal exposure 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.740
 still a generation of children grew up 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.290
 especially in the west to which early 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.000
 childhood use cell phones 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.220
 here recently just such information three 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.350
 times higher 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.930
 It means that it has cancer. 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.260
 generations of children who favor cellular 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.420
 phones here last there 10 15 years 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.190
 some mutations occur when 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.920
 long phone conversation 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.420
 outgoing electromagnetic waves 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.870
 raise the temperature of the brain by a few 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.070
 tenths of a degree as a result 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.829
 microscopic patches of head tissue 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.890
 brain welded like a microwave 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.890
 ovens 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.380
 independent scientists in different countries 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.110
 proved that a cell phone and also 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.900
 damage the eyes during long 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.210
 talk is getting worse 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.399
 optical quality lens eyes when 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.310
 are you here about radiation turning 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.229
 damage begins to be corrected however 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.440
 at the same time at the microscopic level 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.899
 there is another problem on the surface 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:44.770
 The lenses appear small bubbles and they 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:47.690
 do not fade detected that radiation 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.289
 emitted by cell phone damages 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.080
 . 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.259
 this genetic glitch spreads 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.319
 the next generation of radio wave cells 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.850
 hit our body again and 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:04.490
 again until doctors destroy it even 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.619
 introduced such a thing as experience of use 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.149
 mobile phone those who 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.150
 talking on a cell phone 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.579
 over one hour a day can be attributed to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.470
 workers of hazardous industries few 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.930
 knows but the radio tubes are now 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.690
 actively used both at home and in offices 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.880
 too far from safe and load 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.810
 the brain is no less than 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.810
 mobile work 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.870
 guys who have a mobile phone 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.000
 and
