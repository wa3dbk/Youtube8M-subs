you in this one we're going to be taking
a<00:00:11.580> look<00:00:11.700> at<00:00:11.880> how<00:00:12.059> we<00:00:12.120> can<00:00:12.509> disable<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.320> secure

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
a look at how we can disable the secure

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.829 
a look at how we can disable the secure
boot<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.190> Windows<00:00:14.700> 8<00:00:15.000> or<00:00:15.059> Windows<00:00:15.299> 8.1

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
boot on a Windows 8 or Windows 8.1

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.099 
boot on a Windows 8 or Windows 8.1
operating<00:00:16.410> system<00:00:17.250> now<00:00:18.150> secure<00:00:18.779> boot<00:00:18.930> is

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
operating system now secure boot is

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.929 
operating system now secure boot is
inside<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.859> BIOS<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.490> need<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.760> access

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
inside the BIOS and we need to access

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.700 
inside the BIOS and we need to access
the<00:00:21.330> BIOS<00:00:21.630> now<00:00:21.840> there's<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> couple<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.439> ways<00:00:22.560> of

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
the BIOS now there's a couple of ways of

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.140 
the BIOS now there's a couple of ways of
going<00:00:22.800> about<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.640> I'm<00:00:23.730> going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.939> show<00:00:24.090> you

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
going about it and I'm going to show you

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.250 
going about it and I'm going to show you
both<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.449> them<00:00:24.750> okay

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
both of them okay

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.080 
both of them okay
one's<00:00:25.650> an<00:00:25.800> easier<00:00:26.070> way<00:00:26.220> one's<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:26.910> bit

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
one's an easier way one's a little bit

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.160 
one's an easier way one's a little bit
more<00:00:27.269> tricky<00:00:27.480> okay

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
more tricky okay

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.470 
more tricky okay
now<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.590> also<00:00:28.710> use<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.220> video<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.300> how

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
now you can also use this video on how

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.269 
now you can also use this video on how
to<00:00:30.539> get<00:00:30.869> into<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> BIOS<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.130> also

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
to get into the BIOS and this is also

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.979 
to get into the BIOS and this is also
another<00:00:32.669> way<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.329> doing<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.660> there's<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.960> few

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
another way of doing it there's a few

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.049 
another way of doing it there's a few
different<00:00:34.469> ways<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:35.040> doing<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.610> want<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
different ways of doing this I want to

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.639 
different ways of doing this I want to
show<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.270> both<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.050> let's<00:00:37.170> get<00:00:37.320> started<00:00:37.590> so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
on the actual desktop itself we go to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
on the actual desktop itself we go to
settings<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> charms<00:00:43.860> bar<00:00:44.070> come

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the BIOS and you just keep tapping on

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.399 
the BIOS and you just keep tapping on
this<00:02:04.320> key<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.520> reboot<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.990> will<00:02:07.200> come

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
this key on the reboot and it will come

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.580

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
BIOS you need to navigate around and you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.910 
BIOS you need to navigate around and you

the cursor keys are these arrows II you

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.199 
the cursor keys are these arrows II you
just<00:02:16.560> use<00:02:16.710> these<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.100> move<00:02:17.250> side<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.610> side<00:02:17.760> and

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
just use these to move side to side and

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.710 
just use these to move side to side and
up<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.510> down

everything is grayed out here as you can

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.560 
everything is grayed out here as you can

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
see you can't make any changes you can't

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.630 
see you can't make any changes you can't
disable<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.170> or<00:02:37.290> anything<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
disable it or anything like that

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.160 
disable it or anything like that
ok<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.090> reason<00:02:39.390> for<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:39.900> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
ok the reason for that is because you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.190 
ok the reason for that is because you
need<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.590> sapper<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.220> supervisor<00:02:42.180> password<00:02:42.959> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
need to sapper a supervisor password and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.140 
need to sapper a supervisor password and
as<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.410> can<00:02:43.500> see<00:02:43.560> they're<00:02:43.800> both<00:02:43.980> saying<00:02:44.700> clear

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
as you can see they're both saying clear

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.870 
as you can see they're both saying clear
so<00:02:45.600> we<00:02:45.720> need<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.989> enter<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> password<00:02:46.680> here<00:02:47.340> now

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
so we need to enter a password here now

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.820 
so we need to enter a password here now
this<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.480> really<00:02:48.840> stupid<00:02:49.170> way<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.590> doing

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
this is a really stupid way of doing

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.320 
this is a really stupid way of doing
things<00:02:50.040> because<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.550> people<00:02:50.760> forget<00:02:51.239> their

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
things because if people forget their

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.210 
things because if people forget their
password<00:02:51.390> they<00:02:52.260> get<00:02:52.440> locked<00:02:52.709> out<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:52.980> their

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220

BIOS<00:02:53.610> now<00:02:54.150> as<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.690> see<00:02:54.900> here<00:02:55.230> we<00:02:55.650> need<00:02:55.800> to

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
BIOS now as you can see here we need to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.410 
BIOS now as you can see here we need to
enter<00:02:56.280> our<00:02:56.310> password<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:57.000> I'm<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.239> going<00:02:57.390> to

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
enter our password so I'm just going to

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.009 
enter our password so I'm just going to
quickly<00:02:57.690> enter<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.260> password<00:02:58.530> here<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.720> we<00:03:00.840> can

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
quickly enter a password here so we can

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.530 
quickly enter a password here so we can
make<00:03:01.170> some<00:03:01.410> changes<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.010> our<00:03:02.640> secure<00:03:03.360> boot

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
make some changes to our secure boot

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.430 
make some changes to our secure boot
configuration<00:03:05.600> once<00:03:06.600> we've<00:03:06.780> done<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:06.959> push

continue<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:10.070> now<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:11.250> will<00:03:11.340> give<00:03:11.489> us<00:03:11.580> full

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
continue and now that will give us full

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.699 
continue and now that will give us full
control<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.390> we<00:03:12.600> can<00:03:12.630> actually<00:03:13.080> disable<00:03:13.410> or

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709
