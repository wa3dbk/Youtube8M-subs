00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
as you can see on the screen right now I

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.790 
as you can see on the screen right now I
started<00:00:24.210> trading<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.900> some<00:00:25.199> inform<00:00:25.680> players

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
started trading with some inform players

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.429 
started trading with some inform players
but<00:00:26.130> then<00:00:26.279> soon<00:00:26.580> realized<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.359> only<00:00:27.900> trading

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
but then soon realized that only trading

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.439 
but then soon realized that only trading
inform<00:00:28.769> players<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.340> by<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.060> isn't

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
inform players one by one just isn't

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.870 
inform players one by one just isn't
fast<00:00:30.689> enough<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.410> build<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.890> my<00:00:31.920> coin<00:00:32.309> total<00:00:32.730> in

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
fast enough to build up my coin total in

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.389 
fast enough to build up my coin total in
this<00:00:33.059> series<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> eventually<00:00:34.500> went<00:00:34.800> back<00:00:35.130> to

the<00:01:19.110> market<00:01:19.140> because<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.860> course<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.250> didn't

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the market because of course I didn't

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.850 
the market because of course I didn't
know<00:01:20.820> about<00:01:20.970> him<00:01:21.420> earlier<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.080> didn't<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.619> he

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
know about him earlier I didn't know he

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.830 
know about him earlier I didn't know he

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
had an upgraded version and so probably

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.690 
had an upgraded version and so probably
no<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.200> else<00:01:25.470> did<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.340> was<00:01:26.430> actually<00:01:26.520> very

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
no one else did that was actually very

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.999 
no one else did that was actually very
lucky<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.360> me<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:27.630> once<00:01:27.810> again<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.409> stuff

real<00:02:43.170> live<00:02:43.410> football<00:02:43.770> myself<00:02:44.400> as<00:02:44.550> well<00:02:44.880> so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
real live football myself as well so

real live football myself as well so
that<00:02:45.570> was<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> bit<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.080> bummer<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.440> anyways

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
that was a bit of a bummer but anyways

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.370 
that was a bit of a bummer but anyways
very<00:02:47.400> good<00:02:47.580> match<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.120> seems<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.690> have<00:02:48.810> been<00:02:48.990> I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
very good match it seems to have been I

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.560 
very good match it seems to have been I
heard<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.010> by<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.520> dominated<00:02:50.970> most<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
heard that by and dominated most of the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.230 
heard that by and dominated most of the
first<00:02:51.810> half<00:02:51.990> and<00:02:52.350> then<00:02:53.040> Arsenal<00:02:53.610> actually<00:02:54.120> got

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
first half and then Arsenal actually got

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.090 
first half and then Arsenal actually got
a<00:02:54.270> kind<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.840> lucky<00:02:55.080> goal<00:02:55.350> not<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> lucky<00:02:55.890> girl

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
a kind of a lucky goal not a lucky girl

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.160 
a kind of a lucky goal not a lucky girl
in<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> sense<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.760> they<00:02:57.090> didn't<00:02:57.900> deserve

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
in the sense that they didn't deserve

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.350 
in the sense that they didn't deserve
the<00:02:58.350> goal<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:58.770> i<00:02:58.980> think<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.550> corner<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.120> led

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
the goal but i think the corner that led

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.930 
the goal but i think the corner that led
to<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.660> goal<00:03:00.840> wasn't<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.290> corner<00:03:01.710> so<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.280> was

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
to the goal wasn't a corner so that was

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.000 
to the goal wasn't a corner so that was
a<00:03:02.970> bit<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.300> bummer<00:03:03.510> but<00:03:03.690> anyways<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.380> bit<00:03:04.710> of<00:03:04.830> a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
a bit of a bummer but anyways a bit of a

for<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.070> lot<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.220> people<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.820> course<00:03:54.000> the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
for a lot of people is of course the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.930 
for a lot of people is of course the
barcelona<00:03:54.720> vs<00:03:55.080> AC<00:03:55.290> milan<00:03:55.620> match<00:03:56.070> milan

barcelona vs AC milan match milan

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.420 
barcelona vs AC milan match milan
grabbing<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.570> two<00:03:57.840> nil<00:03:58.170> victory<00:03:58.770> there<00:03:59.100> and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
grabbing the two nil victory there and

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.520 
grabbing the two nil victory there and
there<00:03:59.610> was<00:03:59.700> just<00:03:59.910> quite<00:04:00.630> impressive<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.410> be

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
there was just quite impressive to be

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.740 
there was just quite impressive to be
honest<00:04:01.830> because<00:04:01.950> not<00:04:02.730> many<00:04:02.910> teams<00:04:03.210> can<00:04:03.570> beat

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
honest because not many teams can beat

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.720 
honest because not many teams can beat
Barcelona<00:04:04.320> in<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.710> first<00:04:04.920> place<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.190> then<00:04:05.550> I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
Barcelona in the first place and then I

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.430 
Barcelona in the first place and then I
think<00:04:06.210> Barcelona<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.660> didn't<00:04:06.930> have<00:04:07.080> too<00:04:07.320> many

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
think Barcelona I didn't have too many

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.740 
think Barcelona I didn't have too many
shots<00:04:07.800> or<00:04:08.010> even<00:04:08.400> chances<00:04:08.850> on<00:04:09.000> goal<00:04:09.330> so<00:04:09.600> that

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
shots or even chances on goal so that

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.140 
shots or even chances on goal so that
was<00:04:09.870> kind<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.200> ridiculous<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:11.730> see<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.120> a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
was kind of ridiculous to see that a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.750 
was kind of ridiculous to see that a
team<00:04:12.450> was<00:04:12.630> able<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.020> do<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.590> course<00:04:14.190> just

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
team was able to do that of course just

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.970 
team was able to do that of course just
by<00:04:15.000> defending<00:04:15.570> mainly<00:04:15.959> but<00:04:16.140> basically<00:04:16.739> that's

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
by defending mainly but basically that's

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.740 
by defending mainly but basically that's
more<00:04:17.370> or<00:04:17.400> less<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.609> only<00:04:18.120> way<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.299> can<00:04:18.510> play

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
more or less the only way you can play

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.289 
more or less the only way you can play
against<00:04:19.020> Barcelona<00:04:19.590> these<00:04:19.859> days<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:20.910> not

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
against Barcelona these days so not

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.420 
against Barcelona these days so not
really<00:04:21.480> blaming<00:04:21.989> my<00:04:22.500> meal<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:22.979> for<00:04:23.040> playing

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
really blaming my meal and for playing

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.430 
really blaming my meal and for playing
like<00:04:23.640> that<00:04:23.669> but<00:04:24.210> i<00:04:24.240> think<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.900> match<00:04:25.169> between

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
like that but i think the match between

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.920 
like that but i think the match between
barcelona<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.460> midland<00:04:27.000> is<00:04:27.150> far<00:04:27.510> from

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
barcelona and midland is far from

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.930 
barcelona and midland is far from
over<00:04:28.050> because<00:04:28.410> in<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:29.009> second<00:04:29.370> leg<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.729> this

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
over because in the second leg of this

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.270 
over because in the second leg of this
match<00:04:30.210> up<00:04:30.479> they<00:04:31.199> will<00:04:31.320> play<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.680> new<00:04:31.860> clamp<00:04:32.100> it

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
match up they will play the new clamp it

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.879 
match up they will play the new clamp it
will<00:04:32.400> be<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.550> totally<00:04:33.270> different<00:04:33.630> match<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.139> if

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
will be a totally different match and if

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.600 
will be a totally different match and if
Midland<00:04:35.639> can't<00:04:36.000> really<00:04:36.500> play<00:04:37.500> as<00:04:37.830> well<00:04:38.400> as

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
Midland can't really play as well as

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.159 
Midland can't really play as well as
they<00:04:38.759> did<00:04:38.880> in<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.150> first<00:04:39.419> match<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.870> still

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
they did in the first match I still

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.080 
they did in the first match I still
think<00:04:40.199> Barcelona<00:04:40.710> will<00:04:41.280> advance<00:04:41.639> in<00:04:41.880> this

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
think Barcelona will advance in this

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.170 
think Barcelona will advance in this
round<00:04:42.419> anyways<00:04:43.199> if<00:04:43.380> Milan<00:04:43.979> is<00:04:44.250> able<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:44.820> yeah

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
round anyways if Milan is able to yeah

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.999 
round anyways if Milan is able to yeah
kind<00:04:45.750> of<00:04:45.870> counter<00:04:46.289> them<00:04:46.440> in<00:04:46.650> their<00:04:46.860> own

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
kind of counter them in their own

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.219 
kind of counter them in their own
stadium<00:04:47.160> I<00:04:47.880> think<00:04:48.479> they<00:04:48.570> will<00:04:48.720> be<00:04:48.840> able<00:04:48.990> to

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
stadium I think they will be able to

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.170 
stadium I think they will be able to
grab<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.530> win<00:04:49.800> there<00:04:50.009> as<00:04:50.220> well<00:04:50.550> maybe<00:04:50.910> you're

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
grab a win there as well maybe you're

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.330 
grab a win there as well maybe you're
lucky<00:04:51.330> one<00:04:51.900> winner<00:04:52.350> something<00:04:52.770> like<00:04:52.919> that<00:04:53.160> and

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
lucky one winner something like that and

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.070 
lucky one winner something like that and
that<00:04:53.970> would<00:04:54.060> be<00:04:54.120> actually<00:04:54.240> kind<00:04:54.600> of<00:04:54.660> crazy<00:04:54.960> to

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
that would be actually kind of crazy to

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.050 
that would be actually kind of crazy to
see<00:04:55.440> Barcelona<00:04:55.680> being<00:04:56.220> kicked<00:04:56.520> out<00:04:56.639> that

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
see Barcelona being kicked out that

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.580 
see Barcelona being kicked out that
early<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.690> tournament<00:04:58.139> which<00:04:58.259> is<00:04:58.410> of

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
early of the tournament which is of

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.260 
early of the tournament which is of
course<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.919> possibility<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.789> basically

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
course a possibility and basically

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.029 
course a possibility and basically
everything<00:05:00.750> can<00:05:01.139> happen<00:05:01.169> in<00:05:01.530> football<00:05:01.680> which

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
everything can happen in football which

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.499

of<00:05:02.220> course<00:05:02.250> one<00:05:02.669> of<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:02.849> best<00:05:03.060> things<00:05:03.330> about

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
of course one of the best things about

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.390 
of course one of the best things about
the<00:05:03.840> game<00:05:04.080> so<00:05:04.470> what<00:05:04.620> I'd<00:05:04.710> actually<00:05:04.860> like<00:05:05.160> to
