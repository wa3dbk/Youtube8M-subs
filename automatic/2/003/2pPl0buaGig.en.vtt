here's<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.990> problem<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.590> run<00:02:46.860> into<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.460> I

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
here's the problem that I run into and I

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.820 
here's the problem that I run into and I
guess<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.330> is<00:02:48.480> logical<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.350> makes<00:02:49.470> sense

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
guess this is logical and makes sense

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.410 
guess this is logical and makes sense
but<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.370> know<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.670> something<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.030> thought<00:02:51.240> of

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
but I know it's something you thought of

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.420 
but I know it's something you thought of
is<00:02:51.540> I'll<00:02:51.990> get<00:02:52.350> up<00:02:52.470> there<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.800> others<00:02:53.220> start

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
is I'll get up there and others start

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.070 
is I'll get up there and others start
stringing<00:02:53.850> them<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.210> realize<00:02:54.540> I've<00:02:54.720> got<00:02:54.870> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
stringing them and realize I've got to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.290 
stringing them and realize I've got to
mail<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.620> stuck<00:02:55.920> together<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.310> get<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.150> end

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
mail and stuck together I get to the end

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.240 
mail and stuck together I get to the end
and<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.480> go<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.840> have<00:02:58.080> an<00:02:58.170> outlet<00:02:58.440> right<00:02:58.980> well

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and I go I have an outlet right well

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.040 
and I go I have an outlet right well
it's<00:02:59.370> kind<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.640> good<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.880> figure<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.240> out<00:03:00.390> for

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
it's kind of good to figure that out for

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.930 
it's kind of good to figure that out for
you<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.500> guess<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.800> part<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> plan<00:03:02.340> right<00:03:02.640> I

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
you I guess is part of the plan right I

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.640 
you I guess is part of the plan right I
know<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:03.960> just<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.260> it's<00:03:04.440> such<00:03:04.530> an

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
know and you just think it's such an

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.320 
know and you just think it's such an
easy<00:03:04.770> process<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.460> really<00:03:05.850> need<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> step

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
easy process but you really need to step

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.300 
easy process but you really need to step
this<00:03:06.510> out<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.960> your<00:03:06.990> mind<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.920> what<00:03:08.160> you

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
this out in your mind as to what you

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.770 
this out in your mind as to what you
want<00:03:08.520> out<00:03:09.030> first

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
want out first

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.420 
want out first
yeah<00:03:10.080> look<00:03:10.380> at<00:03:10.530> where<00:03:10.680> you're<00:03:10.860> working<00:03:11.100> well

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
yeah look at where you're working well

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.260 
yeah look at where you're working well
you<00:03:11.580> have<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.850> figure<00:03:11.970> out<00:03:12.120> how<00:03:12.210> many

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
you have to figure out how many

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.150 
you have to figure out how many
extension<00:03:12.840> cords<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.200> have<00:03:13.410> where<00:03:13.980> your

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
extension cords you have where your

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.980 
extension cords you have where your
outlets<00:03:14.670> are<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.300> then<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.480> don't<00:03:15.750> want<00:03:15.930> to

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
outlets are and then you don't want to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.260 
outlets are and then you don't want to
over<00:03:16.140> saturate<00:03:16.350> each<00:03:16.890> outlet<00:03:17.250> with<00:03:17.640> too<00:03:17.970> many

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
over saturate each outlet with too many

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.060 
over saturate each outlet with too many
plugins<00:03:19.230> because<00:03:19.470> then<00:03:19.680> you're<00:03:19.800> gonna<00:03:19.890> kind

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
plugins because then you're gonna kind

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.500 
plugins because then you're gonna kind
of<00:03:20.160> go<00:03:20.280> over<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.760> wattage<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.270> your<00:03:21.390> house

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
of go over the wattage that your house

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.720 
of go over the wattage that your house
can<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:22.410> take<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.860> your<00:03:22.890> hand<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.310> the
