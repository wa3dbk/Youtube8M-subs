00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
seasonality for price strengths and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.639 
seasonality for price strengths and
weaknesses<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.140> are<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.260> making<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.559> the

about<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.010> love<00:00:38.340> trade<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.790> fair<00:00:39.030> trade<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
about a love trade in the fair trade and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.500 
about a love trade in the fair trade and
the<00:00:40.200> fear<00:00:40.440> trade<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.040> still<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.090> in

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the fear trade is still there that is in

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.389 
the fear trade is still there that is in
respect<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> gold<00:00:43.440> being<00:00:43.680> difficult<00:00:43.980> because

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
respect to gold being difficult because

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.299 
respect to gold being difficult because
a<00:00:44.579> dollar<00:00:45.000> has<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.170> US<00:00:46.500> dollar<00:00:46.770> has<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
a dollar has the US dollar has the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.950 
a dollar has the US dollar has the
highest<00:00:47.730> real<00:00:47.879> interest<00:00:48.360> rates<00:00:48.570> when<00:00:48.809> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
highest real interest rates when you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.410 
highest real interest rates when you
compare<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> others<00:00:50.340> big<00:00:50.730> currencies<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
compare to others big currencies in the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.900 
compare to others big currencies in the
world<00:00:51.629> maybe<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.160> change<00:00:53.550> or<00:00:53.879> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
world maybe this will all change or a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.869 
world maybe this will all change or a
min<00:00:54.149> b<00:00:54.410> becomes<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:56.160> their<00:00:56.309> pushing<00:00:56.640> force

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
min b becomes with their pushing force

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.510 
min b becomes with their pushing force
become<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> major<00:00:57.539> global<00:00:57.960> currency<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.250> until

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
become a major global currency but until

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
become a major global currency but until
that<00:00:59.550> happens<00:00:59.989> right<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> dollar<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that happens right now the dollar is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.090 
that happens right now the dollar is
king<00:01:02.550> without<00:01:02.969> raising<00:01:03.600> interest<00:01:03.809> rates<00:01:04.170> so

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
king without raising interest rates so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.250 
king without raising interest rates so
that<00:01:05.129> does<00:01:05.670> create<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.000> bit<00:01:06.119> dampening<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:06.990> i

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
that does create a bit dampening and i

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.289 
that does create a bit dampening and i
sm<00:01:07.590> numbers<00:01:07.920> came<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.220> today<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> US<00:01:09.030> and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
sm numbers came out today in the US and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
sm numbers came out today in the US and
that<00:01:09.720> creates<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.200> volatility<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:11.010> regard

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
that creates some volatility with regard

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.460 
that creates some volatility with regard
to<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.700> dollar<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.750> i<00:01:12.780> think<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> bigger

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
to the dollar but i think the bigger

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.410 
to the dollar but i think the bigger
part<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> seasonality<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
part is the seasonality that's going to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
part is the seasonality that's going to
come<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:15.930> driven<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> love<00:01:16.740> trade

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
come in that's driven with a love trade

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
come in that's driven with a love trade
and<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.880> usually<00:01:18.150> gets<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.570> gold

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and and that usually gets a gold

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.800 
and and that usually gets a gold
bottling<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.409> June<00:01:19.710> May<00:01:20.580> June<00:01:20.880> sector<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
bottling in June May June sector and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
bottling in June May June sector and
we'll<00:01:22.470> see<00:01:22.650> how<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> real

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
we'll see how it's if we get the real

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.450 
we'll see how it's if we get the real
trough<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.799> going<00:01:25.799> into<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> second<00:01:26.430> half

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
those quant models but I think more

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.920 
those quant models but I think more
important<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.120> we<00:04:02.389> talked<00:04:02.659> about<00:04:02.750> a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
important is that we talked about a

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.020 
important is that we talked about a
couple<00:04:03.079> weeks<00:04:03.319> ago<00:04:03.409> is<00:04:03.739> de<00:04:03.919> shaw<00:04:04.250> there

they're one of the you know I think they

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.469 
they're one of the you know I think they

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:08.479

with<00:04:13.099> their<00:04:13.250> quant<00:04:13.519> models<00:04:13.909> all<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.120> a<00:04:14.180> sudden

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
with their quant models all of a sudden

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.140 
with their quant models all of a sudden
start<00:04:14.720> buying<00:04:15.049> gold<00:04:15.379> as<00:04:15.620> an<00:04:15.979> exposure<00:04:16.370> that's

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
start buying gold as an exposure that's

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.779 
start buying gold as an exposure that's
a<00:04:17.329> very<00:04:17.570> quant<00:04:18.529> driven<00:04:19.070> shop<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.519> I<00:04:19.549> think

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
a very quant driven shop and I think

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.879 
a very quant driven shop and I think
that<00:04:19.909> that's<00:04:19.940> important<00:04:20.599> to<00:04:20.659> recognize<00:04:21.200> how

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
that that's important to recognize how

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:22.840 
that that's important to recognize how
they<00:04:22.159> position

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
they position

mean to interest rates there's a whole
thought<00:04:34.490> process<00:04:34.550> now<00:04:35.240> it's<00:04:35.420> not<00:04:35.540> just

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
thought process now it's not just

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.350 
thought process now it's not just
looking<00:04:35.960> at<00:04:36.110> GDP<00:04:36.440> which<00:04:37.250> was<00:04:37.490> as<00:04:37.700> you<00:04:38.030> recall

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
looking at GDP which was as you recall

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.760 
looking at GDP which was as you recall
its<00:04:38.540> itaku<00:04:38.990> industrial<00:04:39.500> production

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
its itaku industrial production

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.590 
its itaku industrial production
declining<00:04:40.310> for<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.850> past<00:04:41.090> quarter<00:04:41.360> they

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
declining for the past quarter they

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.190 
declining for the past quarter they
reset<00:04:42.140> lower<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.830> GDP<00:04:43.310> numbers<00:04:43.670> last<00:04:44.240> week<00:04:44.480> so

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
reset lower the GDP numbers last week so

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.570 
reset lower the GDP numbers last week so
I<00:04:45.230> think<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:45.830> that's<00:04:45.980> had<00:04:46.250> a<00:04:46.280> bit<00:04:46.430> of<00:04:46.460> a

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
I think that that's had a bit of a

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.110 
I think that that's had a bit of a
negative<00:04:47.030> sentiment<00:04:47.630> but<00:04:48.050> this<00:04:48.850> income<00:04:49.850> and

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
negative sentiment but this income and

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.480 
negative sentiment but this income and
rising<00:04:50.570> income<00:04:50.720> will<00:04:51.080> be<00:04:51.110> important<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:52.280> if

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
rising income will be important that if

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.640 
rising income will be important that if
we<00:04:52.640> do<00:04:52.850> get<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.060> slowdown<00:04:53.480> this<00:04:53.780> job<00:04:54.020> creation

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
we do get a slowdown this job creation

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.980 
we do get a slowdown this job creation
you'll<00:04:55.130> probably<00:04:55.460> see<00:04:55.730> rates<00:04:56.000> fall<00:04:56.360> of<00:04:56.540> the<00:04:56.630> US

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
you'll probably see rates fall of the US

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.320 
you'll probably see rates fall of the US
and<00:04:57.740> then<00:04:57.890> therefore<00:04:58.160> the<00:04:58.460> dollar<00:04:58.850> will<00:04:59.090> get

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
and then therefore the dollar will get

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.260 
and then therefore the dollar will get
weaker<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:01.070> weaker<00:05:01.550> dollar<00:05:01.760> you'll<00:05:02.060> see

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
weaker and the weaker dollar you'll see

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.350 
weaker and the weaker dollar you'll see
