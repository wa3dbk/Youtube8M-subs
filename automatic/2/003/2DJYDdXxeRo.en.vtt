00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.520
 so for the gardens we will think 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.470
 spontaneously to flowers we will think 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.660
 spontaneously to the forms of shrubs 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.510
 but there is actually a whole area 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.130
 which is also very nice is that of 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.010
 trees with decorative bark 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.900
 the interest is that it's things that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.770
 that we see in the middle of winter often at 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.440
 when there is not much 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 else in the garden it's something 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.840
 what is discovered is small 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.900
 nuggets means that it is not seen 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.340
 always by far but as you go 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.409
 as we approach art we discover 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.420
 the beauty of these bark that often 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.830
 Moreover, changes according to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.360
 seasons that is to say that the jobs 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.159
 are going to be very different for example 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.930
 the jobs will be very different at 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.659
 spring in winter each time it's 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.770
 a show a little bit changing and 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.450
 we can manage to make pretty 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.549
 compositions while there is no more 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.030
 foliage thanks to the association of 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.950
 of trees with berries Corsican 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.440
 so it's something very 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.119
 interesting do not hesitate to 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.010
 try to introduce in his garden 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.780
 there are people who have written books 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.310
 on the beauty of the bark 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.049
 so here we are in a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.020
 composition that was really created 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.700
 especially for its winter effect of 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.439
 by the beauty of the bark 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.729
 so we have a job of the himalaya that 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.770
 is really one of the most 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.350
 blank exists it goes after summer course 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.000
 will become even whiter yet is there 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.729
 before there is a grove of 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.469
 so dogwoods that are trees 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.380
 which are very interesting because of the 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.670
 color of their young wood and there we have 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.509
 this one the flavie rowed to who is 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.689
 practically yellow 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.909
 we put the winter fire which is 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.740
 could truly say fluo like 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.700
 under the era and there are also some 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.710
 red varieties 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.270
 there are all kinds of varieties then 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.200
 so that they stay very pretty these bodies 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.869
 naked without actually what happens is that 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.789
 every year in retail the foot so 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.460
 that their vines are cut at the base 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.140
 so that it is always 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.370
 young shoots that we did not see this 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.930
 that the older shoot will become 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.180
 duller and less pretty or be 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.150
 every year every two years so 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.739
 it goes out 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.480
 a maple to a maple called 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.720
 lasserre grayed oms to these names are in 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.480
 Latin and it's commonly called 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.950
 cinnamon maple because so the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.689
 sabotage resides especially in the in the 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.739
 trunk that knows dander a little bit 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:38.319
 like natural cinnamon sticks there 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.180
 it is the cork oak so versus 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.260
 hubert which is a very famous tree but 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.459
 which is not widely used in 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.079
 gardens and that's a shame because at the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.049
 time he has a very pretty shape and in 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:51.099
 same time he has a bark that gives 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.510
 really very pretty pictures and wins 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.170
 to be present in the gardens a little a 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.480
 unimportant a little stupid so here it is 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.010
 we have a tree which really 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.909
 Corsican is among one of the most 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.609
 spectacular 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.170
 it's prunus its streets there so it's 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.629
 still part of prunus families 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.209
 com dcom the other cherry trees and there he 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.849
 there is a mahogany corsica only to one color 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.170
 absolutely exceptional and in addition 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.790
 this tree a nice port so that makes 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.470
 truly a very beautiful effect in isolated 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.299
 in a in the present time garden 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.699
 in the family of maples with skin of 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.879
 david acer snake a very beautiful 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:31.480
 copy with a red bark that is 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.829
 slightly streaked with vertical streaks and 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.359
 a little white plum case really 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.069
 an extremely spectacular color 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.169
 also in the garden an art of small 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.940
 development there we have in the 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.209
 family of prunus who is a still 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.430
 a 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.709
 a family where there are many trees 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.510
 with interesting bark 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.760
 this one called the prunus makli 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.819
 ambert beauty then his common name gets 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.970
 crosses and the cherry tree of korea and who 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.829
 is very interesting by a color yes 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.680
 reminiscent of a bit slow orange scrambling 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.229
 clear and therefore an extremely trunk 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.030
 decorative and it's a tree that goes 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:06.220
 give in addition white flowers like 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.680
 often the prunus in spring is 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.690
 often families that provide 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.319
 arms he is very beautiful and corsican and the 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.810
 prunus so there is cinnamon maple 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.510
 there are the streets n where it was born 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.020
 red corsican quite interesting the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.300
 prunus ma clique to a bark 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.490
 practically orange or golden and then 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.539
 also the whole family of jobs when 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.070
 often very contrasted barks 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.960
 because in fact the new Scotland is going 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.389
 burst will flake and leave 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.580
 appear a bark 9.2 souka often 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.080
 a completely different color 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.849
 then we will see some orange with 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.969
 with white sometimes a little bit of a 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.349
 little greenish there are colors that those 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.360
 who get married and who appear 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:53.190
 successively its form the shades 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.190
 hood is really pretty
