that primary dns error and you're going

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.160 
that primary dns error and you're going

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
CMD and that's going to be what you're

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:39.930 
CMD and that's going to be what you're
going<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.069> want<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.250> put<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.459> as<00:02:39.579> your<00:02:39.700> primary

going to want to put in as your primary

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.089 
going to want to put in as your primary
this<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.569> my<00:02:40.720> primary<00:02:41.019> because<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.829> my<00:02:41.950> IP

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
this is my primary because this is my IP

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.250 
this is my primary because this is my IP
v4<00:02:42.400> then<00:02:43.120> your<00:02:43.269> secondary<00:02:43.720> is<00:02:43.930> always<00:02:44.170> going

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
v4 then your secondary is always going

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.930 
v4 then your secondary is always going

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
to be a point A to point 8 point 8 i'm

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.180 
to be a point A to point 8 point 8 i'm
pretty<00:02:46.209> sure<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.569> then<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.799> can<00:02:47.890> follow<00:02:48.069> my

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
pretty sure and then you can follow my

going<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.620> work<00:02:51.450> um<00:02:52.530> i<00:02:53.850> think<00:02:54.850> that's<00:02:55.239> pretty

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
going to work um i think that's pretty

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.210 
going to work um i think that's pretty
