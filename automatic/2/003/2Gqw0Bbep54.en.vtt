00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.450
 hello today we are going to leave you a recipe that 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.940
 for many it's going to be too much 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.490
 simple it's about spaghetti with 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.929
 tomato although it is very simple and it is a 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.180
 recipe for people who can not cook 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.340
 absolutely nothing is a recipe very 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.109
 practice to have it as a post base 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.090
 if we add a little bacon you 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.609
 we add some meat we would have 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.859
 another completely different recipe and a 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.880
 very balanced pasta dish so 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.880
 take note of the ingredients 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.330
 The ingredients are 300 grams of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.309
 crushed tomato in no case fried 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.160
 simply crushed we can also 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.860
 take natural tomatoes and grate both 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.290
 bay leaves olive oil and the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.390
 same proportion of brown sugar as of 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.280
 salt in this case would be two teaspoons 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.960
 of brown sugar and two teaspoons of 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.960
 salt and spaghetti 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.170
 step number 1 the water cooking strong 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.550
 the two laurel leaves a little bit 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.310
 salt and add the established 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.960
 from here about 15 minutes of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.510
 all ways in the pasta container 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.050
 cooking times always appear 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.050
 indicated by the manufacturer 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.469
 while the spaghetti is cooked 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.939
 let's fry the tomato for it let's go 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:34.079
 to need the casserole a jet 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:38.130
 abundant virgin olive oil 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.860
 extra about three tablespoons worth the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.939
 crushed tomato that never fried super 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.480
 important so that it is much more good 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.610
 we move it 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.610
 and we are going to add salt and sugar 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.150
 we are going to move it again and now in 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.420
 Tomato is something that jumps so far 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.760
 On the one hand we can dirty the kitchen or 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.480
 even burn us for it always the 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.420
 mid fire 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.100
 and the lid on let's let 10 go through 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.730
 minutes and we will have ready our 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.730
 plate 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.720
 the pasta has already finished and it is done 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.819
 only for tomato to be done well and 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.129
 is much more good we have left it to 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.440
 slow fire and from there we have 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.180
 left covered so that the itch is not 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.840
 of medium here you can see how it goes 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.840
 doing 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.819
 Well, we're not going to wait 5 more minutes 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:40.069
 and we'll have a little bit of 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.069
 garlic and we will have ready the tomato 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.430
 we already have our spaghetti ready 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.320
