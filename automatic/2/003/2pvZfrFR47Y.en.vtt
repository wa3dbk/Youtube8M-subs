that

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.869 
that
Sammy<00:02:54.530> get<00:02:55.069> one<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.930> can<00:02:57.140> play<00:02:57.640> just<00:02:58.640> play

Sammy get one and you can play just play
for<00:02:59.329> two<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.510> guess<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.409> can<00:03:00.590> just

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
for two I guess and you can just

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:09.430 
for two I guess and you can just
like<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:01.459> Sammy<00:03:07.870> something<00:03:08.870> is<00:03:08.959> too<00:03:09.170> small

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
like this Sammy something is too small

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.930 
like this Sammy something is too small
for<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.889> game<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.250> think

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
for this game I think

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.860 
for this game I think
but<00:03:11.599> you<00:03:12.049> see<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:13.040> see<00:03:13.069> I<00:03:13.310> guess<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.569> idea

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
but you see and you see I guess the idea

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.910 
but you see and you see I guess the idea
so<00:03:15.260> what<00:03:15.650> do<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:15.799> think<00:03:17.470> which<00:03:18.470> one<00:03:18.680> game

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920
