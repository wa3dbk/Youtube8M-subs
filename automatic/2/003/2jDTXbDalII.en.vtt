progress and we're going to go over

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.190 
progress and we're going to go over
those<00:01:32.679> as<00:01:32.950> well<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.640> laser<00:01:33.880> can<00:01:34.240> help<00:01:34.539> the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200

fresh come on in for laser it only takes

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.900 
fresh come on in for laser it only takes
five<00:01:43.959> or<00:01:44.020> ten<00:01:44.349> minutes<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.950> do<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.369> laser<00:01:45.580> can

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
five or ten minutes to do the laser can

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.570 
five or ten minutes to do the laser can
not<00:01:46.179> only<00:01:46.390> be<00:01:46.599> used<00:01:46.840> for<00:01:46.990> injury<00:01:47.740> rehab<00:01:48.280> but

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
not only be used for injury rehab but

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.760 
not only be used for injury rehab but
it's<00:01:48.819> also<00:01:49.270> overtime<00:01:49.810> when<00:01:50.319> you<00:01:50.410> use<00:01:50.560> it
