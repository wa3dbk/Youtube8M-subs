00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.410
 the red river plant of the Swiss group 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.880
 glencore started operations this year 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.369
 of its sugar mill in 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.040
 junqueirÃ³polis state of sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.320
 this harvest will produce about 80 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.300
 thousand tons of sugar as a goal of 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.710
 to increase production capacity in 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.590
 next two years 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:35.080
 good this bastard we started production 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:40.480
 of sugar in the first phase are three 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:43.930
 phases 15 thousand bags this year per day 20 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.920
 next year and 30 thousand bags of 2014 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:51.850
 because the plant has now resolved to produce 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:57.540
 the sugar in the plant was acquired in the final 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.540
 of 2010 by the group glencore group 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:06.130
 with this, glencore is a tremendous 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.170
 sugar with and why we investing 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.900
 sugar in the sugar mill that up to then 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:17.590
 phase hydrated alcohol how is the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:20.229
 development of the crop 12 13 talzinha one 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.140
 bit wet where everybody but now 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.969
 It seems that we will be able to do 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.740
 a normal crop from now on 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.310
 started a little wet May had 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.119
 rains in June do not tell us where we are 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.929
 12 days stopped by rain but are the 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.969
 estimates for the crop in numbers as 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:47.079
 around 1 million and 100 thousand tons 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:52.420
 approximately 80 thousand tons of sugarcane . 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.530
 sugar and 50 million liters of alcohol 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.020
 hydrated 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.880
 the rains of the last weeks 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.359
 the first 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.299
 crop estimate the plant not 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.880
 has hampered improved and disrupted the harvest 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:12.130
 but improved agricultural incomes 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.640
 we do not yet have the percentage that 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.070
 can we give we'll measure now in july 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.340
 after a month of rain to feel 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:25.450
 in fact what was the effect on the cameras 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 but surely there was a gain to the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:34.180
 rainy winter it can slow down the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:38.620
 good crop plant can because 12 days 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.670
 and 12 more days that we put 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.110
 at the end of the year 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.090
 but it is in our case it was not because the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.500
 We had a cane with a capacity of 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.050
 milling 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.640
 so we're just going to fit right into 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.540
 harvest, no problem 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:00.190
 this delay will reflect in the harvest 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.370
 2013/2014 noel is a delay but as we 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.230
 we came to finish beginning of november we 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.010
 Let's finish November 6 in the other 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.080
 in love 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.150
 the red river mill is doing 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:17.490
 agricultural or industrial investments 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:23.130
 or both for the crop 13 14 years if we 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:26.770
 besides the growth in sugar in the volumes 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:32.290
 implementing a co- generation for 2013 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:35.380
 the production of anhydrous alcohol in addition to the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.720
 increased sugar capacity in the 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.490
 farmers are planting sugarcane to 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.880
 expand production of the plant 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.040
 s on the co-generation of energy will 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.630
 be marketing and there is already 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.840
 estimation of this cogeneration 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.200
 a freeze for sale on the grid is 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.720
 Our team is next year 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:07.620
 40 mega generator where you should 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.620
 market around 16 6
