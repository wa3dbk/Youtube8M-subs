clip on probiotic yogurt making so I

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.680 
clip on probiotic yogurt making so I
just<00:00:05.430> thought<00:00:05.549> I'd<00:00:05.730> actually<00:00:06.089> go<00:00:06.299> through<00:00:06.480> and

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
done up to now I've had this

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.990 
done up to now I've had this
UHT<00:00:18.869> which<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.710> ultra<00:00:20.039> heat<00:00:20.220> treated<00:00:20.760> milk

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
UHT which is ultra heat treated milk

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.120 
UHT which is ultra heat treated milk
sitting<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.600> jug<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.289> some<00:00:22.470> hot<00:00:22.619> water<00:00:22.830> up

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
sitting in a jug with some hot water up

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.189 
sitting in a jug with some hot water up
to<00:00:23.160> about<00:00:23.310> there<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.449> warm<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.170> bit

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
to about there just to warm it up a bit

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.029 
to about there just to warm it up a bit
and<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:27.150> come<00:00:27.330> up<00:00:27.480> now<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.080> don't<00:00:28.740> know

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
and it's just come up now I don't know

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.229 
and it's just come up now I don't know
take<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:31.250> it's<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.579> started<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.030> fall

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
take this out it's just started to fall

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.100 
take this out it's just started to fall
below<00:00:33.480> 40<00:00:34.110> degrees<00:00:34.500> centigrade<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:36.110> it's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
below 40 degrees centigrade so it's

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.180 
below 40 degrees centigrade so it's
pretty<00:00:37.380> much<00:00:37.500> more<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> right

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
pretty much more at the right

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.600 
pretty much more at the right
temperature<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:39.000> need<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.570> make<00:00:39.719> area<00:00:40.610> right

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
temperature we need to make area right

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.150 
temperature we need to make area right
so<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.899> guys<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.140> been<00:00:43.410> sterilized<00:00:43.980> of

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
so the guys have been sterilized of

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
so the guys have been sterilized of
boiling<00:00:44.370> water<00:00:44.489> very<00:00:45.120> important<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.870> keep

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
boiling water very important to keep

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
boiling water very important to keep
things<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.559> sterile<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:46.920> possible<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:47.730> why

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
things as sterile as possible that's why

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.150 
things as sterile as possible that's why
we<00:00:48.090> use<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> ultra<00:00:48.719> heat<00:00:48.870> treated<00:00:49.320> milk<00:00:49.559> it's

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
we use the ultra heat treated milk it's

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.850 
we use the ultra heat treated milk it's
already<00:00:50.520> been<00:00:50.700> sterilized<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.710> have

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
already been sterilized and all we have

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.380 
already been sterilized and all we have
to<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> bring<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> up<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.789> temperature<00:00:54.090> now

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
to do is bring it up to temperature now

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.750 
to do is bring it up to temperature now
when<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.320> use<00:00:55.350> powdered<00:00:55.920> milk<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.370> actually

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
when we use powdered milk we actually

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.410 
when we use powdered milk we actually
have<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> reverse<00:00:57.390> osmosis<00:00:58.940> water<00:00:59.940> filter

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
have a reverse osmosis water filter

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.180 
have a reverse osmosis water filter
system<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.050> I'm<00:01:01.140> pretty<00:01:01.350> confident<00:01:01.949> there

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
system so I'm pretty confident there

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.740 
system so I'm pretty confident there
there's<00:01:02.460> no<00:01:02.640> bacteria<00:01:03.210> getting<00:01:03.449> through

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
there's no bacteria getting through

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.440 
there's no bacteria getting through
there<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.549> yeah<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:08.450> provide

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
there and yeah so we use that to provide

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.719 
there and yeah so we use that to provide
the<00:01:09.720> water<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> milk<00:01:10.979> powder<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.580> it's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the water for the milk powder so it's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.910 
the water for the milk powder so it's
all<00:01:11.850> nice<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.210> clean<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.530> is<00:01:16.530> put

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
all nice and clean so all you do is put

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.760 
all nice and clean so all you do is put
some<00:01:17.100> milk<00:01:17.280> into<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.580> container<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.770> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
some milk into the container and it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
some milk into the container and it
actually<00:01:19.950> makes<00:01:20.369> up<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.790> liter<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.210> milk<00:01:21.450> this

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
actually makes up one liter of milk this

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450 
actually makes up one liter of milk this
little<00:01:21.930> mark<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> top<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> jar<00:01:23.189> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
little mark up the top of the jar and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.740 
little mark up the top of the jar and
just<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> make<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.900> little<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.229> thicker<00:01:25.549> I

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
just to make it a little bit thicker I

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.810 
just to make it a little bit thicker I
like<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.930> add<00:01:28.110> about<00:01:28.259> half<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:29.189> cup<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.579> milk

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
like to add about half a cup of milk

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.039 
like to add about half a cup of milk
powder<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.850> just<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.450> low<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.720> I'll<00:01:33.930> have

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
powder so just in a bit low so I'll have

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.859 
powder so just in a bit low so I'll have
to<00:01:34.170> double<00:01:34.439> dip<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.180> actually<00:01:36.299> make<00:01:36.720> this

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
to double dip you can actually make this

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.539 
to double dip you can actually make this
with<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> milk<00:01:37.350> paddle<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:38.040> I've<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.250> said

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
with the milk paddle what I've just said

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.999 
with the milk paddle what I've just said
um<00:01:38.869> except<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.990> normally<00:01:40.320> use<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> cup

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
um except you normally use about a cup

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.630 
um except you normally use about a cup
and<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.250> third<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:42.259> milk<00:01:43.259> powder<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:44.460> your

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and a third of milk powder and then your

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.149 
and a third of milk powder and then your
water<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.090> bring<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> level<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.770> that's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
water to bring up to level so that's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.639 
water to bring up to level so that's
just<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.610> nut<00:01:48.030> powder<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.750> gives<00:01:49.560> it

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
just the nut powder in there gives it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.410 
just the nut powder in there gives it
more<00:01:49.799> body<00:01:50.009> gives<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> yoga<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:51.000> body<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
more body gives the yoga more body and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.819 
more body gives the yoga more body and
when<00:01:51.570> you're<00:01:51.659> making<00:01:51.780> cheese<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.470> makes<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
when you're making cheese it makes it a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.090 
when you're making cheese it makes it a
lot<00:01:52.920> thicker<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.680> just<00:01:55.680> top<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.920> up

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
lot thicker I think so just top that up

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.700 
lot thicker I think so just top that up
to<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> litre<00:01:56.640> mark<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.240> some<00:01:57.570> more

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
to a litre mark with some more

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.750 
to a litre mark with some more
with<00:01:59.710> over<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.040> Lena<00:02:00.250> mark<00:02:01.230> and<00:02:02.230> I<00:02:03.040> forgot<00:02:03.580> one

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
with over the Lena mark and I forgot one

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.760 
with over the Lena mark and I forgot one
thing

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
thing

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.850 
thing
measuring<00:02:05.770> spoons<00:02:06.570> Mario<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:07.960> what<00:02:08.470> we<00:02:08.649> have

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
measuring spoons Mario so what we have

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.930 
measuring spoons Mario so what we have
here<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.310> we<00:02:09.670> have<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.880> probiotic<00:02:10.360> culture

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
here is we have a probiotic culture

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.090 
here is we have a probiotic culture
coming<00:02:13.170> specimen<00:02:14.170> jars<00:02:14.440> we<00:02:14.650> actually<00:02:14.920> keep

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
coming specimen jars we actually keep

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.470 
coming specimen jars we actually keep
them<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> freezer<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.060> that's<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.990> powder

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
them in the freezer and that's a powder

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.360 
them in the freezer and that's a powder
when<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.630> first<00:02:20.380> bought<00:02:20.710> them<00:02:20.950> from<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
when we first bought them from the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.900 
when we first bought them from the
gentleman<00:02:22.650> he<00:02:23.650> told<00:02:23.920> us<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.100> use<00:02:24.400> probably

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
gentleman he told us to use probably

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.450 
gentleman he told us to use probably
about<00:02:27.480> probably<00:02:28.480> about<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:29.140> much<00:02:29.460> power

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
about probably about that much power

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.640 
about probably about that much power
probiotic<00:02:31.450> powder<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.930> enough<00:02:32.200> for<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> liter

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
probiotic powder is enough for a liter

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.630 
probiotic powder is enough for a liter
of<00:02:32.800> yogurt<00:02:33.510> we're<00:02:34.510> overdoing<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.170> bit<00:02:35.640> and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
of yogurt we're overdoing it a bit and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.040 
of yogurt we're overdoing it a bit and
we're<00:02:36.850> actually<00:02:37.000> adding<00:02:39.090> only<00:02:40.090> about<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.570> whole

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
we're actually adding only about a whole

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.490 
we're actually adding only about a whole
measurement<00:02:42.040> there<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.209> probably<00:02:43.990> about<00:02:44.110> 2<00:02:44.350> to

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
measurement there so probably about 2 to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.730 
measurement there so probably about 2 to
3<00:02:44.680> times<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.070> recommended<00:02:45.280> amount<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.500> that's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
3 times the recommended amount so that's

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.449 
3 times the recommended amount so that's
the<00:02:47.890> probiotic<00:02:48.550> bacteria<00:02:48.700> or<00:02:49.360> or<00:02:49.450> culture<00:02:50.459> for

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
the probiotic bacteria or or culture for

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.870 
the probiotic bacteria or or culture for
all<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.700> good<00:02:51.880> gut<00:02:52.810> flora<00:02:53.370> help<00:02:54.370> them<00:02:54.580> grow

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
all the good gut flora help them grow

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.480 
all the good gut flora help them grow
and<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.180> strong<00:02:55.240> and<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:56.680> one<00:02:56.890> in<00:02:57.010> here<00:02:57.310> is

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
and be strong and this one in here is

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.190 
and be strong and this one in here is
slightly<00:02:57.850> different<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.660> one<00:02:58.870> here<00:02:59.050> is<00:02:59.170> a

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
slightly different this one here is a

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.260 
slightly different this one here is a
more<00:02:59.440> crystalline<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.610> this<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.060> actual

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
more crystalline and this is the actual

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.630 
more crystalline and this is the actual
yoga<00:03:01.600> culture<00:03:02.200> itself<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.739> yoga<00:03:03.040> bacterium

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
yoga culture itself the yoga bacterium

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.470 
yoga culture itself the yoga bacterium
so<00:03:04.510> for<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.620> one<00:03:05.860> here<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:07.239> need<00:03:07.450> a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
so for this one here you need a

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.410 
so for this one here you need a
ridiculously<00:03:08.320> small<00:03:08.440> amount<00:03:09.130> what<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.060> know<00:03:10.180> if

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
ridiculously small amount what I know if

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.470 
ridiculously small amount what I know if
you<00:03:10.510> can<00:03:10.660> even<00:03:10.780> make<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.140> out<00:03:11.500> there<00:03:11.769> on<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
you can even make that out there on the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.080 
you can even make that out there on the
back<00:03:13.660> on<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.110> spoon<00:03:14.410> there<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:15.700> it's

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
back on that spoon there but it's it's

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.259 
back on that spoon there but it's it's
virtually<00:03:16.690> like<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.230> lot<00:03:17.950> less<00:03:18.550> than<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:19.060> tip

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
virtually like a lot less than the tip

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.150 
virtually like a lot less than the tip
of<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.480> lead<00:03:19.660> pencil<00:03:19.900> worth<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.500> bacteria<00:03:20.980> so

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
of a lead pencil worth of bacteria so

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.660 
of a lead pencil worth of bacteria so
that<00:03:22.030> goes<00:03:22.239> in<00:03:22.269> as<00:03:22.570> well<00:03:23.220> now<00:03:24.220> all<00:03:24.250> we<00:03:24.489> have<00:03:24.640> to

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
that goes in as well now all we have to

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.130 
that goes in as well now all we have to
do<00:03:24.910> is<00:03:25.030> put<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.330> lid<00:03:25.480> on<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.780> give<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:26.019> good

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
do is put the lid on and give it a good

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.750 
do is put the lid on and give it a good
shake<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.769> get<00:03:27.070> everything<00:03:27.340> blended

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
shake and get everything blended

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:44.839 
shake and get everything blended
together

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.990 

this<00:03:45.849> here<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.420> furnace<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:48.819> what

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
this here is the furnace this is what

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.320 
this here is the furnace this is what
the<00:03:49.209> job<00:03:50.170> actually<00:03:50.620> sits<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.180> has<00:03:52.300> a

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
the job actually sits in and it has a

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.180 
the job actually sits in and it has a
little<00:03:52.510> baffle<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.110> is<00:03:53.290> about<00:03:53.500> halfway<00:03:53.739> down

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
little baffle this is about halfway down

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.699 
little baffle this is about halfway down
and<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.239> air<00:03:55.390> you<00:03:55.510> can<00:03:55.690> tanis's<00:03:56.140> on<00:03:56.349> top<00:03:56.530> of

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
and the air you can tanis's on top of

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.100 
and the air you can tanis's on top of
normally<00:03:57.459> when<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:57.819> buy<00:03:58.120> make<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.630> branded

can't<00:04:02.380> see<00:04:02.470> there<00:04:02.769> you<00:04:03.640> actually<00:04:04.000> fill<00:04:04.239> it<00:04:04.360> all

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
can't see there you actually fill it all

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.449 
can't see there you actually fill it all
the<00:04:04.510> way<00:04:04.720> up<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.170> top<00:04:05.380> but<00:04:05.920> would<00:04:06.069> this<00:04:06.220> one

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
the way up to the top but would this one

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.729 
the way up to the top but would this one
because<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.940> comp<00:04:07.209> is<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:07.569> sensitive<00:04:07.989> you

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
because the comp is so sensitive you

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.500 
because the comp is so sensitive you
actually<00:04:09.099> bring<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.400> ball<00:04:09.610> in<00:04:09.790> water<00:04:10.030> just<00:04:10.269> up

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
actually bring the ball in water just up

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.130 
actually bring the ball in water just up
to<00:04:10.810> underneath<00:04:11.290> this<00:04:11.560> level<00:04:11.920> here<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:13.140> that's

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
to underneath this level here and that's

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.039 
to underneath this level here and that's
all<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:14.500> need<00:04:15.419> so<00:04:16.419> I'll<00:04:16.540> just<00:04:16.690> grab<00:04:16.840> the
