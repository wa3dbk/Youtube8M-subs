00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.960 
I get the beautiful over the top through
pass<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.769> try<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.950> smash<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.579> into<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.819> back

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
pass and I try to smash it into the back

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.030 
pass and I try to smash it into the back
corner<00:02:51.239> but<00:02:51.900> my<00:02:52.019> finishing<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.650> definitely

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
corner but my finishing is definitely

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.190 
corner but my finishing is definitely
below<00:02:53.220> average<00:02:53.609> I'm<00:02:54.090> not<00:02:54.239> finishing<00:02:54.599> well<00:02:54.930> and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
below average I'm not finishing well and

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.809 
below average I'm not finishing well and
it's<00:02:55.470> crazy<00:02:55.680> because<00:02:55.890> I've<00:02:56.250> never<00:02:56.459> played

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
it's crazy because I've never played

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.399 
it's crazy because I've never played
with<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> team<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:57.540> sends<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.019> many<00:02:58.049> over<00:02:58.319> the

with a team that sends so many over the
top<00:02:58.530> through<00:02:58.739> passes<00:02:59.099> but<00:02:59.190> Malaga<00:02:59.549> here<00:02:59.700> with

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
top through passes but Malaga here with

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.369 
top through passes but Malaga here with
a<00:02:59.819> great<00:03:00.090> chance<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.599> take<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.930> lead<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.290> they

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
a great chance to take the lead and they

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.830 
a great chance to take the lead and they
do<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.920> 15th<00:03:02.430> minute<00:03:02.940> keep<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.480> probably

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
do in the 15th minute keep it probably

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.449 
do in the 15th minute keep it probably
shouldn't<00:03:04.109> have<00:03:04.230> been<00:03:04.379> in<00:03:04.470> no-man's<00:03:04.890> land<00:03:05.099> but

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
shouldn't have been in no-man's land but

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.180 
shouldn't have been in no-man's land but
he<00:03:05.549> came<00:03:05.730> out<00:03:05.940> try<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.569> get<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.409> Dennis<00:03:08.099> I

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
he came out try to get the the Dennis I

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.589 
he came out try to get the the Dennis I

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
think that was Dennis who missed Network

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.270 
think that was Dennis who missed Network
scored<00:03:10.079> that<00:03:10.200> goal<00:03:10.260> then<00:03:10.530> again<00:03:10.709> Dennis<00:03:11.069> one

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
scored that goal then again Dennis one

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.250 
scored that goal then again Dennis one
