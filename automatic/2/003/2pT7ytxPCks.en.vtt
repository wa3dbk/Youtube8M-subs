profile<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.520> board<00:00:29.850> has<00:00:30.029> Burton's<00:00:30.570> flat<00:00:31.080> top

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
profile this board has Burton's flat top

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.200 
profile this board has Burton's flat top
so<00:00:31.800> that's<00:00:31.949> where<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.279> flat<00:00:32.579> from<00:00:33.149> the

outside of the binding to the outside of
the<00:00:34.680> binding<00:00:34.980> super<00:00:35.489> fun<00:00:35.640> super<00:00:35.910> easy<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the binding super fun super easy a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.030 
the binding super fun super easy a
little<00:00:36.660> bit<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.930> pop<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.320> then<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
little bit of pop for you then it

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.990 
little bit of pop for you then it
rockers<00:00:38.520> up<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.450> tip<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.989> tail<00:00:41.000> this

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
rockers up to that tip and tail this

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.959 
rockers up to that tip and tail this
board<00:00:42.239> has<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.570> core<00:00:42.870> profile<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.350> called<00:00:43.559> off

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
board has a core profile it's called off

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.670 
board has a core profile it's called off
axis<00:00:44.969> squeezebox<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:46.440> actually

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
axis squeezebox and that's actually

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
axis squeezebox and that's actually
where<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.370> thicker<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> outside<00:00:48.540> of<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
where it's thicker on the outside of the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.420 
where it's thicker on the outside of the
bindings<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.559> thinner<00:00:49.890> underneath

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
bindings and then thinner underneath

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.270 
bindings and then thinner underneath
your<00:00:50.610> foot<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.270> between<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:52.260> feet<00:00:52.620> so

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
your foot and then between your feet so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920 
your foot and then between your feet so
this<00:00:53.430> allows<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.969> flex<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.510> board<00:00:54.719> where

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
this allows you to flex the board where

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.029 
this allows you to flex the board where
you<00:00:54.989> need<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.320> then<00:00:55.469> transfer<00:00:56.010> that

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
you need it and then transfer that

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.979 
you need it and then transfer that
energy<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.610> thicker<00:00:56.879> area<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.390> then<00:00:57.719> pop

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
energy to the thicker area and then pop

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380 
energy to the thicker area and then pop
off<00:00:58.200> your<00:00:58.500> tail<00:00:58.710> or<00:00:59.100> your<00:00:59.430> nose<00:00:59.610> but<00:01:00.090> they<00:01:00.210> call

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
off your tail or your nose but they call

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.479 
off your tail or your nose but they call
it<00:01:00.480> off<00:01:00.629> axis<00:01:01.110> because<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.250> think<00:01:02.399> about

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
it off axis because if you think about

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.549 
it off axis because if you think about
it<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> set<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.750> board<00:01:04.019> my<00:01:04.259> feet

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
it if I was to set up this board my feet

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.069 
it if I was to set up this board my feet
aren't<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.009> be<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.309> 0<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.729> 0<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.389> usually

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
aren't going to be at 0 and 0 I usually

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.019 
aren't going to be at 0 and 0 I usually
write<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> little<00:01:07.979> duck<00:01:08.219> foot<00:01:08.399> you<00:01:08.579> angle<00:01:08.939> your

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:09.029 
write a little duck foot you angle your

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:11.510 
write a little duck foot you angle your
feet<00:01:09.209> out<00:01:09.389> to<00:01:09.990> mimic<00:01:10.499> a<00:01:10.619> more<00:01:10.950> natural<00:01:11.340> stance

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
feet out to mimic a more natural stance

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.929 
feet out to mimic a more natural stance
so<00:01:12.179> off<00:01:12.529> axis<00:01:13.529> squeezebox<00:01:14.249> does<00:01:14.639> the<00:01:14.759> same

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
so off axis squeezebox does the same

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.940 
so off axis squeezebox does the same
exact<00:01:15.240> thing<00:01:15.509> instead<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.109> having<00:01:16.380> your

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
exact thing instead of having your

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.410 
exact thing instead of having your
thicker<00:01:17.249> and<00:01:17.429> thinner<00:01:17.579> parts<00:01:17.819> just<00:01:18.149> going

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
thicker and thinner parts just going

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.999 
thicker and thinner parts just going
straight<00:01:18.569> across<00:01:18.719> the<00:01:19.020> board<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.709> turn<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
straight across the board they turn it

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.160 
straight across the board they turn it
off<00:01:20.159> access<00:01:20.639> again<00:01:21.179> to<00:01:21.509> mimic<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.869> way<00:01:22.109> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
off access again to mimic the way you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
off access again to mimic the way you
stand<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.709> a<00:01:22.740> snowboard<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:24.029> can<00:01:24.149> see<00:01:24.299> this
