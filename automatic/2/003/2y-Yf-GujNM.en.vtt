 populated of the region here is wanted 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.289
 build the new florence report with

 most planes will land 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.630
 following this route they will line up 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.190
 at the slope more or less above a liana 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.230

 a height of little points minutes meters from 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.190

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.809
 km in the area of ​​lawn and fields is 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.820
 a landing is expected every quarter
