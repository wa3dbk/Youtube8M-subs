00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
probably a 5 out of 10 but purely

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.530

something<00:03:48.080> like<00:03:48.230> this<00:03:48.350> when<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.590> was<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.739> kid<00:03:48.950> and

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
something like this when I was a kid and

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.650 
something like this when I was a kid and
it<00:03:49.220> opens<00:03:49.519> up<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.820> had<00:03:49.970> change<00:03:50.269> in<00:03:50.480> there

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
it opens up and you had change in there

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.910 
it opens up and you had change in there
but<00:03:51.470> that's<00:03:52.220> just<00:03:52.430> me<00:03:52.700> build<00:03:53.690> quality<00:03:54.049> as<00:03:54.560> all

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
but that's just me build quality as all

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.560 
but that's just me build quality as all
the<00:03:55.040> hazard<00:03:55.340> for<00:03:55.549> I'd<00:03:55.820> give<00:03:56.060> it<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.239> 10<00:03:56.420> out<00:03:56.450> of

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
the hazard for I'd give it a 10 out of

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.070 
the hazard for I'd give it a 10 out of
10

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080

sort<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.170> Nick's<00:04:03.650> burs<00:04:03.980> where<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.120> sometimes

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
sort of Nick's burs where it sometimes

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.020 
sort of Nick's burs where it sometimes
whether<00:04:06.290> it's<00:04:06.860> stitched<00:04:07.130> together<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.700> kinda

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
whether it's stitched together it kinda

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.330 
whether it's stitched together it kinda
comes<00:04:08.269> away<00:04:08.600> it's<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:09.890> really<00:04:10.160> well-made

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
comes away it's it's really well-made
