well these are two different types of

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.190 
well these are two different types of
nesting<00:00:13.350> systems<00:00:14.360> that<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.540> put<00:00:15.809> out<00:00:15.959> by<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
nesting systems that is put out by a

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.890 
nesting systems that is put out by a
company<00:00:16.289> called<00:00:17.450> fowl<00:00:18.450> stuff<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:20.630> they<00:00:21.630> work

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
company called fowl stuff and they work

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
company called fowl stuff and they work
really<00:00:22.200> well<00:00:22.500> you've<00:00:23.190> got<00:00:23.430> two<00:00:23.730> different

kinds here we'll talk about we'll talk

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.680 
kinds here we'll talk about we'll talk
about<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.650> first<00:00:29.150> but<00:00:30.150> basically

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
about this one here first but basically

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.799 
about this one here first but basically
it's<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.080> bucket<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> container<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.210> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it's a bucket that has a container and a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.150 
it's a bucket that has a container and a
perch<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.940> put<00:00:36.739> shavings<00:00:37.739> in

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
perch on it and you can put shavings in

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.390 
perch on it and you can put shavings in
the<00:00:38.550> bottom<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.470> this<00:00:40.470> is<00:00:40.530> designed<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.310> be

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
the bottom and this is designed to be

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.400 
the bottom and this is designed to be
inside<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.360> chicken<00:00:42.810> coop<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.290> your

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
inside of your chicken coop or your

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.040 
inside of your chicken coop or your
chicken<00:00:43.650> house<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.970> this<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> display

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
chicken house now this is a display

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.170 
chicken house now this is a display
model<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.920> low<00:00:47.220> right<00:00:47.640> now<00:00:47.670> but

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
model so it's low right now but

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
model so it's low right now but
typically<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.870> want<00:00:49.020> them<00:00:49.170> about<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.590> high

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
typically you want them about this high

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.639 
typically you want them about this high
somewhere<00:00:50.430> about<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.000> high<00:00:51.239> off<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.500> ground

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
somewhere about this high off the ground

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.840 
somewhere about this high off the ground
and<00:00:53.180> it<00:00:54.180> screws<00:00:54.720> on<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.800> back<00:00:56.700> of<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.630> wall

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
and it screws on to the back of a wall

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.400 
and it screws on to the back of a wall
so<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> want<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> find<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.480> good<00:01:00.660> solid<00:01:01.020> wall

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
so you want to find a good solid wall

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.569 
so you want to find a good solid wall
that's<00:01:01.770> about<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.250> high<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.259> a

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
that's about this high and we have a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:15.270 
that's about this high and we have a
there's<00:01:05.579> a<00:01:05.670> template

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.340 

you<00:01:16.280> put<00:01:16.670> this<00:01:16.880> on<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.240> backside<00:01:17.900> of<00:01:17.930> your

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
you put this on the backside of your

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.590 
you put this on the backside of your
bucket<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.070> you'd<00:01:19.189> have<00:01:19.220> your<00:01:19.490> bucket<00:01:19.970> on<00:01:20.479> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
bucket so you'd have your bucket on the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.649 
bucket so you'd have your bucket on the
backside<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.189> it'll<00:01:23.060> show<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.299> where

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
backside of it and it'll show you where

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.600 
backside of it and it'll show you where
to<00:01:23.990> drill<00:01:25.000> five<00:01:26.000> holes<00:01:27.340> pre-drill<00:01:28.340> some<00:01:28.369> holes

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
to drill five holes pre-drill some holes

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.570 
to drill five holes pre-drill some holes
so<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:29.240> can<00:01:29.450> come<00:01:29.720> in<00:01:29.750> here<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.500> drill<00:01:31.369> it

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
so you can come in here and drill it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.450 
so you can come in here and drill it
right<00:01:31.880> into<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.600> back<00:01:32.840> of<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.619> wall<00:01:33.860> somewhere

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
right into the back of a wall somewhere

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.020 
right into the back of a wall somewhere
and<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:36.350> don't<00:01:36.560> know<00:01:37.009> if<00:01:37.159> you<00:01:37.280> can<00:01:37.490> see<00:01:37.820> it<00:01:37.940> or

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
and I don't know if you can see it or

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.510 
and I don't know if you can see it or
not<00:01:38.210> but<00:01:38.659> on<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:40.220> top<00:01:40.789> of<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.090> bucket<00:01:42.520> there

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
not but on the top of the bucket there

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.340 
not but on the top of the bucket there
are<00:01:43.670> some<00:01:43.880> lines<00:01:44.119> here<00:01:44.360> this<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.049> top<00:01:45.320> of

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
are some lines here this is the top of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.410 
are some lines here this is the top of
the<00:01:45.590> bucket<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:48.140> you'd<00:01:48.319> want<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.619> drill<00:01:49.100> those

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
the bucket so you'd want to drill those

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.510 
the bucket so you'd want to drill those
four<00:01:50.420> holes<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:51.289> there<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.069> then<00:01:52.159> there's<00:01:52.310> one

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
four holes in there and then there's one

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.300 
four holes in there and then there's one
at<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.729> bottom<00:01:52.990> mainly<00:01:53.990> those<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.979> screws

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
at the bottom mainly those the screws

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.070 
at the bottom mainly those the screws
are<00:01:55.520> at<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.759> top<00:01:56.000> because<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.509> start<00:01:56.780> getting

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
are at the top because you start getting

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.260 
are at the top because you start getting
pressure<00:01:57.440> on<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.950> that's<00:01:58.520> where<00:01:58.819> you<00:01:58.940> want<00:01:59.149> all

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
pressure on it that's where you want all

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.350 
pressure on it that's where you want all
the<00:01:59.390> support<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:01.340> screws<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.270> the

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
the support so the the screws and the

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.969 
the support so the the screws and the
washers<00:02:03.050> come<00:02:03.890> with<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.340> unit<00:02:05.799> so<00:02:06.799> you'll

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
washers come with the unit so you'll

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.180 
washers come with the unit so you'll
have<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.190> packet<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.729> washers<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:08.989> some<00:02:09.830> screws

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
have a packet of washers and some screws

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.509 
have a packet of washers and some screws
and<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.989> have<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.170> zip<00:02:12.470> tie<00:02:12.739> here<00:02:13.100> we'll<00:02:13.310> talk

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
and you have a zip tie here we'll talk

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.050 
and you have a zip tie here we'll talk
about<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.480> minute<00:02:19.060> but

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
about that in just a minute but

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.330 
about that in just a minute but
basically<00:02:20.350> when<00:02:21.350> you're<00:02:21.470> ready<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.920> put<00:02:22.100> the

and the lid on the front of your bucket

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.319 
and the lid on the front of your bucket
and<00:02:35.200> before<00:02:36.200> we<00:02:36.320> do<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.560> actually<00:02:37.370> this<00:02:38.120> is

and before we do that actually this is
the<00:02:38.450> front<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.079> it<00:02:39.859> clips<00:02:40.130> right<00:02:40.459> on<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.820> the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the front and it clips right on to the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.770 
the front and it clips right on to the
bucket<00:02:41.769> if<00:02:42.769> you<00:02:43.549> have<00:02:43.670> smaller<00:02:44.120> hands<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.720> is

may want to go ahead and cut this

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.690 
may want to go ahead and cut this
portion<00:02:57.470> out<00:02:57.650> this<00:02:58.040> will<00:02:58.220> give<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.519> little

now what you will want to do there's a

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.730 
now what you will want to do there's a
zip<00:03:27.260> tie

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
zip tie

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.480 
zip tie
here<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:31.310> will<00:03:31.460> want<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:33.340> drill<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.370> hole

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
here and you will want to drill a hole

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.470 
here and you will want to drill a hole
right<00:03:35.390> in<00:03:35.570> here<00:03:36.020> and<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:37.040> here<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.640> put<00:03:38.330> that

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
right in here and in here and put that

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.980 
right in here and in here and put that
zip<00:03:38.870> tie<00:03:39.140> through<00:03:39.520> the<00:03:40.520> reason<00:03:41.000> for<00:03:41.270> that<00:03:41.510> even

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
zip tie through the reason for that even

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.350 
zip tie through the reason for that even
though<00:03:42.140> this<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.530> strong<00:03:42.920> enough<00:03:43.280> but<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.330> can

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
though this is strong enough but it can

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.470 
though this is strong enough but it can
start<00:03:44.960> to<00:03:45.110> tilt<00:03:45.560> like<00:03:45.800> this<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:47.450> basically

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
start to tilt like this so basically

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.810 
start to tilt like this so basically
that<00:03:48.140> zip<00:03:48.530> tie<00:03:48.740> just<00:03:48.800> keeps<00:03:49.310> this<00:03:49.550> from

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
that zip tie just keeps this from

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.650 
that zip tie just keeps this from
tilting<00:03:50.300> on<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.700> this<00:03:52.910> one<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.270> used<00:03:53.510> for

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
tilting on you so this one is used for

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.720 
tilting on you so this one is used for
inside<00:03:54.320> of<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.530> chicken<00:03:54.710> house<00:03:55.070> or<00:03:55.370> chicken

actually this part comes out it's got a

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.380 
actually this part comes out it's got a
little<00:04:39.980> string<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.580> can<00:04:40.610> dangle<00:04:40.940> it<00:04:43.180> you<00:04:44.180> can

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
getting out now it will probably work

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.200 
getting out now it will probably work
okay<00:04:59.540> without<00:04:59.720> this<00:05:00.170> but<00:05:00.530> if<00:05:01.220> they<00:05:01.550> bump<00:05:01.880> it<00:05:02.090> or

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
okay without this but if they bump it or

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.540 
okay without this but if they bump it or
hit<00:05:02.420> it<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.660> lot<00:05:02.870> or<00:05:03.140> try<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.410> push<00:05:03.980> on<00:05:04.190> it<00:05:04.310> a<00:05:04.370> lot

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
hit it a lot or try to push on it a lot

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.820 
hit it a lot or try to push on it a lot
it's<00:05:05.150> nice<00:05:05.450> to<00:05:05.690> have<00:05:05.840> this<00:05:05.990> bungee<00:05:06.350> but<00:05:06.680> this

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
it's nice to have this bungee but this

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.420 
it's nice to have this bungee but this
has<00:05:07.040> a<00:05:07.070> nice<00:05:07.370> little<00:05:07.640> suction<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:09.050> it<00:05:09.200> so<00:05:09.710> this

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
has a nice little suction to it so this

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.580 
has a nice little suction to it so this
is<00:05:10.640> really<00:05:11.060> nice<00:05:11.270> so<00:05:11.720> you're<00:05:11.960> not<00:05:12.080> having<00:05:12.410> to

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
is really nice so you're not having to
