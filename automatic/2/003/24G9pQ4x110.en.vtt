00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.480 

so<00:00:00.810> I've<00:00:01.439> actually<00:00:01.650> already<00:00:02.010> done<00:00:02.250> mine

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
so I've actually already done mine

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.100 
so I've actually already done mine
because<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.419> was<00:00:03.540> getting<00:00:03.600> annoyed<00:00:03.870> with<00:00:03.899> the

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
because I was getting annoyed with the

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.670 
because I was getting annoyed with the
Boost<00:00:04.319> issues<00:00:05.299> but<00:00:06.299> basically<00:00:06.720> what<00:00:07.560> you're

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
Boost issues but basically what you're

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.080 
Boost issues but basically what you're
doing<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.919> you're<00:00:08.069> replacing<00:00:08.519> these<00:00:08.760> why<00:00:09.030> is

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
doing is you're replacing these why is

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.169 
doing is you're replacing these why is
it<00:00:10.219> well<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.280> can<00:00:11.400> after<00:00:11.490> replacing<00:00:11.730> because

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
it well you can after replacing because

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.740 
it well you can after replacing because
you<00:00:12.240> need<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.480> boost<00:00:12.660> control<00:00:12.960> valve<00:00:13.309> so

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
you need to boost control valve so

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.060 
you need to boost control valve so
replacing<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.839> with<00:00:15.960> some<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.470> silicon

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
replacing it with some of this silicon

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.950 
replacing it with some of this silicon
tube<00:00:17.340> if<00:00:17.910> you've<00:00:18.150> got<00:00:18.270> some<00:00:18.420> GM<00:00:18.660> stuff<00:00:18.840> you

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
tube if you've got some GM stuff you

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.540 
tube if you've got some GM stuff you
chopped<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.289> which<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.560> pretty<00:00:19.740> good<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.130> this

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
chopped up which is pretty good and this

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.790 
chopped up which is pretty good and this
is<00:00:20.670> about<00:00:20.789> three<00:00:20.850> pound<00:00:21.270> Eva<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.410> waiting

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
is about three pound Eva so waiting

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.070 
is about three pound Eva so waiting
start<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.670> not<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.090> turbo<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:24.930> if

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
start with it's not the turbo here if

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.250 
start with it's not the turbo here if
you<00:00:25.170> can<00:00:25.320> see<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:26.029> I<00:00:27.029> need<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.840> unplug<00:00:28.050> it

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
you can see that I need to unplug it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.990 
you can see that I need to unplug it
from<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:29.369> might<00:00:29.519> want<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.849> what<00:00:29.970> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
from there you might want to do what I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.560 
from there you might want to do what I
did<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.539> pick<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> airbox<00:00:31.320> assembly<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:32.570> so

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
did and pick the airbox assembly out so

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.700 
did and pick the airbox assembly out so
I<00:00:33.600> think<00:00:33.719> if<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.020> just<00:00:34.140> take<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> air<00:00:34.530> flow

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
I think if you just take the air flow

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.310 
I think if you just take the air flow
meter<00:00:34.890> off<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.210> airbox<00:00:36.210> out<00:00:36.540> should<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.230> I'll

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
meter off the airbox out should be I'll

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.190 
meter off the airbox out should be I'll
make<00:00:37.469> some<00:00:37.649> room<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:39.000> mean<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.079> want

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
make some room and I mean what you want

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.299 
make some room and I mean what you want
to<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.590> want<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.739> come<00:00:40.890> around<00:00:40.950> you've

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to do is you want to come around you've

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.830 
to do is you want to come around you've
got<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.550> bit<00:00:41.730> unplugged<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.629> want<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
got that bit unplugged if you want to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.970 
got that bit unplugged if you want to
come<00:00:42.930> around<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.559> then<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.829> need

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
come around it and then you need

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.940 
come around it and then you need
something<00:00:44.190> pocket<00:00:44.579> from<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.870> fuel<00:00:46.739> pressure

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
something pocket from the fuel pressure

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.840 
something pocket from the fuel pressure
regulator<00:00:47.870> which<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
regulator which is just there so you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.830 
regulator which is just there so you
want<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.059> put<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.300> from<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.449> fuel<00:00:51.660> pressure

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
want to put it from the fuel pressure

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.020 
want to put it from the fuel pressure
regulator<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.129> somewhere<00:00:53.610> around<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
regulator and then somewhere around this

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.750 
regulator and then somewhere around this
part<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:54.930> there'll<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.800> tee<00:00:56.010> piece<00:00:56.250> going

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
part here there'll be a tee piece going

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.510 
part here there'll be a tee piece going
off<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> rear<00:00:57.480> boost<00:00:57.719> control<00:00:58.109> valve<00:00:58.520> so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
off to the rear boost control valve so

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.670 
off to the rear boost control valve so
you<00:00:59.579> need<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.850> find<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.230> follow<00:01:01.530> your

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you need to find that so follow your

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.369 
you need to find that so follow your
hand<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.399> pipe<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.940> way<00:01:03.120> down<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
hand on the pipe all the way down and it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.219 
hand on the pipe all the way down and it
will<00:01:04.470> come<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.979> two<00:01:05.510> pipes<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.840> into<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
will come to two pipes going into the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.950 
will come to two pipes going into the
vac<00:01:07.409> box<00:01:07.680> which<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.820> booze<00:01:09.360> control<00:01:09.720> valve

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
vac box which there booze control valve

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.800 
vac box which there booze control valve
is<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> pull<00:01:12.299> them<00:01:12.479> two

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
is on and so you want to pull them two

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.200 
is on and so you want to pull them two
pipes<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.619> leave<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.520> thick<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.090> because

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
pipes out leave the thick one in because

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.240 
pipes out leave the thick one in because
that's<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> loom<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.920> put<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that's the loom if you do if you put the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
that's the loom if you do if you put the
loom<00:01:17.460> it'll<00:01:17.909> throw<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.180> year

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
loom it'll throw a year

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
loom it'll throw a year
it's<00:01:19.020> very<00:01:19.229> caring<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.830> limp<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.970> don't

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it's very caring to limp one you don't

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240 
it's very caring to limp one you don't
want<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.170> take<00:01:22.439> them<00:01:22.590> two<00:01:22.740> pipes<00:01:22.979> out

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
want that so you take them two pipes out

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.060 
want that so you take them two pipes out
and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> take<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.659> out<00:01:24.780> from<00:01:25.590> throttle

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and then you take it out from throttle

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.830 
and then you take it out from throttle
body<00:01:26.250> as<00:01:26.400> well<00:01:26.580> input<00:01:26.790> which<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.659> here

put darling we'll just pull the entire

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.789 
put darling we'll just pull the entire
wire<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.229> should<00:01:34.409> look<00:01:34.560> something

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
wire out and it should look something

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
wire out and it should look something
like<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.220> obviously<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.540> broken<00:01:36.780> up

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
like this obviously not broken up

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.870 
like this obviously not broken up
because<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.439> was<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.829> impatient<00:01:38.490> taking<00:01:38.759> mine

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
because I was the impatient taking mine

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.300 
because I was the impatient taking mine
up<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.320> need<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.590> take<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> couple<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.159> T

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
up and they need to take a couple of T

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
up and they need to take a couple of T
pieces<00:01:41.579> off<00:01:41.850> these<00:01:42.030> two<00:01:42.060> pieces<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.570> unless

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
pieces off these two pieces here unless

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
pieces off these two pieces here unless
you've<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.350> any<00:01:43.500> new<00:01:43.649> ones<00:01:43.799> spare<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.149> you'll

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you've got any new ones spare and you'll

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.880 
you've got any new ones spare and you'll
probably<00:01:45.659> only<00:01:45.930> need<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:46.770> you've<00:01:46.860> got

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
probably only need one but if you've got

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.429 
probably only need one but if you've got
a<00:01:47.009> boost<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.790> boost<00:01:48.450> gauge<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.869> read<00:01:49.049> involving

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
a boost a boost gauge I read involving

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.679 
a boost a boost gauge I read involving
like<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.009> even<00:01:50.159> need<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> couple<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.570> once

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
like that and even need a couple so once

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.330 
like that and even need a couple so once
you're<00:01:51.780> taking<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.079> up<00:01:52.229> start<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.280> you

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you're taking them up start with you

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.600 
you're taking them up start with you
silicon<00:01:54.200> tubing<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.890> need<00:01:56.040> between<00:01:56.310> two<00:01:56.460> and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
silicon tubing you need between two and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.399 
silicon tubing you need between two and
three<00:01:56.670> meets<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.689> then<00:01:58.110> basically

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
three meets of it and then basically

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.660 
three meets of it and then basically
just<00:01:58.649> start<00:01:58.890> feeding<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.490> you're<00:01:59.579> going

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
just start feeding in but you're going

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.490 
just start feeding in but you're going
to<00:01:59.759> miss<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.299> rear<00:02:00.719> booth<00:02:00.899> control<00:02:01.259> valve

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
to miss out the rear booth control valve

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.490 
to miss out the rear booth control valve
and<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.979> back<00:02:02.130> box<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.390> started<00:02:03.960> here<00:02:04.409> at

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
and the back box so I started here at

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.270 
and the back box so I started here at
the<00:02:04.560> table<00:02:04.920> again<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.060> slide<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.689> and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
the table again so just slide it on and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.430 
the table again so just slide it on and
then<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.310> want<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.520> go<00:02:08.670> all<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:08.970> way<00:02:09.239> around

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
then you want to go all the way around

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.190 
then you want to go all the way around
to<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.070> next<00:02:11.190> bit<00:02:11.490> which<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.450> fuel

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
to the next bit which is the fuel

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440 
to the next bit which is the fuel
pressure<00:02:13.380> regulator<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:15.000> then<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.270> want<00:02:15.420> to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
pressure regulator so then you want to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.140 
pressure regulator so then you want to
chop<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> hole<00:02:15.990> here<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.500> put<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.890> piece<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.160> and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
chop a hole here and put a piece in and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.430 
chop a hole here and put a piece in and
then<00:02:18.270> have<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.480> bit<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.720> pipe<00:02:18.870> just<00:02:19.140> going<00:02:19.320> to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
then have a bit of pipe just going to

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.650 
then have a bit of pipe just going to
feel<00:02:19.680> pressure<00:02:19.860> regulator<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:21.210> can<00:02:21.330> see<00:02:21.480> that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
feel pressure regulator you can see that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.560 
feel pressure regulator you can see that
and<00:02:22.100> then<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.250> rest<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.520> your<00:02:23.640> tubing<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.360> chop

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
and then the rest of your tubing to chop

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.660 
and then the rest of your tubing to chop
it<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.720> size<00:02:25.040> go<00:02:26.040> straight<00:02:26.400> into<00:02:26.550> your

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
it to size go straight into your

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.510 
it to size go straight into your
throttle<00:02:26.970> body<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.770> that's<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.340> then

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
throttle body and that's it and then

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.760 
throttle body and that's it and then
just<00:02:29.640> refit<00:02:30.000> your<00:02:30.090> air<00:02:30.180> box<00:02:30.270> assembly<00:02:30.770> my

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
just refit your air box assembly my

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.380 
just refit your air box assembly my
notions<00:02:32.130> done<00:02:32.310> right<00:02:32.550> when<00:02:33.000> you're<00:02:33.180> starting

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
notions done right when you're starting

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.820 
notions done right when you're starting
car<00:02:33.600> look<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:33.930> no<00:02:34.050> money's<00:02:34.320> all<00:02:34.410> over<00:02:34.560> like

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
car look so no money's all over like

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.100 
car look so no money's all over like
that<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.670> then<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:35.880> get<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.630> get<00:02:36.720> full<00:02:36.930> boost

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
that and then you get you get full boost

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.990 
that and then you get you get full boost
in<00:02:37.290> first<00:02:37.500> second<00:02:37.830> gear<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.640> like<00:02:38.790> me

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
in first second gear and if you like me

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.930 
in first second gear and if you like me
alone<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:40.050> literally<00:02:40.320> boost<00:02:40.560> issues<00:02:40.940> as

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
alone you literally boost issues as
