00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.000
 portal glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.160
 entertainment on glafi.com hello everyone with 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.420
 You Misha days in this review game under 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.340
 name max stil 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.440
 chillingo development studio in 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.240
 once again really happy 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.550
 original game max steel 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.560
 in this arcade and they managed to combine 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.170
 two seemingly different genres 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.330
 dynamic runner and tactical let's go 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.790
 the duet turned out right 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.680
 familiarize yourself with this creation without 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.930
 long prefaces put you on 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.990
 the road leading to the shoulders adventure 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.450
 runners among all the games are not uncommon and this 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.610
 The game is created according to the standard of the genre 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.800
 the road will be divided into three lanes 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.980
 between which you need to move quickly 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.420
 for rounding various obstacles 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.150
 jump over and be sure to slide 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.100
 the obstacles themselves depend on the location on 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.860
 initial stage representing 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.170
 the canyon it will be rocks and constantly 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.629
 cobblestones rolling on all sides 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.430
 but just tack between them 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.770
 an obstacle on the road would be boring 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.560
 so at regular intervals 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.659
 time you are waiting for small battles with 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.299
 robots and at the end of each level 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.400
 meeting with boss fights as well as 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.040
 the rest of the way will be checked 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.409
 your ability to respond quickly is simple 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.299
 beat the enemies there is little need also 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.720
 have time to dodge blows and 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.310
 shots and sometimes shoot down to apply 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.470
 superpowers without which winning you 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.430
 do not see along the way you will collect 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.010
 tokens 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.110
 which is essentially game currency for 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.970
 which in the laboratory you can 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.940
 buy for your hero various 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.400
 improvements and 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.740
 bonuses for example can be increased 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.020
 maximum health limit that will be 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.940
 not at all superfluous and dying character 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.430
 only from a head-on collision with 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.620
 monolithic rock others the same case only 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.330
 lose some health and do it 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.760
 you can right during the game 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.730
 using the stock first aid kits graphics in the game 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.270
 bright but not realistic and rather 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.580
 vice versa 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.950
 and a lot of gruff but overall looks 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.470
 it is not bad and is achieved by 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.020
 a large number of parts let them 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.120
 too well crafted on this 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.340
 me all subscribe to our channel 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.290
