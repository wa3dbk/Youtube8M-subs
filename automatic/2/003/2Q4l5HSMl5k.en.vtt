00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 chose a fence for a very long time 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.560
 functionality in appearance and 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.290
 chose fences 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.809
 factory named frunze here yesterday orders 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.969
 I came to see the fence here 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.350
 happens 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.980
 You can install a fence in principle with two 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.430
 species 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.560
 alone or resort to help 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.600
 specialists but as I have not done 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.470
 I will resort to the help of plant specialists 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.269
 frunze name 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.890
 which not only make this 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.679
 fence but also offer now 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 installation service I was informed that 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.030
 a few hours ago a car with 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.610
 fencing has already arrived at the site goes 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.649
 set flax and work on how much i 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.250
 I see almost all the work already done 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:50.270
 nifiga myself but how I look is there still 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.770
 working for me so let's go help 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.840
 no, let's look at you 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.940
 very online set the whole 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.460
 fence and how am I initially work 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.590
 were carried out fairly quickly we 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.640
 performed according to plan the markup development ta 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.020
 territory where it will be necessary 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.530
 install our fence 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.939
 next stage we have drilled holes 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 so to speak you dug pits where the fuck is not 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.420
 by becoming our pillars with 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:29.340
 sections respectively the next step 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.729
 there was an assembly of all the barriers like became 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.360
 ban 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.000
 for this we used such 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.630
 procedure 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.670
 we take a pillar with scenes of his rivets to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.920
 the top is sure to 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.040
 then we put section 2 weakly on it 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.610
 we lay down parallel at a distance of two seconds 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.610
 half meters 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:00.229
 on top of this find 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:04.030
 would we set up our section my 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.030
 a colleague is not going to help 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.230
 then with the help of such fasteners 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.319
 simple enough but none the less 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:31.489
 we are effective and fasten the section to 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:34.420
 our pillar principle can proceed 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.420
 the next step is the construction of the fence and 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:46.790
 set our pre- dug 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:49.069
 fossa next step is necessary 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.959
 fix it with 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.329
 the bars we were preparing also 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.090
 pre and basically can 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.090
 construct the next part of the section 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.810
 pipe slightly lift 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.100
 Eugene 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.170
 the fence was literally folded in 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.560
 minutes with your work 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.930
 collective that is if i'm a man i would 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.400
 could this sunburn sona yes 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.160
 really nothing complicated about it 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.260
 the guys are certainly hands full but having 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.930
 hand ordinary instructions you 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.420
 yourself with the help of comrades would 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.610
 handled the cost a little more 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.100
 time I want to say that the installation 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.680
 really pretty simple and not 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.670
 requires a lot of effort and a lot 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.670
 the amount of time my fence selected 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.650
 has a rich beautiful blue color and 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.240
 Of course I would like this 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.850
 the color is still the same 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.110
 beautiful for a long time not to change 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.390
 Are we facing rust? 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.570
 there is no threat of quarantine 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.710
 the fence is 12 years old thanks to all 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.330
 innovation technology which 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.250
 applied in our production we 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.050
 achieved such a good performance 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.940
 you can be sure that you have a fence 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.210
 there is still the same beautiful 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.970
 the world 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.710
 great job however how i see 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.860
 need my presence here 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.130
 no more therefore you finish work i 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.130
 I know that here in good hands 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.130
 is happy
