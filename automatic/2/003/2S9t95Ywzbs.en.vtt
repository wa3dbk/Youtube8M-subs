alright<00:01:14.200> I'm<00:01:15.200> okay<00:01:15.530> with<00:01:15.680> that

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
alright I'm okay with that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.130 
alright I'm okay with that
I<00:01:20.200> guess<00:01:21.200> I'll<00:01:21.350> keep<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.649> call<00:01:21.860> in<00:01:22.280> my<00:01:22.430> hand

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
I guess I'll keep the call in my hand

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.289 
I guess I'll keep the call in my hand
because<00:01:24.140> if<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:24.409> set<00:01:24.619> both<00:01:24.890> if<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:25.189> set<00:01:25.399> a<00:01:25.610> waste

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
because if I set both if I set a waste

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.890 
because if I set both if I set a waste
and<00:01:26.659> call<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.380> way<00:01:27.470> I'm<00:01:27.590> thinking<00:01:27.950> and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
and call this the way I'm thinking and

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.570 
and call this the way I'm thinking and
he<00:01:29.900> gets<00:01:30.110> rid<00:01:30.229> of<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.409> field<00:01:30.680> something<00:01:31.430> like

I<00:02:41.780> used<00:02:42.780> Vegas<00:02:43.110> effect<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.560> send<00:02:43.830> this<00:02:44.060> go<00:02:45.060> to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
I used Vegas effect to send this go to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.230 
I used Vegas effect to send this go to
summon<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:46.400> but<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.490> all<00:02:47.610> depends<00:02:48.000> though

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
summon this but it all depends though

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.480 
summon this but it all depends though
right<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:50.720> if<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.870> summon<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:53.280> really

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
right so if I summon this is it really

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.580 
right so if I summon this is it really
that<00:02:53.670> important<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:54.330> him<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:55.260> summon<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
that important for him to summon the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.930 
that important for him to summon the
dark<00:02:55.800> walk<00:02:56.010> he<00:02:56.130> might<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.460> summon<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.760> dark

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
dark walk he might just summon the dark

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.690 
dark walk he might just summon the dark
wall<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.080> think<00:02:58.710> I'm<00:02:58.800> okay<00:02:58.890> with<00:02:59.220> that

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700

wall but I think I'm okay with that
so<00:03:01.370> we're<00:03:02.370> gonna<00:03:02.490> do<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.060> summon<00:03:03.420> and

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.040 
I'm not gonna activate the effect cuz I
don't<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.210> really<00:03:06.300> matters<00:03:06.540> either<00:03:06.840> way

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
don't think it really matters either way

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
mass changed and shadow miss activates

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.520 
mass changed and shadow miss activates
and<00:03:37.440> then<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.800> will<00:03:38.510> bottomless<00:03:39.510> his<00:03:39.780> or<00:03:40.410> at

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
least attempt the bottomless is dark law

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.250

that<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.770> unfortunate<00:03:45.080> hmm<00:03:47.959> do<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:48.989> want<00:03:49.200> to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
that is unfortunate hmm do I want to

00:03:49.260 --> 00:04:16.050 
that is unfortunate hmm do I want to
continue<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.739> battle<00:03:50.450> sure<00:03:51.560> continue

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.800 

I<00:04:17.549> don't<00:04:18.549> think<00:04:18.609> plasm<00:04:19.150> really<00:04:19.450> matters<00:04:19.780> right

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810

I don't think plasm really matters right
now<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:21.010> think<00:04:21.130> it's<00:04:21.519> pretty<00:04:21.790> safe<00:04:22.120> for<00:04:22.540> me

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
now so I think it's pretty safe for me

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:39.379 
now so I think it's pretty safe for me
