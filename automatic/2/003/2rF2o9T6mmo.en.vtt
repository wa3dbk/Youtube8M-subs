guy it's essentially routing our device
automatically<00:03:24.810> by<00:03:25.019> doing<00:03:25.319> this<00:03:25.410> here<00:03:25.620> you

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
automatically by doing this here you

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.050 
automatically by doing this here you
don't<00:03:25.919> have<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.160> type<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.519> any<00:03:26.639> commands

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
anything like that all right so it's

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.300 
anything like that all right so it's
gonna<00:03:30.239> reboot<00:03:30.810> itself<00:03:31.019> again<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.919> then<00:03:32.129> once
