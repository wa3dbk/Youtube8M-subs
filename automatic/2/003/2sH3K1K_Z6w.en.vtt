also<00:00:29.400> travel<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.449> when<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.080> take<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
also travel with you when you take the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.730 
also travel with you when you take the
garment<00:00:31.800> off<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.260> technique

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
garment off so this is just a technique

garment off so this is just a technique
as<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.400> I'm<00:00:35.670> only<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> lift<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.810> the

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
as you see I'm only going to lift up the

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.120 
as you see I'm only going to lift up the
seam<00:00:37.800> allowance<00:00:39.650> because<00:00:40.650> if<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.890> were<00:00:41.010> to

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
seam allowance because if you were to

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.970 
seam allowance because if you were to
sew<00:00:41.340> through<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> entire<00:00:42.150> thing<00:00:42.840> you'll<00:00:43.710> see

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
sew through the entire thing you'll see

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.560 
sew through the entire thing you'll see
that<00:00:44.160> you'll<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.490> on<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> outside<00:00:45.240> of<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
that you'll be on the outside of the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.770 
that you'll be on the outside of the
garment<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.560> what<00:00:46.830> you're<00:00:47.040> going<00:00:47.310> to<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.790> is<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
garment so what you're going to do is to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.610 
garment so what you're going to do is to
lift<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.770> seam<00:00:50.130> allowance<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:51.620> about

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
lift the seam allowance up about

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.010 
lift the seam allowance up about
three-quarters<00:00:53.310> of<00:00:53.340> an<00:00:53.670> inch<00:00:53.820> higher<00:00:54.630> than

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
three-quarters of an inch higher than

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.290 
three-quarters of an inch higher than
the<00:00:55.620> hemline<00:00:56.150> you're<00:00:57.150> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> go<00:00:59.180> put<00:01:00.180> your

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the hemline you're going to go put your

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.750 
the hemline you're going to go put your
needle<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.200> and<00:01:02.150> sew<00:01:03.150> a<00:01:03.180> couple<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.049> passes<00:01:04.760> to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
needle in and sew a couple of passes to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.260 
needle in and sew a couple of passes to
anchor<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:10.760> then<00:01:11.760> once<00:01:12.030> it's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
anchor that in and then once it's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.480 
anchor that in and then once it's
anchored<00:01:12.800> I'll<00:01:13.800> show<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.370> technique

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.670 

if<00:01:20.490> you'd<00:01:20.730> hold<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.960> thread<00:01:22.350> that's

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
if you'd hold on to the thread that's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.210 
if you'd hold on to the thread that's
attached<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.520> needle<00:01:23.880> end<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.830> one<00:01:25.830> hand

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
attached to the needle end in one hand

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.600 
attached to the needle end in one hand
and<00:01:26.580> wrap<00:01:27.510> it<00:01:27.660> around<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:28.050> finger<00:01:28.610> you're

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and wrap it around your finger you're

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.910 
and wrap it around your finger you're
going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.910> use<00:01:30.150> your<00:01:30.360> other<00:01:30.570> hand<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.230> hand

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
going to use your other hand to hand

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.180 
going to use your other hand to hand
crochet<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.570> piece<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.110> thread<00:01:34.440> until<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
crochet that piece of thread until you

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.500 
crochet that piece of thread until you
get<00:01:35.400> enough<00:01:35.730> length<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.870> create<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:39.180> French

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
get enough length to create the French

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.320 
get enough length to create the French
tack<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> you're<00:01:42.630> making<00:01:42.810> an<00:01:43.170> opening<00:01:44.330> you're

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
tack so you're making an opening you're

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.380 
tack so you're making an opening you're
pulling<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.900> thread<00:01:46.170> through<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:48.000> create<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
pulling the thread through to create a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.160 
pulling the thread through to create a
loop<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.070> pull<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.400> way<00:01:50.670> down<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.780> anchor

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
loop and pull all the way down to anchor

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.780 
loop and pull all the way down to anchor
that<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.620> again<00:01:55.010> you're<00:01:56.010> going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.220> continue

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
that and again you're going to continue

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.600 
that and again you're going to continue
to<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.210> same<00:01:57.600> movement<00:01:58.290> as<00:01:58.410> you<00:01:59.250> notice

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
to do that same movement as you notice

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.480 
to do that same movement as you notice
on<00:01:59.790> my<00:01:59.820> right<00:02:00.270> hand<00:02:00.690> I'm<00:02:01.350> holding<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.190> thread

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
on my right hand I'm holding the thread

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.660 
on my right hand I'm holding the thread
so<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.790> there's<00:02:03.180> enough<00:02:03.510> tension<00:02:03.930> there<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so that there's enough tension there to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.430 
so that there's enough tension there to
create<00:02:07.280> your<00:02:08.280> thread<00:02:08.640> loops<00:02:09.510> and<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.200> see

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
create your thread loops and as you see

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.000 
create your thread loops and as you see
you're<00:02:10.679> getting<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:11.040> little<00:02:11.220> length<00:02:11.580> on<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
you're getting a little length on that

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
you're getting a little length on that
tack

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:28.059 

and<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.750> readjust<00:02:17.350> as<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.680> go<00:02:17.830> along

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.489 

you<00:02:28.609> want<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.879> keep<00:02:29.030> going<00:02:29.299> with<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.870> until

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:30.499 
you want to keep going with this until

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:35.770 
you want to keep going with this until
you<00:02:30.769> get<00:02:31.090> about<00:02:33.249> 5/8<00:02:34.249> of<00:02:34.459> an<00:02:34.609> inch<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.909> 3/4<00:02:35.749> of

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
you get about 5/8 of an inch to 3/4 of

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.520 
you get about 5/8 of an inch to 3/4 of
an<00:02:36.109> inch<00:02:36.260> long<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.269> reason<00:02:38.659> for<00:02:38.689> that<00:02:38.870> is

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
an inch long and the reason for that is

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.509 
an inch long and the reason for that is
you<00:02:40.310> want<00:02:40.579> it<00:02:40.700> long<00:02:41.060> enough<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.810> maintain

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
you want it long enough to maintain

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.119 
you want it long enough to maintain
enough<00:02:43.519> distance<00:02:43.879> between<00:02:44.469> your<00:02:45.469> lining<00:02:45.980> and

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
enough distance between your lining and

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.520 
enough distance between your lining and
your<00:02:46.310> garment<00:02:46.790> but<00:02:47.269> not<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:47.780> close<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.379> as

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
your garment but not so close that as

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.099 
your garment but not so close that as
you<00:02:48.680> walk<00:02:48.889> the<00:02:49.730> lining<00:02:50.180> starts<00:02:50.389> to<00:02:50.629> pull<00:02:50.840> and

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
you walk the lining starts to pull and

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.569 
you walk the lining starts to pull and
the<00:02:51.349> garment<00:02:51.969> will<00:02:52.969> buckle<00:02:53.689> at<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.260> hem<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:55.549> I

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
the garment will buckle at the hem so I

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.140 
the garment will buckle at the hem so I
think<00:02:55.760> we've<00:02:56.150> got<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.919> couple<00:02:57.919> more<00:02:58.549> to<00:02:58.609> go<00:02:58.909> to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
think we've got a couple more to go to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.659 
think we've got a couple more to go to
get<00:02:59.599> the<00:02:59.719> length<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.200> we<00:03:00.349> need<00:03:00.639> which<00:03:01.639> will

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:01.669 
get the length that we need which will

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.869 
get the length that we need which will
be<00:03:01.939> about<00:03:02.209> 5/8<00:03:02.780> of<00:03:03.019> an<00:03:03.169> inch<00:03:03.319> and<00:03:03.680> then<00:03:04.489> the

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
be about 5/8 of an inch and then the

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.110 
be about 5/8 of an inch and then the
last<00:03:05.180> thing<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.139> do<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.469> this<00:03:06.709> side<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.909> put

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
last thing you do in this side is to put

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.390 
last thing you do in this side is to put
the<00:03:08.269> needle<00:03:08.540> through<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.049> loop<00:03:09.349> so<00:03:10.069> that<00:03:10.280> you

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
the needle through the loop so that you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.030 
the needle through the loop so that you
can<00:03:10.579> close<00:03:10.969> it<00:03:11.389> up<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:15.500> stops<00:03:15.889> the

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
can close it up and that stops the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.459 
can close it up and that stops the
looping<00:03:16.489> process<00:03:16.959> what<00:03:17.959> you're<00:03:18.109> going<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.290> do

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:18.469 
looping process what you're going to do

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.899 
looping process what you're going to do
now<00:03:18.709> is<00:03:19.069> to<00:03:19.250> pick<00:03:19.430> up<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.939> lining<00:03:20.449> portion<00:03:21.909> I'm

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
now is to pick up the lining portion I'm

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.390 
now is to pick up the lining portion I'm
going<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.209> turn<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.139> around<00:03:24.199> so<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.250> you

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
going to turn this around so that you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.599 
going to turn this around so that you
can<00:03:25.639> see<00:03:26.569> more<00:03:26.810> of<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.019> lining<00:03:30.400> there's<00:03:31.400> your

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
can see more of the lining there's your

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.360 
can see more of the lining there's your
French<00:03:31.879> tack<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:33.109> now<00:03:33.349> we<00:03:33.409> need<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.769> reach<00:03:34.069> for

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
French tack so now we need to reach for

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.140 
French tack so now we need to reach for
the<00:03:34.489> lining<00:03:34.819> as<00:03:35.799> you<00:03:36.799> see<00:03:37.040> we've<00:03:37.250> got<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.699> seam

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
the lining as you see we've got a seam

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.210 
the lining as you see we've got a seam
that's<00:03:38.479> pressed<00:03:38.840> open<00:03:39.079> in<00:03:39.409> the<00:03:39.530> garment<00:03:39.979> and

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
that's pressed open in the garment and

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.819 
that's pressed open in the garment and
we've<00:03:41.150> got<00:03:41.329> a<00:03:41.359> seam<00:03:41.720> that's<00:03:41.900> pressed<00:03:42.259> open<00:03:42.470> in

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
we've got a seam that's pressed open in

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.999 
we've got a seam that's pressed open in
the<00:03:42.979> lining<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:44.180> you're<00:03:44.389> going<00:03:44.689> to<00:03:44.989> just<00:03:45.769> lay

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:46.009 
the lining so you're going to just lay

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:47.890 
the lining so you're going to just lay
those<00:03:46.250> together<00:03:46.579> close<00:03:47.150> enough<00:03:47.419> together<00:03:47.599> to

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
those together close enough together to

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.369 
those together close enough together to
see<00:03:48.199> where<00:03:48.409> they<00:03:48.590> meet<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.609> on<00:03:50.509> the<00:03:50.659> same<00:03:50.959> side

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
see where they meet and on the same side

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.890 
see where they meet and on the same side
of<00:03:51.409> the<00:03:51.739> seam<00:03:52.009> that<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.879> put<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.299> French<00:03:53.569> tack

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
of the seam that you put the French tack

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.499 
of the seam that you put the French tack
you're<00:03:54.650> going<00:03:54.949> to<00:03:55.099> then<00:03:55.340> go<00:03:55.609> in<00:03:55.879> about<00:03:56.329> the

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:56.509 
you're going to then go in about the

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:00.069 
you're going to then go in about the
same<00:03:56.720> level<00:03:57.199> up<00:03:57.639> about<00:03:58.639> 5/8<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.419> an<00:03:59.629> inch<00:03:59.780> up

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
same level up about 5/8 of an inch up

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.339 
same level up about 5/8 of an inch up
from<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.470> hem<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.489> pull<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.479> tech<00:04:02.900> all<00:04:03.139> the

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
from the hem and pull that tech all the

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.690 
from the hem and pull that tech all the
way<00:04:03.470> back<00:04:03.709> down<00:04:03.949> to<00:04:04.009> the<00:04:04.340> hem

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
way back down to the hem

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:18.370 

and<00:04:07.930> then<00:04:08.930> anchor<00:04:09.349> it<00:04:09.500> in

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.490 

so<00:04:18.980> that<00:04:19.220> finished<00:04:19.700> end<00:04:19.970> gets<00:04:20.480> closed<00:04:20.840> down<00:04:21.170> to

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
so that finished end gets closed down to

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.990 
so that finished end gets closed down to
the<00:04:21.650> lining<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:23.770> then<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.370> couple<00:04:25.670> more

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
the lining and then so a couple more

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.420 
the lining and then so a couple more
passes<00:04:26.300> through<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.800> can<00:04:30.890> anchor<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.340> down

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
passes through so you can anchor it down

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.930 
passes through so you can anchor it down
well<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.120> then<00:04:32.300> we've<00:04:32.510> got<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:33.680> loop<00:04:33.950> where

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
well and then we've got the loop where

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.590 
well and then we've got the loop where
we<00:04:35.090> can<00:04:35.240> make<00:04:35.420> our<00:04:35.630> knot<00:04:36.820> two<00:04:37.820> passes<00:04:38.360> through

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
we can make our knot two passes through

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.570 
we can make our knot two passes through
the<00:04:38.720> loop<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:40.720> knots<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:41.930> off<00:04:42.170> so<00:04:42.740> now

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
the loop and that knots it off so now

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.850 
the loop and that knots it off so now
all<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:44.120> have<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.360> do<00:04:44.510> is<00:04:44.660> cut<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.050> off<00:04:49.060> and

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
all you have to do is cut it off and

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.220 
all you have to do is cut it off and
here's<00:04:51.860> your<00:04:52.070> French<00:04:52.340> tack<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:53.840> hold<00:04:54.080> the

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
here's your French tack to hold the

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.680 
here's your French tack to hold the
lining<00:04:54.680> next<00:04:55.100> to<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.280> garment<00:04:55.700> so<00:04:56.300> that<00:04:56.540> when

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
lining next to the garment so that when

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.640 
lining next to the garment so that when
it<00:04:56.840> hangs<00:04:57.050> freely<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:59.510> can't<00:04:59.780> even<00:04:59.960> tell<00:05:00.350> that

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
it hangs freely you can't even tell that

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.640 
it hangs freely you can't even tell that
there's<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.130> French<00:05:01.430> tack<00:05:01.700> there<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:03.500> have

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
there's a French tack there and you have

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.750 
there's a French tack there and you have
the<00:05:03.680> extra<00:05:04.250> added<00:05:04.400> stability<00:05:04.880> of<00:05:05.510> that<00:05:06.140> lining

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
the extra added stability of that lining

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.970 
the extra added stability of that lining
not<00:05:07.760> being<00:05:08.030> able<00:05:08.270> to<00:05:08.420> travel<00:05:08.780> through<00:05:09.110> when

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
not being able to travel through when

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.540 
not being able to travel through when
you<00:05:10.070> remove<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.550> garment<00:05:12.130> that's<00:05:13.130> just<00:05:13.490> a

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
you remove the garment that's just a

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.790 
you remove the garment that's just a
