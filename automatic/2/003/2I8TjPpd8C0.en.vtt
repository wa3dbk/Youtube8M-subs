00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.520
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.650
 at schmuckladen punkt.de my name is 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.990
 stressed Traub and I'm in the moderator 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.700
 Well today I want to show you how we are 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.930
 from a normal cloth bag what 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.820
 can make cool things 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.270
 Of course we need one for that 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:30.550
 fabric bag bit of textile paint for 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:36.840
 blackboard sponge and very important one 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:39.880
 sporty pies lace need more 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.870
 these are the patterns now 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.680
 here at the side 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.640
 there could also choose as different and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.440
 of course I have everyone then 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.360
 Letters printed on it you can 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.670
 then carefully cut her out 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.890
 You can also take something else a heart 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.900
 and star or whatever 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.570
 and that looks like this 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.390
 I have already used that 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.009
 show you how to do it 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.460
 Well, so these cakes tip we lie 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.280
 then simply on the side 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.170
 here on a corner expresses already 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.350
 firmly and with the paint drive over here 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.689
 I noticed something there and that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.250
 if you just do it that way 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.840
 Unfortunately we have the problem that the color 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.670
 that's what's on the other side 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.009
 that they never so well would become of so 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.020
 I recommend you just take it 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.890
 in newspaper it is here to below 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.810
 the ceiling 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.340
 then s can not go through then you can 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.960
 that is at least dry please 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.850
 turn around on the other side of the make 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.649
 or the other way you want 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.119
 that's how easy it is 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:51.340
 then we put our letter that 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.940
 here on it as well and bicycles with the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.940
 swam over it 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 OK 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.870
 yes, there is not really 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.750
 So I wish you much 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.000
 have fun, I think I have to 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.640
 Let's show you a little bit more 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.670
 let's down a little because 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.590
 otherwise it is a bit silly now 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.950
 namely down here, we still do 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.880
 a small part 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.780
 otherwise I have nothing to do with it now 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.780
 do in the video 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.510

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.760
 10 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.340
 I also have to explain to you that you 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.130

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.319
 interesting thing is I am number 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.709

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.440

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.040

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:33.130

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.720
 to make a leg and a small one 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.190
 really know sometimes 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.360
 challenges 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.319
 sometimes I wish that to me 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.720
 could only present but it does 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.950
 fun 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.350
 should you at some point notice that 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.569
 that my German maybe not 110 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.790
 grammatically perfect is correct then 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.760
 until the most likely because 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.139
 that's how it really is 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.870

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.569

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.569
 done because my mother tongue is 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.340
 afrikaans now you ask how 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.560
 then this afrikaans sounds like that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:22.120
 dutch and sounds to them 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.410
 I'd say something then says very briefly 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.740
 here, for example, has to screw that 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:32.389
 that we do not clear that up everywhere 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.650
