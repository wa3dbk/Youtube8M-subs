00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
a pad on straightaway because literally

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.650 
a pad on straightaway because literally
in<00:00:55.160> my<00:00:55.250> urine<00:00:55.580> was<00:00:55.730> just<00:00:55.970> coming<00:00:56.240> out<00:00:56.390> like<00:00:56.600> a

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
in my urine was just coming out like a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.800 
in my urine was just coming out like a
tap<00:00:56.900> it<00:00:57.290> was<00:00:57.530> just<00:00:57.800> like<00:00:57.950> turning<00:00:58.160> on<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.370> tab

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
tap it was just like turning on the tab

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.270 
tap it was just like turning on the tab
and<00:00:59.810> you<00:00:59.990> don't<00:01:00.170> realize<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:00.710> know<00:01:01.160> no

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
and you don't realize this you know no

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.500 
and you don't realize this you know no
matter<00:01:01.430> what<00:01:01.520> you're<00:01:01.820> told<00:01:02.030> about<00:01:02.360> it

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
matter what you're told about it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.420 
matter what you're told about it
beforehand<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.110> have<00:01:03.260> no<00:01:03.440> concept<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:04.220> just

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
beforehand you have no concept you just

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.700 
beforehand you have no concept you just
think<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.790> might<00:01:04.970> be<00:01:05.090> like<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.269> little<00:01:05.360> child

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
think it might be like a little child

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.740 
think it might be like a little child
rippling<00:01:06.710> occasionally<00:01:07.280> but<00:01:08.210> it's<00:01:08.360> not<00:01:08.540> it

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
rippling occasionally but it's not it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.510 
rippling occasionally but it's not it
just<00:01:08.780> keeps<00:01:09.230> coming<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:09.740> keeps<00:01:09.980> coming<00:01:10.220> and

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
just keeps coming and keeps coming and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.610 
just keeps coming and keeps coming and
within<00:01:10.640> an<00:01:10.820> hour<00:01:10.940> you've<00:01:11.330> you<00:01:11.960> filled<00:01:12.350> your

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
within an hour you've you filled your

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.070 
within an hour you've you filled your
pad<00:01:12.980> and<00:01:13.340> then<00:01:14.120> you're<00:01:14.540> getting<00:01:14.750> another<00:01:14.900> one

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
pad and then you're getting another one

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.010 
pad and then you're getting another one
that's<00:01:15.680> quite<00:01:16.130> inhibiting<00:01:16.640> on<00:01:16.760> your<00:01:16.880> life<00:01:17.030> and

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
that's quite inhibiting on your life and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.680 
that's quite inhibiting on your life and
I<00:01:18.140> certainly<00:01:18.380> found<00:01:18.710> for<00:01:18.980> the<00:01:19.040> first<00:01:19.690> few

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
I certainly found for the first few

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.570 
I certainly found for the first few
weeks<00:01:20.870> that<00:01:21.260> that<00:01:21.680> was<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:21.890> very<00:01:22.130> inhibiting

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
weeks that that was a very inhibiting

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.770 
weeks that that was a very inhibiting
thing<00:01:22.760> because<00:01:22.910> you<00:01:23.000> can't<00:01:23.180> do<00:01:23.330> very<00:01:23.450> much

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
thing because you can't do very much

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.450 
thing because you can't do very much
like<00:01:24.290> if<00:01:24.440> I<00:01:24.530> wanted<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.830> play<00:01:24.980> a<00:01:25.010> game<00:01:25.160> of<00:01:25.310> golf

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
like if I wanted to play a game of golf

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.580 
like if I wanted to play a game of golf
I<00:01:25.730> was<00:01:26.180> having<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.450> find<00:01:26.600> bins<00:01:26.960> around<00:01:27.470> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
I was having to find bins around the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.560 
I was having to find bins around the
course<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.190> had<00:01:28.310> put<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.730> pad<00:01:29.060> in<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.420> put

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
course and it had put a pad in and put

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.750 
course and it had put a pad in and put
another<00:01:29.780> one<00:01:29.990> in<00:01:30.020> that's<00:01:30.680> not<00:01:30.830> on<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.190> golf

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
another one in that's not on a golf

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.399 
another one in that's not on a golf
course<00:01:31.909> that's<00:01:32.150> not<00:01:32.360> very<00:01:32.480> easy<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.930> do<00:01:33.050> I<00:01:33.200> did

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
course that's not very easy to do I did

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.110 
course that's not very easy to do I did
it<00:01:33.530> mind<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:33.920> because<00:01:34.159> I<00:01:34.340> was<00:01:34.490> determined<00:01:35.000> not

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
it mind you because I was determined not

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.649 
it mind you because I was determined not
to<00:01:35.180> be<00:01:35.390> beaten<00:01:35.720> by<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.930> but<00:01:36.650> it's<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:38.090> was<00:01:38.330> quite

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
to be beaten by it but it's it was quite

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.270 
to be beaten by it but it's it was quite
difficult<00:01:38.870> that<00:01:39.260> when<00:01:39.920> you've<00:01:40.070> had<00:01:40.220> the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
difficult that when you've had the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
on working I just see you know this this

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.320 
on working I just see you know this this
is<00:02:49.560> something<00:02:49.770> just<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.190> move<00:02:50.370> on<00:02:50.580> whatever

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
is something just to move on whatever

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.570 
is something just to move on whatever
happens<00:02:51.570> next<00:02:51.990> that<00:02:52.440> will<00:02:52.530> be<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.800> same<00:02:53.040> you

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
happens next that will be the same you

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.610 
happens next that will be the same you
know<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.209> cancer<00:02:54.600> occurs<00:02:54.959> at<00:02:55.230> some<00:02:55.260> time

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
know if the cancer occurs at some time

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.140 
know if the cancer occurs at some time
in<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.800> future<00:02:55.920> that'll<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.940> same

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
in the future that'll be the same

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.600 
in the future that'll be the same
because<00:02:57.570> it's<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.140> belief<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.709> there<00:02:59.430> isn't

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
because it's the belief that there isn't

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.180 
because it's the belief that there isn't
go<00:03:00.360> beyond<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.870> one<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.350> then<00:03:01.770> look<00:03:01.980> at<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
go beyond that one and then look at the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.860 
go beyond that one and then look at the
next<00:03:02.220> step<00:03:02.550> look<00:03:02.940> at<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.120> next<00:03:03.360> things<00:03:03.600> look

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
next step look at the next things look

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.730 
next step look at the next things look
at<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.080> next<00:03:04.290> challenge

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
at the next challenge

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.550 
at the next challenge
and<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.630> would<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> strong<00:03:07.110> message<00:03:07.350> to

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
and so that would be a strong message to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.310 
and so that would be a strong message to
to<00:03:08.550> anybody<00:03:08.880> else<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.420> know<00:03:09.510> if<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.810> can<00:03:10.050> I'm

not<00:03:10.440> saying<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.740> can<00:03:10.980> because<00:03:11.430> it's<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
not saying you can because it's just the
