00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
now a piece like this this should be

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.050 
now a piece like this this should be
able<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.540> fit<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.870> there<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.580> kind<00:03:26.580> of<00:03:26.730> move<00:03:26.940> it

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:14.209 
tutorial I'm just explaining some things

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:16.089 
tutorial I'm just explaining some things
about<00:05:14.539> the<00:05:14.779> magazine

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
about the magazine

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.219 
about the magazine
we<00:05:16.369> built<00:05:16.699> this<00:05:16.849> part<00:05:17.209> and<00:05:17.419> this<00:05:17.869> is<00:05:17.929> the

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
we built this part and this is the

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.639 
we built this part and this is the
plunger<00:05:19.089> and<00:05:20.089> it's<00:05:20.539> what<00:05:20.779> actually<00:05:21.109> pushes<00:05:21.529> to

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:21.649 
plunger and it's what actually pushes to

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:23.349 
plunger and it's what actually pushes to
the<00:05:21.709> rubber<00:05:21.949> bands<00:05:22.339> that<00:05:22.669> mean<00:05:22.849> pushes<00:05:23.209> the

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:23.359 
the rubber bands that mean pushes the

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:28.599 
the rubber bands that mean pushes the
pieces<00:05:23.899> into<00:05:24.109> the<00:05:24.229> gun<00:05:26.289> so<00:05:27.289> it<00:05:27.679> snaps<00:05:28.099> into<00:05:28.339> the

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:28.609 
pieces into the gun so it snaps into the

00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:31.539 
pieces into the gun so it snaps into the
magazine<00:05:28.909> like<00:05:29.119> that<00:05:29.389> and<00:05:29.889> then<00:05:30.889> the<00:05:31.099> bullets

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:31.549 
magazine like that and then the bullets

00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:36.759 
magazine like that and then the bullets
going<00:05:32.509> above<00:05:32.959> it<00:05:33.699> when<00:05:34.699> you<00:05:34.789> load<00:05:35.029> and<00:05:35.769> there's

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:36.769 
going above it when you load and there's

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:39.609 
going above it when you load and there's
a<00:05:36.999> rubber<00:05:37.999> band<00:05:38.209> that<00:05:38.449> has<00:05:38.569> attached<00:05:38.899> one<00:05:39.349> side

00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:39.619 
a rubber band that has attached one side

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:42.359 
a rubber band that has attached one side
to<00:05:39.859> the<00:05:40.189> the<00:05:40.999> gun<00:05:41.239> and<00:05:41.599> then<00:05:41.749> the<00:05:41.869> other<00:05:42.049> side

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:42.369 
to the the gun and then the other side

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:44.079 
to the the gun and then the other side
attaches<00:05:43.369> right<00:05:43.549> here

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:44.089 
attaches right here

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:47.289 
attaches right here
and<00:05:44.469> it<00:05:45.469> is<00:05:45.589> what<00:05:45.799> will<00:05:45.979> push<00:05:46.729> your<00:05:46.999> pieces

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:47.299 
and it is what will push your pieces

00:05:47.299 --> 00:05:51.519 
and it is what will push your pieces
into<00:05:47.689> the<00:05:47.719> gun<00:05:47.989> so<00:05:50.259> yeah

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:51.529 
into the gun so yeah

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.009 
into the gun so yeah
depending<00:05:52.069> on<00:05:52.129> your<00:05:52.279> gun<00:05:52.519> you<00:05:53.329> could<00:05:53.599> make<00:05:53.869> the

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:54.019 
depending on your gun you could make the

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:57.669 
depending on your gun you could make the
plunger<00:05:54.439> smaller<00:05:54.829> if<00:05:55.779> or<00:05:56.779> you<00:05:57.079> wouldn't<00:05:57.559> you

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:57.679 
plunger smaller if or you wouldn't you

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:58.869 
plunger smaller if or you wouldn't you
might<00:05:57.859> have<00:05:58.009> to<00:05:58.099> make<00:05:58.219> it<00:05:58.369> bigger<00:05:58.579> just

00:05:58.869 --> 00:05:58.879 
might have to make it bigger just

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.749 
might have to make it bigger just
depending<00:05:59.359> on<00:05:59.539> how<00:05:59.959> like<00:06:00.889> tall<00:06:01.189> your<00:06:01.369> gun<00:06:01.549> is

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
depending on how like tall your gun is

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.079 
depending on how like tall your gun is
inside<00:06:02.329> I<00:06:02.359> guess<00:06:02.799> but<00:06:03.799> this<00:06:04.309> is<00:06:04.459> the<00:06:04.639> size<00:06:04.849> I

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:05.089 
inside I guess but this is the size I

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:09.219 
inside I guess but this is the size I
use<00:06:05.389> for<00:06:05.839> the<00:06:06.049> gun<00:06:06.259> the<00:06:06.649> LGG<00:06:07.099> are<00:06:07.369> one

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
yeah you can see here my rubber band

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.620 
yeah you can see here my rubber band
that<00:06:45.290> goes<00:06:45.560> on<00:06:45.800> the<00:06:45.950> plunger<00:06:46.460> goes<00:06:46.670> through

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
that goes on the plunger goes through

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.040 
that goes on the plunger goes through
the<00:06:47.750> wall<00:06:47.990> of<00:06:48.170> the<00:06:48.260> gun<00:06:48.530> and<00:06:49.660> it<00:06:50.660> would<00:06:50.810> come

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
the wall of the gun and it would come

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.200 
the wall of the gun and it would come
out<00:06:51.080> somewhere<00:06:51.680> in<00:06:51.860> here<00:06:52.220> and<00:06:52.370> pull<00:06:53.060> the

out somewhere in here and pull the
plunger<00:06:53.900> up<00:06:54.260> so<00:06:55.070> that's<00:06:55.430> pretty<00:06:55.940> much<00:06:56.030> it

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310
