would stick to the bottom of the shoe
you<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.820> town<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.509> then

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you would just in that one town and then

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.179 
you would just in that one town and then
this<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.259> did<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.770> any

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.910 
adjustability to it adjustable strap
like<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:49.140> cut<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
like this one so I just cut it and I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.499 
like this one so I just cut it and I
added<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.340> piece<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.759> padding<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:52.320> extend<00:01:53.070> that

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
added a piece of padding to extend that

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.630 
added a piece of padding to extend that
heel

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
heel

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.410 
heel
but<00:01:56.570> it'd<00:01:57.080> be<00:01:57.110> better<00:01:57.409> if<00:01:57.560> you're<00:01:57.800> going<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.010> do
