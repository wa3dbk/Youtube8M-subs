00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.210
 do not 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.110
 this is a video of a good one I just 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.110
 find 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.590
 this boat the way with the new 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.730
 precisions the two versions 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:34.359
 it's the new 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.359
 [Music] 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.240
 I'm going to be loading little by the map 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.329
 because before if I approach these 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.690
 machines 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.940
 running a little 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.540
 if for example I approached what yes 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.640
 new charge what is the house 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.010
 that you have already seen is loading what is the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.780
 house and the wooden house and you see in the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.150
 good map I'm going to remove it because meters 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.860
 a little bit long and we also have 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.080
 what are the coordinated the 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.800
 coordinates will see it on your part the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.650
 left part above you can see there 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.830
 are the coordinates the coordinates 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.660
 there are other than that what more I 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.409
 like me was that you can change the 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.039
 language as in Spanish 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.039
 give him 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.799
 the coordinates and you can also put 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.130
 create a marker or be here for example 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.170
 put I do not know 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.170
 almost as much as if my little house 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.889
 [Music] 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.750
 and now let's see here where I put my 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.820
 little house and the little arrow wait for me 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.800
 indicating where I am going 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.630
 for example, it is marking me that I have 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.479
 to go there and the time where 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.130
 then I have marked I will go around and 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.140
 this would be all guys superior to 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.450
 taste in this way the truth is very 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.950
 father that is my map so I do not know 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.470
 lose because they are almost worlds 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.990
 infinite then they want to explore and not 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.540
 they know how to return and web run 22 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.820
