00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.639
 and that's where everything is for our 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.740
 ugly new video on the 2.30 or 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.900
 dofus has just announced that 2.30 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.630
 will be released on September 1st so this Tuesday 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.640
 remains only a few more days for 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.529
 enjoy the 2.29 ie the drop of 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.199
 dofus turcot agents are currently at 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.580
 148 why not pass the bar of 150 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.800
 it could be nice it would miss 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.080
 dofus having cried I do a little 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.120
 last run honestly I do not have 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.950
 so want to know if I can not come so 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.600
 udder 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.270
 the deaths do not interest me any more 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.040
 way it could have been a fan of doing it 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.770
 well, I'll see if you manage 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.870
 not keeping his price I saw that the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.850
 turquoise turquoise quest were enough 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.520
 delicate we mean difficult enough 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.380
 especially he must do the so I 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.840
 had watched the dungeons that 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.630
 was proposing I find it so you'll see 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.670
 I have to redo the pki pki the teen 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.380
 rice the world its royal the spinter cell 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.450
 the donut rice pasta the climate group sig 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.050
 and between must stick to it or coriander 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.660
 all this with an imposed idol and more 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.840
 of this idol body so that when 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.420
 even 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.890
 it's still going to be a quest that goes 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.869
 to be long enough because nothing already 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.830
 to make these donations day there he goes there 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.570
 to have for a long time 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.420
 plus all the quests that risk of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.100
 take some time anyway 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.259
 there is besides precisely here I am 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.450
 you proposed to do this quest 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.750
 on a leave please an episode 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.240
 almost daily from Tuesday on 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.090
 getting turquoise dofus a let's 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.800
 play that traces the whole quest 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.090
 you will really have all the details if 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.600
 you are interested are not told me 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.920
 in comments do not hesitate so here 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.390
 what else are there going to be in 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.310
 this update aside from the quest 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.649
 turquoise dofus is the standardization 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.000
 levels of characteristics of which 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.569
 all classes will have the same 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.399
 plateau ie 100 200 300 in 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.630
 levels and that I think it's 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.800
 really a good idea because 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.270
 some classes were really 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.970
 disabled in some elements one 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.680
 had never seen a 2 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.570
 such classes into such elements because 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.410
 that simply the landing was 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.280
 not viable and some come out will be rc 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.250
 suddenly eg for 1 flip case 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.959
 because the scan is and 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.240
 currently I think it's 20 40 60 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.870
 80 they will go to 100 200 300 so 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.230
 it's normal that boom tap - and I 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.860
 do not think that basically these are 1 r I 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.700
 think it would be pretty good 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.800
 so here for the steps the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.250
 characteristics are not too many details 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.620
 to have 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.300
 and for those who do not know everything about 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.640
 characters whose level will change 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.110
 ie all classes except 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.790
 those who have a recent overhaul 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.020
 so I'm thinking of the fact that axel or this 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.370
 said I think that leave alone 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.470
 classes they did not win must 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.860
 store and well all other cases 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.350
 you will have your stats that will remain 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.550
 precisely so there no problem at this 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.300
 level there you will have no order to 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.560
 buy 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.600
 and that suits me well because I have 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.550
 some Eurostat characters so much better 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.010
 I feel but it will save me from 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.900
 do some dungeons on the island 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.340
 of otomai so there and the second thing 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.950
 finally the third big information 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.140
 on this update 2.30 the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.880
 modification of the obtaining of the nuggets 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.190
 I make a video that details all that 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.380
 for what is seen in detail but basically 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.959
 we can exchange our resources against 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.940
 nuggets and this will be the only way to 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.690
 get them that's why I think 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.640
 that the price will increase especially that 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.070
 look for magic forge 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.920
 I did a few small is including 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.930
 on an ink trip that's pretty 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.430
 galley in itself fm which you arrive on 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.380
 to crafter that you have a g like that you 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.019
 are not happy and there you can everything 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.440
 just change it via that it costs 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.970
 just 500 nugget to make it a 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.890
 here and now a thirty 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.049
 sleeping quarantine and will make a 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.720
 rather not badly where it was missing 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.220
 some ruins I think about it there 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.030
 look at the g I just made there 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.880
 is just huge 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.519
 you pass a small perfected line and 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.329
 then one or two ravier is good on 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.549
 will test it 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:12.829
 I'll get a re Persia is 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.000
 so with clerfayt in my opinion she 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.000
 is extremely expensive 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.820
 renounces and a small harbor reads 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.370
 will watch if it does not go too bad 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.990
 but anyway I think it's okay 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.870
 to be much simpler women this 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.070
 kind of say m I think about the veil of ink 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.940
 but there are others who are really 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:42.930
 a woman while he's very father fire 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.930
 the parrot stop jumped 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.820
 I tested the judgment father to provide 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:57.000
 So here we are, this system 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.410
 really cool especially for some 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.570
 resources also they do not cost 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:05.340
 nothing that can be exchanged for 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.900
 nuggets which will allow you to make 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.750
 kamas with resources that must only 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.550
 nothing before and that's really cool 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.820
 good here is a time we spend the 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.800
 delighted to pity the delight would have passed on 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.600
 would have had a I quite okay 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.600
 for the 32 street we pass on 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.870
 after it needs spam is stopped at the right 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.390
 moment because just now I know 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.650
 not but I grabbed a 10 10 10 and bah 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:39.060
 i continued dfm like a puppet game 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.980
 strong and the g and why not you 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.500
 propose a series also at this level 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.630
 where I try handmade facts I 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.500
 almost perfect just with orders 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:54.060
 like that they miss max case to me 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:57.120
 to tell with the orbs some 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.630
 latencies where he goes I'm not disgusting 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.920
 just before me anyway 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.420
 now when you orange and kraft 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.190
 completely rotten you will 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.440
 really remedy that moment you're scolding 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.760
 on an exo also a game I know 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.930
 that there are some times they received a 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.930
 example totally destroy it 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:21.240
 could repair your items without it 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.620
 costs us millions good I think 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.420
 you understand the principle so we have 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.780
 for a new update 2.30 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.700
 I can not wait for her to arrive on the 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.389
 the official lefebvre which amply so 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.389
 September 1st 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.650
 I forgot something ah yes and I 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.450
 wanted anyway we insult or by the 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.400
 badly often from ankama who are often in 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.890
 delay in any case he is really the one 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.920
 at 2.30 for September and she is going out on 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:50.020
 September 1st so that's rather than 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.720
 are they going to change lenses to 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.580
 this level is really trying to 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.520
 much better rely on deadlines in 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.770
 Anyway I hope for us so that's it 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.330
 we can still congratulate them for 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.350
 to be on time for this update I 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.620
 believe it had not happened since 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.910
 very very long so the ball I 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.910
 believe I went around this time 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.080
 so here I 'll leave you there and I 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.650
 will you see you soon for new 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.650
 videos
