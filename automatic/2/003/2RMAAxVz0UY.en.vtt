up<00:00:05.400> is<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.700> pendulum<00:00:06.210> which<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> great<00:00:07.080> way

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
up is the pendulum which is a great way

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.080 
up is the pendulum which is a great way
to<00:00:07.290> get<00:00:07.500> used<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.950> concept<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.550> arcs<00:00:08.940> as

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
to get used to the concept of arcs as

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.289 
well as slow in and slow out first draw
a<00:00:12.210> ball<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> string<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.860> frame<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.519> draw<00:00:15.240> it

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
a ball on a string for frame to draw it

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.630 
a ball on a string for frame to draw it
swung<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> side<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.500> make<00:00:17.010> sure<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
swung to the side and make sure that the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.370 
swung to the side and make sure that the
length<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> string<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.539> kept<00:00:18.960> consistent

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
length of the string is kept consistent

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.340 
length of the string is kept consistent
for<00:00:20.340> frame<00:00:20.580> three<00:00:20.970> draw<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.720> swung<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
for frame three draw it swung in the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.920 
for frame three draw it swung in the
opposite<00:00:22.949> direction<00:00:23.119> now<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.180> have<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> basic

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
opposite direction now we have a basic

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.750 
opposite direction now we have a basic
loop<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.859> smooth<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.099> out<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.609> add

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
loop and to smooth it out we can add

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.509 
loop and to smooth it out we can add
some<00:00:26.970> in-between<00:00:27.480> frames<00:00:27.689> if<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.220> two

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
some in-between frames if we do two

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.470 
some in-between frames if we do two
in-betweens

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
in-betweens

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.510 
in-betweens
you<00:00:31.019> might<00:00:31.230> expect<00:00:31.650> them<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.949> have<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> ball

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you might expect them to have the ball

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.400 
you might expect them to have the ball
right<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> middle<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.510> its<00:00:33.690> position<00:00:34.230> in

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
right in the middle of its position in

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.770 
right in the middle of its position in
the<00:00:34.469> frames<00:00:35.010> around<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.180> when<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the frames around it but when we do it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.290 
the frames around it but when we do it
this<00:00:36.809> way<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.710> movement<00:00:38.129> seems<00:00:38.460> unnatural

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
this way the movement seems unnatural

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.990 
this way the movement seems unnatural
that's<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.860> ball<00:00:41.040> has<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.489> slow<00:00:41.700> down

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that's because the ball has to slow down

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.600 
that's because the ball has to slow down
before<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.809> changes<00:00:43.170> direction<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.890> when<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
before it changes direction and when it

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.430 
before it changes direction and when it
does<00:00:44.789> turn<00:00:45.090> around<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.629> will<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.140> slow

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
does turn around it will be going slow

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.340 
does turn around it will be going slow
at<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.879> principle<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.539> animation<00:00:48.780> is

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
at first this principle of animation is

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.430 
at first this principle of animation is
known<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.160> slow<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.879> slow<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.239> or<00:00:51.629> ease<00:00:52.199> in

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
known as slow in and slow out or ease in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.310 
known as slow in and slow out or ease in
and<00:00:52.680> ease<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:53.309> by<00:00:54.149> keeping<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.809> mind<00:00:54.840> our

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and ease out by keeping this in mind our

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
and ease out by keeping this in mind our
animations<00:00:56.070> will<00:00:56.250> look<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.460> lot<00:00:56.640> more

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
animations will look a lot more

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.599 
animations will look a lot more
believable<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:58.829> take<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> step<00:00:59.550> further

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
believable to take this a step further

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.060 
believable to take this a step further
we<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.449> add<00:01:00.570> another<00:01:00.690> pendulum<00:01:01.410> attached<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
we can add another pendulum attached to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
we can add another pendulum attached to
this<00:01:02.190> pendulum<00:01:02.609> what's<00:01:03.449> important<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> keep

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
this pendulum what's important to keep

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.770 
this pendulum what's important to keep
in<00:01:04.140> mind<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> rule<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.339> secondary<00:01:06.299> action

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
in mind is the rule of secondary action

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.179 
in mind is the rule of secondary action
that<00:01:07.020> means<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> second<00:01:07.890> pendulum

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
that means that the second pendulum

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.760 
that means that the second pendulum
won't<00:01:08.820> start<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.479> change<00:01:09.689> direction<00:01:10.320> until<00:01:10.710> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
won't start to change direction until it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.500 
won't start to change direction until it
starts<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> get<00:01:11.490> pulled<00:01:11.790> by<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> first

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
starts to get pulled by the first

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
starts to get pulled by the first
pendulum<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.409> principle<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.010> also<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.460> used

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
pendulum this principle can also be used

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.969 
pendulum this principle can also be used
when<00:01:14.880> animating<00:01:15.390> flowing<00:01:15.750> clothing<00:01:16.200> hair<00:01:16.680> or

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
when animating flowing clothing hair or

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.550 
when animating flowing clothing hair or
other<00:01:17.580> loosely<00:01:18.060> attached<00:01:18.330> objects<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.229> next

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
other loosely attached objects the next

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
other loosely attached objects the next
exercise<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.340> bouncing<00:01:20.850> ball<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.659> will

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
exercise is the bouncing ball which will

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.690 
exercise is the bouncing ball which will
help<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> explain<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> concept<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.250> squash

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
help to explain the concept of squash

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.850 
help to explain the concept of squash
and<00:01:23.729> stretch<00:01:24.150> start<00:01:25.080> by<00:01:25.229> drawing<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> ball

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
and stretch start by drawing the ball

and stretch start by drawing the ball
and<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> floor<00:01:26.610> as<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.330> talked<00:01:27.570> about<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and the floor as we talked about in the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080 
and the floor as we talked about in the
last<00:01:28.140> exercise<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.250> ball<00:01:29.460> will<00:01:29.640> start<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
last exercise the ball will start to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.450 
last exercise the ball will start to
fall<00:01:30.270> slowly<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.960> gradually<00:01:31.350> speed<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.009> as<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
fall slowly and gradually speed up as it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.300 
fall slowly and gradually speed up as it
goes<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:33.140> falling<00:01:34.140> object<00:01:34.259> won't<00:01:34.770> slow<00:01:35.100> down

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
goes a falling object won't slow down

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.100 
goes a falling object won't slow down
before<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.820> hits<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> ground<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:36.990> it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
before it hits the ground but if it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.440 
before it hits the ground but if it
bounces<00:01:37.530> upwards<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.340> will<00:01:38.729> gradually<00:01:39.000> slow

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
bounces upwards it will gradually slow

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630 
bounces upwards it will gradually slow
to<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.689> stop<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.229> turn<00:01:40.560> around<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.130> gravity

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
to a stop and turn around as gravity

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.340 
to a stop and turn around as gravity
works<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> decent

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
works on it now we have a decent

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
works on it now we have a decent
bouncing<00:01:43.860> ball<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.909> improve<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.450> with

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
bouncing ball but we can improve it with

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840 
bouncing ball but we can improve it with
some<00:01:45.810> squash<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.320> stretch<00:01:46.530> when<00:01:47.369> an<00:01:47.460> object

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
some squash and stretch when an object

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.550 
some squash and stretch when an object
starts<00:01:48.149> moving<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.720> fast<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.380> one

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
starts moving really fast in one

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.469 
starts moving really fast in one
direction<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.189> will<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.610> stretched<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.210> in

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
direction it will get stretched out in

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.690 
direction it will get stretched out in
that<00:01:51.659> direction<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.380> keep<00:01:52.950> its<00:01:53.130> overall<00:01:53.399> mass

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that direction to keep its overall mass

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.940 
that direction to keep its overall mass
the<00:01:53.909> same<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.390> also<00:01:54.630> gets<00:01:55.079> squashed<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the same it also gets squashed in the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.859 
the same it also gets squashed in the
perpendicular<00:01:56.790> direction<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> ball

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
perpendicular direction when the ball

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.080 
perpendicular direction when the ball
hits<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> ground<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.950> can't<00:01:59.310> keep<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.850> down

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
hits the ground it can't keep going down

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.660 
hits the ground it can't keep going down
but<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.659> still<00:02:00.930> wants<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> move<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.189> result

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
but it still wants to move as a result

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.030 
but it still wants to move as a result
each<00:02:03.000> side<00:02:03.450> starts<00:02:03.899> moving<00:02:04.229> sideways<00:02:04.710> until

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
each side starts moving sideways until

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550 
each side starts moving sideways until
the<00:02:05.430> elasticity<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> ball<00:02:06.780> pulls<00:02:07.290> itself

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the elasticity of the ball pulls itself

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
the elasticity of the ball pulls itself
back<00:02:07.829> together<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.640> bounces<00:02:09.000> back<00:02:09.179> up

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
back together and it bounces back up

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.449 
back together and it bounces back up
now<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.349> bouncing<00:02:10.770> ball<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.220> looks<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
now we have a bouncing ball that looks a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.809 
now we have a bouncing ball that looks a
lot<00:02:11.640> more<00:02:11.849> lifelike

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.750 

our<00:02:15.599> third<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.200> final<00:02:16.409> exercise<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.549> walk

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
our third and final exercise is the walk

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.819 
our third and final exercise is the walk
cycle<00:02:18.030> which<00:02:18.780> as<00:02:18.989> an<00:02:19.170> animator<00:02:19.560> you'll

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
cycle which as an animator you'll

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.610 
cycle which as an animator you'll
probably<00:02:20.069> be<00:02:20.459> using<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.909> lot<00:02:21.290> there<00:02:22.290> are<00:02:22.439> four

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
probably be using a lot there are four

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.949 
probably be using a lot there are four
basic<00:02:22.890> poses<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> walk<00:02:23.969> cycle<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.540> we'll

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
basic poses to a walk cycle and we'll

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.080 
basic poses to a walk cycle and we'll
start<00:02:25.200> with<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.439> contact<00:02:25.890> pose<00:02:26.099> this<00:02:26.909> is

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
start with the contact pose this is

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.789 
start with the contact pose this is
where<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.390> feet<00:02:27.599> are<00:02:27.810> farthest<00:02:28.260> apart<00:02:28.379> and

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
where the feet are farthest apart and

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.220 
where the feet are farthest apart and
both<00:02:29.099> legs<00:02:29.430> are<00:02:29.670> straight<00:02:29.700> do<00:02:30.689> one<00:02:30.900> for<00:02:31.109> each

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
both legs are straight do one for each

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.039 
both legs are straight do one for each
side<00:02:31.609> now<00:02:32.609> in<00:02:32.939> between<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.420> contact<00:02:33.870> pose

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
side now in between the contact pose

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.589 
side now in between the contact pose
draw<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> passing<00:02:35.129> pose<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.150> where<00:02:36.359> one

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
draw a passing pose this is where one

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.599 
draw a passing pose this is where one
leg<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.049> perfectly<00:02:37.439> vertical<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.459> other

is<00:02:38.819> passing<00:02:39.000> by<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.450> as<00:02:39.689> it<00:02:39.810> moves<00:02:39.989> forward

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
is passing by it as it moves forward

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.280 
is passing by it as it moves forward
also<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.730> body<00:02:41.939> is<00:02:42.120> slightly<00:02:42.450> higher<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.139> this

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
also the body is slightly higher in this

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.580 
also the body is slightly higher in this
pose<00:02:43.560> than<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.159> in<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.400> contact<00:02:44.849> pose<00:02:45.030> in

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
between the contact and passing poses

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.349 
between the contact and passing poses
are<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.840> up<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.200> down<00:02:49.409> poses<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.790> down<00:02:51.030> pose

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
are the up and down poses the down pose

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.179 
are the up and down poses the down pose
is<00:02:51.659> when<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.930> body<00:02:52.109> is<00:02:52.260> at<00:02:52.470> its<00:02:52.590> lowest<00:02:52.829> and

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
is when the body is at its lowest and

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.339 
is when the body is at its lowest and
has<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.609> rear<00:02:53.819> leg<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.659> starting<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.109> move

has the rear leg just starting to move

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.460 
has the rear leg just starting to move
forward<00:02:55.829> after<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.340> contact<00:02:56.700> pose<00:02:57.349> after<00:02:58.349> the

passing pose is the up pose where the
body<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.049> at<00:03:01.230> its<00:03:01.379> highest<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:02.519> comes<00:03:02.819> just

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
body is at its highest this comes just

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.780 
body is at its highest this comes just
before<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.629> leg<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.019> put<00:03:04.260> down<00:03:04.579> draw<00:03:05.579> these

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
before the leg is put down draw these

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.059 
before the leg is put down draw these
four<00:03:06.060> poses<00:03:06.510> for<00:03:06.720> each<00:03:06.870> side<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.530> now<00:03:08.040> you

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
four poses for each side and now you

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.810 
four poses for each side and now you
have<00:03:08.370> an<00:03:08.489> eighth<00:03:08.669> frame<00:03:09.030> walk<00:03:09.299> cycle
