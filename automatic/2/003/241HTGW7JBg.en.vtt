00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.140 
best which lost was the most
disappointing<00:03:02.770> in<00:03:03.040> his<00:03:03.160> top<00:03:03.370> 6<00:03:03.580> 12<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:03.970> know

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
disappointing in his top 6 12 you know

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.680 
disappointing in his top 6 12 you know
maybe<00:03:04.330> can<00:03:04.950> do<00:03:05.950> way<00:03:06.220> because<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:07.390> was<00:03:07.570> the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
maybe can do way because it was the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.650 
maybe can do way because it was the
second<00:03:08.080> game<00:03:08.400> with<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.580> maybe<00:03:10.120> when<00:03:10.420> we

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
second game with that maybe when we

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.960 
second game with that maybe when we
could<00:03:10.840> be<00:03:11.320> psychologically<00:03:12.190> much<00:03:12.760> more

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
could be psychologically much more

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.270 
could be psychologically much more
positive<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:14.910> maybe<00:03:15.910> we<00:03:16.150> could<00:03:16.390> hang<00:03:16.540> too<00:03:17.280> big

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
positive and maybe we could hang too big

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.310 
positive and maybe we could hang too big
maybe<00:03:18.490> Barcelona<00:03:19.390> here<00:03:19.690> with<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:20.020> when<00:03:20.200> I

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
maybe Barcelona here with that when I

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.480 
maybe Barcelona here with that when I
