do some work right there so huge damage
and<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> proc<00:01:24.030> focus<00:01:24.509> sash

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
and that's going to proc focus sash

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.679 
and that's going to proc focus sash
right<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.729> last<00:01:26.729> resort<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> is
