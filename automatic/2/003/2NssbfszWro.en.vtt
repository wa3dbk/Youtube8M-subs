00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.160 

let's<00:00:39.239> start<00:00:39.480> with<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> recipe

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
let's start with the recipe

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.430 
let's start with the recipe
the<00:00:40.440> key<00:00:40.680> ingredient<00:00:40.969> plaster<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.090> Paris<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the key ingredient plaster of Paris this

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
the key ingredient plaster of Paris this
is<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.800> gives<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> great<00:00:44.460> matte<00:00:44.730> texture

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
is what gives it the great matte texture

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.180 
is what gives it the great matte texture
and<00:00:45.600> also<00:00:45.899> helps<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.410> adhere<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.739> almost

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and also helps it adhere to almost

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.000 
and also helps it adhere to almost
anything<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.030> makes<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.750> third<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> cup<00:00:49.200> with

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
anything so makes a third of a cup with

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.220 
anything so makes a third of a cup with
a<00:00:50.039> third<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.460> cup<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.820> cool<00:00:51.059> water<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.690> stir

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
a third of a cup of cool water and stir

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.049 
a third of a cup of cool water and stir
that<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.250> well<00:00:53.370> until<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
that up really really well until the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.060 
that up really really well until the
plaster<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> Paris<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.989> completely<00:00:55.590> dissolved

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
plaster of Paris is completely dissolved

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
plaster of Paris is completely dissolved
then<00:00:56.460> add<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> cup<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.000> paint<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.510> plain<00:00:57.930> old

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
then add a cup of paint just plain old

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.040 
then add a cup of paint just plain old
latex<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> stir<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.780> may

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
latex and stir and that's it this may

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.900 
latex and stir and that's it this may
seem<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.469> really<00:01:01.770> small<00:01:02.010> batch<00:01:02.309> but

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
seem like a really small batch but

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.429 
seem like a really small batch but
you'll<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.210> amazed<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.809> how<00:01:03.840> far<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> will<00:01:04.379> go

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
you'll be amazed at how far it will go

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.300 
you'll be amazed at how far it will go
okay<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.760> think<00:01:06.090> we're<00:01:06.210> ready<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> paint<00:01:07.310> this

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
okay I think we're ready to paint this

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
okay I think we're ready to paint this
isn't<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:08.850> getting<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.210> completely<00:01:09.689> smooth

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
isn't about getting a completely smooth

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.690 
isn't about getting a completely smooth
finish<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.920> would<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> glossy

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
finish like you would with a glossy

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.300 
finish like you would with a glossy
latex<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:12.450> oil-based<00:01:12.510> paint<00:01:13.350> you're<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
latex or oil-based paint you're going to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.800 
latex or oil-based paint you're going to
see<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:14.700> brushstrokes<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.420> you're<00:01:15.720> gonna

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
see some brushstrokes and you're gonna

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.620 
see some brushstrokes and you're gonna
see<00:01:16.140> some<00:01:16.350> texture<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> finish<00:01:17.479> this<00:01:18.479> is

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
see some texture in the finish this is

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.020 
see some texture in the finish this is
why<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.990> love<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.619> stuff<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.310> didn't<00:01:20.790> even<00:01:20.909> have

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
why I love this stuff I didn't even have

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
why I love this stuff I didn't even have
to<00:01:21.180> sand<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.049> watch<00:01:22.290> how<00:01:22.500> easily<00:01:22.770> it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
to sand this and watch how easily it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:33.820 
to sand this and watch how easily it
covers

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.860 

because<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.910> paint<00:01:35.150> does<00:01:35.360> have<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.630> more

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
because the paint does have a more

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.870 
because the paint does have a more
brittle<00:01:36.110> finish<00:01:36.620> you<00:01:37.160> really<00:01:37.490> want<00:01:37.700> to

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
brittle finish you really want to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.060 
brittle finish you really want to
protect<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.420> from<00:01:38.510> wear<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.960> tear<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:39.830> can

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
protect it from wear and tear so you can

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.670 
protect it from wear and tear so you can
either<00:01:40.220> use<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.670> spray<00:01:41.030> poly<00:01:41.330> or<00:01:41.660> a<00:01:41.930> wipe<00:01:42.230> on<00:01:42.380> wax

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
either use a spray poly or a wipe on wax

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.550 
either use a spray poly or a wipe on wax
this<00:01:43.670> step<00:01:43.970> help<00:01:44.450> seal<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.870> finish<00:01:45.380> and

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
this step help seal the finish and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.300 
this step help seal the finish and
protect<00:01:45.980> the<00:01:46.130> paint<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.740> do<00:01:48.920> just<00:01:49.130> one

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
protect the paint you can do just one

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.190 
protect the paint you can do just one
color<00:01:49.580> or<00:01:49.850> if<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.150> really<00:01:50.540> want<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:50.840> aged

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
color or if you really want that aged

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.740 
color or if you really want that aged
worn<00:01:51.740> patina<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.880> could<00:01:53.060> layer<00:01:53.270> colors

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
worn patina you could layer colors

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.750 
worn patina you could layer colors
creating<00:01:54.290> more<00:01:54.560> depth<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.100> interest

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
creating more depth and interest

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.090 
creating more depth and interest
I<00:01:55.790> love<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.600> raised<00:01:56.810> patterns<00:01:57.410> on<00:01:57.650> this<00:01:57.770> frame

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
I love the raised patterns on this frame

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.910 
I love the raised patterns on this frame
and<00:01:58.400> by<00:01:58.790> adding<00:01:59.000> almost<00:01:59.570> a<00:01:59.750> wash<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.470> paint

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
and by adding almost a wash of the paint

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.680 
and by adding almost a wash of the paint
it's<00:02:01.460> really<00:02:01.730> going<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.970> highlight<00:02:02.300> all<00:02:02.360> that

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
it's really going to highlight all that

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.470 
it's really going to highlight all that
beautiful<00:02:03.290> detail<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:04.000> because<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.180> paint

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480
