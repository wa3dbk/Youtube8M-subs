six in north and south boston so I've

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.400 
six in north and south boston so I've
done<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.399> few<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.000> looking<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.079> map<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
done a few but looking at this map I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.500 
done a few but looking at this map I
haven't<00:00:40.649> done<00:00:40.770> any<00:00:40.920> yet<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.969> unfortunately

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
haven't done any yet and unfortunately

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.030 
haven't done any yet and unfortunately
only<00:00:42.600> five<00:00:42.870> markers<00:00:43.290> popped<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.829> map

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
only five markers popped up on the map

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.229 
only five markers popped up on the map
so<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.250> had<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.670> seek<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> other

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
Northeast and this is another fog

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
Northeast and this is another fog
machine<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> dude<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.280> red<00:01:17.490> dot

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
machine so the dude with the red dot

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.039 
machine so the dude with the red dot
you've<00:01:17.939> got<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> kill<00:01:18.299> before<00:01:18.509> he<00:01:18.750> runs<00:01:18.869> away

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
you've got to kill before he runs away

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.600 
you've got to kill before he runs away
and<00:01:19.350> you've<00:01:19.590> got<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> fight<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.220> guys<00:01:20.430> and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
and you've got a fight we all guys and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
and you've got a fight we all guys and
it's<00:01:21.210> weird<00:01:21.479> because<00:01:21.720> there's<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.500> blue

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it's weird because there's like the blue

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.320 
it's weird because there's like the blue
codes<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.130> joined<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.520> against<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:24.090> but

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
codes have joined in against them but

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.520 
codes have joined in against them but
they<00:01:24.420> fight<00:01:24.659> me<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:24.930> well<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
they fight me as well so it's like a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.270 
they fight me as well so it's like a
three-way<00:01:25.830> battle<00:01:25.979> anyway<00:01:28.070> it's<00:01:29.070> always

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
the only way to see the level it's a

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.909 
the only way to see the level it's a

little level two and a level zero when

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.320 
little level two and a level zero when
you<00:05:59.009> send<00:05:59.219> them<00:05:59.310> off<00:05:59.400> it<00:05:59.610> will<00:05:59.729> take<00:05:59.940> you<00:06:00.210> know

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
you send them off it will take you know

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.430 
you send them off it will take you know
two<00:06:00.509> minutes<00:06:00.659> five<00:06:00.900> minutes<00:06:00.930> eight<00:06:01.409> minutes

difficulties<00:06:04.259> now<00:06:04.560> once<00:06:04.770> you<00:06:04.889> free<00:06:05.159> the<00:06:05.279> zone

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
difficulties now once you free the zone

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.519

and<00:06:05.639> it<00:06:05.699> goes<00:06:05.849> blue<00:06:06.210> it<00:06:06.479> will<00:06:06.629> help<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.199> boost

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:07.529 
and it goes blue it will help and boost

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:09.619

the<00:06:07.710> success<00:06:08.069> rate<00:06:08.279> of<00:06:08.310> other<00:06:08.580> zones<00:06:08.849> so<00:06:09.569> I

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:09.629 
the success rate of other zones so I

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:11.059 
the success rate of other zones so I
find<00:06:09.840> it<00:06:09.900> best<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.139> work<00:06:10.379> from<00:06:10.560> the<00:06:10.680> top<00:06:10.710> and
