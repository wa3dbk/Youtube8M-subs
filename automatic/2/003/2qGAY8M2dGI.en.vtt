beside<00:00:18.800> that<00:00:18.830> network<00:00:19.520> connection<00:00:20.270> which<00:00:21.260> we

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
beside that network connection which we

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.260 
beside that network connection which we
will<00:00:21.890> occasionally<00:00:22.310> use<00:00:22.430> to<00:00:22.730> connect<00:00:22.970> to<00:00:23.119> the

directly at home beside that we have the
power<00:00:31.750> connection<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.020> we<00:00:33.110> suggest<00:00:33.500> that<00:00:33.590> you

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
power connection and we suggest that you

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.640 
power connection and we suggest that you
keep<00:00:34.040> that<00:00:34.480> connected<00:00:35.480> at<00:00:35.600> home<00:00:35.840> to<00:00:36.530> ensure

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
keep that connected at home to ensure

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.680 
keep that connected at home to ensure
that<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:37.130> battery<00:00:37.520> is<00:00:37.550> always<00:00:37.850> fully<00:00:38.239> charged

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
that the battery is always fully charged

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.530 
that the battery is always fully charged
when<00:00:38.840> you<00:00:38.930> bring<00:00:39.079> it<00:00:39.230> to<00:00:39.320> school<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:41.450> the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
when you bring it to school and the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.639 
when you bring it to school and the
opposite<00:00:41.899> side<00:00:41.960> we<00:00:43.180> have<00:00:44.180> VGA<00:00:44.660> outlet<00:00:45.350> here<00:00:45.530> in

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
opposite side we have VGA outlet here in

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.950 
opposite side we have VGA outlet here in
the<00:00:45.739> corner<00:00:46.129> which<00:00:47.090> will<00:00:47.239> be<00:00:47.359> very<00:00:47.539> useful<00:00:47.600> at

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
the corner which will be very useful at

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.689 
the corner which will be very useful at
home<00:00:48.140> to<00:00:48.289> connect<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:48.800> an<00:00:48.920> external<00:00:49.519> monitor

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
home to connect to an external monitor

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.369 
home to connect to an external monitor
which<00:00:50.510> would<00:00:50.690> give<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:50.930> a<00:00:50.960> much<00:00:51.140> bigger

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
which would give you a much bigger

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.869 
which would give you a much bigger
screen<00:00:51.789> using<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:52.879> laptop<00:00:54.280> we<00:00:55.280> then<00:00:55.460> have<00:00:55.670> the

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
screen using the laptop we then have the

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.299 
screen using the laptop we then have the
fan<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.420> it's<00:00:57.320> very<00:00:57.530> important<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.010> this<00:00:58.160> is

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
fan and it's very important that this is

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.029 
fan and it's very important that this is
never<00:00:58.460> covered<00:00:58.910> at<00:00:59.030> any<00:00:59.179> stage<00:00:59.510> as<00:00:59.780> that<00:01:00.379> may

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
never covered at any stage as that may

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.549 
never covered at any stage as that may
cause<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.519> processor<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.539> overheat<00:01:02.960> with

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
cause the processor to overheat with

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.400 
cause the processor to overheat with
dire<00:01:03.739> consequences<00:01:04.930> beside<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.200> third

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
dire consequences beside that the third

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.960 
dire consequences beside that the third
USB<00:01:07.010> outlet<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.470> these<00:01:09.470> USB<00:01:10.070> outlets<00:01:10.760> could

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
USB outlet and these USB outlets could

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.030 
USB outlet and these USB outlets could
be<00:01:11.120> used<00:01:11.360> for<00:01:11.810> an<00:01:11.870> external<00:01:12.350> keyboard<00:01:12.500> and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040
