00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
talk about how to write a cookbook I

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.490 
talk about how to write a cookbook I
think<00:00:08.130> it's<00:00:08.250> really<00:00:08.519> important<00:00:09.500> especially

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
think it's really important especially

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.070 
think it's really important especially
if<00:00:10.950> you're<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.130> cook<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.639> might<00:00:11.849> be<00:00:12.630> tempted<00:00:12.870> to

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
if you're a cook you might be tempted to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.499 
if you're a cook you might be tempted to
include<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.710> lot<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.040> different<00:00:14.639> kinds<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.269> food

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
include a lot of different kinds of food

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.970 
include a lot of different kinds of food
but<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.780> think<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.199> really<00:00:16.350> important<00:00:16.859> if

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
but I think it's really important if

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.730 
but I think it's really important if
you're<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> write<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> cookbook<00:00:17.910> to

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
you're going to write a cookbook to

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.859 
you're going to write a cookbook to
narrow<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.980> little<00:00:20.160> bit<00:00:20.369> focus<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> food

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
narrow it a little bit focus on a food

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.179 
narrow it a little bit focus on a food
that<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.080> think<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.590> be<00:00:22.650> appealing

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
that you think is going to be appealing

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.070 
that you think is going to be appealing
to<00:00:23.369> an<00:00:23.460> audience<00:00:24.410> for<00:00:25.410> example<00:00:25.800> salsas<00:00:26.310> or

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
to an audience for example salsas or

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.109 
to an audience for example salsas or
30-minute<00:00:28.080> meals<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.830> opposed<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
30-minute meals as opposed to just a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.010 
30-minute meals as opposed to just a
bunch<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.390> good<00:00:30.539> food<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:33.300> pick<00:00:33.660> your<00:00:33.690> topic

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
bunch of good food so pick your topic

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.750 
bunch of good food so pick your topic
and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:34.860> focus<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.430> little<00:00:35.640> bit

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and then really focus in a little bit

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.819 
and then really focus in a little bit
and<00:00:35.969> really<00:00:36.239> create<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> range<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.380> recipes

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and really create a range of recipes

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.389 
and really create a range of recipes
that<00:00:37.860> fit<00:00:38.219> within<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.550> topic<00:00:39.559> now<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:41.100> far<00:00:41.340> as

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
that fit within that topic now as far as

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.799 
that fit within that topic now as far as
writing<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.940> cookbook<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.360> think<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.660> really

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
writing a cookbook I think it's really

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.170 
writing a cookbook I think it's really
important<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> cook<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.559> lot<00:00:43.910> you<00:00:44.910> might<00:00:45.059> need

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
important to cook a lot you might need

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.080 
important to cook a lot you might need
to<00:00:45.239> cook<00:00:45.570> each<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.200> recipes<00:00:46.430> five<00:00:47.430> six
