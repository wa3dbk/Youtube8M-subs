00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
are glitter glues and as you can see if

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.559 
are glitter glues and as you can see if
you<00:03:33.629> are<00:03:33.659> doing<00:03:34.609> something<00:03:35.609> as<00:03:35.760> detailed<00:03:36.299> as

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
you are doing something as detailed as

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:43.699 
you are doing something as detailed as
letters<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:39.090> may<00:03:40.049> not<00:03:40.260> come<00:03:40.560> off<00:03:40.769> as<00:03:41.040> well<00:03:42.709> as

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
letters it may not come off as well as

letters it may not come off as well as
the<00:03:44.069> markers<00:03:44.549> do<00:03:44.849> also<00:03:45.449> you<00:03:47.060> avoid<00:03:48.060> any<00:03:48.299> type

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
the markers do also you avoid any type

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.569 
the markers do also you avoid any type
of<00:03:48.659> smearing<00:03:49.199> as<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.620> see<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:49.799> did<00:03:50.069> not<00:03:50.099> let

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
of smearing as you can see I did not let

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.270 
of smearing as you can see I did not let
that<00:03:50.849> glitter<00:03:51.120> glue<00:03:51.449> sit<00:03:52.379> for<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.680> while<00:03:52.829> and<00:03:52.889> I

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
that glitter glue sit for a while and I

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.629 
that glitter glue sit for a while and I
smeared<00:03:54.060> all<00:03:54.329> of<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.690> glitter<00:03:55.400> glue<00:03:56.400> all

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
smeared all of that glitter glue all

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.539 
smeared all of that glitter glue all
over<00:03:56.900> some<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.199> are<00:03:58.319> also<00:03:58.530> familiar<00:03:58.889> with

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
over some of you are also familiar with

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.449 
over some of you are also familiar with
the<00:04:00.239> glitter<00:04:00.870> pens<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.650> have<00:04:01.889> here<00:04:02.220> at<00:04:02.310> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the glitter pens I have here at the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.879 
the glitter pens I have here at the
unabomber<00:04:03.949> glitter<00:04:04.949> pen<00:04:06.470> I'm<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:07.769> gonna

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
unabomber glitter pen I'm just gonna

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.189 
unabomber glitter pen I'm just gonna
hopefully<00:04:08.519> you<00:04:08.729> guys<00:04:08.819> can<00:04:08.879> see<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.419> but<00:04:10.109> I'm

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
hopefully you guys can see this but I'm

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.409 
hopefully you guys can see this but I'm
just<00:04:10.319> gonna<00:04:10.439> color<00:04:10.859> in<00:04:11.159> that<00:04:11.189> letter<00:04:11.849> as<00:04:12.120> well

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
just gonna color in that letter as well

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.390 
just gonna color in that letter as well
so<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.049> can<00:04:13.169> definitely<00:04:13.620> do<00:04:13.829> this<00:04:13.859> with<00:04:14.250> the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
so you can definitely do this with the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.770 
so you can definitely do this with the
pen<00:04:15.650> but<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:17.190> pen<00:04:17.519> does<00:04:17.970> have<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.299> little<00:04:18.630> bit

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
pen but the pen does have a little bit

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.890 
pen but the pen does have a little bit
of<00:04:19.049> glue<00:04:19.349> on<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:20.669> will<00:04:21.030> have<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.659> wait

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
of glue on it so you will have to wait

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.379 
of glue on it so you will have to wait
but<00:04:22.380> pretty<00:04:22.680> much<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:23.279> is<00:04:23.340> essentially<00:04:24.150> what

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
but pretty much this is essentially what

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.140 
but pretty much this is essentially what
I<00:04:24.419> was<00:04:24.960> doing<00:04:25.320> with<00:04:25.469> the<00:04:25.620> markers

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
I was doing with the markers

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.930 
I was doing with the markers
a<00:04:27.210> little<00:04:27.720> bit<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.169> glitter<00:04:28.610> so<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.669> have

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
a little bit of that glitter so I have

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.260 
a little bit of that glitter so I have
to<00:04:30.090> let<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.509> sit<00:04:31.350> before<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:32.190> can<00:04:32.820> do<00:04:33.000> anything

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
to let that sit before I can do anything

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.900 
to let that sit before I can do anything
else<00:04:33.630> with<00:04:33.930> it

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
else with it

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.710 
else with it
but<00:04:35.910> that<00:04:36.150> is<00:04:36.449> the<00:04:36.479> difference<00:04:37.050> between<00:04:38.720> that

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
but that is the difference between that

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.450 
but that is the difference between that
wink<00:04:39.990> of<00:04:40.139> Stella<00:04:40.550> also<00:04:41.550> what<00:04:41.729> you<00:04:41.820> can<00:04:42.060> do<00:04:42.360> is

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
wink of Stella also what you can do is

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.810 
wink of Stella also what you can do is
if<00:04:44.460> you're<00:04:44.789> familiar<00:04:45.449> with<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:46.639> wink<00:04:47.639> of

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
if you're familiar with the wink of

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.499 
if you're familiar with the wink of
Stella<00:04:48.180> brush<00:04:49.430> which<00:04:50.430> looks<00:04:50.729> like<00:04:50.789> this<00:04:51.120> it's

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
Stella brush which looks like this it's

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.439 
Stella brush which looks like this it's
very<00:04:51.900> similar<00:04:52.259> but<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.280> has<00:04:53.430> that<00:04:53.729> brush<00:04:54.060> point

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
very similar but it has that brush point

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.129 
very similar but it has that brush point
to<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:56.210> but<00:04:57.210> it's<00:04:57.419> pretty<00:04:57.630> much<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.990> same

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
to it but it's pretty much the same

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.790 
to it but it's pretty much the same
concept<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.740> has<00:04:59.180> that<00:05:00.180> shimmer<00:05:00.539> but<00:05:01.320> as<00:05:01.620> you

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
concept it has that shimmer but as you

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.529 
concept it has that shimmer but as you
can<00:05:01.979> see<00:05:02.190> if<00:05:02.340> I<00:05:02.520> were<00:05:02.669> to<00:05:02.850> do<00:05:03.000> that<00:05:03.030> with<00:05:03.389> the

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
can see if I were to do that with the

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.540 
can see if I were to do that with the
brush<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:04.020> can<00:05:04.229> probably<00:05:04.590> get<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.039> it<00:05:05.280> but<00:05:05.460> you

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
brush you can probably get to it but you

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.330 
brush you can probably get to it but you
couldn't<00:05:05.970> be<00:05:06.180> as<00:05:06.330> detailed<00:05:06.840> as<00:05:07.020> if<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:08.010> had

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
couldn't be as detailed as if you had

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:17.240 
couldn't be as detailed as if you had
the<00:05:08.910> markers<00:05:15.289> so<00:05:16.289> it<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.860> water-based

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
the markers so it is a water-based

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.719 
the markers so it is a water-based
pigment<00:05:18.090> ink<00:05:18.650> which<00:05:19.650> is<00:05:19.680> again<00:05:20.099> great<00:05:20.430> for

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
pigment ink which is again great for

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.850 
pigment ink which is again great for
journaling<00:05:21.570> as<00:05:21.720> well<00:05:22.020> let<00:05:22.229> me<00:05:22.260> just<00:05:22.470> see<00:05:22.680> the

out<00:05:43.349> here<00:05:43.409> so<00:05:43.800> you<00:05:43.889> can<00:05:44.039> see<00:05:44.310> that<00:05:50.060> but<00:05:51.060> that's

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
out here so you can see that but that's

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.810 
out here so you can see that but that's
what<00:05:51.780> that<00:05:51.990> looks<00:05:52.289> like<00:05:52.409> there<00:05:53.070> I'm<00:05:53.430> not<00:05:53.580> sure

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
what that looks like there I'm not sure

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.200 
what that looks like there I'm not sure
if<00:05:54.060> again<00:05:54.750> I<00:05:54.780> will<00:05:55.080> pick<00:05:55.320> up<00:05:55.590> on<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.849> shimmer

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
if again I will pick up on the shimmer

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.990 
if again I will pick up on the shimmer
but<00:05:57.990> if<00:05:58.169> you<00:05:58.349> like<00:05:58.590> adding<00:06:00.979> hints<00:06:01.979> of<00:06:02.099> that<00:06:02.370> to

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
but if you like adding hints of that to

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.730 
but if you like adding hints of that to
your<00:06:03.120> journaling<00:06:03.630> can<00:06:03.870> definitely<00:06:04.320> do<00:06:04.560> that

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
your journaling can definitely do that

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:12.080 
your journaling can definitely do that
as<00:06:05.039> well<00:06:05.340> now<00:06:10.099> the<00:06:11.099> thing<00:06:11.430> about<00:06:11.639> this<00:06:11.820> is

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
as well now the thing about this is

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.290 
as well now the thing about this is
since<00:06:12.389> it<00:06:12.630> doesn't<00:06:12.960> have<00:06:13.680> any<00:06:14.039> glue<00:06:14.280> on<00:06:14.460> it<00:06:14.490> it

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
since it doesn't have any glue on it it

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.730 
since it doesn't have any glue on it it
does<00:06:16.139> rub<00:06:16.740> away<00:06:16.919> just<00:06:17.849> a<00:06:18.000> bit<00:06:18.210> here's<00:06:18.599> the<00:06:18.930> back

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
does rub away just a bit here's the back

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.820 
does rub away just a bit here's the back
side<00:06:20.190> so<00:06:21.030> you<00:06:21.120> can<00:06:21.210> see<00:06:21.539> this<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:22.080> new<00:06:22.590> trim

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
side so you can see this the new trim

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.610 
side so you can see this the new trim
notebook<00:06:23.159> is<00:06:23.280> about<00:06:23.550> 80<00:06:23.810> 70<00:06:24.810> gram<00:06:25.050> weight

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
notebook is about 80 70 gram weight

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.950 
notebook is about 80 70 gram weight
paper<00:06:26.150> so<00:06:27.150> you<00:06:27.240> can<00:06:27.360> see<00:06:27.479> there's<00:06:27.659> minimal

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
paper so you can see there's minimal

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.430 
paper so you can see there's minimal
shadowing<00:06:28.800> there<00:06:29.039> I<00:06:31.880> also<00:06:32.880> did<00:06:33.449> try<00:06:33.900> this<00:06:33.960> with

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
shadowing there I also did try this with

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.890 
shadowing there I also did try this with
my<00:06:34.710> Filofax<00:06:35.159> paper<00:06:36.029> if<00:06:36.389> some<00:06:36.599> of<00:06:36.719> you're

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
my Filofax paper if some of you're

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.439 
my Filofax paper if some of you're
familiar<00:06:37.110> with<00:06:37.639> polymers

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
familiar with polymers

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.749 
familiar with polymers
have<00:06:40.629> some<00:06:41.110> Filofax<00:06:41.469> paper<00:06:41.919> that<00:06:42.249> I<00:06:42.279> tried<00:06:42.610> it

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759 
have some Filofax paper that I tried it

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.179 
have some Filofax paper that I tried it
with<00:06:42.969> now<00:06:43.539> they<00:06:43.779> are<00:06:43.900> known<00:06:44.139> for<00:06:44.770> having<00:06:44.889> very

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:45.189 
with now they are known for having very

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:47.850 
with now they are known for having very
thin<00:06:45.520> paper<00:06:45.789> I<00:06:45.939> think<00:06:46.090> this<00:06:46.419> is<00:06:46.599> about<00:06:46.840> 60<00:06:47.590> gram

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
thin paper I think this is about 60 gram

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.939 
thin paper I think this is about 60 gram
white<00:06:48.099> paper<00:06:48.629> but<00:06:49.629> since<00:06:50.229> it<00:06:50.379> is<00:06:50.529> a<00:06:50.559> pigment

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:50.949 
white paper but since it is a pigment

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.879 
white paper but since it is a pigment
ink<00:06:51.279> pigment<00:06:51.819> ink<00:06:51.999> set<00:06:52.330> tends<00:06:52.689> to<00:06:53.050> stay<00:06:53.349> on<00:06:53.620> top

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889 
ink pigment ink set tends to stay on top

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.890 
ink pigment ink set tends to stay on top
of<00:06:53.919> the<00:06:54.159> paper<00:06:54.370> rather<00:06:54.669> than<00:06:54.819> sink<00:06:55.360> into<00:06:55.749> the

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
of the paper rather than sink into the

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.890 
of the paper rather than sink into the
paper<00:06:56.460> so<00:06:57.460> as<00:06:57.580> you<00:06:57.699> can<00:06:57.849> see<00:06:57.909> on<00:06:58.389> the<00:06:58.659> bleed

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
paper so as you can see on the bleed

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.659 
paper so as you can see on the bleed
through<00:06:59.110> not<00:06:59.830> much<00:07:00.129> there

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
through not much there

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.079 
through not much there
very<00:07:01.349> minimal<00:07:02.370> shadowing<00:07:03.370> so<00:07:03.639> if<00:07:03.759> you<00:07:03.909> would

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:04.089 
very minimal shadowing so if you would

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:05.760 
very minimal shadowing so if you would
like<00:07:04.330> to<00:07:04.539> use<00:07:04.689> this<00:07:04.870> in<00:07:05.080> your<00:07:05.229> planner<00:07:05.499> you
