00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 it looks like a lot of luxury is sinking from a luxury in a grave 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.230
 we stay under 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.230
 yes both the evidence delivered I hope 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:10.950
 contracted 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.559
 what is it like to act on water 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.609
 well aegon goes 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.529
 I'm assuming we stay 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.529
 of saying little but ita criticizes you 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.619
 no but it is well contractually agreed that you are not free but 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.579
 it is good i want you if you have the concept of yes yes tis too crazy 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.759
 couldn't handle anything 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.649
 the pianist they are good criticisms 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.870
 also raised with the music of a woman 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.540
 no not really yes I have the first thirteen years for becoming poor 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.280
 lived and I live with my father in six years 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.980
 Schiphol itself world 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.170
 I think we are happy with this result 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.560
 that's well I already have some I didn't think so 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.310
 no numbers from 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.570
 Friday you will find a little less developed here he says sorry it is thereby 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.410
 a very big one when the father of the bear tour started again with one 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.329
 his musicians are feeding or the dispute was over 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.989
 after reaching it regularly with him also in that period a year ago 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.039
 I then saw I had a meal and tied to a chair and 9 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.810
 people going to Cairo that week 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.630
 just the laundry except music in the house and 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.500
 this does not get me a sufficient fit just a bit of harvick 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.810
 beautiful find that beautiful 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.320
 and you can go with that, just like me, a very broad taste and so that goes one 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.600
 number of things there are they make 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 is going to lay down in law how serious the forties you can reach 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.300
 up to and including tom two years 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.710
 this is very far behind 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.800
 and everything in between the beatles did not be chuck berry previously inclined ditch 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.530
 down with all of them there are also a lot of singing 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.729
 He wanted to be but we certainly didn't happen about stock 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.770
 so also drugs and sex on rolls 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.149
 yes that goes almost entirely right 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.889
 that just can't be responsible there can be a government about gigs and 

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:56.510
 activities 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.280
 because he must have Kurdish first conversation with years before going to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 got down to real estate saying that too 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.729
 has a good idea where i believe we will go on this soon 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.959
 totally good yes this seems to me what do you do with father and son who goes music 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.130
 on the first day the lead was apparently at that moment the sacrifice 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.910
 On the same day we agreed that I would go there 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.580
 from out 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.719
 Wellink says that we are now on the same line 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.769
 take a little 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.579
 the hands that is sometimes difficult yes because I am so also want father and 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.829
 and again colleagues do know that you do 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.890
 so we can mix it up a bit 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.399
 we are now further 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.729
 we set but singing can tear up 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.500
 I also sing my own material where we do 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.190
 and we all naturally play at party cafes and have been around for years 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.219
 village festivals values ​​where there is interest 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.239
 We will soon have a lot of stennis the station Nijkerk CEO 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.829
 and never had to play again 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.609
 to have the taste of all things but this is a strong competition for 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.399
 the question concerning 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.999
 a deliberate for a break 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.279
 to develop and I now also allow the developer to write songs 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:07.859
 Jim led I write 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.819
 because bring it together and there are more working on it too 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.309
 multi-year material voting or 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:16.179
 that is a question from 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.619
 and my imac present for the development to spring for myself 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.919
 to continue to develop or also for myself it is of course also 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.739
 make a good music so he will think that he is alone 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.359
 from my musical cooperation there is a chance that he will not be a session of this 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.359
 Arnhem and since a few years been happy with your horse 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.579
 well here you can still remember do you go that day 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.509
 that's a great one 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:40.399
 rené van eck 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:41.939
 I've never had one 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.569
 she realizes how that all happened so quickly 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:44.879
 how old are you 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.039
 16 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.339
 your father once played on pinkpop 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:50.709
 because this is not done yet 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.419
 A witness said that Ramos but mostly sunny theaters come out at the end of the 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.369
 tour result pinkpop 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.079
 haha 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.659
 Belgium 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.659
 this world 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.949
 first of all 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.949
 He is 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:23.770
 in our opinion that van de lanotte 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.949
 glasses that both my wages 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.620
 now have a deep pass albarn of light inspected at that time 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.509
 the problem has changed a lot and that is just not possible to follow 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.460
 It really was a lot before because that is one of the big ones now 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.369
 that is possible as a former organon one of the big demands for was then a big one 

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:46.560
 festival netherlands hey how do you look at a couple on pinkpop 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.099
 is that the trade 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.360
 yes, that is of course something I would like to do there, say 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.080
 but yes that also not to give up 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.319
 just keep working and hopefully with a lot of luck 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.529
 maybe again 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:05.729
 the others played a little soap to help and now they are either expensive 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:06.789
 you of course 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.880
 to show that they are not just so obvious of course 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:10.389
 present 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.499
 the judge can stand 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.460
 wanting to make yes 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.810
 museums at home and abroad may record after seven years of insecurity and 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.810
 it appreciates them for a moment 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.939
 He said that in a short on the shelf 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:28.949
 the remarkable performance can be seen with 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.699
 burght van bussum 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.699
 there is one here and there 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:47.480
 you can assume heracles it is a nice after week itself for years afterwards it follows 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.210
 example of buttocks structure 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.949
 especially dirk bikkembergs on my wife had her performance but i have them now 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.660
 acquaintances of my taxpayers who have that 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.040
 organized along with contact come to talk about the concept one has 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.930
 role model to be video screen and have already started playing with it 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.630
 He has been very many reports 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.909
 inter contacted with them in that period 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.080
 ask again to play bronze plate and this all done and from there 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.349
 that the boys got the idea of ​​god 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.559
 she must organize a tour and 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:22.369
 his reason for that tour that I was asked because but they were there 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:25.369
 a lover of what I did with pimples from the ball pit 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.169
 but if i do the special guest the who are in in leeuwarden and pop venue 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:33.360
 Roman 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.970
 the staff swollen 9 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.969
 Yes of course 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.150
 and nothing and then maybe it is nice that you concern me very much with 

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:41.300
 my son also my 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.780
 but certainly also because everyone is complaining so it is not at all determined which songs 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.960
 we are going to do it together yes sanne added value yes if you are quick recognition for if 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.960
 after the first single from 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.740
 Now Merkel would also have success
