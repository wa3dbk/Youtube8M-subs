00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
have been on there it would have been

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.009 
have been on there it would have been
like<00:04:10.959> a<00:04:11.019> little<00:04:11.230> finger<00:04:11.920> -<00:04:12.129> well<00:04:12.280> there

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
like a little finger - well there

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.979

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
instead of having to hump to slip on it

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.599 
instead of having to hump to slip on it
would<00:04:17.200> have<00:04:17.349> been<00:04:17.560> opposite<00:04:18.099> size<00:04:18.280> so<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.519> have

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
would have been opposite size so it have

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.640 
would have been opposite size so it have
been<00:04:18.700> something<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:19.120> put<00:04:19.269> your<00:04:19.419> finger<00:04:19.630> in

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
finish problems here if you see on this

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.300 
finish problems here if you see on this
side<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.980> scale<00:04:44.280> but<00:04:44.610> up<00:04:45.510> at<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.720> top<00:04:45.960> here

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
side of the scale but up at the top here

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.080 
side of the scale but up at the top here
it<00:04:47.310> was<00:04:48.320> sanded<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.770> sharp<00:04:50.400> edges<00:04:50.640> were

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
it was sanded the sharp edges were

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.930 
it was sanded the sharp edges were
sanded<00:04:51.920> like<00:04:52.920> routered<00:04:53.540> but<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.630> other<00:04:54.810> side

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
sanded like routered but the other side

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.880 
sanded like routered but the other side
was<00:04:56.940> not<00:04:58.790> very<00:04:59.790> sharp<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:01.350> turn<00:05:01.560> it<00:05:01.710> sideways

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
was not very sharp you turn it sideways

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:08.810 
was not very sharp you turn it sideways
you<00:05:04.370> see<00:05:05.370> what<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.520> mean<00:05:07.280> so<00:05:08.280> like<00:05:08.430> they<00:05:08.610> forgot

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
you see what I mean so like they forgot

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.630 
you see what I mean so like they forgot
to<00:05:09.180> do<00:05:09.300> that<00:05:09.330> side<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:09.780> guess<00:05:10.080> I<00:05:10.380> don't<00:05:11.310> see<00:05:11.490> no

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
to do that side I guess I don't see no

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.160 
to do that side I guess I don't see no
reason<00:05:11.970> why<00:05:12.090> they<00:05:12.270> would<00:05:12.390> have<00:05:12.510> left<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:13.020> like

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
reason why they would have left it like

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.440 
reason why they would have left it like
that<00:05:13.200> you<00:05:14.160> see<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.550> this<00:05:14.730> side<00:05:15.000> here<00:05:15.420> is

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
that you see that this side here is

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.290 
that you see that this side here is
shorter<00:05:16.130> it<00:05:17.130> took<00:05:17.280> more<00:05:17.460> material<00:05:17.970> off<00:05:18.090> than

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
shorter it took more material off than

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.340 
shorter it took more material off than
they<00:05:18.390> did<00:05:18.540> on<00:05:18.750> this<00:05:18.990> side<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:20.870> mean<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:22.020> can<00:05:22.170> fix

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
they did on this side I mean I can fix

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.650 
they did on this side I mean I can fix
that<00:05:22.590> with<00:05:22.830> a<00:05:23.210> sander<00:05:24.210> a<00:05:24.240> little<00:05:24.450> sandpaper

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
that with a sander a little sandpaper

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.790 
that with a sander a little sandpaper
and<00:05:24.990> a<00:05:25.050> dremel<00:05:25.670> but<00:05:27.200> $435<00:05:28.200> I<00:05:28.320> don't<00:05:28.500> think<00:05:28.680> I

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
and a dremel but $435 I don't think I

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.290 
and a dremel but $435 I don't think I
should<00:05:29.280> have<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.610> take<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.880> apart<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.240> do<00:05:30.330> that

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.570 

if<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:36.420> look<00:05:36.540> at<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.780> front<00:05:37.250> it's<00:05:38.250> kind<00:05:38.520> of

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
if you look at the front it's kind of

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.350 
if you look at the front it's kind of
the<00:05:38.700> same<00:05:38.910> way<00:05:40.280> some<00:05:41.280> sharp<00:05:41.580> edges<00:05:41.760> and<00:05:42.210> this

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
the same way some sharp edges and this

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.220 
the same way some sharp edges and this
side<00:05:42.600> had<00:05:42.950> just<00:05:43.950> moved<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.280> router<00:05:44.460> edges

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
side had just moved the router edges

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.820 
side had just moved the router edges
unless<00:05:46.230> again<00:05:46.670> it<00:05:47.670> was<00:05:47.850> designed<00:05:48.240> that<00:05:48.420> way

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
unless again it was designed that way

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.590 
unless again it was designed that way
for<00:05:49.830> a<00:05:49.860> reason<00:05:50.070> that<00:05:50.910> I'm<00:05:51.060> not<00:05:51.240> sure<00:05:51.420> about<00:05:53.600> but

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
for a reason that I'm not sure about but

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.860 
for a reason that I'm not sure about but
other<00:05:54.750> than<00:05:54.990> that<00:05:55.170> that's<00:05:55.860> about<00:05:56.450> the<00:05:57.450> worst<00:05:57.630> I

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
other than that that's about the worst I

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.710 
other than that that's about the worst I
see<00:05:58.110> of<00:05:58.290> it<00:05:58.440> I<00:05:58.970> don't<00:05:59.970> know<00:06:00.060> what<00:06:00.270> been<00:06:00.480> worse

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
see of it I don't know what been worse

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.080 
see of it I don't know what been worse
had<00:06:00.750> to<00:06:01.140> blade<00:06:01.560> off<00:06:01.740> centered<00:06:02.130> or<00:06:02.340> or<00:06:03.150> had<00:06:03.300> the

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
had to blade off centered or or had the

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:12.490 
had to blade off centered or or had the
scales<00:06:06.090> a<00:06:06.270> little<00:06:07.070> little<00:06:08.070> off<00:06:11.090> either<00:06:12.090> way

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
scales a little little off either way

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.920 
scales a little little off either way
I'm<00:06:13.500> happy<00:06:13.560> with<00:06:13.980> it

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
I'm happy with it
