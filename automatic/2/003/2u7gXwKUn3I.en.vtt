 all guys well found in this 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.880
 new video 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.240
 today I want to do my first review 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.039
 on the fifa ultimate team the player in 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.750
 the question you see is tim howard 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.490
 player you have already seen anyway 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.340
 interview on the fly 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.230
 in the video dedicated to my team but 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 today we hear talk in depth 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.760
 a little this goalkeeper and we see a 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.769
 moment if it is actually worth it 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.489
 buy it or not tim howard in his 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.530
 version 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.140
 man of the world cup match then 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.969
 this card came out during and precisely 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.489
 the world championship after he had made one 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.320
 big game and so paper 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.680
 greatly enhanced it in my opinion 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.530
 the second goalkeeper stronger than the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.780
 premier league after clearly cech 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.149
 team on the season 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.399
 then the paper is much enhanced 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.270
 base paper I think was an 81 of o 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.480
 for this it becomes 84 with 89 dip 90 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.710
 reflections 88 placement 86 presences in the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.900
 77 postponement little stuff however is a 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.909
 very very strong goalkeeper 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.650
 clearly American but obviously 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.890
 makes understanding of the premier's multipliers 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.409
 because everton goalkeeper 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.450
 then you see that I bought 229,000 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.070
 credits for a goalkeeper are not 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.170
 good high price was also a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.610
 po been domenico around 160 while 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.400
 I speak 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.930
 however we are there is a price 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.790
 remarkably high for a goalkeeper 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.700
 obviously they are really many gray per 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.030
 a porter and in my opinion 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.590
 a concierge to cost so much must 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.869
 make a difference if you don't do the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.670
 difference 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.229
 I don't want all these jerks and da 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.360
 this point of view 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.490
 I tell you right away that maybe the note 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.740
 worst that in conclusion howard is not 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.990
 a goalkeeper who makes the difference 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.970
 so let's say he is a goalkeeper there 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.829
 I would definitely recommend retrying the venue 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.539
 many hundreds of thousands of credits a 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.630
 spend at least take it try it 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.270
 but what sells you, however, if perhaps 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.310
 you like to do the team with so much 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.310
 relying only on your strength I am 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.930
 playing 129,000 or more in this 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.569
 case it really comes after so much 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.610
 fatigue and I advise you not to throw the 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.130
 your savings for a goalkeeper and 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.170
 especially for a porter so why 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.450
 said so it seems that I want to talk about it 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.860
 bad absolutely name howard likes 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.319
 very much even if I said it does not 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.750
 difference then great quality is 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.180
 definitely the base low gloss output 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.440
 with that one-in-one exit between 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.260
 the other one was never the one 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.209
 happened to 14 that takes initiative and 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.190
 comes out of the door alone so I am 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.660
 one who plays a game a lot in attack 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.819
 very unbalanced forward with the game 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.730
 from of food and it happens very often 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.829
 depending on counter-attacks in general is me 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.810
 to bring out the porter to let out 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.150
 with triangle because I am often in 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.560
 one versus one 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.739
 howard, on the other hand, does this by himself 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.910
 there is often he is already running already 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.030
 meeting the opponent 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.769
 before you even start pressing 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.450
 so this triangle is a pleat 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.850
 very active always very attentive game 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.350
 so here but a little remembered how he plays 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.609
 in reality bored there is one who plays 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.310
 very close to the area 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.130
 also ready to do the free if it comes 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.930
 in short, therefore, a surprise 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.790
 this one the one I like best 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.710
 absolute of aol there is a doorman who does 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.240
 almost the twelfth in the field and between 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.710
 each other when always comes up with the pisu 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.630
 warfare not ever happen to do 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.670
 get out of missing the ball to do 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.120
 do it from penalty and there is always clean on 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.930
 balloon takes it and it is scattered and really 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.560
 infallible almost from this point of 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.410
 view therefore definitely promoted to 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.020
 full marks for the exits 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.210
 regarding reactivity also 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.730
 we are on excellent levels is a goalkeeper 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.470
 quite explosive which makes excellent 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.630
 office of great reflections 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.710
 therefore it often manages to reduce the balloons 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.700
 which seem to be recoverable , we say the 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.200
 part where he is a normal goalkeeper and 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.030
 when he is in the door that is when maybe 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.340
 I take a shot from distance or otherwise 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.020
 a header in the area in short le 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.220
 situations he is in the door must 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.240
 just talk 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.310
 here in all these situations it is not 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.320
 it is not scarce and it never seems no shoe 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.600
 he has never done it without one I remember 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.250
 it did n't do me serious damage but it is not 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.990
 the problem is that he is a goalkeeper 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.790
 normal to this point of view is a 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.130
 goalkeeper strong but how much can be 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.680
 strong basic check for example or even 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.750
 loris baz are excellent goalkeepers anyway 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.660
 we always talk about top players on goal 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.820
 however it is clear that an iris base a check 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.350
 base costs you infinitely less vi 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.500
 it will also cost less than 10 thousand credits 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.480
 so from that point of view howard 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.640
 unfortunately it is equivalent to those goalkeepers and not 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.220
 the price rules are justified 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.170
 costs even if then as I said the 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.430
 huge feature that sets it apart 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.520
 just the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.680
 the fact of going out independently 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.120
 always good so it's the thing for 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.280
 as I play for my style of play 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.050
 always very offensive is unbalanced is 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.060
 something that I appreciate very much for 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.740
 this reason anyway goalkeeper 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.260
 end he got it did not change it 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.440
 although I am aware that it is not worth it 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.840
 credits which therefore costs in conclusion 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.090
 for not deceiving too much howard it is 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.610
 recommended I repeat yes if you have many 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.860
 credits to spend try it especially 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.360
 for those who play like me a lot in the attack 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.290
 very go to the bathroom and don't go much 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.000
 the defensive phase 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.710
 so if you are people that taking i 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.390
 many counter-attacks when you play try 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.240
 but look why it can still case 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.980
 really help you a lot but keep in mind 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.240
 mind that he is not a goalkeeper 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.550
 difference maybe it does in some 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.060
 game but not fano and very continuous 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.320
 optimal performance is rare 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.690
 games where he really does the phenomenon 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.550
 in all often when you see from 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.080
 or in any case the distance shots from distance 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.510
 close up and a pretty goalkeeper 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.220
 normal except for a few notes 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.080
 because I said it's very explosive 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.420
 in movements and sometimes succeeds 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.690
 arrive where it was unthinkable that 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.610
 it would arrive, however, are interventions we say 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.159
 that sometimes it goes sometimes not 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.819
 so I repeat it costs me anyway 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:15.949
 too objectively probably if 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:19.460
 take a basic check is definitely 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:21.560
 less strong but it costs infinitely less 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.800
 then the value for money check 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.139
 best base also loris baz best 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.139
 according to me in the quality / price ratio 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:32.629
 so it's all for this review 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.009
 thank you for following this video 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.629
 let me know if these reviews by 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:37.310
 journey because it is new to me 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:38.750
 something I wanted to do for a long time but not 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.500
 having enough that you have to do it not 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.180
 I had never done that 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.789
 now I could start doing these 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.979
 things let me know if you like them if they do 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:48.409
 he would like others and I will gladly do them 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:49.789
 in short, then left by the servers 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.139
 liked leave a dislike server 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:54.560
 liked so I make cash of 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:55.310
 liking is everything and see you with a 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.849
 next video 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.849
 Hi everyone
