this thing is a laser beam the one thing

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.540 
this thing is a laser beam the one thing
that<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.650> think<00:02:41.710> is<00:02:41.890> interesting<00:02:42.010> are<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.520> ER

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550

that I think is interesting are the ER
goes<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.180> knife<00:02:43.390> they're<00:02:43.630> kind<00:02:43.840> of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
goes on this knife they're kind of

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.160 
goes on this knife they're kind of
forced<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.350> are<00:02:44.500> goes<00:02:44.740> you<00:02:44.950> kind<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.250> have<00:02:45.400> this

forced to are goes you kind of have this

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.710 
forced to are goes you kind of have this
two<00:02:47.170> finger<00:02:47.620> choil<00:02:47.950> here<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:48.820> sort<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.240> grip

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
two finger choil here and sort of a grip

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.800 
two finger choil here and sort of a grip
that's<00:02:49.900> far<00:02:50.290> back<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:52.030> not<00:02:52.060> sharp<00:02:52.540> right

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
that's far back this is not sharp right

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.450 
that's far back this is not sharp right
here<00:02:53.080> so<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.320> can't<00:02:53.590> choke<00:02:53.800> up<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.190> if<00:02:54.340> you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
here so you can't choke up on it if you

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.680 
here so you can't choke up on it if you
if<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.820> need<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.120> get<00:02:55.240> in<00:02:55.330> there<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.540> do

if you need to get in there and do

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.540 
if you need to get in there and do
something<00:02:55.930> but<00:02:56.320> for<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.560> most<00:02:56.680> part<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:57.370> grip

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
something but for the most part you grip

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.390 
something but for the most part you grip
it<00:02:57.640> back<00:02:57.790> here<00:02:58.030> that's<00:02:58.540> fine<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:59.800> just<00:03:00.100> think

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
it back here that's fine I just think

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.680 
it back here that's fine I just think
it's<00:03:00.490> interesting<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.880> choice<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.120> force<00:03:01.570> a

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
it's interesting the choice to force a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.800 
it's interesting the choice to force a
grip<00:03:01.900> like<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:03.420> but<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
grip like that but I like it the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.090 
grip like that but I like it the
construction<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.410> this<00:03:08.530> knife<00:03:08.710> is<00:03:08.890> really

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
construction of this knife is really

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.920 
construction of this knife is really
interesting<00:03:09.460> it's<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.670> single<00:03:10.120> spacer

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
interesting it's a single spacer

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.830 
interesting it's a single spacer
construction<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:12.490> spacers<00:03:13.000> anodized<00:03:13.510> blue

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
construction that spacers anodized blue

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:22.530 
construction that spacers anodized blue
here<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:18.430> has<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:19.890> roughed<00:03:20.890> finish<00:03:21.880> on<00:03:22.150> the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
here it has a roughed finish on the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.300 
here it has a roughed finish on the
flipper<00:03:22.870> here<00:03:23.080> that<00:03:23.650> allows<00:03:23.860> for<00:03:24.070> traction

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
flipper here that allows for traction

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.580 
flipper here that allows for traction
when<00:03:24.850> you're<00:03:25.030> flipping<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.200> jumping

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
when you're flipping and the jumping

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.860 
when you're flipping and the jumping
here<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.550> kind<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.060> checkering<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:28.720> he's

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
here is kind of the checkering that he's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.780 
here is kind of the checkering that he's
pretty<00:03:29.140> famous<00:03:29.560> for<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.430> actually

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
pretty famous for and it is actually

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.240 
pretty famous for and it is actually
quite<00:03:30.880> functional<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.540> can<00:03:32.040> get<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.070> good

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
good retention I like the clip a lot the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.690 
good retention I like the clip a lot the
knife<00:03:44.230> carries<00:03:44.620> really<00:03:44.950> well<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.280> discreetly

lanyard<00:03:48.130> slot<00:03:48.870> one<00:03:49.870> of<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.020> cool<00:03:50.170> things<00:03:50.200> I

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
lanyard slot one of the cool things I

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.160 
lanyard slot one of the cool things I
think<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.800> Gus<00:03:50.980> does<00:03:51.250> is<00:03:51.760> he<00:03:52.000> Han<00:03:52.360> inscribes

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
think that Gus does is he Han inscribes

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.910 
think that Gus does is he Han inscribes
the<00:03:53.980> model<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:55.750> date<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.739> blade

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
the model and the date and the blade

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.220 
the model and the date and the blade
steel<00:03:57.190> on<00:03:57.790> his<00:03:58.330> knives<00:03:58.570> I<00:03:58.870> think<00:03:59.080> that's

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
steel on his knives I think that's

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.140 
steel on his knives I think that's
pretty<00:03:59.380> neat<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.890> I'm<00:04:00.459> not<00:04:00.670> entirely<00:04:00.970> sure

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
pretty neat and I'm not entirely sure

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.380 
pretty neat and I'm not entirely sure
that<00:04:01.600> says<00:04:01.810> ril<00:04:02.680> torque<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.580> I<00:04:03.880> think<00:04:04.209> that

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
that says ril torque and I think that

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.870 
that says ril torque and I think that
stands<00:04:04.690> for<00:04:04.840> Reeves<00:04:05.350> integral<00:04:06.130> lock<00:04:06.340> or<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
stands for Reeves integral lock or the

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.660 
stands for Reeves integral lock or the
frame<00:04:07.090> lock<00:04:07.950> would<00:04:08.950> be<00:04:09.070> kind<00:04:09.250> of<00:04:09.280> cool<00:04:09.459> for

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
frame lock would be kind of cool for

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.400 
frame lock would be kind of cool for
guests<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.000> give<00:04:10.180> Chris<00:04:10.540> Reeve<00:04:10.810> some<00:04:11.110> credit

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
guests to give Chris Reeve some credit

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.920 
guests to give Chris Reeve some credit
there<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.860> then<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.489> date<00:04:12.700> on<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.570> first

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
there and then the date on that is first

little difficult to read

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.650 
little difficult to read

over<00:04:32.590> travel<00:04:33.009> stop<00:04:33.449> milled<00:04:34.449> in<00:04:34.870> you<00:04:35.289> can<00:04:35.440> kind

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
over travel stop milled in you can kind

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.110 
over travel stop milled in you can kind
of<00:04:35.710> see<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:35.979> pocket<00:04:36.370> milled<00:04:36.520> out<00:04:36.639> there

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
of see the pocket milled out there

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.969 
of see the pocket milled out there
I<00:04:37.150> think<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.840> lock<00:04:38.020> bar<00:04:38.259> cutout<00:04:38.560> is<00:04:38.650> really

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
I think the lock bar cutout is really

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.290 
I think the lock bar cutout is really
cool<00:04:39.159> because<00:04:39.340> it's<00:04:39.550> really<00:04:39.699> it's<00:04:39.879> just<00:04:40.120> kind

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
cool because it's really it's just kind

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.210 
cool because it's really it's just kind
of<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.419> pocket<00:04:40.900> milled<00:04:41.199> out<00:04:41.379> and<00:04:41.710> this<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:41.889> where

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
of a pocket milled out and this is where

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.710 
of a pocket milled out and this is where
the<00:04:42.340> flexibility<00:04:42.970> of<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.090> lock<00:04:43.240> bar<00:04:43.479> comes

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
the flexibility of the lock bar comes

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.499 
the flexibility of the lock bar comes
from<00:04:44.020> but<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:44.860> doesn't<00:04:45.220> really<00:04:45.940> weaken<00:04:46.419> the

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
from but it doesn't really weaken the

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.450 
from but it doesn't really weaken the
