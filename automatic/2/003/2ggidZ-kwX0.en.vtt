these<00:04:36.390> rivers<00:04:36.810> completely<00:04:37.290> functional<00:04:37.670> I'm

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
these rivers completely functional I'm

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.120 
these rivers completely functional I'm
gonna<00:04:38.850> put<00:04:39.090> in<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.240> way<00:04:39.360> there<00:04:39.570> but<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.860> think

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
gonna put in the way there but I think

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.070 
gonna put in the way there but I think
that<00:04:41.460> just<00:04:41.730> comes<00:04:41.880> from<00:04:42.090> maybe<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.930> guys

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
that just comes from maybe the guys

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.720 
that just comes from maybe the guys
using<00:04:43.410> he's<00:04:43.560> just<00:04:43.740> ripping<00:04:44.130> up<00:04:44.250> on<00:04:44.430> them<00:04:44.610> and

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
using he's just ripping up on them and

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.700 
using he's just ripping up on them and
stuff<00:04:44.880> like<00:04:45.060> that<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.540> pulling<00:04:46.290> them<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.560> get

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
stuff like that and pulling them to get

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.110 
stuff like that and pulling them to get
out<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.070> bags<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.520> stuff<00:04:47.730> like<00:04:47.850> that

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
out of the bags and stuff like that

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.640 
out of the bags and stuff like that
that's<00:04:48.810> probably<00:04:49.380> pretty<00:04:49.560> hard<00:04:49.890> on<00:04:50.040> those<00:04:50.300> but

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650
