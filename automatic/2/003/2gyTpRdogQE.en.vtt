00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Hello my friends, today this nice red Porsche will get new rubber bushes at the front stabilizer

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.900
Here you see worn rubber bushes

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.580
The bush is coming out of the clip, it is rather swollen

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.600
This happens when there is a oil leak above and the oil is dropping on the rubbers

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.540
Here the bar has a lot of space in the rubber, this leads to a spongy handling

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.240
Before buying the rubber bushes, measure the diameter of the stabilizer installed

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.900
Here we have a 20 mm stabilizer

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.860
Here are two 8 mm bolts

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.040
Up here is the other nut, you'll need a 17 mm socket

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.000
The same procedure at the other side

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.160
And the large nut, too

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.780
Removing the last bolts

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.460
and the whole stabilizer will come down

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.300
I remove the large nuts, which have been still in place for safety reasons

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.900
And we have the stabilizer

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.360
Now we have to replace all rubber bushes

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.160
Take care, better to compare the numbers

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.600
The inner and outer bushes are rather similar, but different

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.960
The rubber mounts you may remove by hand

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.240
Just with the fingers, you see that the rubber bushes have been very worn

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.400
The threads are rather rusty and dirty, thus I recut the threads

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.240
It's not going easy, there is a lot of rust and dirt in the thread

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.840
Here you see all the dirt which have been in the thread

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.540
Mount the new rubber bushes with some talc powder

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.000
But Porsche is a fine company, the bushes have been already delivered with talc on them

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.300
Position it straightly and push - they go hardly compared to the old ones

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.540
Try to find a start 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.240
You see how firm it is fitting, you'll need a vice to push them slowly in

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.880
The part is in now

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.640
The same procedure at the other side

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.960
You may bent the clips of the inner bushes a little

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.540
And you may remove them

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.040
And another one

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.840
This are the rubber bushes for the inner holders

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:16.600
Just press them in the clips - this works quite easy

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.240
Removing the swollen rubber bush on the other side is more complicate

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.440
The other side also

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.000
Here you see what the times makes out of your rubbers

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:05.100
The parts are symmetrically, but Porsche mounted them with the numbers pointing to the washers

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.800
The second rubber we'll mount later in the car

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.440
Mount the outer holders

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.600
Here you see the difference, the old rubbers have been already loose, now all is tight

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.940
Mount the stabilizer

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.940
Put the other rubber bush

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.320
The concave washer and then the nut

00:05:50.340 --> 00:06:00.960
Enter the bolts from the front side and press the clip with pliers together

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.360
When one bolt is in, the second won't be a problem

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.940
The same procedure here

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.300
Fasten all the nuts

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.400
The bolts here at the hangers, get 20 Nm

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:30.600
The nuts on the side get 45 Nm

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.160
Fasten with care

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.000
The stabilizer is in, now the next curves may come

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.400
Bye, bye, see you in the next video
