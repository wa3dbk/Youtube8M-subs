her flying suit is they're folded it
neatly<00:03:40.500> with<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.920> bar<00:03:41.160> on<00:03:41.310> top<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:43.230> woke<00:03:43.470> up

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
neatly with a bar on top and I woke up

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.170 
neatly with a bar on top and I woke up
and<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.150> just<00:03:45.150> believe<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.410> is<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:48.030> was

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
and I just believe that this is it was

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.510 
and I just believe that this is it was
more<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.510> personal<00:03:48.870> dream<00:03:49.650> for<00:03:49.830> myself<00:03:50.220> to

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
more of a personal dream for myself to

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.430 
more of a personal dream for myself to
wake<00:03:50.640> up<00:03:50.820> my<00:03:51.150> family<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.140> think<00:03:52.350> those

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
wake up my family and I think those

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.230 
wake up my family and I think those
reassurance<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.100> God<00:03:53.459> had<00:03:53.760> his<00:03:53.910> hand<00:03:54.120> at

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
reassurance that God had his hand at

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.630 
reassurance that God had his hand at
each<00:03:54.390> one<00:03:54.630> of<00:03:54.660> them<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.230> has<00:03:56.130> been<00:03:56.340> bringing

each one of them and has been bringing
them<00:03:56.790> in<00:03:56.970> one<00:03:57.270> by<00:03:57.300> one<00:03:57.690> by<00:03:57.840> one<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.230> I'm<00:03:58.320> still
