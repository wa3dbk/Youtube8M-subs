00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
does come with some tape it's a really

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.110 
does come with some tape it's a really
good<00:00:35.969> deal<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.920> tape<00:00:38.160> by<00:00:38.340> itself<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.940> actually

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
good deal the tape by itself is actually

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.530 
good deal the tape by itself is actually
more<00:00:39.510> expensive<00:00:39.690> than<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.390> you're<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
more expensive than that so if you're a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.560 
more expensive than that so if you're a
crafter<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:46.850> this<00:00:47.850> works<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.450> as

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
crafter out there this works for you as

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.049 
crafter out there this works for you as
well<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.890> smaller<00:00:50.309> unit<00:00:50.760> which<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
well so it is a smaller unit which I

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.310 
well so it is a smaller unit which I
actually<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:51.840> some<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.260> are

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
actually like there are some that are

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.689 
actually like there are some that are
you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.100> more<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.239> printer<00:00:55.699> but

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
you know more like a little printer but

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
you know more like a little printer but
that's<00:00:57.360> basically<00:00:57.780> what<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
that's basically what this is the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.729 
that's basically what this is the
thermal<00:00:58.829> printer<00:01:00.949> then<00:01:01.949> inside<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.640> box<00:01:03.739> we

whole shebang and of course I have to go
get<00:03:23.100> some<00:03:23.430> triple-a<00:03:24.360> batteries<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.020> I<00:03:25.050> can

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
get some triple-a batteries so I can

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.350 
get some triple-a batteries so I can
show<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.070> guys<00:03:26.220> how<00:03:26.550> this<00:03:26.730> prints<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.210> we'll

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
one but let's just do a test here so

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.550 
one but let's just do a test here so
we'll<00:03:48.030> go<00:03:48.180> caps<00:03:48.690> oops<00:03:49.410> let's<00:03:49.710> go<00:03:49.830> back<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:51.560> good

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
we'll go caps oops let's go back to good

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.900 
we'll go caps oops let's go back to good
you<00:03:53.190> could<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.670> do<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:56.310> tried<00:03:56.550> turning<00:03:56.700> it

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
on and off again and well I guess here

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.060 
on and off again and well I guess here
we<00:04:05.730> could<00:04:05.970> do<00:04:06.090> this<00:04:06.240> so<00:04:06.600> made<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> mistake<00:04:07.740> want

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
to back up here's the backspace so this

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.890 
to back up here's the backspace so this

good<00:05:26.419> that<00:05:26.689> time<00:05:28.449> however<00:05:30.370> that's<00:05:31.370> not<00:05:31.580> the

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
good that time however that's not the

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.010 
good that time however that's not the
size<00:05:32.349> that<00:05:33.349> I<00:05:33.409> just<00:05:33.740> selected<00:05:34.279> so<00:05:35.270> you<00:05:35.539> see

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
size that I just selected so you see

size that I just selected so you see
here<00:05:36.259> there's<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:36.979> size<00:05:37.330> so<00:05:38.330> every<00:05:38.689> other

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
here there's that size so every other

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.889 
here there's that size so every other
time<00:05:39.430> it's<00:05:40.430> doing<00:05:40.699> a<00:05:40.879> different<00:05:41.270> size<00:05:43.899> which

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:44.899 
time it's doing a different size which

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:48.129 
time it's doing a different size which
is<00:05:45.110> kind<00:05:45.589> of<00:05:45.770> obnoxious<00:05:46.449> so<00:05:47.449> you<00:05:47.899> can<00:05:48.020> see

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139

actually<00:06:13.490> the<00:06:13.610> first<00:06:13.790> product<00:06:14.270> I've<00:06:14.390> ever<00:06:14.420> had

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
actually the first product I've ever had

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.170 
actually the first product I've ever had
fail<00:06:15.080> like<00:06:15.320> this<00:06:15.530> in<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:15.740> video<00:06:16.010> so<00:06:16.280> I<00:06:16.490> really

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
fail like this in the video so I really

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.360 
fail like this in the video so I really
don't<00:06:17.270> know<00:06:17.390> what<00:06:17.600> to<00:06:17.720> do<00:06:17.840> other<00:06:18.050> than<00:06:18.370> don't

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
don't know what to do other than don't

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.960 
don't know what to do other than don't
buy<00:06:19.670> it

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
buy it

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.240 
buy it
apparently<00:06:20.570> I<00:06:21.230> thought<00:06:21.590> it<00:06:21.710> important<00:06:22.100> to

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
apparently I thought it important to

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.100 
apparently I thought it important to
show<00:06:22.460> this<00:06:23.030> with<00:06:23.270> this<00:06:23.450> printer<00:06:23.720> really<00:06:23.990> isn't

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
show this with this printer really isn't

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.840 
show this with this printer really isn't
working<00:06:24.350> well<00:06:24.680> maybe<00:06:24.980> it's<00:06:25.160> just<00:06:25.250> a<00:06:25.400> defective

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
working well maybe it's just a defective

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.990 
working well maybe it's just a defective
product<00:06:26.150> but<00:06:26.600> it<00:06:27.200> took<00:06:27.440> me<00:06:28.000> 1<00:06:29.000> 2<00:06:29.240> 3<00:06:29.270> 4<00:06:29.840> 5<00:06:30.200> tries

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
product but it took me 1 2 3 4 5 tries

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.780 
product but it took me 1 2 3 4 5 tries
to<00:06:32.000> get<00:06:32.180> the<00:06:32.420> label<00:06:32.600> I<00:06:32.870> actually<00:06:33.080> wanted<00:06:33.790> first

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:34.790 
to get the label I actually wanted first

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.030 
to get the label I actually wanted first
it<00:06:35.030> printed<00:06:35.330> too<00:06:35.480> small<00:06:35.810> then<00:06:36.530> it<00:06:36.650> printed<00:06:36.890> in

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
it printed too small then it printed in

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.950 
it printed too small then it printed in
medium<00:06:37.460> then<00:06:37.670> it<00:06:37.790> printed<00:06:38.000> in<00:06:38.150> small<00:06:38.480> then<00:06:38.870> it

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
medium then it printed in small then it

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.720 
medium then it printed in small then it
printed<00:06:39.230> in<00:06:39.350> large<00:06:39.590> but<00:06:39.890> fed<00:06:40.100> out<00:06:40.250> a<00:06:40.280> bunch<00:06:40.640> of

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
printed in large but fed out a bunch of

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.880 
printed in large but fed out a bunch of
extra<00:06:41.030> tape<00:06:41.240> then<00:06:42.020> it<00:06:42.140> finally<00:06:42.350> printed<00:06:42.770> the

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
extra tape then it finally printed the

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.410 
extra tape then it finally printed the
right<00:06:43.070> one<00:06:43.220> so<00:06:43.430> I<00:06:43.490> thought<00:06:43.730> maybe<00:06:43.940> that's<00:06:44.270> just

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
right one so I thought maybe that's just

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.460 
right one so I thought maybe that's just
an<00:06:44.630> anomaly<00:06:44.900> I'll<00:06:45.410> try<00:06:46.250> it<00:06:46.310> again<00:06:47.290> so<00:06:48.290> I<00:06:48.350> was

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
an anomaly I'll try it again so I was

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.430 
an anomaly I'll try it again so I was
labeling<00:06:48.950> some<00:06:49.480> tough<00:06:50.480> of<00:06:50.660> beach<00:06:50.870> toys<00:06:51.170> that

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
labeling some tough of beach toys that

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.650 
labeling some tough of beach toys that
we<00:06:51.560> have<00:06:51.680> for<00:06:51.890> the<00:06:51.980> kids<00:06:52.160> and<00:06:52.550> it<00:06:53.330> took<00:06:53.450> me

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
we have for the kids and it took me

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.920 
we have for the kids and it took me
three<00:06:53.960> tries<00:06:55.180> so<00:06:57.370> Timmy<00:06:58.370> TechTV<00:06:58.730> top<00:06:59.270> tip<00:06:59.600> if

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
three tries so Timmy TechTV top tip if

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.660 
three tries so Timmy TechTV top tip if
it<00:07:00.140> takes<00:07:00.380> you<00:07:00.530> that<00:07:00.770> much<00:07:01.040> to<00:07:01.250> print<00:07:01.490> one

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670 
it takes you that much to print one

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.550 
it takes you that much to print one
thing<00:07:02.830> maybe<00:07:03.830> not<00:07:04.550> a<00:07:04.880> good<00:07:05.120> value<00:07:05.380> because<00:07:06.380> the

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
thing maybe not a good value because the

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.090 
thing maybe not a good value because the
tapes<00:07:06.770> for<00:07:07.010> this<00:07:07.220> are<00:07:07.430> $12.99<00:07:08.680> so<00:07:09.680> that's<00:07:09.830> Tim

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
tapes for this are $12.99 so that's Tim

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.360 
tapes for this are $12.99 so that's Tim
oh<00:07:10.280> and<00:07:10.490> I<00:07:10.610> have<00:07:10.790> two<00:07:10.970> if<00:07:11.090> you<00:07:11.390> turn<00:07:11.570> it<00:07:11.690> off

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
oh and I have two if you turn it off

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.590 
oh and I have two if you turn it off
see<00:07:13.370> if<00:07:13.460> I<00:07:13.520> can<00:07:13.670> reproduce<00:07:13.910> this<00:07:14.210> on<00:07:14.360> camera

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:14.600 
see if I can reproduce this on camera

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.040 
see if I can reproduce this on camera
probably<00:07:14.990> not<00:07:15.260> so<00:07:15.920> turn<00:07:16.070> it<00:07:16.190> back<00:07:16.310> on

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
probably not so turn it back on

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.490 
probably not so turn it back on
print<00:07:19.420> we'll<00:07:20.420> see<00:07:20.750> if<00:07:20.900> it<00:07:21.020> comes<00:07:21.140> out<00:07:21.320> the

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500 
print we'll see if it comes out the

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.500 
print we'll see if it comes out the
right<00:07:21.620> side<00:07:21.860> up<00:07:22.190> so<00:07:22.340> you<00:07:22.430> look<00:07:22.550> at<00:07:22.610> that<00:07:22.640> wrong

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:23.510 
right side up so you look at that wrong

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.150 
right side up so you look at that wrong
size<00:07:23.780> again<00:07:24.140> so<00:07:24.320> here's<00:07:24.500> the<00:07:24.680> size<00:07:24.860> that<00:07:25.040> it

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.160 
size again so here's the size that it

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.680 
size again so here's the size that it
should<00:07:25.340> be<00:07:25.460> in<00:07:25.580> the<00:07:25.700> size<00:07:25.910> that<00:07:25.940> the<00:07:26.390> screen

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690 
should be in the size that the screen

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.540 
should be in the size that the screen
says<00:07:27.020> it<00:07:27.200> should<00:07:27.410> be<00:07:28.960> and<00:07:30.220> that's<00:07:31.220> the<00:07:31.370> size

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550 
says it should be and that's the size

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.200 
says it should be and that's the size
that<00:07:31.580> it<00:07:32.300> actually<00:07:32.510> should<00:07:32.900> be<00:07:33.160> so<00:07:34.160> this<00:07:35.090> is

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.210 
that it actually should be so this is

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.060 
that it actually should be so this is
