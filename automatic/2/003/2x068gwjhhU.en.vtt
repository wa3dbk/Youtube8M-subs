way there is comfortable as possible you

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.479 
way there is comfortable as possible you
don't<00:02:33.870> want<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.230> put<00:02:34.440> them<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.830> your<00:02:35.040> waterline

don't want to put them on your waterline

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.880 
don't want to put them on your waterline

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
the way to the inner corner of my eyes

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.289 
the way to the inner corner of my eyes
only<00:03:24.780> because<00:03:25.590> my<00:03:25.620> eyes<00:03:26.010> get<00:03:26.400> irritated<00:03:27.030> when

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
only because my eyes get irritated when

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.000 
only because my eyes get irritated when
I<00:03:27.330> do<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.530> just<00:03:28.830> placed<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.400> little

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
I do that so I just placed a little

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.509 
I do that so I just placed a little
mascara<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:32.069> give<00:03:33.069> it<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.459> finished<00:03:34.060> look

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
mascara to give it that finished look

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.000 
mascara to give it that finished look
now<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.579> start<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.299> other<00:03:37.510> eye<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.829> do

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
now to start the other eye and you do

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.360 
now to start the other eye and you do
the<00:03:39.159> same<00:03:39.400> exact<00:03:39.849> thing<00:03:40.209> as<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:42.030> other<00:03:43.030> eye

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
the same exact thing as the other eye

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.809 
the same exact thing as the other eye
so<00:03:45.370> with<00:03:45.640> these<00:03:45.849> lashes<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.540> can<00:03:46.870> wear

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
so with these lashes you can wear

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.399 
so with these lashes you can wear
mascara<00:03:48.819> but<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.659> want<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.930> be<00:03:50.049> careful

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
mascara but you want to be careful

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.819 
mascara but you want to be careful
because<00:03:51.480> when<00:03:52.480> cleaning<00:03:52.870> them<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.650> don't

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
because when cleaning them you don't

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.380 
because when cleaning them you don't
want<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.040> clean<00:03:54.280> them<00:03:54.489> you<00:03:54.940> want<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.180> clean

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
them with the oil-free makeup remover

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.890 
them with the oil-free makeup remover
that<00:03:58.269> will<00:03:59.280> help<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.579> keep<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.030> bond<00:04:01.590> also

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
that will help to keep the bond also

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.149 
that will help to keep the bond also
when<00:04:04.900> you're<00:04:05.049> cleaning<00:04:05.319> your<00:04:05.560> makeup<00:04:05.980> off

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
when you're cleaning your makeup off

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.309 
when you're cleaning your makeup off
trying<00:04:06.549> to<00:04:06.609> use<00:04:06.819> a<00:04:06.849> q-tip<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.720> try<00:04:07.959> not<00:04:08.109> to

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
trying to use a q-tip and try not to

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.399 
trying to use a q-tip and try not to
disturb<00:04:08.680> them<00:04:08.950> as<00:04:09.129> much<00:04:09.370> as<00:04:09.579> possible<00:04:10.409> you

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
disturb them as much as possible you

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.170 
disturb them as much as possible you
might<00:04:11.650> have<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:12.040> learn<00:04:12.190> how<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.489> sleep<00:04:12.849> pretty

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
might have to learn how to sleep pretty

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.629 
might have to learn how to sleep pretty
too<00:04:13.709> because<00:04:14.709> you<00:04:14.859> don't<00:04:15.040> want<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.370> rub<00:04:15.609> the

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
too because you don't want to rub the

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.770 
too because you don't want to rub the
lashes<00:04:16.479> and<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:18.010> remove<00:04:18.430> them<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:19.090> just<00:04:19.180> use

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
lashes and to remove them I just use

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.860 
lashes and to remove them I just use
olive<00:04:20.169> oil<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:21.039> rub<00:04:21.639> them<00:04:21.880> on<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.150> lashes<00:04:22.660> and

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
olive oil and rub them on the lashes and

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.670 
olive oil and rub them on the lashes and
allow<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.470> lashes<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.250> fall<00:04:24.490> out<00:04:24.669> themselves

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
allow the lashes to fall out themselves

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.560 
allow the lashes to fall out themselves
that<00:04:26.680> way<00:04:27.070> you're<00:04:27.340> not<00:04:27.550> pulling<00:04:28.060> your<00:04:28.360> own

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
that way you're not pulling your own

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.740 
that way you're not pulling your own
lashes<00:04:28.900> out<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:29.889> if<00:04:30.520> they<00:04:30.699> start<00:04:31.090> falling<00:04:31.419> out

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
lashes out and if they start falling out

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.439 
lashes out and if they start falling out
it's<00:04:32.590> probably<00:04:32.949> because<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.820> maybe<00:04:34.090> didn't

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
it's probably because you maybe didn't

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.960 
it's probably because you maybe didn't
put<00:04:34.630> enough<00:04:34.660> glue<00:04:35.760> or<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:37.800> or<00:04:38.800> your<00:04:39.430> lashes
