bolt in each one of the brackets I have

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.400 
bolt in each one of the brackets I have
to<00:00:23.000> go<00:00:23.120> in<00:00:23.270> and<00:00:23.390> finish<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.840> other<00:00:23.960> bolts

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
to go in and finish the other bolts

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.780 
to go in and finish the other bolts
can't<00:00:25.160> get<00:00:25.370> at<00:00:25.550> them<00:00:25.670> from<00:00:26.540> the<00:00:26.780> underneath

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
can't get at them from the underneath

can't get at them from the underneath
frame<00:00:28.790> pipes<00:00:29.030> in<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.300> way<00:00:30.640> but<00:00:31.640> it<00:00:31.760> turned<00:00:31.970> out

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
frame pipes in the way but it turned out

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:43.450 
frame pipes in the way but it turned out
really<00:00:32.150> nice<00:00:32.480> I<00:00:32.689> think<00:00:41.530> cut<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.829> radiator

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
really nice I think cut the radiator

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.580 
really nice I think cut the radiator
hose<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:44.150> fit<00:00:44.800> we<00:00:45.800> got<00:00:45.980> that<00:00:46.250> hose<00:00:46.489> at

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
hose to fit we got that hose at

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.440 
hose to fit we got that hose at

restoration specialists out of
California<00:00:51.640> they're<00:00:52.690> making<00:00:53.690> a<00:00:53.750> lot<00:00:53.930> of<00:00:53.960> stuff

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
California they're making a lot of stuff

for<00:00:54.680> car<00:00:55.100> guys<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.850> we<00:00:56.540> notice<00:00:56.899> when<00:00:57.140> we<00:00:57.350> were

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
for car guys and we notice when we were

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.700 
for car guys and we notice when we were
taking<00:00:57.860> this<00:00:57.980> apart<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.420> color<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.410> the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
taking this apart that the color of the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.790 
taking this apart that the color of the
original<00:01:01.190> hose<00:01:01.460> was<00:01:02.120> orange<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.440> when<00:01:03.590> I<00:01:03.620> was

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
original hose was orange and when I was

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.530 
original hose was orange and when I was
going<00:01:04.009> through<00:01:04.100> looking<00:01:04.460> for<00:01:04.850> some<00:01:05.000> bolts<00:01:05.360> and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
going through looking for some bolts and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.740 
going through looking for some bolts and
things<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:06.170> came<00:01:07.040> across<00:01:07.190> that<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.510> said

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
things I came across that and it said

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.000 
things I came across that and it said
that<00:01:08.900> its<00:01:09.049> period<00:01:10.570> vintage<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:11.990> era<00:01:12.290> and

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
that its period vintage to this era and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.120 
that its period vintage to this era and
so<00:01:13.340> we<00:01:13.490> picked<00:01:13.760> it<00:01:13.880> up<00:01:14.770> that<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:15.860> would<00:01:15.979> be<00:01:16.100> a

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
so we picked it up that it would be a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.160 
so we picked it up that it would be a
nice<00:01:16.310> touch<00:01:19.780> everything's<00:01:20.780> put<00:01:20.990> together

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
nice touch everything's put together

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.310 
nice touch everything's put together
over<00:01:21.680> here<00:01:23.380> on<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.530> pulley<00:01:25.930> had<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:27.020> take<00:01:27.200> the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
over here on the pulley had to take the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.090 
over here on the pulley had to take the
wheels<00:01:27.560> back<00:01:27.890> off<00:01:29.380> for<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.439> variety<00:01:30.619> of<00:01:31.010> reasons

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
wheels back off for a variety of reasons

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:41.230 
wheels back off for a variety of reasons
I<00:01:35.830> did<00:01:36.830> manage<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.610> almost<00:01:38.150> finish<00:01:38.720> up<00:01:40.240> the

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
I did manage to almost finish up the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.429 
I did manage to almost finish up the
cleats<00:01:41.659> on<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:43.000> they're<00:01:44.000> rubber<00:01:44.240> cleats<00:01:44.600> as

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
cleats on it they're rubber cleats as

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.230 
cleats on it they're rubber cleats as
you<00:01:45.590> can<00:01:45.740> see<00:01:45.979> they<00:01:46.610> turned<00:01:46.970> out<00:01:47.210> really<00:01:47.689> nice

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
you can see they turned out really nice

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.300 
you can see they turned out really nice
it<00:01:50.240> was<00:01:50.420> actually<00:01:50.780> surprised<00:01:51.680> at<00:01:51.950> how<00:01:52.100> nice

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
it was actually surprised at how nice

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.140 
it was actually surprised at how nice
they<00:01:52.549> do<00:01:52.610> look<00:01:55.810> we<00:01:56.810> do<00:01:57.079> have<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.380> couple<00:01:58.150> that

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
they do look we do have a couple that

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
they do look we do have a couple that
have<00:01:59.479> curled<00:02:00.049> up<00:02:00.290> on<00:02:00.740> us<00:02:01.130> as<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:02.240> can<00:02:02.450> see<00:02:02.720> here

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
have curled up on us as you can see here

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.819 
have curled up on us as you can see here
kinda<00:02:03.590> curled<00:02:03.950> up<00:02:04.479> but<00:02:05.479> I<00:02:05.509> made<00:02:05.780> one<00:02:06.020> test<00:02:06.380> area

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
kinda curled up but I made one test area

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.650 
kinda curled up but I made one test area
with<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.040> little<00:02:07.280> gorilla<00:02:07.759> glue<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.239> clamp

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
with a little gorilla glue and a clamp

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.309 
with a little gorilla glue and a clamp
and<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.619> held<00:02:09.920> really<00:02:10.610> nice<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.480> I'm<00:02:11.630> going<00:02:11.780> to

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
and it held really nice so I'm going to

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.170 
and it held really nice so I'm going to
do<00:02:12.499> that<00:02:12.739> on<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.099> couple<00:02:13.519> of<00:02:13.579> corners<00:02:13.849> that

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
do that on the couple of corners that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.489 
do that on the couple of corners that
need<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.829> down<00:02:15.829> here<00:02:16.249> we<00:02:16.400> have<00:02:16.609> a<00:02:17.200> pile<00:02:18.200> of

right<00:02:42.409> here<00:02:45.939> this<00:02:46.939> pipe<00:02:47.359> is<00:02:47.769> actually<00:02:48.769> the

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
right here this pipe is actually the

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.689 
right here this pipe is actually the
pipe<00:02:49.099> that<00:02:49.370> holds<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.480> fenders<00:02:51.699> together

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:52.699 
pipe that holds the fenders together

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:56.080 
pipe that holds the fenders together
rigid<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.659> one<00:02:53.840> place<00:02:54.699> so<00:02:55.699> that<00:02:55.819> they<00:02:55.969> don't

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
rigid in one place so that they don't

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.789 
rigid in one place so that they don't
flop<00:02:56.389> back<00:02:56.569> and<00:02:56.840> forth<00:02:57.079> there's<00:02:57.290> about<00:02:57.439> a<00:02:57.500> half

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
flop back and forth there's about a half

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.220 
flop back and forth there's about a half
inch<00:02:58.040> clearance<00:02:58.430> between<00:02:58.699> the<00:02:58.939> wheel<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.540> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
inch clearance between the wheel and the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.949 
inch clearance between the wheel and the
fender<00:03:00.590> so<00:03:00.829> it's<00:03:00.980> really<00:03:01.189> tight<00:03:01.579> in<00:03:01.730> there

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
fender so it's really tight in there

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.089 
fender so it's really tight in there
it's<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:02.989> good<00:03:03.139> idea<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.439> have<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.829> pipe

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
it's a good idea to have that pipe

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:11.949
