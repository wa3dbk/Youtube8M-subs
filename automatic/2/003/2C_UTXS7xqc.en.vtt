i<00:05:09.820> would<00:05:10.000> say<00:05:10.180> among<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.540> most<00:05:10.690> television

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
i would say among the most television

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.200 
i would say among the most television
writing<00:05:11.770> staffs<00:05:12.160> and<00:05:12.430> that<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.700> is<00:05:12.730> fifty

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
writing staffs and that it is fifty

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.720 
writing staffs and that it is fifty
percent<00:05:13.480> of<00:05:13.630> women<00:05:13.810> which<00:05:14.560> you<00:05:14.710> don't<00:05:14.830> see<00:05:15.190> a
