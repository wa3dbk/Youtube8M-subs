I<00:00:01.190> am<00:00:02.190> going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.669> show<00:00:02.820> you<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.240> program

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
I am going to show you how to program

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.980 
I am going to show you how to program
the<00:00:04.110> level<00:00:04.650> segue<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.390> chose<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.690> particular

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
the level segue I chose this particular

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.280 
the level segue I chose this particular
model<00:00:07.589> from<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.280> web<00:00:08.460> it's<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.450> very<00:00:09.690> popular

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
model from the web it's a very popular

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.339 
model from the web it's a very popular
one<00:00:10.530> I'm<00:00:11.400> going<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.730> put<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.269> link<00:00:12.660> for<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
one I'm going to put the link for the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.810 
one I'm going to put the link for the
buildin<00:00:13.679> instructions<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> description

buildin instructions in the description
of<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.540> video<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:17.250> only<00:00:17.279> thing<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.270> I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
of this video the only thing that I

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.929 
of this video the only thing that I
changed<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.949> added<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> counterweight

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
changed is that I added a counterweight

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.650 
changed is that I added a counterweight
here<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.680> just<00:00:22.680> used<00:00:22.980> an<00:00:23.160> old<00:00:23.670> battery<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.180> found

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
here I just used an old battery I found

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.460 
here I just used an old battery I found
because<00:00:26.090> troops<00:00:27.090> fermentation<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.960> found<00:00:28.289> that

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
because troops fermentation I found that

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.120 
because troops fermentation I found that
this<00:00:28.680> model<00:00:29.039> tests<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.330> quicker<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.410> expect

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
this model tests for quicker to expect

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.049 
this model tests for quicker to expect
than<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:33.149> track<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:34.040> think<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.579> because

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
than to track I think that it is because

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.139 
than to track I think that it is because
of<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.719> tall<00:00:37.380> structure<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.399> exert<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
of this tall structure that exert a

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.709 
of this tall structure that exert a
greater<00:00:39.690> torque<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.950> whole<00:00:41.399> device<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
greater torque in the whole device and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.610 
greater torque in the whole device and
to<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> back<00:00:44.300> that's<00:00:45.300> why<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> added<00:00:46.050> this

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to the back that's why I added this

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.340 
to the back that's why I added this
counterweight<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.750> well<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.899> purpose<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
counterweight and well the purpose of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
counterweight and well the purpose of
the<00:00:49.410> level<00:00:49.860> set<00:00:50.160> well<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> purpose<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.210> an

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the level set well is the purpose of an

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.580 
the level set well is the purpose of an
inverted<00:00:52.020> pendulum<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.600> has<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.170> keep

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
inverted pendulum and so it has to keep

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.610 
inverted pendulum and so it has to keep
its<00:00:55.800> balance<00:00:56.090> by<00:00:57.090> moving<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.660> front<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.350> back

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
its balance by moving in front and back

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.920 
its balance by moving in front and back
because<00:00:59.520> why<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.910> only<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.570> very

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
because why it's only it's very

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.210 
because why it's only it's very
difficult<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.640> stay<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.710> in<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.920> steel

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
difficult to to stay in in a steel

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.929 
difficult to to stay in in a steel
position<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:07.070> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.220> show<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
position I'm going to show you how to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.679 
position I'm going to show you how to
program<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.080> LabVIEW<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.390> there's<00:01:12.390> also

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
program this in LabVIEW and there's also

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.490 
program this in LabVIEW and there's also
a<00:01:13.140> link<00:01:14.270> where<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> overall

direction your models are going to move
you<00:05:51.460> can<00:05:51.669> just<00:05:52.240> use<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:53.620> sign<00:05:53.890> and<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:55.240> sign

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
you can just use the sign and the sign
