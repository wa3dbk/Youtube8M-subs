00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.520
 Why 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.070
 4 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.800
 4 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.270
 hello and thank you for receiving us at home 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.189
 today I address the greediest of others 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.029
 you are wondering why 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.739
 she's just because we're going to make a cocktail-based 

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:18.679
 colas hot dishes 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.689
 original no and yet you will see you are laughing 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.119
 so it's true that I created and I do not have a guarantor 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.999
 for father and chocolate any other motive 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.990
 go on I talk about his passion let's move on as a result 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.990
 in the second half they need balladur like this 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.010
 you proved no but let's stop from the street could be perfect for this 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.830
 show 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.150
 two other felines need to lift all the second choice position 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.510
 we use 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.990
 real danger 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.990
 which is perfectly normal as I believe for the contrast 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.690
 then we will use 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.390
 chocolate I want to remind him 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.390
 as well as yes we three white and black chocolate squares 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.340
 we also need an orange for the decoration 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.240
 and I think the standard 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.430
 as for the ingredients we used 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.760
 a biker 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.330
 good 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.000
 the rangoun leader 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.280
 Beneteau and Jeanneau 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.090
 just with an easter boss to finish off the cream alone 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.640
 nice 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.250
 chocolate powder 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.250
 the probability of a partial opa as a result 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.070
 must therefore 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.480
 as the mutual we leave around the grave a dose may pour 406 in 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.990
 a letter that are hostile to him 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.920
 why do we speak 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 at most they said 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.940
 three seconds is for another 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.170
 these partial data house 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.159
 you can find it's them that can happen on this side so we have 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.299
 near suicide so easier it is ready to put in 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.050
 artwork 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.970
 so here we have a few centilitres good 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.049
 this date a few showers so the second 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.019
 in Switzerland for georgia we will need 200 citizens concluded he has 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.279
 took advantage of the bonus so it makes us quite normal ap 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.389
 detroit red wings 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.529
 for the occasion it's the same 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.719
 you are 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.879
 the three seconds 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.949
 our cane sugar 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:35.949
 the referees like these 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.529
 it's our task 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.909
 this public offer of debt securities 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.789
 so here are the adjuvants contained if you register 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.839

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.529
 and we will postpone driving 77 ' 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.979

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:15.529
 its authors and it's a nice gesture that he quietly qualifies because it's 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.529
 not very easy this district 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.849
 mourinho 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.939
 for the smallest outlets 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.939

 if I have time 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.269
 to understand why 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:14.349
 it's a complicated exercise ap ce very short fair way 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:21.719
 of the same type so why what happens it says their presence Wednesday 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.259
