00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.509
 okay 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:26.289
 a ray of tequila and never full of course 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.349
 if it gets you cool clear command lead 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.630
 towards your head and what sadness coruña or 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.450
 on the floor like a healthy healthy plum 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.730
 Well here on the floor I ring my nick and 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.280
 All the little bit and video there is my son 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.710
 throw in the towel with your recycled kisses 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.840
 no longer measure up look at my wall is 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.030
 a herd we walk in the street without fear 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.190
 we catch them I see them running inside 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.289
 your room is urinating your pants or 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.510
 sending threats by lots but not 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.519
 there is nothing when you saw the guy that 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.829
 He does not have balls where you left 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.079
 when I did all the shots I had 20 floors 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.690
 Indiciado añádele chemistry arrived but no 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.370
 Cesar ceases what is from 6 to 20 in the 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.409
 table is what will give me stress that I 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.240
 puts on his head that he will see well feet 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.290
 the only thing that interests me is to end with 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.500
 my pérez 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.510
 if you are interested 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.160
 the times the movie starts it follows 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.260
 listening also coherently 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.090
 comment in a cemetery for the same 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.890
 the bitter ones fly within a soul if 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.080
 you knew that my independent mind was 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.060
 create things like I do if you feel 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.740
 different you knew that people just 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.660
 look from the outside in response to me 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.090
 I am the law so that was the apple 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.979
 I never gave a gift to my career just like 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.020
 in each verse you reach him that is expected 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.030
 steals us at first but feels light 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.190
 person and I 'm always aware of my 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.780
 show profit after earnings of what 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.880
 it makes me keep writing music 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.070
 because of free is not always low 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.229
 for my album it escapes me in your 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.720
 free legs go to sing first 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.420
 with me talk about bullets but fame 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.460
 to be listeners or crazy do not give me 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.780
 rhombus and leather that already so high of that and 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.780
 high pile what a rafa 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.300
 combined with that way of mcallen 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.890
 it was also for Endesa 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.020
 and after the return he copied it in 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.580
 stores this is for you to understand me 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.530
 money and progress what they give you 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.690
 results in the subject but there's no 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.510
 problem because it's the system put me in 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.250
 her music mediates the planet as 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.860
 if it was good and we had to go back 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.850
 we are the first and you have to 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.060
 I always learn I feel Santiago and you 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.060
