I've<00:00:16.010> learned<00:00:16.430> a<00:00:16.640> lot<00:00:16.670> about<00:00:16.990> composition<00:00:17.990> and

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
I've learned a lot about composition and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.609 
I've learned a lot about composition and
color<00:00:19.310> through<00:00:20.150> working<00:00:20.390> abstractly<00:00:21.170> so<00:00:21.470> in

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
color through working abstractly so in

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.010 
color through working abstractly so in
this<00:00:21.800> video<00:00:22.039> I'm<00:00:22.580> going<00:00:23.029> to<00:00:23.119> show<00:00:23.360> you<00:00:23.419> some

this video I'm going to show you some
basic<00:00:24.820> compositions<00:00:25.820> that<00:00:25.970> you<00:00:26.270> will<00:00:26.450> often

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
basic compositions that you will often

see when you're looking at abstract
works<00:00:29.259> there<00:00:30.259> are<00:00:30.470> many<00:00:31.250> different<00:00:31.760> kinds<00:00:32.210> of

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
works there are many different kinds of

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.180 
works there are many different kinds of
compositions<00:00:33.080> but<00:00:33.230> I'm<00:00:33.500> going<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.769> go<00:00:33.860> over

compositions but I'm going to go over

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.759 
compositions but I'm going to go over
some<00:00:34.370> of<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.580> basic<00:00:35.410> compositions<00:00:36.410> that<00:00:36.650> you

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
some of the basic compositions that you

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.060 
some of the basic compositions that you
will<00:00:36.920> see<00:00:37.220> and<00:00:37.550> I'm<00:00:38.090> also<00:00:38.360> going<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:39.040> go<00:00:40.040> over

will see and I'm also going to go over
some<00:00:40.820> information<00:00:41.480> about<00:00:42.370> color<00:00:43.370> theory

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
some information about color theory

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.289 
some information about color theory
color<00:00:44.809> schemes<00:00:45.290> I've<00:00:46.129> learned<00:00:46.580> a<00:00:46.790> lot<00:00:47.089> about

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:47.299 
color schemes I've learned a lot about

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.039 
color schemes I've learned a lot about
color<00:00:47.750> through<00:00:48.110> working<00:00:48.350> with<00:00:48.559> pastel<00:00:49.489> and

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
color through working with pastel and

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.259 
color through working with pastel and
have<00:00:51.049> now<00:00:51.260> been<00:00:51.530> able<00:00:51.650> to<00:00:51.799> apply<00:00:52.070> that<00:00:52.309> to<00:00:53.239> my

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
have now been able to apply that to my

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.840 
have now been able to apply that to my
works<00:00:53.720> in<00:00:53.989> acrylics<00:00:54.589> and<00:00:54.799> oil<00:00:55.100> with<00:00:55.640> this

video in the information that is in this
you'll<00:00:59.510> be<00:00:59.720> able<00:00:59.839> to<00:01:00.110> take<00:01:00.379> this<00:01:00.650> and<00:01:00.710> apply<00:01:01.190> it

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
you'll be able to take this and apply it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.630 
you'll be able to take this and apply it
to<00:01:01.699> any<00:01:02.000> type<00:01:02.780> of<00:01:02.809> medium<00:01:03.409> that<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:04.100> work<00:01:04.369> in

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
to any type of medium that you work in

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.899 
to any type of medium that you work in
I'm<00:01:05.089> going<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.390> start<00:01:05.720> at<00:01:05.960> this<00:01:06.260> side<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.100> I

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
I'm going to start at this side and I

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.810 
I'm going to start at this side and I
don't<00:01:07.970> want<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.450> divide<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:08.930> evenly<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.310> I<00:01:10.340> have

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
don't want to divide it evenly so I have

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.719 
don't want to divide it evenly so I have
four<00:01:11.180> equal<00:01:11.630> squares<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:13.159> not<00:01:13.400> very

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
four equal squares that is not very

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.920 
four equal squares that is not very
appealing<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.080> I'm<00:01:15.409> going<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.950> have<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.310> I<00:01:16.930> mean

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
appealing so I'm going to have a I mean

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.340 
appealing so I'm going to have a I mean
started<00:01:18.590> here<00:01:19.039> but<00:01:19.700> I<00:01:19.909> may<00:01:20.299> vary<00:01:20.719> that<00:01:20.960> line

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
started here but I may vary that line

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.219 
started here but I may vary that line
and<00:01:21.649> have<00:01:21.890> more<00:01:22.219> of<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.460> jagged<00:01:22.969> line<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.509> maybe

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
and have more of a jagged line and maybe

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.459 
and have more of a jagged line and maybe
have<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.859> thicker<00:01:25.520> line<00:01:25.850> over<00:01:26.240> here<00:01:26.469> maybe

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
have that thicker line over here maybe

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.249 
have that thicker line over here maybe
have<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.770> double<00:01:28.250> line<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:29.119> I<00:01:29.149> do<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.600> lot<00:01:29.929> of

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
have a double line so I do a lot of

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.429 
have a double line so I do a lot of
different<00:01:30.590> types<00:01:31.159> of<00:01:31.429> sketches<00:01:32.030> but<00:01:32.929> this

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
different types of sketches but this

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.999 
different types of sketches but this
would<00:01:33.770> be<00:01:33.950> an<00:01:34.159> example<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.999> cruciform

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
would be an example of cruciform

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.739 
would be an example of cruciform
composition<00:01:37.009> there's<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:38.060> many<00:01:38.210> different

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:38.749 
composition there's so many different

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:42.520 
composition there's so many different
variations<00:01:39.560> on<00:01:39.829> blues<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.090> orange<00:01:41.659> I<00:01:41.840> don't

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
variations on blues and orange I don't

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.539 
variations on blues and orange I don't
stick<00:01:43.189> with<00:01:43.219> the<00:01:43.579> same<00:01:43.850> type<00:01:44.569> of<00:01:44.810> blue<00:01:45.170> I<00:01:45.549> might

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
stick with the same type of blue I might

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.139 
stick with the same type of blue I might
use<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:47.149> greenish<00:01:48.049> blue<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.619> blue<00:01:49.280> violet<00:01:49.880> a

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
use a greenish blue a blue violet a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.459 
use a greenish blue a blue violet a
light<00:01:50.929> blue<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:51.909> try<00:01:52.909> to<00:01:52.969> vary<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.929> types<00:01:54.229> of

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
light blue I try to vary the types of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.399 
light blue I try to vary the types of
blue<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.310> would<00:01:55.700> choose<00:01:56.170> different<00:01:57.170> types

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
blue that I would choose different types

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.859 
blue that I would choose different types
of<00:01:57.619> oranges<00:01:58.219> we<00:01:58.850> have<00:01:59.030> more<00:01:59.329> of<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.509> brilliant

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
of oranges we have more of a brilliant

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.819 
of oranges we have more of a brilliant
pure<00:02:00.770> orange<00:02:01.179> more<00:02:02.179> of<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.420> neutral<00:02:02.960> orange<00:02:03.530> a

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
pure orange more of a neutral orange a

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.069 
pure orange more of a neutral orange a
lighter<00:02:04.579> orange<00:02:04.999> but<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:05.689> different

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
lighter orange but the different

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.950 
lighter orange but the different
variations<00:02:06.829> I<00:02:07.100> like<00:02:07.549> to<00:02:07.759> use<00:02:07.939> just<00:02:07.969> a<00:02:08.390> big<00:02:08.690> wide

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
variations I like to use just a big wide

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.620 
variations I like to use just a big wide
brush<00:02:09.319> because<00:02:09.830> I'm<00:02:10.009> going<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.550> make<00:02:10.729> some<00:02:11.000> big

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
brush because I'm going to make some big

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.720 
brush because I'm going to make some big
sweeps<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:13.060> color<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:15.110> direction<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
sweeps of color in the direction of the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.420 
sweeps of color in the direction of the
cruciform<00:02:17.330> I'm<00:02:17.690> not<00:02:18.260> going<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.560> try<00:02:18.830> at<00:02:19.100> this

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
cruciform I'm not going to try at this

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.560 
cruciform I'm not going to try at this
point<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:20.540> copy<00:02:20.810> any<00:02:21.170> details<00:02:21.770> my<00:02:22.730> purpose<00:02:23.540> for

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
point to copy any details my purpose for

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.100 
point to copy any details my purpose for
doing<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:25.040> lay<00:02:25.280> down<00:02:25.930> structure<00:02:26.930> and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
doing this is to lay down structure and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.620 
doing this is to lay down structure and
a<00:02:27.530> found<00:02:27.830> a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
a found a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.750 
a found a
sometimes<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:30.870> use<00:02:31.200> one<00:02:31.680> color<00:02:31.980> instead

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
sometimes I just use one color instead

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.600 
sometimes I just use one color instead
of<00:02:32.880> two<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.780> thought<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:34.319> this<00:02:34.410> case<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:35.010> will

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
of two but I thought in this case I will

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.420 
of two but I thought in this case I will
use<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.510> complementary<00:02:37.319> colors<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.830> orange

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
use the complementary colors of orange

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.900 
use the complementary colors of orange
and<00:02:38.580> blue<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.230> once<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.440> put<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.770> blue<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.550> and

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
and blue and once I put this blue on and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.630 
and blue and once I put this blue on and
it<00:02:42.090> mixes<00:02:42.630> with<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.840> orange<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:44.310> going<00:02:44.550> to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
it mixes with the orange it's going to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.470 
it mixes with the orange it's going to
create<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> deeper<00:02:45.740> color<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:47.820> can<00:02:48.000> see<00:02:48.300> and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
create a deeper color you can see and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.230 
create a deeper color you can see and
it's<00:02:48.600> starting<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.170> dry<00:02:49.470> already<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:51.060> it's

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
it's starting to dry already but it's

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.870 
it's starting to dry already but it's
going<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.540> give<00:02:51.780> me<00:02:52.080> some<00:02:52.800> more<00:02:53.040> colors<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.850> I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
going to give me some more colors that I

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.680 
going to give me some more colors that I
could<00:02:54.239> use

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
could use

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.770 
could use
I<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:55.830> stage<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.670> like<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.360> play<00:02:57.750> with

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
I like this stage I like to play with

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.390 
I like this stage I like to play with
this<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.770> think<00:02:59.550> about<00:03:00.300> my<00:03:00.750> composition<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:02.370> I

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
this I think about my composition but I

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
this I think about my composition but I
don't<00:03:02.850> think<00:03:03.209> about<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.810> lot<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.130> be

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
don't think about it a lot I like to be

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.330 
don't think about it a lot I like to be
experimental<00:03:06.420> with<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.800> like<00:03:08.040> how<00:03:08.280> the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
experimental with this I like how the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.820 
experimental with this I like how the
even<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.570> colors<00:03:09.930> running<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.590> dripping

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
even the colors running and dripping

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.720 
even the colors running and dripping
like<00:03:11.220> that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
like that

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.270 
like that
are<00:03:11.790> kind<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.540> nice<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.140> like<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.440> sometimes

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
are kind of nice I like that sometimes

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.270 
are kind of nice I like that sometimes
when<00:03:14.640> I'm<00:03:14.910> in<00:03:14.970> my<00:03:15.810> own<00:03:16.019> studio<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.590> might<00:03:17.070> even

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
when I'm in my own studio I might even

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.540 
when I'm in my own studio I might even
take<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.670> brush<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.060> do<00:03:18.480> some<00:03:18.660> splashing<00:03:19.320> and

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
take a brush and do some splashing and

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.750 
take a brush and do some splashing and
just<00:03:20.550> leave<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.239> there<00:03:21.690> because<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:23.430> can

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
just leave that there because that can

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.900 
just leave that there because that can
be<00:03:23.970> really<00:03:24.900> fun<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.860> incorporate<00:03:26.310> those

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
be really fun to incorporate those

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.120 
be really fun to incorporate those
things<00:03:27.350> into<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.310> am<00:03:29.670> building<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.360> layer

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
things into but I am building a layer

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.100 
things into but I am building a layer
underneath<00:03:32.130> that<00:03:32.820> will<00:03:33.090> help<00:03:33.390> me<00:03:33.600> build<00:03:33.810> some

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
underneath that will help me build some

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.930 
underneath that will help me build some
foundation<00:03:35.040> for<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.380> painting<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:38.400> use

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
foundation for this painting I can use

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.229 
foundation for this painting I can use
you<00:03:39.480> know<00:03:39.600> some<00:03:40.230> areas<00:03:40.500> for<00:03:40.950> lines<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.670> lot<00:03:42.180> of

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
you know some areas for lines a lot of

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.430 
you know some areas for lines a lot of
times<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.840> just<00:03:43.110> follow<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.860> lines<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:45.239> are

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
times I just follow the lines that are

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.069 
times I just follow the lines that are
in<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.980> under<00:03:47.430> painting<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.510> think<00:03:48.840> part

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
in this under painting and I think part

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.350 
in this under painting and I think part
of<00:03:49.200> abstract<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.130> really<00:03:50.850> enjoy<00:03:51.360> is

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
of abstract that I really enjoy is

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.210 
of abstract that I really enjoy is
there's<00:03:54.360> kind<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.930> fine<00:03:55.260> line<00:03:55.290> between

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
there's kind of a fine line between

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.860 
there's kind of a fine line between
having<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.090> plan<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.880> letting<00:03:59.880> go<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.090> control

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
having a plan and letting go of control

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.009 
having a plan and letting go of control
with<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.579> takes<00:04:02.880> practice<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.870> is

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
with and that takes practice that is

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.310 
with and that takes practice that is
something<00:04:04.380> that<00:04:04.530> comes<00:04:04.739> with<00:04:05.040> time<00:04:05.340> is

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
something that comes with time is

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.500 
something that comes with time is
letting<00:04:07.320> things<00:04:07.590> go<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.280> responding<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.150> what

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
letting things go and responding to what

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.890 
letting things go and responding to what
you<00:04:09.690> see<00:04:09.930> in<00:04:09.959> front<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.390> but<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.420> really

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
you see in front of you and but I really

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.370 
you see in front of you and but I really
do

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
do

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.449 
do
let<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:14.310> under<00:04:14.700> painting<00:04:15.030> help<00:04:15.750> guide<00:04:16.459> what

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
let the under painting help guide what

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.479 
let the under painting help guide what
the<00:04:18.120> values<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.780> color<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.950> color<00:04:20.220> that

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
the values of color and the color that

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.440 
the values of color and the color that
I'm<00:04:20.640> going<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.120> put<00:04:21.359> down<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.880> here<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.419> a

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
I'm going to put down and here is a

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.990 
I'm going to put down and here is a
lighter<00:04:24.870> more<00:04:25.169> brilliant<00:04:25.830> orange<00:04:26.310> that

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
lighter more brilliant orange that

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.210 
lighter more brilliant orange that
really<00:04:27.600> stands<00:04:27.990> out<00:04:28.229> I<00:04:28.289> think<00:04:28.530> I'll<00:04:28.830> put<00:04:29.070> it

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
really stands out I think I'll put it

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.269 
really stands out I think I'll put it
over<00:04:29.400> here<00:04:29.610> where<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.330> light<00:04:30.660> area<00:04:31.169> is

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:35.279 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:39.049 

and<00:04:36.269> I<00:04:36.719> have<00:04:36.929> an<00:04:37.049> even<00:04:37.589> brighter<00:04:38.059> brighter

00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:39.059 
and I have an even brighter brighter

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:41.919 
and I have an even brighter brighter
orange<00:04:39.479> that<00:04:39.809> I<00:04:39.839> could<00:04:40.169> use<00:04:40.379> that<00:04:40.409> I<00:04:40.739> may<00:04:41.219> save

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:41.929 
orange that I could use that I may save

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:44.989 
orange that I could use that I may save
until<00:04:42.929> a<00:04:42.959> little<00:04:43.349> later<00:04:43.589> sometimes<00:04:44.459> I<00:04:44.579> like<00:04:44.789> to

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999 
until a little later sometimes I like to

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:49.519 
until a little later sometimes I like to
save<00:04:45.269> those<00:04:45.479> bright<00:04:45.899> colors<00:04:46.159> till<00:04:47.159> the<00:04:47.309> end
