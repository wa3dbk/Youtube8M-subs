00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:02.570 
this is my review of the benchmade

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.360 
this is my review of the benchmade

over here you have flathead again I'll
just<00:01:45.270> go<00:01:45.570> through<00:01:45.750> these<00:01:45.869> very<00:01:46.020> quickly<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.810 

four<00:01:52.340> Torx<00:01:53.340> screws<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:54.479> actually<00:01:55.079> only<00:01:55.290> get

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
four Torx screws you actually only get

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.580 
four Torx screws you actually only get
three<00:01:56.820> different<00:01:56.939> sizes<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.079> Torx<00:01:58.350> screws

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
three different sizes of the Torx screws

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.330 
three different sizes of the Torx screws
they<00:01:58.740> actually<00:01:59.070> gave<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.520> two<00:02:00.390> t<00:02:00.689> sixes

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
they actually gave you two t sixes

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.859 
they actually gave you two t sixes
mainly<00:02:02.340> because<00:02:02.490> they<00:02:02.820> figure<00:02:03.390> that's<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
mainly because they figure that's the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.910 
mainly because they figure that's the
most<00:02:03.990> common<00:02:04.409> bring<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:05.240> head<00:02:06.240> size<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.140> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
most common bring up head size and you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
most common bring up head size and you
might<00:02:08.129> break<00:02:08.700> or<00:02:08.910> damage<00:02:09.060> them<00:02:09.629> since<00:02:09.929> they're

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
might break or damage them since they're

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.309 
might break or damage them since they're
smaller<00:02:10.440> they're<00:02:10.679> also<00:02:10.830> more<00:02:11.039> delicate<00:02:12.110> again

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
smaller they're also more delicate again

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.899 
smaller they're also more delicate again
with<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:14.060> torque<00:02:16.129> heads<00:02:17.129> here<00:02:17.459> I'm<00:02:17.639> actually

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
with the torque heads here I'm actually

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.429 
with the torque heads here I'm actually
very<00:02:18.209> happy<00:02:18.689> this<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:18.900> one<00:02:19.109> of<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.230> main

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
very happy this is one of the main

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.610 
very happy this is one of the main
concerns<00:02:19.799> I<00:02:19.980> had<00:02:20.159> with<00:02:20.999> getting<00:02:21.540> these<00:02:21.629> you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
concerns I had with getting these you

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.770 
concerns I had with getting these you
know<00:02:22.709> sight<00:02:22.980> unseen<00:02:23.189> if<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.269> notice<00:02:24.829> the<00:02:25.829> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
know sight unseen if you notice the the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.959 
know sight unseen if you notice the the
tool<00:02:27.780> bit<00:02:27.930> here<00:02:28.139> tapers<00:02:28.769> down<00:02:28.799> when<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.819> gets

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
tool bit here tapers down when it gets

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.479 
tool bit here tapers down when it gets
to<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.209> smaller<00:02:30.680> torque<00:02:31.680> head<00:02:31.829> that<00:02:32.340> was

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
to the smaller torque head that was

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.099 
to the smaller torque head that was
something<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.120> was<00:02:33.180> concerned<00:02:33.540> about<00:02:33.659> because

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
something I was concerned about because

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.240 
something I was concerned about because
with<00:02:34.950> hex<00:02:35.549> keys<00:02:36.139> if<00:02:37.139> you<00:02:37.620> notice<00:02:37.920> I'll<00:02:38.040> grab

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
with hex keys if you notice I'll grab

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.509 
with hex keys if you notice I'll grab
the<00:02:38.400> smallest<00:02:38.819> hex<00:02:39.090> key<00:02:39.329> there<00:02:39.739> it's<00:02:40.739> all<00:02:41.040> one

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
the smallest hex key there it's all one

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.330 
the smallest hex key there it's all one
size<00:02:41.790> all<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.329> way<00:02:42.419> down<00:02:42.629> so<00:02:43.019> if<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.530> bend<00:02:44.099> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
size all the way down so if you bend it

working on working on something you can
damage<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.859> whole<00:02:50.359> whole<00:02:51.359> tool<00:02:51.739> with<00:02:52.739> this

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
damage the whole whole tool with this

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.390 
damage the whole whole tool with this
since<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.639> tapers<00:02:54.120> down<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:55.019> have<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.500> larger

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
since it tapers down you have the larger

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.390 
since it tapers down you have the larger
size<00:02:56.669> of<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:58.260> main<00:02:58.439> body<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.949> then<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.189> head

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
size of the main body and then the head

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.250 
size of the main body and then the head
tapers<00:02:59.969> down<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.419> size<00:03:00.599> that<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.900> need<00:03:01.079> so

tapers down to the size that you need so

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.349 
tapers down to the size that you need so
it<00:03:01.590> actually<00:03:01.889> makes<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.159> very<00:03:02.790> very<00:03:03.150> sturdy

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
it actually makes it very very sturdy

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.939 
it actually makes it very very sturdy
we'll<00:03:06.359> jump<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.169> to<00:03:07.439> some<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.799> other

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:07.949 
we'll jump on to some of the other

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:09.289 
we'll jump on to some of the other
things<00:03:08.219> we<00:03:08.459> have<00:03:08.489> here

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
things we have here

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.709 
things we have here
I<00:03:09.769> folded<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.889> away<00:03:11.099> actually<00:03:11.540> they<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.900> a

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719 
I folded it away actually they have a

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.659 
I folded it away actually they have a
sharpening<00:03:15.719> rod<00:03:15.930> now<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:17.099> sharpening<00:03:17.489> rod

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
sharpening rod now the sharpening rod

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.879 
sharpening rod now the sharpening rod
well<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.419> nice<00:03:18.659> little<00:03:18.930> extra<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.829> I

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
well it's a nice little extra that I

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.800 
well it's a nice little extra that I
wasn't<00:03:20.129> expecting<00:03:20.639> because<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:20.939> didn't<00:03:21.479> really

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
wasn't expecting because I didn't really

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.550 
wasn't expecting because I didn't really
read<00:03:22.560> into<00:03:22.889> it<00:03:23.099> that<00:03:23.400> much<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.840> it's<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:25.139> pretty

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
read into it that much so it's a pretty

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.830 
read into it that much so it's a pretty
much<00:03:25.650> like<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.829> rat<00:03:26.069> tail<00:03:26.250> file<00:03:26.579> its<00:03:27.060> limbs<00:03:27.569> down

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
much like a rat tail file its limbs down

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.229 
much like a rat tail file its limbs down
it's<00:03:28.470> made<00:03:28.829> of<00:03:29.009> the<00:03:29.099> same<00:03:29.280> material<00:03:29.790> as<00:03:29.939> all

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
it's made of the same material as all

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.289 
it's made of the same material as all
the<00:03:30.419> other<00:03:30.540> bits<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:32.040> it's<00:03:32.220> stainless<00:03:32.909> steel

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
the other bits so it's stainless steel

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.140 
the other bits so it's stainless steel
that<00:03:33.629> was<00:03:33.930> bead<00:03:34.290> blasted<00:03:34.979> to<00:03:35.549> give<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.090> a

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
that was bead blasted to give it a

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.839 
that was bead blasted to give it a
slightly<00:03:36.569> rougher<00:03:37.199> texture<00:03:37.590> now<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.669> is

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
slightly rougher texture now this is

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.080 
slightly rougher texture now this is
good<00:03:39.269> for<00:03:39.569> sharpening<00:03:40.790> serrations<00:03:41.790> if<00:03:41.970> your

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
good for sharpening serrations if your

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.960 
good for sharpening serrations if your
knife<00:03:42.239> has<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.259> only<00:03:43.439> downfall<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:44.159> it's

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
knife has that the only downfall is it's

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.990 
knife has that the only downfall is it's
just<00:03:45.449> be<00:03:45.750> blasted<00:03:46.259> stainless<00:03:46.620> steel<00:03:46.919> so<00:03:47.549> I

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
just be blasted stainless steel so I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.849 
just be blasted stainless steel so I
mean<00:03:48.329> it's<00:03:48.629> gonna<00:03:48.780> scratch<00:03:49.259> it<00:03:49.290> up<00:03:49.500> really

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
mean it's gonna scratch it up really

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.830 
mean it's gonna scratch it up really
good<00:03:50.159> if<00:03:50.849> you<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.030> something<00:03:51.419> better<00:03:51.569> at
