00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.109
 talk of the group what to do a 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.260
 tutorial that the people asked of the video that 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:16.890
 posted on the flip or nightmare clothesline 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.260
 flip that a lot of people call you good 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.539
 know the flip biologist 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.340
 technically have to know the flip and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.279
 Owari to the clip 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.279
 the change lies here on the basis of the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.189
 old wolf filip holosko the base of the flip 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.989
 you use more or less this basis 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.410
 I use this also variable basis of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.510
 mapfre varial flip that have varied anfip 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.190
 The only secret is the following foot one 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.469
 A little more on the tip for example is 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.379
 more pop to give time to rotate and foot 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.809
 the front a little further back one 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.120
 a little more on the tip because so 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.120
 Can you make a spinning answer? 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.719
 faster when you hit here 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.910
 it will run faster than 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.090
 normal 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.640
 booed on flickr this maneuver 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.890
 it requires a lot of effort in this 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.080
 technique for those who know how to vary the clip 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.260
 it's so hard, you just need 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.400
 put the foot a little behind 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.900
 tabatinga is stronger 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.670
 the tip to hit the end of the conflict 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.970
 it is also the following 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.369
 at the time you hit pop do not wait 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.830
 he climbed a lot to kick flip already hit 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.200
 sucking flip because you expected to hit 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.890
 It's going to run very high, it's going to jump. 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.100
 much to power there is a poster skateboard 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.770
 hinder 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.290
 so it's easier you give pop in time 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.259
 it is the dell pop to give the chutÃ£o 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.040
 clip it will already go up and rotate the clip 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.590
 same time we used very common from dubai 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.590
 to the new clip or is it you fall training 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.040
 so because I do not push it enough 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.840
 to spin or you fall with the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.909
 front and skateboarding 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.320
 This is because you are 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.420
 unbalanced skateboard you were with 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.180
 body far behind the body much to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.239
 North front was the tip for this 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.640
 I know the body straight line straight head 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:15.230
 down and aim at the optical skateboard goes 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:24.470
 fall that's all we insist and have ahead 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:26.860
 a little to leave but the sky gets more or 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.860
 less so 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.549
 oh look there 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.900
 oh my death ae
