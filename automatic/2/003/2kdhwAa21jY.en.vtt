00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
just like the top of a good chili dog

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.580 
just like the top of a good chili dog
minus<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.810> chili<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.520> what<00:02:54.520> I<00:02:54.550> mean<00:02:54.700> by<00:02:54.760> that

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
minus the chili and what I mean by that

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.890 
minus the chili and what I mean by that
is<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:57.630> smell<00:02:58.630> I<00:03:00.180> smell<00:03:01.180> like<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.330> mixture<00:03:01.780> of

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
is I smell I smell like a mixture of

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.650 
is I smell I smell like a mixture of
really<00:03:02.860> good<00:03:03.010> spicy<00:03:03.730> mustard<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.390> sauerkraut

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
really good spicy mustard and sauerkraut

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.230 
really good spicy mustard and sauerkraut
that's<00:03:05.530> exactly<00:03:06.130> how<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.490> smells<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.060> there's

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
that's exactly how it smells and there's

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.400 
that's exactly how it smells and there's
no<00:03:07.390> moles<00:03:08.140> or<00:03:08.260> mustard<00:03:08.560> here<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:10.410> don't

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
no moles or mustard here I don't

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.320 
no moles or mustard here I don't
remember<00:03:11.590> what<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:11.920> read<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.850> read<00:03:13.210> it

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
remember what I read I just read it

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.750 
remember what I read I just read it
where<00:03:13.540> is<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.780> um<00:03:14.280> yeah<00:03:15.280> there<00:03:15.460> was<00:03:15.550> ground

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
where is it um yeah there was ground

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.220 
where is it um yeah there was ground
mustard<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.240> it<00:03:16.270> okay<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:16.840> makes<00:03:17.050> sense

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
mustard in it okay so that makes sense

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.760 
mustard in it okay so that makes sense
but<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:18.310> sauerkraut<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:20.230> does<00:03:20.440> not<00:03:20.590> make

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
but the sauerkraut that does not make

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.310 
but the sauerkraut that does not make
sense<00:03:20.830> there's<00:03:21.280> no<00:03:21.430> sauerkraut<00:03:21.760> in<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.320> but

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
sense there's no sauerkraut in this but

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.550 
sense there's no sauerkraut in this but
I<00:03:23.350> guess<00:03:23.500> maybe<00:03:23.710> the<00:03:23.860> vinegar<00:03:25.350> anyway<00:03:26.350> all

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
I guess maybe the vinegar anyway all

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.190 
I guess maybe the vinegar anyway all
right<00:03:26.740> so<00:03:26.950> yeah<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.370> smells<00:03:27.520> like<00:03:27.760> a

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
right so yeah it smells like a

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.230 
right so yeah it smells like a
sauerkraut<00:03:29.200> mustard<00:03:29.650> like<00:03:30.160> hot<00:03:30.490> dog<00:03:30.700> topping

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
sauerkraut mustard like hot dog topping

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.830 
sauerkraut mustard like hot dog topping
combo<00:03:32.130> which<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.340> love<00:03:33.640> although<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:34.540> don't<00:03:34.690> have

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
combo which I love although I don't have

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.210 
combo which I love although I don't have
a<00:03:34.900> hot<00:03:35.050> dog<00:03:35.200> right<00:03:35.440> now<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:35.770> I<00:03:35.830> know<00:03:35.890> how<00:03:36.070> good

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
that's going to taste but we'll see it's

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.750 
that's going to taste but we'll see it's
supposed<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.150> be<00:03:40.240> mild<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:40.840> I'm<00:03:41.710> going<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:41.980> go

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
supposed to be mild so I'm going to go

kind of heavy on the spoon here it's a
thicker<00:03:45.550> consistency<00:03:45.790> okay<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:48.510> I'll

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
thicker consistency okay and so I'll

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.350 
thicker consistency okay and so I'll

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
weird consistency of course I'm trying

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.280 
weird consistency of course I'm trying
this<00:04:41.560> alone<00:04:41.919> and<00:04:42.220> not<00:04:42.340> on<00:04:42.580> food<00:04:43.080> which<00:04:44.080> might

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
this alone and not on food which might

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.750 
this alone and not on food which might
make<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.470> difference<00:04:44.560> but<00:04:45.040> I<00:04:45.250> don't<00:04:45.400> know<00:04:45.520> what

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
make a difference but I don't know what

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.440 
make a difference but I don't know what
i<00:04:45.790> would<00:04:46.000> put<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:46.300> on<00:04:47.760> offhand<00:04:51.300> seemed<00:04:52.300> like

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
i would put this on offhand seemed like

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.150
