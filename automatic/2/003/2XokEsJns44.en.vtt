00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.059
 not only at the eurobike will be 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.400
 bicycles issued but here as 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.770
 at the booth of cora tag will be too 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.259
 Example of how to frame 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.020
 or the person misses 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.090
 and then because of this data the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.489
 right frame height and so on 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.649
 can find out that he marozsÃ¡n ino 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.850
 who stands behind me here and that 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.850
 for cora tecan 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.370
 yes hello my name is michael mack me 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.860
 I'm a student at West Saxon 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.410
 college zwickau and have in the frame 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.610
 my diploma thesis this bike 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:25.850
 developed at the company patria our 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.740
 challenging was to develop a cargo bike 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.290
 something that does not exist yet 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 or as special features 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.930
 would have 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.960
 We said a load wheel takes 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.240
 Lots of room and is mainly in 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.770
 big cities where little used 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.510
 Space is there that is why we have ourselves 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.900
 said okay we do the bike 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.000
 foldable and if it is shortened one 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.940
 reach size as normal 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.780
 tourer was also we have as 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.850
 seen problem 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.490
 the steering handle with many other loads 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.090
 wheels are the deepest and the most extreme 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.710
 part 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.240
 We did not think that was good 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.970
 we have the handlebar somewhere in the 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.950
 In addition, we are integrated as a bicycle 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.290
 measures peasant in germany is for 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.910
 important to us the ergonomics 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.550
 and that's why we have a system 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.310
 integrated where people between 1 meter 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.470
 50 and 1 meter 85 an optimal 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.430
 can achieve seating position or 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.870
 can adjust the bike 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.330
 you have to collapse the here 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.990
 fastest lever 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.030
 this one rejects a stainless steel pipe 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.000
 A polyamide dots runs and shape 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.610
 non-positively help a pass error 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.570
 next i have the handlebar 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.990
 angry 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.850
 Since we have a family review 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.530
 which is not very clear like that 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.530
 in the end, the overall solution is scarce 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.530
 finished 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.970
 hello I'm the ludwig of the race 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.740
 hard and I am here in the entrance area 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.610
 the eurobike 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.740
 we will win the eurobike award 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.760
 issued every year here on the 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.830
 be chosen 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.120
 and I'm going in with you now 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.120
 few of the award winners 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.300
 the first guess would like to introduce yourself 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.430
 is the break 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.610
 this is one of the categories 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.620
 Kreml bikes is one of the bikes 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.900
 relatively new term denoted 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.090
 wheels for the multiple roads 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.800
 Substrates are suitable by the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.450
 wider tire one that means one can 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.630
 even in light terrain with the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.160
 cycling yes sag award won 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.520
 also because of its extraordinary 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.890
 frame shape you can see it here on the frame 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.130
 Triangle really a nice advice of neg 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.690
 I deserve the award won 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.239
 Of course, the eurobike award will not be 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.510
 only wheels awarded but also 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.650
 components garments or even 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.610
 as here also shoes 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.890
 like the mirror by two things 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.020
 especially the tuber attracts attention 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.010
 danger that gaudy orange and be 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.010
 school-system 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.440
 yes he is exceptional and has one 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.320
 Prize won this year 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.840
 so here one or one of the most exciting 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:19.570
 news at the fair the new 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:24.030
 shimano xt with synchro shift the whole 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:27.930
 it is exciting you can switch it that way 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.910
 the derailleur and derailleur itself 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.729
 completely automatic but move 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.449
 show 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.710
 no matter which gear turns on and 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:43.339
 switches decide completely autonomously 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.339
 how they move 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.330
 like every year here on the 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.000
 eurobike also has a test parcours where the 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.390
 Try out the specialist dealers 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.070
 can 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.660
 and yes I have an advice 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.270
 Normally I am caught, too 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.590
 very thin tires on the way 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.960
 Now I thought I'll stay 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.540
 one with really thick mature from one 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.490
 so-called fatback that's the trend 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.870
 almost every manufacturer at eurobike 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.880
 once in the program 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.020
 yes and I'll look at all this here 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.010
 the test track and I'm already 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.010
 curious how it goes 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.520
 two can go back I have to say 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.500
 The wheel is a lot of fun I am 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.600
 surprised how little that is about the 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.990
 Turns yes it is in any case 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.920
 a cool endangered where you have to see 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.690
 what goes with it 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.220
 I have a few others now 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.720
 News at the fair 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.890
 that was the third day on the 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.890
 eurobike soon
