had you know - you know for me myself

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.929 
had you know - you know for me myself
you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.320> my<00:01:52.500> team<00:01:52.680> done<00:01:52.860> remarkable<00:01:53.430> job<00:01:53.670> I

thought<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:54.990> had<00:01:55.079> moments<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> first<00:01:55.920> half

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
thought he had moments in the first half

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.440 
thought he had moments in the first half
of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> fight<00:01:56.549> specifically<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> fourth<00:01:57.270> of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
of the fight specifically the fourth of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.850 
of the fight specifically the fourth of
six<00:01:57.600> round<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.140> thought<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.619> inability

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
six round but I thought this inability

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.130 
six round but I thought this inability
to<00:01:59.130> adjust<00:01:59.700> was<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> major<00:02:00.299> factor<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.020> were

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
to adjust was a major factor you were

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.200 
to adjust was a major factor you were
consistent<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.860> were<00:02:01.979> defensively<00:02:02.520> dominant

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
consistent you were defensively dominant

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270 
consistent you were defensively dominant
you<00:02:03.479> were<00:02:03.600> taking<00:02:03.960> advantage<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.469> situations

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you were taking advantage of situations

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.940 
you were taking advantage of situations
did<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:06.090> halfway<00:02:06.990> through<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.649> fight

did you know halfway through that fight

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.130
