of the trees have stars at the top and I

the<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> star<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.299> thought<00:01:15.540> oh<00:01:15.750> it's

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the how to star but I thought oh it's

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.390 
the how to star but I thought oh it's
just<00:01:16.020> gonna<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.229> overkill<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.100> had<00:01:17.189> way<00:01:17.340> too

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
just gonna be overkill I had way too

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.940 
just gonna be overkill I had way too
much<00:01:17.670> time<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.659> cut<00:01:19.110> out<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> star<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
much time to cut out a star in all of

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.410 
much time to cut out a star in all of
them<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.369> ended<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.850> cutting<00:01:21.000> some<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
them so I ended up cutting some of the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.420 
them so I ended up cutting some of the
stars<00:01:21.659> off<00:01:21.890> that's<00:01:22.890> probably<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> most

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
stars off that's probably the most

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
stars off that's probably the most
time-consuming<00:01:24.180> part<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> card<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.439> just

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
time-consuming part of the card is just

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.109 
time-consuming part of the card is just
cutting<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> trees<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.000> it's

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
cutting out the trees but it's

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.330 
cutting out the trees but it's
completely<00:01:27.299> worth<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> I'm<00:01:28.710> getting<00:01:29.100> ready<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
of like a depth of field

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.780 
of like a depth of field
so<00:02:13.710> some<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.100> trees<00:02:14.340> will<00:02:14.490> be<00:02:14.520> behind

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
so some of the trees will be behind

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.890 
so some of the trees will be behind
others<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.540> there's<00:02:15.660> going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> be

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
others and there's going to be

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.610 
others and there's going to be
overlapping<00:02:17.030> starting<00:02:18.030> out<00:02:18.470> adhering<00:02:19.470> the

trees to the card and I'm used I'm gonna

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.200 
trees to the card and I'm used I'm gonna
be<00:02:22.080> adhering<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.100> trees<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.640> want<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
be adhering the trees that I want in the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.210 
be adhering the trees that I want in the
back<00:02:24.480> first<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.350> I've<00:02:25.770> applied<00:02:25.980> adhesive

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
back first so I've applied adhesive

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.890 
back first so I've applied adhesive
straight<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.910> those<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.360> I'm<00:02:27.420> gonna<00:02:27.600> put<00:02:27.810> it

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
straight onto the card for the trees

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.340 
straight onto the card for the trees
that<00:02:29.970> are<00:02:30.060> gonna<00:02:30.150> be<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.600> front<00:02:30.960> I'm

applying a foam dimensional adhesive and

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.920 
applying a foam dimensional adhesive and
that's<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.470> they'll<00:02:34.650> kinda<00:02:34.950> sit<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.520> away

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
that's so that they'll kinda sit up away

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.800 
that's so that they'll kinda sit up away
from<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.110> tree<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.590> trees<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.190> background

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
from the tree is trees in the background

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.120 
from the tree is trees in the background
so<00:02:39.810> I'm<00:02:39.870> just<00:02:40.050> going<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.260> be<00:02:40.380> arranging<00:02:40.980> the
