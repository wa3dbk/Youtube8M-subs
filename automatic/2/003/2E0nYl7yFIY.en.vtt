00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
transit so I think I believe this is the

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.840 
transit so I think I believe this is the
best<00:00:04.920> strategy<00:00:05.100> guide<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.520> can<00:00:05.670> go<00:00:05.790> to

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.780 
successful and we have to do is just buy
them<00:00:09.599> 16<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.320> just<00:00:10.950> do<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> zombie<00:00:11.429> rape<00:00:11.580> train

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790

so just keep going up and down and the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.919 
so just keep going up and down and the

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
space is actually really wide is the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.689 
space is actually really wide is the
best<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.470> place<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.859> can<00:00:16.890> actually<00:00:17.100> really

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
best in place you can actually really

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.460 
best in place you can actually really
stick<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.300> all<00:00:18.930> I'm<00:00:19.050> saying<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.320> this

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
stick to and all I'm saying is this

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.820 
stick to and all I'm saying is this
place<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.830> best<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.180> do<00:00:21.300> is

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
place is the best so we have to do is

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.230 
place is the best so we have to do is
get<00:00:22.830> em<00:00:22.949> 16<00:00:23.250> every<00:00:23.460> time<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> run<00:00:23.820> our<00:00:23.970> ammo

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
get em 16 every time you run our ammo

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.759 
get em 16 every time you run our ammo
and<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.840> see<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.080> boss<00:00:25.230> keeps<00:00:25.470> coming

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and as you can see the boss keeps coming

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.740 
and as you can see the boss keeps coming
and<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.189> by<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.240> take<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.570> an

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and going by so you can take that to an

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.660 
and going by so you can take that to an
advantage<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.470> every<00:00:28.949> time<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.279> big<00:00:29.460> card

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
advantage so every time is the big card

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
advantage so every time is the big card
as<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.849> can<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.900> bus<00:00:31.230> would

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
as you can see right there the bus would

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.310 
as you can see right there the bus would
just<00:00:31.560> run<00:00:32.460> over<00:00:32.520> them<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.780> will<00:00:33.930> kill<00:00:34.140> them

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
just run over them and it will kill them

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.350 
just run over them and it will kill them
so<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.590> don't<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> waste<00:00:35.370> ammo<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
so you don't have to waste ammo and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
so you don't have to waste ammo and
it'll<00:00:36.480> save<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.750> more<00:00:37.050> time<00:00:37.290> although<00:00:38.040> you're

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it'll save you more time although you're

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.549 
it'll save you more time although you're
gonna<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> lot<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.790> points<00:00:39.530> spending<00:00:40.530> money

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
gonna get a lot of points spending money

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.190 
gonna get a lot of points spending money
on<00:00:40.770> ammo<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> big<00:00:42.059> deal<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.690> at

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
on ammo is not really a big deal but at

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.420 
on ammo is not really a big deal but at
the<00:00:43.320> same<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> bus<00:00:43.980> will<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.250> rid<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the same time the bus will get rid of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.930 
the same time the bus will get rid of
them<00:00:44.550> easier<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.110> was<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.700> save<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.789> time

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
towards the mystery box which is not the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.640 
towards the mystery box which is not the

best location for a mystery box to be in

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.280 
best location for a mystery box to be in
