impossible

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100 

now<00:01:59.100> when<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.310> comes<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.820> bodybuilding<00:02:00.720> we<00:02:00.840> all

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
now when it comes to bodybuilding we all

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.539 
now when it comes to bodybuilding we all
like<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.350> think<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.710> nothing<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.520> impossible

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
like to think that nothing is impossible

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.210 
like to think that nothing is impossible
after<00:02:03.329> all<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.840> whole<00:02:03.990> purpose<00:02:04.560> at<00:02:05.070> his

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
after all that's a whole purpose at his

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.620 
after all that's a whole purpose at his
spot<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.700> able<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.909> make<00:02:06.000> changes<00:02:06.479> that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
spot to be able to make changes that

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.979 
spot to be able to make changes that
above<00:02:06.899> astounding<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.330> amazing<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.509> when<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
above astounding and amazing and when it

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.570 
above astounding and amazing and when it
comes<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.319> your<00:02:10.440> whole<00:02:10.619> physique<00:02:11.039> changing

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
comes to your whole physique changing

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.180 
comes to your whole physique changing
its<00:02:11.700> shape<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.209> size<00:02:12.810> are<00:02:13.200> definite<00:02:13.920> things

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
its shape and size are definite things

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.030 
its shape and size are definite things
that<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:14.790> all<00:02:15.060> aim<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.780> do<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.590> when<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.890> comes

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
that we all aim to do but when it comes

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.190 
that we all aim to do but when it comes
to<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> individual<00:02:18.000> muscle<00:02:18.480> things<00:02:18.840> get<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
to the individual muscle things get a

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.650 
to the individual muscle things get a
little<00:02:19.440> bit<00:02:19.739> trickier<00:02:20.519> you<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:21.239> we've<00:02:21.450> all

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
little bit trickier you see we've all

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.920 
little bit trickier you see we've all
got<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.019> genetic<00:02:22.830> structure<00:02:23.819> or<00:02:24.030> genetic<00:02:24.630> lines

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
got a genetic structure or genetic lines

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.470 
got a genetic structure or genetic lines
which<00:02:25.260> make<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.739> shape<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.670> our<00:02:27.000> muscles

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
which make up the shape of our muscles

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.860 
which make up the shape of our muscles
and<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.470> those<00:02:28.739> genetic<00:02:29.280> lines<00:02:29.519> are<00:02:29.790> very

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
and in that those genetic lines are very

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.300 
and in that those genetic lines are very
difficult<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.260> change<00:02:31.500> those<00:02:31.799> lines<00:02:32.100> will

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
difficult to change those lines will

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.280 
difficult to change those lines will
make<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.670> outline<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.900> muscle<00:02:34.170> which

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
make the outline of the muscle which

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
make the outline of the muscle which
determine<00:02:34.890> what<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.340> muscle<00:02:35.910> will<00:02:36.120> actually

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
determine what that muscle will actually

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.330 
determine what that muscle will actually
look<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.780> from<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.530> start<00:02:37.890> whether<00:02:38.100> it's<00:02:38.280> a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
look like from the start whether it's a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.220 
look like from the start whether it's a
small<00:02:38.610> muscle<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.360> completion<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
small muscle to the completion of

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.410 
small muscle to the completion of
building<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.830> muscle<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.430> when<00:02:42.269> it's

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
building that muscle and when it's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.150 
building that muscle and when it's
finished<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.380> give<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.010> quick

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
finished just to give you a quick

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.630 
finished just to give you a quick
example<00:02:45.110> as<00:02:46.110> your<00:02:46.380> quickly<00:02:46.620> show<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.040> for

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
example as your quickly show you for

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.520 
example as your quickly show you for
instance<00:02:47.880> much<00:02:48.120> as<00:02:48.330> we<00:02:48.450> all<00:02:48.660> like<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.200> chess

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
instance much as we all like a chess

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.250 
instance much as we all like a chess
that<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:49.830> square<00:02:50.310> across<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.760> bottom<00:02:50.910> and

that is square across the bottom and
