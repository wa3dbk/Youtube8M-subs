00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
this is just showing how that that can

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.950 
this is just showing how that that can
get<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> crazy<00:00:35.910> situation<00:00:36.210> i<00:00:36.809> mean

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
get out of like a crazy situation i mean

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.630 
get out of like a crazy situation i mean
really<00:00:37.140> comes<00:00:37.530> down<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.739> birthing<00:00:38.250> pod<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
really comes down to birthing pod the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
really comes down to birthing pod the
very<00:00:38.850> powerful<00:00:39.300> card<00:00:39.590> still<00:00:40.590> extremely

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
very powerful card still extremely

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.700 
very powerful card still extremely
underrated<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:42.570> anyway<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:42.989> here's<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> list

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
underrated but anyway so here's the list

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.610 
underrated but anyway so here's the list
right<00:00:43.950> now<00:00:44.239> really<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> idea<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.140> deck<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
right now really the idea of the deck is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.069 
right now really the idea of the deck is
that<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.070> comes<00:00:47.309> from<00:00:47.430> an<00:00:47.969> agro<00:00:48.420> standpoint

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that it comes from an agro standpoint

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.189 
that it comes from an agro standpoint
however<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.460> got<00:00:50.940> kind<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> combo

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
however it's got kind of the combo

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.020 
however it's got kind of the combo
pieces<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.160> splinter<00:00:53.489> twin<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
pieces in it for splinter twin and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.680 
pieces in it for splinter twin and
deceiver<00:00:54.600> eggs<00:00:54.750> arc<00:00:56.090> however<00:00:57.090> splinter<00:00:57.449> twins

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
deceiver eggs arc however splinter twins

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.930 
deceiver eggs arc however splinter twins
not<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.770> deceiver<00:00:59.190> exarch<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.789> you

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
not just for the deceiver exarch if you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.209 
not just for the deceiver exarch if you
notice<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.020> pop<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.710> an<00:01:01.829> acidic

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
notice you can pop it on on an acidic

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.509 
notice you can pop it on on an acidic
slime<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.730> frost<00:01:03.300> titan<00:01:04.040> metamorph<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> great

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
slime a frost titan metamorph is a great

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.410 
slime a frost titan metamorph is a great
target<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.860> there's<00:01:08.490> more<00:01:08.820> than<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.180> good

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
target it so there's more than one good

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
target it so there's more than one good
target<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.380> especially<00:01:11.100> citic

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
target for it here especially citic

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.399 
target for it here especially citic
slime<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> frost<00:01:12.390> titan<00:01:12.750> often<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.290> i'll

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
slime and frost titan often that i'll

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.660 
slime and frost titan often that i'll
just<00:01:13.590> end<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.860> game<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> they'll<00:01:14.400> scoop

just end the game and they'll scoop

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.510 
just end the game and they'll scoop
phase<00:01:14.939> anyways<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.140> really<00:01:16.500> you've<00:01:16.680> got<00:01:16.890> close

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
phase anyways so really you've got close

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.870 
phase anyways so really you've got close
to<00:01:17.729> 11<00:01:18.150> actually<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.869> about<00:01:18.990> 11

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
to 11 actually you do have about 11

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.999 
to 11 actually you do have about 11
cards<00:01:20.880> well<00:01:21.299> plus<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> worm<00:01:22.020> coil<00:01:22.290> 12<00:01:22.650> that

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
cards well plus the worm coil 12 that

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.880 
cards well plus the worm coil 12 that
can<00:01:23.850> pretty<00:01:24.090> much<00:01:24.180> end<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> game<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.439> left

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
can pretty much end the game if left

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
can pretty much end the game if left
unanswered<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:28.220> but<00:01:29.220> i<00:01:29.430> had<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.299> Avenged<00:01:30.479> vons

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
unanswered so but i had the Avenged vons

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.149 
unanswered so but i had the Avenged vons
just<00:01:30.990> because<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.470> deck<00:01:31.619> needed<00:01:31.979> some

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
just because the deck needed some

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.460 
just because the deck needed some
pressure<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.659> make<00:01:33.810> vengevine<00:01:34.170> better

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
pressure and to make vengevine better

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.410 
pressure and to make vengevine better
obviously<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:35.070> need<00:01:35.220> more<00:01:35.460> creatures<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.180> we

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
obviously we need more creatures so we

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.969 
obviously we need more creatures so we
cut<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> explorer's<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> nest<00:01:37.560> invaders

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
cut the explorer's for the nest invaders

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
cut the explorer's for the nest invaders
because<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> accomplishes<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.180> same<00:01:39.210> thing

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
because it accomplishes the same thing

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.950 
because it accomplishes the same thing
mostly<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.310> ramps<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.810> will

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
mostly in that it ramps you it will

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.170 
mostly in that it ramps you it will
recur<00:01:43.290> vengevine<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.280> also<00:01:44.460> helps<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> agro

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
recur vengevine it also helps the agro

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270 
recur vengevine it also helps the agro
matchup<00:01:45.570> because<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.049> get<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.439> tokens<00:01:46.950> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
matchup because we get the tokens and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.340 
matchup because we get the tokens and
all<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.509> block<00:01:49.079> block<00:01:49.320> block

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
all you want to do is block block block

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.350 
all you want to do is block block block
until<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> four<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:50.909> five<00:01:51.060> mana

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
until you can get to four or five mana

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.800 
until you can get to four or five mana
so<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.860> decks<00:01:53.070> been<00:01:53.399> much<00:01:53.729> more<00:01:53.939> tuned<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.479> cut

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
so the decks been much more tuned I cut

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.630 
so the decks been much more tuned I cut
the<00:01:55.020> copper<00:01:55.350> language<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:56.040> raising<00:01:56.340> reading

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the copper language for raising reading

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 
the copper language for raising reading
also<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.659> more<00:01:57.840> aggressive<00:01:58.079> they<00:01:58.710> come

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
artifact hate for it and in fact we can

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.629 
artifact hate for it and in fact we can
really<00:03:18.709> change<00:03:19.709> your<00:03:19.859> sideboard<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.519> the

sideboard<00:03:21.030> might<00:03:21.209> end<00:03:21.419> up<00:03:21.510> changing<00:03:21.780> because

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
sideboard might end up changing because

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.409 
sideboard might end up changing because
of<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:23.069> fact<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.430> we<00:03:23.579> can<00:03:23.730> change<00:03:24.239> your

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
of this the fact that we can change your

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.599 
of this the fact that we can change your
sideboard<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.959> become<00:03:25.200> more<00:03:25.410> aggro<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.069> just

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
sideboard to become more aggro and just

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.119 
sideboard to become more aggro and just
remove<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.000> enchantments<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.810> removal<00:03:28.260> will

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
remove the enchantments and removal will

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.830 
remove the enchantments and removal will
create<00:03:29.489> completely<00:03:30.150> dead<00:03:30.329> cards<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.750> your

create completely dead cards in your

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.990 
create completely dead cards in your
opponent's<00:03:31.260> hand<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:32.040> you're<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.519> strict

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
opponent's hand so you're the strict

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.520 
opponent's hand so you're the strict
advantage<00:03:33.510> there<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.959> fact<00:03:34.200> we'll<00:03:34.349> probably

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
advantage there in fact we'll probably

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.440 
advantage there in fact we'll probably
put<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.859> fourth<00:03:35.099> bench<00:03:35.310> run<00:03:35.549> in<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.819> side<00:03:36.060> so

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
put the fourth bench run in the side so

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.690 
put the fourth bench run in the side so
i'll<00:03:36.900> post<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.440> list<00:03:37.650> what<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.340> think<00:03:38.609> it

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
i'll post the list what I think it

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.800 
i'll post the list what I think it
should<00:03:38.849> be<00:03:38.879> at<00:03:39.180> at<00:03:39.359> this<00:03:39.510> point<00:03:41.540> that's<00:03:42.540> great

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
should be at at this point that's great

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.599 
should be at at this point that's great
a<00:03:42.900> bolt<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.500> would<00:03:43.680> have<00:03:43.799> been<00:03:43.889> devastating

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
a bolt here would have been devastating

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.849 
a bolt here would have been devastating
as<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.359> always<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.660> when<00:03:45.959> your<00:03:46.109> Cobra<00:03:46.410> dies<00:03:46.560> if

frost<00:05:34.650> titans<00:05:35.010> however<00:05:35.419> I<00:05:36.419> think<00:05:37.229> we<00:05:37.349> will<00:05:37.530> be

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
frost titans however I think we will be

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.730 
frost titans however I think we will be
a<00:05:37.770> lot<00:05:37.979> more<00:05:38.010> once<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.700> medicom<00:05:39.180> so<00:05:39.740> just

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
a lot more once this medicom so just

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.020 
a lot more once this medicom so just
because<00:05:40.860> we'll<00:05:41.070> be<00:05:41.099> seeing<00:05:41.430> valla<00:05:41.610> coot<00:05:41.849> and

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
because we'll be seeing valla coot and

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.790 
because we'll be seeing valla coot and
remember<00:05:42.450> how<00:05:42.780> good<00:05:43.080> frost<00:05:43.349> titan<00:05:43.680> was

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
remember how good frost titan was

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.500 
remember how good frost titan was
against<00:05:44.220> it<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:44.490> that's<00:05:45.000> kind<00:05:45.270> of<00:05:45.330> why<00:05:45.479> I

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
against it and that's kind of why I

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.120 
against it and that's kind of why I
built<00:05:45.720> this<00:05:45.930> tech<00:05:46.169> because<00:05:46.380> i'm<00:05:46.650> expecting

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
built this tech because i'm expecting

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.120 
built this tech because i'm expecting
splinter<00:05:47.580> twin<00:05:47.729> and<00:05:48.090> valla<00:05:48.720> cute<00:05:49.050> heavily<00:05:49.650> so

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
splinter twin and valla cute heavily so

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.279 
splinter twin and valla cute heavily so
both<00:05:50.700> those<00:05:50.910> decks<00:05:51.180> can<00:05:51.479> be<00:05:51.720> destroyed<00:05:52.050> by

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
both those decks can be destroyed by

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.980 
both those decks can be destroyed by
cutting<00:05:52.620> off<00:05:52.770> their<00:05:53.070> mana<00:05:53.370> sources<00:05:53.990> and

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
cutting off their mana sources and

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.580 
cutting off their mana sources and
that's<00:05:55.260> that's<00:05:55.560> how<00:05:55.889> this<00:05:56.070> deck<00:05:56.310> spawned<00:05:57.590> but

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
that's that's how this deck spawned but

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.370 
that's that's how this deck spawned but
so<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:59.010> agri<00:05:59.280> matchup<00:05:59.699> i<00:06:00.139> decided<00:06:01.139> actually

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
so the agri matchup i decided actually

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.260 
so the agri matchup i decided actually
was<00:06:01.770> suffering<00:06:02.190> so<00:06:02.400> how<00:06:02.849> to<00:06:02.910> make<00:06:03.090> some

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
was suffering so how to make some

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.360 
was suffering so how to make some
adjustments<00:06:03.780> for<00:06:03.930> that<00:06:04.199> and<00:06:04.470> this<00:06:04.800> list<00:06:05.099> does

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
adjustments for that and this list does

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.270 
adjustments for that and this list does
compensate<00:06:06.240> for<00:06:06.449> that<00:06:06.650> so<00:06:07.650> we're<00:06:08.070> in<00:06:08.099> a<00:06:08.250> very

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
compensate for that so we're in a very

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.029 
compensate for that so we're in a very
very<00:06:08.849> rough<00:06:09.060> position<00:06:09.270> obviously<00:06:09.830> he's<00:06:10.830> going

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
very rough position obviously he's going

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.400 
very rough position obviously he's going
to<00:06:11.099> get<00:06:11.250> up<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.550> three<00:06:11.789> cards<00:06:12.180> we<00:06:12.990> get<00:06:13.229> this

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
to get up to three cards we get this

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.469 
to get up to three cards we get this
slime<00:06:13.740> and<00:06:14.130> here's<00:06:14.820> here's<00:06:15.210> where<00:06:15.360> it<00:06:15.449> gets

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
slime and here's here's where it gets

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.779 
slime and here's here's where it gets
awesome<00:06:16.020> because<00:06:16.169> we<00:06:17.099> get<00:06:17.250> to<00:06:17.310> get<00:06:17.490> rid<00:06:17.610> of<00:06:17.669> the

don't<00:07:30.940> rotate<00:07:31.150> out<00:07:31.540> until<00:07:31.960> the<00:07:32.229> 29<00:07:32.770> so<00:07:33.100> it

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 
don't rotate out until the 29 so it

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.100 
don't rotate out until the 29 so it
should<00:07:33.940> probably<00:07:34.479> it<00:07:34.690> would<00:07:34.840> have<00:07:34.960> showed

should probably it would have showed

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.930 
should probably it would have showed
promise<00:07:35.500> then<00:07:35.740> I<00:07:35.950> think<00:07:36.430> it's<00:07:36.550> really<00:07:36.729> going

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:36.940 
promise then I think it's really going

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.360 
promise then I think it's really going
to<00:07:37.000> show<00:07:37.180> promise<00:07:37.600> after<00:07:37.780> the<00:07:38.350> the<00:07:39.039> bannings

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.370 
to show promise after the the bannings

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.830 
to show promise after the the bannings
take<00:07:39.610> place<00:07:39.880> so<00:07:40.350> thanks<00:07:41.350> for<00:07:41.440> listening
