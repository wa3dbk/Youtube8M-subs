00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.210
 about my style where i get my inspiration 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.110
 where I like to go shopping and shopping 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.509
 maybe I have two more 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.000
 basic tips for you guys 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.100
 So where could I start? 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.539
 I'll briefly describe Mainz at it 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.310
 every case as easily appoint him 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.810
 playful with a certain elegance that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.789
 has now in january 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.680
 bit developed earlier i have 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.600
 happy to print flowers with flowers 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.340
 Ballerinas combines pastel colors and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.630
 that is still true today, but it is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.040
 but a little more elegant I would 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.320
 saying having grown up shows 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.320
 give you an example of this 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.600
 at the very beginning of my career 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.680
 and now my outfit wants this 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.680
 took place recently 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.350
 there you can already in different 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.660
 and I got inspiration as well 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.010
 like her from magazines sometimes too 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.330
 still from the television but most 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.940
 time really online in the net 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.310
 other blogs online magazine online 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.960
 Shops that just offer inspiration 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.710
 I combine what new trends meet 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 imagine 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.660
 that certainly makes me so and where 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.010
 I go shopping of course in course 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.990
 my place of residence in the shopping mile 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.790
 I often go to the shops but 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.250
 of course online as well will be us all 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.630
 but with the big suspects meet 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.520
 I did get so accustomed to times 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.020
 it can be found again and something else 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.670
 to have the sound already if I have 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.710
 my vacation is just so short and 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.990
 your cities will join the family 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.610
 friends or with the friend me 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.200
 put some money aside and me 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.880
 then something special it might be 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.259
 not in Germany or in general they 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.070
 Everyone gives us and I have styling 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.530
 tips for you 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.780
 I think you are already very good in 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.580
 What I'm wearing is not sad but 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.990
 sometimes there are days where you are 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.280
 in front of the wardrobe and me 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.729
 I think I have nothing to wear 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.940
 although this thing is proppevoll therefore 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.050
 30 always to two rules 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.340
 maybe something very simple 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.899
 jeans top and gate to then I reach for 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.550
 statement chain to one to one 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.170
 flashy lipstick and yours 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.660
 bag of its eye-catching color around that 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.700
 spice upfit once again 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.800
 the other way round, if I really have one already 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.750
 Dress is something completely correct 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.080
 has nice pattern or a flashy 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.849
 color then I go to the rather decent 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.620
 thing ran and take a news 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.900
 lipstick and a kennedy drops completely 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.640
 narrow is the one hardly sees or even 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.140
 no jewelry and a bag itself 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.880
 color a bit like that 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.099
 These are two teams I give you 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.750
 and of course one of the 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.310
 it still very important the third the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.440
 Did not mention it at the beginning 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.450
 you have to feel comfortable so no matter what you do 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.310
 you just have to feel good and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.780
 recognize you in it 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.000
 that is absolutely important because I believe 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.190
 You can see that no matter what the trend 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.840
 just happened on the street when he 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.200
 does not fit you, then this is not 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.420
 bad 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.010
 we just ignore it and look at it 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.870
 what you like and then you are 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.459
 simply dressed on well so I think 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.280
 that in the three tips I like you 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.739
 would give and will also be in 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.970
 two more posts for you 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.670
 and answer but this time 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.019
 Writing once turned to how 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.660
 I have my accessories on my blog 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.069
 present and in the second contribution 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.810
 why is that why? 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.739
 It was actually a must have 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.010
 at least for me so the s33 look forward 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.010
 we us
