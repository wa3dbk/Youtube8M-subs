was showing you how you can kind of get

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.610 
was showing you how you can kind of get
um<00:02:34.860> pro<00:02:35.220> spamming<00:02:35.670> up<00:02:35.790> it's<00:02:36.420> not<00:02:36.630> exactly<00:02:37.350> but

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
um pro spamming up it's not exactly but

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.530 
um pro spamming up it's not exactly but
um<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:37.950> increases<00:02:38.550> your<00:02:38.670> knife<00:02:38.940> speed<00:02:39.360> you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
um this increases your knife speed you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.790 
um this increases your knife speed you
guys<00:02:39.660> can<00:02:39.870> see<00:02:39.989> whenever<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.440> hold<00:02:40.680> out<00:02:40.769> a

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
guys can see whenever you hold out a

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.670 
guys can see whenever you hold out a
turbine<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.970> knife<00:02:42.209> like<00:02:42.450> twice<00:02:42.870> as<00:02:43.080> fast<00:02:43.350> and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
turbine you knife like twice as fast and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.190 
turbine you knife like twice as fast and
it<00:02:43.860> also<00:02:44.010> increases<00:02:44.430> your<00:02:44.820> sprint<00:02:45.239> speed<00:02:45.480> so

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it also increases your sprint speed so

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.199 
it also increases your sprint speed so
you<00:02:46.260> could<00:02:46.500> like<00:02:46.739> sprint<00:02:47.160> twice<00:02:47.519> as<00:02:47.730> fast<00:02:47.940> if

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
you could like sprint twice as fast if

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.340 
you could like sprint twice as fast if
you<00:02:48.300> guys<00:02:48.450> are<00:02:48.600> just<00:02:48.630> trying<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.050> get<00:02:49.170> from<00:02:49.320> one

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
you guys are just trying to get from one

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.259 
you guys are just trying to get from one
location<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.950> another<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.940> could<00:02:51.120> um

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
location to another you could um

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.030 
location to another you could um
definitely<00:02:51.600> just<00:02:52.140> pull<00:02:52.290> out<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.440> turbine<00:02:52.860> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
definitely just pull out a turbine and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.440 
definitely just pull out a turbine and
then<00:02:53.130> run<00:02:53.340> with<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.790> since<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.180> knife

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
then run with it and since you knife

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.449 
then run with it and since you knife
faster<00:02:54.959> you'll<00:02:55.500> be<00:02:55.590> able<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.800> run<00:02:55.980> faster<00:02:56.430> and

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
faster you'll be able to run faster and

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.550 
faster you'll be able to run faster and
knife<00:02:57.000> dumb<00:02:57.269> little<00:02:57.570> Dennis's<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.380> are<00:02:58.470> on

barriers so basically you guys are gonna
want<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.700> bit<00:03:05.880> rebuild<00:03:06.390> barriers<00:03:07.319> like<00:03:07.470> 50

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
want a bit rebuild barriers like 50

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.910 
want a bit rebuild barriers like 50
times<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.850> my<00:03:09.060> one<00:03:09.510> game<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.050> stuff<00:03:10.320> so
