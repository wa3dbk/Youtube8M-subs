it different from the later version is

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.320 
it different from the later version is
we<00:03:43.620> have<00:03:43.770> this<00:03:43.920> angel<00:03:44.490> that's<00:03:44.670> sustaining

more<00:04:07.110> than<00:04:07.230> anything<00:04:07.440> else<00:04:07.650> we<00:04:07.920> would

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
more than anything else we would

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.230 
more than anything else we would
probably<00:04:08.250> say<00:04:08.580> he<00:04:08.730> just<00:04:08.910> looks<00:04:09.060> pretty

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
probably say he just looks pretty

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.410 
probably say he just looks pretty
surprised<00:04:09.720> by<00:04:10.050> what's<00:04:10.560> going<00:04:10.710> on<00:04:11.420> this

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
surprised by what's going on this

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.480 
surprised by what's going on this
particular<00:04:12.750> version<00:04:13.230> of<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:14.010> conversion<00:04:14.400> of

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
particular version of the conversion of

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.890 
particular version of the conversion of
Saint<00:04:14.700> Paul<00:04:14.850> is<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.150> brighter<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.780> two

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
Saint Paul is the brighter of the two

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.500 
Saint Paul is the brighter of the two
paintings<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:17.310> really<00:04:17.460> owes<00:04:17.700> more<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.299> the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
paintings and it really owes more to the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.070 
paintings and it really owes more to the
Mannerist<00:04:19.470> tradition<00:04:20.479> mannerism<00:04:21.479> being<00:04:21.810> this

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
Mannerist tradition mannerism being this

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.260 
Mannerist tradition mannerism being this
sort<00:04:22.350> of<00:04:22.440> movement<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:23.130> emerged<00:04:23.280> toward<00:04:24.120> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
sort of movement that emerged toward the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.090 
sort of movement that emerged toward the
end<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.600> Italian<00:04:24.720> high<00:04:25.260> Renaissance<00:04:25.800> and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
end of the Italian high Renaissance and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.320 
end of the Italian high Renaissance and
eventually<00:04:26.880> what<00:04:27.000> act

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
eventually what act

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.960 
eventually what act
of<00:04:27.479> a<00:04:27.539> bridge<00:04:27.810> into<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.199> Baroque<00:04:28.610> era<00:04:29.610> that

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
of a bridge into the Baroque era that

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.230 
of a bridge into the Baroque era that
that<00:04:30.270> followed<00:04:30.659> the<00:04:30.750> Renaissance<00:04:31.400> in<00:04:32.400> the

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
that followed the Renaissance in the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.510 
that followed the Renaissance in the
second<00:04:33.599> painting<00:04:33.810> we<00:04:34.770> see<00:04:35.009> the<00:04:35.159> conversion

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
second painting we see the conversion

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.820 
second painting we see the conversion
primarily<00:04:36.419> not<00:04:36.659> actually<00:04:37.080> through<00:04:37.289> saw<00:04:37.590> but

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
primarily not actually through saw but

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.649 
primarily not actually through saw but
through<00:04:38.009> his<00:04:38.159> horse<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:39.030> this<00:04:39.180> applies<00:04:39.479> to

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
through his horse and this applies to

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.390 
through his horse and this applies to
the<00:04:39.750> first<00:04:39.870> painting<00:04:40.199> too<00:04:40.439> although<00:04:40.650> I<00:04:41.009> think

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
the first painting too although I think

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.529 
the first painting too although I think
it<00:04:41.580> may<00:04:41.699> be<00:04:41.759> a<00:04:41.849> little<00:04:42.030> bit<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.240> lesser

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
it may be a little bit of a lesser

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.469 
it may be a little bit of a lesser
extent<00:04:43.020> but<00:04:43.830> but<00:04:44.159> look<00:04:44.340> at<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.909> horse<00:04:45.150> look<00:04:45.419> at

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
extent but but look at the horse look at

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.779 
extent but but look at the horse look at
the<00:04:45.569> expression<00:04:45.990> on<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.199> horse<00:04:46.520> right<00:04:47.520> souls

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
the expression on the horse right souls

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.010 
the expression on the horse right souls

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
just kind of laying on the ground it's

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.110 
just kind of laying on the ground it's
