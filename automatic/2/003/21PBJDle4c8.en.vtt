 flyer from 19 90 raster and his 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.859
 sponsors 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.730
 this is not a purposeful community like that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 old oldenburger proves that vechta 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.099
 insurance company with claus 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.349
 Thiessen at the top is the club 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.869
 faithful for a long time it's important 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.000
 Sponsors from the region also become one 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.950
 keep such a club if he sometimes 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 then drop the chance we still have 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.350
 to give with the appropriate means 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.160
 then again next year 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.329
 rise 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.550
 I think it's one of ours 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.110
 main points that we have said 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.120
 continue like in the last one 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.260
 year as much as support 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.690
 last year because we unite this 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.059
 Just come back in the first Bundesliga 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.680
 want to see and then ultimately 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.480
 it comes again for us in the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.199
 limited dimensions benefit which also makes itself 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.199
 happy about it 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.550
 but here is I think only once this 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.129
 regional engagement much more important for 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.110
 us as just hold us in any 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.729
 to see form outside the advertising 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.010
 to be seen in the rooms of the old ones 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.320
 oldenburger is for press and sponsors 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.570
 raster's new team today is everyone 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 there and good news for the coach 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.369
 they are all fit and that's great too 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.650
 raster maker stefan niemeyer can 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.659
 it's hard to wait for his guys on the show 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.000
 We first saw parquet 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.860
 naturally known players brought to the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.810
 one but we already have bailey 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.579
 for example, once again one 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.829
 brought young players and we have that 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.860
 yes also from earlier days experienced that 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.210
 Players grow with their duties 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.000
 And if you look at the evolution of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.930
 Richie Williams looks for example and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.920
 yes I think have a good mix 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.659
 out of everything 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.939
 And that was our goal too 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.619
 not busy crew 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.070
 only five six good but we have 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.390
 already a good man and I am 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.860
 I am quite confident that we have one 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.869
 very important role in this league 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.520
 This is not just supposed to be sporty 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.380
 but also apply financially 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.899
 This summer has raster again 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.670
 diligent sponsored acquisition and operated 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.540
 many many partners in the grid bot 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.280
 held 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.079
 economically this year would be no 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.420
 so we cut with one 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.340
 similar budget as in the bbl season 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.870
 I am very happy 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.700
 Of course that's the company 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.250
 further bind them to us, we could some 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.540
 Companies can win what we do 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.120
 was also very important to us and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.130
 We now have 100 130 partners in our 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.080
 side the go with us also in 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.730
 the second league what a lot 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.560
 is worth a lot and with what we just then 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.300
 can not plan in the long term either 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.400
 fans have to wait longer for longer 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.800
 Tickets next week will be the new ones 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.140
 season tickets will be sent out tomorrow 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.660

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.670
 become 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.680
 Of course, I want to wish that we 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.239
 sold out as quickly as possible 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.860
 I sell out in the short term 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.200
 We unfortunately do not know anymore 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.630
 could issue life cards and therefore 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.819
 is just a few but they are necessarily 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.350
 still want to have cards and we are 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.390

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.260
