was he took he he thought the rumble in
the<00:01:04.559> ps3<00:01:05.189> controller<00:01:06.080> wasn't<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.229> good<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.710> he

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the ps3 controller wasn't as good as he

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.660 
the ps3 controller wasn't as good as he
wanted<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.240> what<00:01:09.720> he<00:01:09.840> did<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.670> take

wanted it to be so what he did was take
um<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.830> forgot<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.220> those<00:01:14.369> things<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.850> but

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
um I forgot what those things are but

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.359 
um I forgot what those things are but
they're<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.560> each<00:01:16.560> side<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> ps2

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
they're in each side on the ps2

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.460 
they're in each side on the ps2
controller<00:01:17.909> which<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> same<00:01:19.200> thing

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
controller which are the same thing

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.260 
controller which are the same thing
knocked<00:01:19.650> down<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> ps3<00:01:20.490> controller<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.150> he

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
knocked down on the ps3 controller so he

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.380 
knocked down on the ps3 controller so he
took<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> them<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.860> he<00:01:23.189> put<00:01:23.400> them<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
took one of them and he put them on the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.140 
took one of them and he put them on the
left<00:01:24.570> side<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:25.170> which<00:01:25.890> causes<00:01:26.369> which

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
left side I think which causes which

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.429 
left side I think which causes which
causes<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> rumble<00:01:28.430> yes<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:30.229> rumbles<00:01:31.229> much

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
causes the rumble yes it rumbles much

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.120 
causes the rumble yes it rumbles much
much<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.520> better<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:33.200> crazy<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.590> could

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
much much more better it's crazy I could

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
much much more better it's crazy I could
barely<00:01:35.250> hold<00:01:35.579> control<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.540> my<00:01:36.720> hand

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
barely hold control on that in my hand

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.609

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and squid ps2 and ps3 controller and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.450 
and squid ps2 and ps3 controller and
then<00:01:55.229> take<00:01:56.009> those<00:01:56.790> two<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.619> mean<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:59.070> one<00:01:59.310> of
