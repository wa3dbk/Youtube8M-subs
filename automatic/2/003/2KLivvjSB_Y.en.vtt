00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 I have a new video and in this video I 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.150
 I will show three applications that are in 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.830
 this moment meana caught my attention 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.800
 in this new update of them 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.259
 were these applications let's start 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.690
 with the first they kill each other with fans and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.529
 can 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 You can change this the colors of your 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:26.330
 center notification notifications 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 spring spotlight medication center 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.830
 spotlight can change the keyboard or 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.870
 so can this be a color 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.480
 everything for example I'm going to show it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.930
 This is faster because I have it in 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.660
 purple in everything and it will show you here 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.980
 also the spring edge I do not have if I already 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.340
 which is a single color but also 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.240
 we can be change to one more color like this already 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.970
 that I have this color that I have chosen 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.440
 we can see a little bit can be that a 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:01.920
 66 change and change will change all the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.830
 excel I'm going to change the team everything 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.880
 that what you are selected 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.220
 And this is a new application that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.290
 I liked it's going to be something different for 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.370
 let it be seen that our phone is 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.560
 jailbreak that is called fans and other 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.710
 application also that I would like is 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.450
 this encourages in ibagué pro and this what 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.310
 does it is that every gamification in 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.520
 example if for example here I have a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.340
 message you can notice here the symbol of 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.840
 kisses like here is the symbol of 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:42.130
 the symbol of a rose you can 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.760
 do that since since you can 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.020
 change it can put the text 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.020
 here you can for example 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.470
 to put him we are going to put him 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.630
 a gun and when I get a 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.250
 indication on twitter I will get the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.890
 gun instead of telling me how many 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.229
 notifications 12 normally comes out that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.020
 not for now I will leave aa 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.259
 gun as you can see here from here in 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.350
 facebook on facebook I have a rose of 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.090
 messages I have a symbol of the kiss what 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.800
 only that I do not like about this application 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.450
 and that may be a little 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.600
 You can get a little riled that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.720
 every time you want to open 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.380
 this application will appear this 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.750
 message 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.180
 in tehran and texas every time you have to 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.550
 to be the only one who will better me 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.250
 I imagine in a new news now that 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.380
 every time it's going to appear this was the only thing 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.510
 that I do not like about this one of this 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.000
 application but good is as I said 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.860
 it's okay since something is something different 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.990
 that maybe your friends or people 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.990
 acquaintances go see it and basic look 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.080
 let the different thing come out there where it 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.480
 note that it has been done 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.720
 or what is that the second the third is 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.600
 there is madness 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.190
 I imagine that you have had 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.370
 had this 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.240
 maybe they have in their phone the palac 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.450
 screening maybe they have this 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.820
 a land with a pad with a key to 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.900
 enter the cup to open your iphone 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.340
 good we are with this scum sorry 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.030
 with this 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.720
 but the con stella group is not going to be 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.970
 necessary 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.370
 to put a key on your black screen if it is 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.290
 who do not want this application is 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.360
 free is in syariah all this is in 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.950
 serious that people who do not know that 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.580
 Syria look for my videos there I have a 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.090
 explanation then it has to be 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.010
 sorry also something else to be your 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.120
 we have trinitaria alberich then 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.010
 these applications that is 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.660
 teaching everything is in Syria and they have 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.450
 that be your jailbreak phone 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.880
 to be able to do it as I told them 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.069
 he explains this this method that I have 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.730
 it's free there's a pro where you have to 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.370
 can do to the limit with limited I 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.890
 this free is limited no more I can 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.390
 do as 34 applications and already what 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.090
 they saw a while ago when I teach them by 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.020
 example I have facebook instead 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.890
 I have an application here 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.070
 there enters 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.859
 that's another one that I have the messenger 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.870
 as well 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.939
 As I tell you, the only one I do not like 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.319
 of that application to use that appears 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:25.319
 every time I have twitter 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.310
 I have 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.740
 I do not have it but as I say it is 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.689
 limited nothing more so not to this great 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.839
 as well 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:44.830
 because every one of you are going to do your 

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:47.439
 way of his way of putting everything in 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.419
 put the key that you want and 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:51.189
 they can change it also because it has 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.569
 right here in this application they open it and 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.569
 they change the way you want 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.300
 these are the three applications since 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.029
 if you do not want to that to your iphone already 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.639
 can do this in the 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:09.680
 in his 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.139
 in its applications only 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.150
 good now that these are the three 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.610
 applications that I would like we go that 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.410

 It calls high dynamic and these applications 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.879

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.020
 liked since it has good good 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.910
 good wallpapers to be able 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.880
 put on your iphone and also make it 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.010
 something different from the others and these are 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.740
 the four applications with bond and 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:01.349

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:04.050
 to fans and in ibagué pro and also the cure 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:06.270
