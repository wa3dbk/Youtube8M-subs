00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.790
 I am the administrator organically 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.080
 a company that looks 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.080
 sale of natura photos 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.090
 one hundred percent Mexican 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.010
 it really makes a difference 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.580
 with other stores here 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.530
 they export a lot of organic points in 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.210
 Mexico produces a number of products 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:37.120
 phenomenal organizers that export the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.050
 85% of organic products made in 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.149
 Mexico and they are escorted 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.070
 the concept of organically is of 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.690
 try to grab those as 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.120
 in the country 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.070
 the concept of organic products in 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.190
 regarding consumption in Mexico 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.960
 something quite new the Mexicans in 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.570
 general 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.239
 they do not realize 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.660
 of the quality of organic production 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.910
 within Mexico and they were 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.470
 importing or using imported products 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.210
 organic now what are we 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.820
 trying to do is offer a product 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.960
 that does not happen for the foreigner then 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.159
 it's less less expensive and they're 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.359
 really made by 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.609
 by communities and by small businesses 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:36.390
 relatives 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:39.859
 it's a little bit more expensive let's say not all 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.950
 their products but in some cases yes and 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:45.049
 mostly the reasons why 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.170
 to certification between products 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.960
 organic 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.310
 it is quite expensive and for many 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.520
 communities is pretty 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.690
 hard 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.690
 collect the funds 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.130
 to obtain organic certification 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.130
 organic certification 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.760
 doctor is still mostly 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.760
 foreign groups 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.610
 of the states 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.770
 but there are some groups that do 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.590
 they are forming in mexico 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.510
 like the thirty mex for example that is a 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.510
 certification group 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.930
 Mexican are these agencies that 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.410
 they certify the products they are looking for 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.750
 to support the communities also the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.230
 small businesses because the concept of 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.260
 organic really does not go very well with 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.209
 this online production 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.810
 and the truth is that the best products 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.879
 are made by hands one of the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.099
 problems of having products as well 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:01.760
 is that they take then sometimes if 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.760
 they want if a group we say 100 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:10.060
 100 bottles of a product for example 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.790
 think of a cream is almost impossible to 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.270
 be done for the next day they do not have 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.840
 what to expect at minimum 23 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.030
 and very often then why 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.650
 with the agents who sanctify these 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.549
 products 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.549
 as well 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.730
 they look for organizations that also have 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:34.989
 certification of conversion just the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.989
 fair trade is 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.120
 a concept 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.720
 that started more or less really to take 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.720
 with about 15 years ago in terms of 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.819
 one gives value to the work of little ones 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.980
 merchants 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:04.510
 and even more to indigenous communities 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.860
 it is a concept that was developed in 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:12.160
 against many associations and 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:16.799
 companies that were using 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:19.920
 or accusing this 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.810
 people of pleasure less 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.650
 and paying them very little money and 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:30.440
 making them work hours 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.440
 ridiculous and it's a way of 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.139
 to give value to the point and to ensure 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.840
 what 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.600
 the communities that are doing the 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.550
 points are protected that are 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:52.210
 pursuing a fair salary and that is 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.210
 in treaties of work form
