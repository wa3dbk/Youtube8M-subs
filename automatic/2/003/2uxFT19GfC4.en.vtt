00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.380
 so far we walk like those horses on the mongolian steppe but the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.380
 was a time when it was different 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.099
 know in any case 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.169
 is that in the 19 68 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.220
 the last one with 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.890
 a person ski stallion seen in the wild additionally have all 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.350
 expeditions never anticipates, considering that actually means the whole 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.840
 population dependent 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.490
 and thus continue to exist of the species as depending on what is in it 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.500
 zoos and a wildlife park 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.309
 that was not a good situation 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.560
 there was a lot of inbreeding, the songs only lived there for three years 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
 the purple white threatened with extinction 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.330
 in the construction man her husband who took other with green field put a breeding program 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.870
 on 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.150
 to save the species 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.730
 whatever you do 6 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.860
 actually 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.490
 very late is very popular there 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.160
 13 generations in zoos let them evaluate the grass to eat apel 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.720
 and then normal 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.690
 but teach her a bandages to grow up healthy again 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.660
 and so you do two things 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.660
 actually makes them suitable destination he realizes 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.280
 in nineteen 92 they also accompany the first transport to mongolia and 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.280
 the horses used to be called an accident 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.510
 that is impressive 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.660
 because we like it 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.170
 cetin 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.120
 those who harder dell us all in traditional costumes 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.740
 and then even seriously and when the first box came out of that plane 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.930
 and those are all like me on our values 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.600
 go to Chris 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.480
 from van 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.340
 day 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.170
 that you then 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.730
 d and types of respect 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.630
 what more people than thought 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.790
 the order is 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.370
 later is the country where they are welcome
