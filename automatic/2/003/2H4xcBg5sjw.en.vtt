00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.620
 hello everyone is in the data world 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.780
 let's say almost black goes into the background 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.780
 you will see the track just completed 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.780
 the hooligan of the characteristics a little 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.230
 details 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.540
 let's start from the central are psi that 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.720
 meanwhile they face not coming from a 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.720
 straight but from a curve so much 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.910
 technician bend well equip yourself first 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 possible then leuzzi are in 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.880
 progression both in length and in 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.490
 height 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.729
 finished the ucs and a triple from 24 meters 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.340
 not everyone will be able to do e 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.479
 it will be a very spectacular point 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.860
 especially because it will be a lot 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.860
 suitable for his steps 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:58.390
 we have the quadruple with double between 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.240
 history the good ones will manage to do 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.370
 internally they will probably do the almost 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.150
 was sad not know what 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.630
 must eat then we have a curve a 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:14.880
 left that puts us back on the straight 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.880
 starting with a long jump 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:29.140
 it straightens right at the right end 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:33.640
 left and a long series of bumps where 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.990
 the technical pilot will be freely seen 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.330
 we also have a cornering board with 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.260
 support that a novelty that I have 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.310
 invented 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.650
 I hope destruction after that we have one 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.570
 cousin a little tight that will force i 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.840
 pilots almost stop for a jump 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.200
 short but very demanding because still 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.280
 you are not on the ground that jade bend curved to 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.760
 right 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.750
 other section of wolves this section is 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.800
 very technical because lux confront each other 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.000
 practically at the same level as 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.640
 ground in which you are marching in 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.190
 fund to op if I invented the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.800
 castle made a little strange is a novelty 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.570
 both for you and for me and that 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.760
 surely you have not as I saw 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.220
 so it's something I invented 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.550
 I hope it works properly 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.830
 always coming back, no turning point yes 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.340
 always travels the castle in the sense 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.100
 reverse will also be a point where there is 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.080
 a double trajectory and immediately after that 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.770
 they wrote this from 25 meters up there 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.930
 who will shoot well known but landed 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.910
 we face the curve of which I spoke to you 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.930
 first and face the office of 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.360
 central to doing all this we have 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.140
 needed 4 thousand cubic meters of 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.200
 land 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.600
 ten days of work five cars 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.550
 my four card operators 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:09.440
 matteo turicchi alessandro operators 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:12.260
 bertoncini and ranieri mazzoleni I hope that 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.790
 be one waited for you to enjoy me 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.840
 I recommend see you go up 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.840
 Hi everyone
