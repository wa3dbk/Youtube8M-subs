00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
to come straight into the side bore so

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.709 
to come straight into the side bore so
at<00:00:43.440> 17<00:00:43.860> he's<00:00:44.219> got<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> lot<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.090> football<00:00:45.390> head<00:00:45.629> of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
him so there's plenty of time for him to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.840 
him so there's plenty of time for him to
develop<00:00:48.270> another<00:00:49.140> crucial<00:00:49.500> aspect<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
develop another crucial aspect is the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.670 
develop another crucial aspect is the
fact<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.180> he<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.510> also<00:00:51.719> play<00:00:52.020> centre<00:00:52.500> back

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
fact that he can also play centre back

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.060 
fact that he can also play centre back
which<00:00:53.460> doesn't<00:00:53.969> rule<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.840> signing<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
which doesn't rule out the signing of a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
which doesn't rule out the signing of a
centre-back<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.789> window<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:58.020> being

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
centre-back this window as it's being

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.080 
centre-back this window as it's being
discussed<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.250> does<00:00:59.399> mean<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.609> Arsenal

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
discussed but it does mean that Arsenal

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
discussed but it does mean that Arsenal
do<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> bit<00:01:00.719> more<00:01:00.870> depth<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.680> area

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
do have a bit more depth in that area

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.750 
do have a bit more depth in that area
which<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> something<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.329> sorely<00:01:03.719> need

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760

Billick is six foot two it obviously

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.590 
Billick is six foot two it obviously
gives<00:01:36.840> him<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.110> midfield<00:01:37.619> presence<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.939> he<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
gives him a midfield presence but he is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.880 
gives him a midfield presence but he is
low<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.560> way<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.009> he<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.520> about<00:01:41.759> 65<00:01:42.590> 65<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
low on way I think he was about 65 65 to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.460 
low on way I think he was about 65 65 to
70<00:01:44.310> kilograms<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.119> read<00:01:45.810> which<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.200> obviously

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
70 kilograms I read which is obviously

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.940 
70 kilograms I read which is obviously
not<00:01:47.100> ideal<00:01:47.659> for<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.780> midfield<00:01:49.170> presence<00:01:49.770> but

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
not ideal for that midfield presence but

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.819 
not ideal for that midfield presence but
it<00:01:50.070> obviously<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.490> 17<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.590> he<00:01:52.590> could<00:01:52.740> play

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
it obviously is 17 and he could play

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.480 
it obviously is 17 and he could play
around<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:54.200> crucially<00:01:55.200> his<00:01:55.350> high<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.829> one<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
around that crucially his high is one of

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.920 
around that crucially his high is one of
the<00:01:56.549> reasons<00:01:56.850> why<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.030> likened<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.509> viera

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the reasons why is likened to viera

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.359 
the reasons why is likened to viera
because<00:01:58.380> he<00:01:58.500> does<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.979> aerial

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
because he does have the aerial

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.219 
because he does have the aerial
dominance<00:01:59.880> which<00:02:00.149> also<00:02:00.360> blacked<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:00.990> times

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
dominance which also blacked at times

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.760 
dominance which also blacked at times
and<00:02:02.240> he<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.270> very<00:02:03.390> defensive-minded<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.619> he

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and he is very defensive-minded so he

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.920 
and he is very defensive-minded so he
will<00:02:04.979> happily<00:02:05.969> sit<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.390> front<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> back

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
will happily sit in front of the back

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.080 
will happily sit in front of the back

top<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.599> what<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:18.989> also<00:02:19.290> what<00:02:19.769> I

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
top of this and what is also what I

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.670 
top of this and what is also what I
think<00:02:20.099> is<00:02:20.219> crucial<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.269> he<00:02:22.019> has<00:02:22.200> an<00:02:22.439> eye

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
think is crucial is that he has an eye

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.459 
think is crucial is that he has an eye
for<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.980> pass<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:24.209> he<00:02:24.450> can<00:02:24.629> be<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.959> link<00:02:25.230> between

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
for a pass so he can be the link between

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.960 
for a pass so he can be the link between

from<00:03:55.739> Southampton<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.699> summer<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:57.689> it's

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
from Southampton and summer so it's

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.509 
from Southampton and summer so it's
something<00:03:58.229> that<00:03:58.500> can<00:03:58.620> be<00:03:58.650> improved<00:03:58.859> upon<00:03:59.159> and

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
something that can be improved upon and

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.259 
something that can be improved upon and
it's<00:03:59.639> not<00:03:59.879> too<00:04:00.810> bad<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.470> in<00:04:01.829> that<00:04:02.370> position<00:04:02.669> as

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
it's not too bad and in that position as

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.819 
it's not too bad and in that position as
well<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.750> defensive<00:04:04.169> midfield<00:04:04.560> there<00:04:04.739> was

well in defensive midfield there was
going<00:04:04.949> to<00:04:05.040> be<00:04:05.069> times<00:04:05.340> where<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:05.669> have<00:04:05.879> to<00:04:06.060> pick

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
going to be times where you have to pick

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.479 
going to be times where you have to pick
up<00:04:06.299> a<00:04:06.389> yellow<00:04:06.540> card<00:04:07.819> also<00:04:08.819> in<00:04:09.209> his<00:04:09.739> time<00:04:10.739> awards

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
to quite a high level that's obviously a

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.689 
to quite a high level that's obviously a
decent<00:04:19.139> competition<00:04:19.859> especially<00:04:20.159> now

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
decent competition especially now

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.339 
decent competition especially now
there's<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> lot<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.150> decent<00:04:21.359> teams<00:04:21.779> playing<00:04:22.109> in

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
there's a lot of decent teams playing in

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.589 
there's a lot of decent teams playing in
there<00:04:22.529> and<00:04:22.740> it's<00:04:23.610> good<00:04:23.760> experience<00:04:24.090> for<00:04:24.330> him

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599

there and it's good experience for him
obviously<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:25.380> not<00:04:25.560> quite<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.010> height<00:04:26.279> of

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
obviously it's not quite the height of

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
as every sign in does but I'm pretty

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.160 
as every sign in does but I'm pretty
confident<00:04:42.790> with<00:04:43.030> everything<00:04:43.840> I've<00:04:43.990> seen

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
confident with everything I've seen

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.650 
confident with everything I've seen
nothing<00:04:44.530> I've<00:04:44.710> read<00:04:44.890> the<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:45.370> good<00:04:45.640> turn<00:04:46.450> out

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
nothing I've read the this good turn out

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.500 
nothing I've read the this good turn out
to<00:04:46.930> be<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.110> good<00:04:47.410> transfer<00:04:47.950> for<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.790> store<00:04:49.240> and

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
to be a good transfer for a store and

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.140 
to be a good transfer for a store and
there's<00:04:49.870> two<00:04:49.990> key<00:04:50.200> parts<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.650> it<00:04:50.710> it's<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.430> 17

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
there's two key parts to it it's the 17

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.850 
there's two key parts to it it's the 17
it<00:04:52.390> makes<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:52.780> very<00:04:52.810> good<00:04:53.260> transfer<00:04:53.530> for<00:04:53.830> the

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
it makes it very good transfer for the

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.860 
it makes it very good transfer for the
future<00:04:54.280> but<00:04:54.940> what's<00:04:55.300> probably<00:04:55.600> more

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
future but what's probably more

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.690 
future but what's probably more
important<00:04:56.290> right<00:04:56.440> now<00:04:56.500> given<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.250> defensive

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
important right now given the defensive

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.340 
important right now given the defensive
midfield<00:04:58.060> is<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.300> problem<00:04:58.810> where<00:04:59.050> we<00:04:59.170> have

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
midfield is a problem where we have

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.010 
midfield is a problem where we have
struggled<00:04:59.830> is<00:04:59.980> that<00:05:00.580> Big<00:05:00.760> Lick<00:05:00.940> seems<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.930> be

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
struggled is that Big Lick seems to be

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.950 
struggled is that Big Lick seems to be
able<00:05:02.140> to<00:05:02.410> come<00:05:02.770> straight<00:05:03.070> in<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.730> do<00:05:04.690> a<00:05:04.720> job

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
able to come straight in and do a job

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.860 
able to come straight in and do a job
for<00:05:05.110> us<00:05:05.170> immediately<00:05:05.680> which<00:05:05.950> obviously

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
for us immediately which obviously

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.030 
for us immediately which obviously
important<00:05:07.870> as<00:05:08.020> we<00:05:08.140> come<00:05:08.260> up<00:05:08.410> with<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.590> FA<00:05:08.800> Cup

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
important as we come up with the FA Cup

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.650 
important as we come up with the FA Cup
the<00:05:09.340> Champions<00:05:09.790> League<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.390> Premier

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
the Champions League and the Premier

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.300 
the Champions League and the Premier
League<00:05:10.690> throughout<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.680> rest<00:05:11.860> of<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.100> season

League throughout the rest of the season

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.970 
League throughout the rest of the season
so<00:05:12.840> yeah<00:05:13.840> it<00:05:13.900> looks<00:05:14.170> confident<00:05:14.620> of<00:05:14.830> see

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
so yeah it looks confident of see

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.190 
so yeah it looks confident of see
Arsenal<00:05:15.280> paid<00:05:15.490> its<00:05:16.180> non-disclosed<00:05:16.840> fee

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
Arsenal paid its non-disclosed fee

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.370 
Arsenal paid its non-disclosed fee
believed<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.800> be<00:05:17.920> around<00:05:18.160> 2.5<00:05:19.060> million<00:05:19.840> three

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
believed to be around 2.5 million three

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.290 
believed to be around 2.5 million three
million<00:05:20.620> bridge<00:05:21.400> in<00:05:21.670> the<00:05:21.730> grand<00:05:21.940> scheme<00:05:22.030> of

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
million bridge in the grand scheme of

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.020 
million bridge in the grand scheme of
things<00:05:22.420> isn't<00:05:23.200> much<00:05:23.380> all<00:05:23.620> so<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.730> seems<00:05:24.910> like

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
things isn't much all so it seems like

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.340 
things isn't much all so it seems like
another<00:05:25.270> good<00:05:25.480> sign<00:05:25.660> in<00:05:25.780> for<00:05:25.840> Arsenal<00:05:26.230> and

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
another good sign in for Arsenal and

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.100 
another good sign in for Arsenal and
hopefully<00:05:27.250> it<00:05:28.030> won't<00:05:28.240> be<00:05:28.390> the<00:05:28.630> last<00:05:28.660> time<00:05:29.050> that

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
hopefully it won't be the last time that

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.510 
hopefully it won't be the last time that
we<00:05:29.350> have<00:05:29.470> to<00:05:29.560> assess<00:05:29.830> a<00:05:29.860> player<00:05:30.130> before<00:05:30.310> the

we have to assess a player before the

we have to assess a player before the
transfer<00:05:30.700> window<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.270> if<00:05:31.750> you've<00:05:31.930> got
