00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.150
 learn how to build our guard 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.580
 of carrot 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.550
 the carrot launcher we'll need 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:37.890
 the following materials a tube of 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 aluminum about 37 and 42 in that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.660
 we can introduce to the carrot and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.739
 catch the second of carrot we go 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 do that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.170
 on both sides and you need to prepare 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.649
 still informs you that a piece of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:16.560
 rubber then fasten with tape 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:20.070
 insulation of about 30 centimeters and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:31.229
 half free so that it can be 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:36.180
 introduced in about 12 of where of 12 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:39.990
 centimeters and a spit for you 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.700
 cleaning your launcher 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.920
 after the shot we need to be 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.259
 removing the carrot cylinder that is 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.049
 trapped here inside the tube then 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.049
 doing the cleaning totally uses 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:00.820
 Let's upload and let's shoot. 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:05.180
 besides ours ours initially 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.690
 carry our weapon for this you go 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.760
 introduce into carrot 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.900
 that way to the other side 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:24.370
 then you will withdraw notice the side 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.370
 already loaded and now on the other side 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.640
 the xandÃ£o 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.520
 we have both sides loaded there 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.690
 we now pa 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.690
 we have our loaded gun 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:58.220
 directs you to observe that this 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.580
 displacement of carrot celina will generate 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.110
 pressurizing here in the barrel and 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.870
 expel another carrot cylinder 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.890
 posted on the front of our side 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.890
 let's go to the shot 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.880
 we act to shoot 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.510
 the cylinder has collided with the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.510
 our album 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.950
 a considerable pressure 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.280
 This is our carrot noodles. 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.700
 our carrot launcher to 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:57.200
 weight after firing the aid 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.200
 from our skewer we're taking it out 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.060
 the cylinder 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.090
 thus effecting cleaning 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.790
 i 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:05:01.250
 we observed that 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:05.539
 the spit is slightly larger than the 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:10.280
 cylinder then removed after firing 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:11.180
 this other cylinder which is positioned in the 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.819
 back 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.449
 let's push it down 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:20.180
 here is not the spacing between the 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.759
 two beautiful prioritizing one to generating 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.740
 shot at the front 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.189
 let's reload again do one more 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.189
 shot 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:38.270
 arriving here remember 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.840
 through the carrot strip loads 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.840
 again 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:54.679
 we have our loaded shotgun there 

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:57.219
 now we are pushed by 

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:57.219
 our soul 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.000
 why is our carrot project 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:25.330
 collided with somber picture 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.790
 we have here our 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.050
 second shot fear relationship 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.010
 so there is one more experiment 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:40.730
 interesting for me is today 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:44.620
 our carrot noodles 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.620
 A hug and until our next meeting
