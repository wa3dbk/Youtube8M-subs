00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.959
 good day boys today I love you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.549
 share this tomahawk that I made has 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.290
 order I finished it in the middle of the 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.270
 last week but the truth up 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.680
 right now I had a chance to 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.810
 record the video 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.290
 It was made to order for a very good 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.290
 friend I tell you the characteristics and 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:32.090
 the total length of the rope as we can 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:35.540
 see exceeds 30 centimeters has 33 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.700
 centimeters long is made in 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.030
 oak wood 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.460
 dyed with color wood ink 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.840
 perfect low clear 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:52.030
 the blade is made of a steel bar 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.800
 one inch by one inch 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.860
 its dimensions of work already 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.489
 finished are in the cutting part 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:05.259
 they have what are 7 centimeters long 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.990
 It has 19 centimeters in total and it was 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.740
 forged entirely by hand is a leaf 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.070
 very robust is a replica of 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.280
 a tomahawk used by soldiers 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.049
 of the USA in the Vietnam war the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.920
 client asked us with some 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.620
 details of ford brut and well that's it 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.650
 how was it 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.000
 as I comment here you can appreciate what 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.950
 robust of the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.950
 the structure of the tomahawk 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.790
 and then, of course, how the form should be 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.720
 plastic of the tomahawk rode on the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.510
 which is from highest to lowest towards the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.100
 top is impossible to come out and 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.770
 down is so simple that enough 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.530
 some hits here 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.530
 in this way to generate that fall 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.609
 we are going to give you an approach to give 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.609
 a little more in detail 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.470
 there is a sheet there are the details of 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.470
 raw forge 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.230
 the back part 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.409
 has what is being a tip of 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.409
 spear 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.780
 one edge to four tables 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.520
 and that 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.030
 let's see it on the other side 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.030
 sometimes 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.630
 I forgot to tell them 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.000
 the piece has a differential temper 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.760
 is 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.760
 the one who went forward and the one who was acting 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.170
 in this kind of good pieces and in the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.400
 Knives in general is recommended 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.400
 make a differential temple 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.720
 lets go see it 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.490
 more in detail 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.490
 for example, all this bad 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.060
 there is the spearhead 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.310
 with us 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.640
 or the bevel of us we are better 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.640
 saying 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.890
 and well, here is the piece its cover 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.180
 because as always it was made in stick 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.900
 first quality totally by hand 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.939
 it is dyed 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.750
 abroad is also illustrated with 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:11.610
 wax and then sealed this new 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.610
 kitchen was with rivets 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.040
 and a pin to hold it 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.379
 and this one 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.060
 and on the back it carries its prey 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:27.080
 to be able to ride to what is coming 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.080
 being him 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.990
