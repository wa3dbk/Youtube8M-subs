00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.959
 So we have one here today 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.330
 Demonstration made of our new 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.960
 developed isoft line 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 that consists of settel vehicles and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.330
 they all really needed as a target 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.210
 have the biomechanical processes at 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.369
 horse with better consideration and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 thus in consequence for a better one 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.519
 well-being 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.710
 the difference in the saddle today 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.480
 that they have completely divided him in 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.089
 a left and right half are themselves 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.120
 move independently 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:48.000
 can and therefore the back muscles in 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.600
 Relieve movement and less pressure 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.129
 exercise 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.129
 especially under the seat of the rider 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.479
 always a little bit with this horse 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.260
 mango praised her program 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.900
 Rose showed light tension and that was 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.580
 Here today with this saddle as well as 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.369
 not noticeable 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.740
 So the horse was always easy even in the 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.259
 back here I have today 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.930
 can not notice anything about it and about it 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:28.369
 is that the saddle year divided into two 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.110
 is and has a certain awakening function 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.729
 but not for the rider 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.070
 I'm uncomfortable having that personally 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.690
 did not even notice I think the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.910
 you should not even notice that the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.840
 saddle moves so that was so 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.840
 enjoyable 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.810
 The strap is the first break in itself 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.189
 three-dimensional rear movement of the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.810
 deform horses that means they have 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.530
 the lateral elasticity 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.049
 But they also have the elasticity 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.270
 children deformations of the chest basket like that 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.950
 that less pressure on your lungs and heart 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.530
 function to be exercised and the horse 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.869
 thus significantly lower frequency hard 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.120
 yes it has already noticed that 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.410
 Saddle through the strap clearly 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.240
 better the movements of the horse on 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.330
 fits both in the step and in the trot 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.100
 and gallop and i have the feeling too 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.630
 that he is significantly better off the shoulder 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.630
 comes out that he goes much freer 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.109
 At the brake, our goal was in two 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.719
 for improvement 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.280
 on the one hand, the tube is completely free 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.840
 that is not all 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.719
 cut back but the trense 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.989
 Will really be 45 cm behind the ear 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.579
 fixed head and has no head 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.829
 piece in which he was right on the 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.510
 Horse head flies up 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.959
 so the ears are free and can 180 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.819
 Turning grade means that means the horse 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.139
 can be better attentive 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.750
 and the areas of august we have one 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.239
 Built-in iron ensures that 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.310
 the eye is completely free and so on 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.069
 the field of vision improves from the horse and 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.989
 We take any pressure from the main 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.689
 annoying the otherwise annoying normally 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.989
 among the bakken pieces and the main 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:20.379
 does not fall at the border 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:24.310
 extremely on the neck piece so far 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.079
 shifted back there is that there 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.120
 there is no pressure behind the ears 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.500
 what else you often have a limit 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.030
 if only the star then such a 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.639
 a bit tight is just or not quite 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.280
 fits or the wide halter a bit 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.979
 tightened is then immediately on 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.100
 behind in terror impression arises and 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:43.530
 the neck piece 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.780
 then pushes unpleasant behind the gate 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.270
 for the horse and here is a lot 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.260
 Freedom because the trimmer is very different 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.260
 is shaped 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.379
 that with security taken in the reason 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:04:00.329
 something good for everyone for his horse 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.370
 At least one would certainly like to do that 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.560
 alternative to try them 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.420
 there is that at our line service 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.239
 you can taste the products before 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.430
 they should buy and think of that 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.560
 the rider himself a picture 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.299
 Get to see what he likes 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.340
 or not but the previously made 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.940
 Experiences are very positive 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.239
 So very stimulating part of those for 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.239
 us
