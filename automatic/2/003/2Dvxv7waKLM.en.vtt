00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello and welcome a first video 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.370
 from new super mario bros 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.259
 so I'm going to show you how 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.920
 succeed the world's eight castle 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:28.980
 the last one the next tome me I 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:31.849
 prefer I listened to him I do not know if you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.849
 see very well 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.350
 here 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.580
 so this part of people is wrong 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:10.940
 sprint at the beginning no no it's this 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:10.940
 peaceful first scene a good day 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.810
 thin 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.080
 good I hope you see well 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.920
 so that's a bit like that I have a little 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.420
 difficult 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.420
 no it's okay like you know a little 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.560
 Oh 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.810
 new luck 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.959
 m 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:33.189
 I do not have if you notice if I am 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:46.420
 still at the very beginning and that the boss he 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:51.629
 and so we then always fail at 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:55.169
 early I pass the door and I'm here 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.169
 it makes perfect sense 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.049
 so here you have three passages 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:10.319
 different 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:15.069
 if you take the bad that it does that 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:24.870
 it sends in loop if you take 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:24.870
 a lot it's that so on and on 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.710
 gets I have a flower 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.210
 or 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:05:04.980
 black as I said then there the passage 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.150
 in fact it's the middle one and I 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.070
 took a long time to understand how 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.540
 had to do I think he's jumping 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.640
 from there to another but in fact no it's 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:20.130
 all con con make and that's all and 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:24.110
 it is not understood and the important thing is 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.110
 that there and it's already the doors of the bus 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:45.290
 so as you see the little buzz 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.290
 is required and lemon is not cool 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:00.099
 and eventually went even there 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:00.099
 more upset when we lose 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.800
 okay 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.330
 that's after you have the right to 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.960
 generic that makes all the images 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.960
 everyone 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.069
 in short, it lasts long enough that I 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.940
 can show you 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:58.370
 I hope you enjoyed my 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.740
 video i am also animal videos 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:06.069
 crossing so see them if you 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.069
 thanks to him
