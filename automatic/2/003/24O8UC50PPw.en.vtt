00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
which is disappointing but she's still a

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.749 
which is disappointing but she's still a
great<00:04:28.940> figure<00:04:29.210> overall<00:04:29.780> now<00:04:30.560> it<00:04:31.490> wouldn't<00:04:31.669> be

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
great figure overall now it wouldn't be

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.080 
great figure overall now it wouldn't be

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
her wings give her a bit of a balance

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.379 
her wings give her a bit of a balance
issue<00:05:03.199> but<00:05:04.129> she's<00:05:04.340> still<00:05:04.639> a<00:05:04.699> credit<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.270> the
