00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.470
 good afternoon my dear friends today i am 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.849
 again with you and I want to have 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:18.470
 such a frying pan is already quite 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:22.470
 and new here is such an old frying pan 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.560
 soot and I want to clean it now 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.990
 bring the old view 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.510
 Here is my husband from turning the handle of 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.489
 pans because it was something 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.380
 terrible that's what we need for this for 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.879
 we will use these 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.070
 This is how we have a joint like this 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.579
 I planed soap and economic 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.850
 but we'll get a soda out of here 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.850
 food 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:01:02.840
 here and glue only it was not 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:08.600
 stationery glue and it is written that this 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:13.950
 silicate silicate glue written 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:18.869
 liquid glass so what are the proportions of us 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:24.350
 will it now i will show it here me 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.350
 Vodichka already boiled pots 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.340
 here I will throw 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.920
 so here zhmenka soap I 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.920
 set a 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:02.720
 you here i'm pouring here is silicate glue 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:06.040
 that was somewhere 100 grams here pour 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:12.020
 100 grams of silicate glue pour out too 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:14.270
 in the pot I have a pot somewhere on 5 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.480
 or 6 liters and 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.319
 need mini 2 already 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.319
 soda 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:48.560
 it all boils here we put 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.560
 our griddle in this solution 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.010
 and pen 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:05.549
 and let it boil and boil and we through 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:09.620
 hour, let's see what happens 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.799
 we boiled some water here she is 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.340
 dirty 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:23.269
 some water now here we will get 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:23.269
 pan and it under cold water immediately 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:37.829
 nothing has changed yet 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:40.159
 now we look further from the cold 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.159
 water 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.340
 [music] 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:05.430
 so far so far we have turned out 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.050
 now let's put it on fire again 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.050
 another half hour 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:21.100
 Here is our pan that was boiling 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:26.530
 5 hours our solution as you can see which 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:31.090
 the result is absolutely no result with 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.220
 back side here you see on 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.870
 in fact, she has become cleaner only 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.990
 because it scratched and this one 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:45.389
 on the mountains it is scratched here you can see 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:50.580
 in fact this solution unfortunately 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:53.740
 did nothing ie experiment 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.419
 the conclusion is that actually 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.510
 Unfortunately, I expected my other 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:05.350
 and waited for at least some result 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.479
 more positive what you are left 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.380
 see actually here we are 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.800
 sundresses 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:17.110
 i.e. this griddle needs to be cleaned 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:22.060
 only by mechanical cleaning on 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:26.430
 in fact, the cleaners here will not help 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:30.220
 what do you understand, sodium is necessary 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.979
 there cheat special brush such 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.400
 and brush then because really 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.849
 In fact, this solution in which boiled 5 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.139
 o'clock 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:43.289
 I will remind again yes the dispute was from 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.289
 laundry soap 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:56.530
 then you are such a stationery glue 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:06:00.190
 silicate and soda with actually this 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.710
 the solution as in my opinion he did not give 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.860
 no even expected at all 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.979
 the result did not give what was the pan 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.620
 and it was impossible to clean such she and 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.100
 left everything here from whom ward that 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.390
 bathed by the method of mechanical 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:23.070
 and the zeal of power inside is nothing at all 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.810
 changed because that's what they put in 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.470
 u-tuba 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.350
 video of all sorts that helps to clean 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.510
 that 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:36.660
 unfortunately this is not so personal in my experience 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.730
 showed so why all the sorry who 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.060
 of course there we advertised these funds 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:46.680
 and maybe with you and helping, I don't know 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.930
 but I have the result Norrisu there 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.930
 comment 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:55.730
 so those who want 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:58.710
 also use this method 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:01.710
 you can use but as you can see 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.500
 here is the result I did not bring money 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:08.370
 were spent 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:10.260
 but the zeal was well, so that's why all 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.080
 once again i will try just mechanical 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:16.460
 cleaning maybe take a video like 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.990
 clean this pan with another method 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:22.500
 there everyone thanks stay on my 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:26.940
 channel bye bye 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.770
 make no mistakes maybe eat the carcass and 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:32.780
 pans cleaning options 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.780
 thank you all bye
