hello welcome to my first video my first

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.740 
hello welcome to my first video my first
video<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.390> going<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.810> be<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.649> dive<00:00:08.340> bombs<00:00:08.750> um

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
video is going to be on dive bombs um

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.810 
video is going to be on dive bombs um
I'm<00:00:10.710> going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.070> be<00:00:11.130> teaching<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.670> these

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
I'm going to be teaching you these

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.049 
I'm going to be teaching you these
because<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.599> lot<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:12.990> people<00:00:13.049> who<00:00:13.349> like<00:00:13.530> metal

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
because a lot of people who like metal

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.870 
because a lot of people who like metal
have<00:00:15.059> seen<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:16.080> know<00:00:16.609> Dimebag<00:00:17.609> Darrell

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
have seen this I know Dimebag Darrell

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.300 
have seen this I know Dimebag Darrell
made<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.779> pretty<00:00:18.900> famous<00:00:19.439> from<00:00:19.680> Damageplan

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
made it pretty famous from Damageplan

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.759 
made it pretty famous from Damageplan
and<00:00:20.670> various<00:00:21.210> other<00:00:21.359> bands<00:00:24.320> they're<00:00:25.320> not<00:00:25.500> very

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and various other bands they're not very

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.189 
and various other bands they're not very
hard<00:00:26.460> once<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.240> learn<00:00:27.390> how<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:27.750> natural

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
hard once you learn how to do natural

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.999 
hard once you learn how to do natural
harmonics<00:00:29.539> they're<00:00:30.539> sort<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.410> difficult<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
harmonics they're sort of difficult to

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.590 
harmonics they're sort of difficult to
get<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.279> first<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:32.910> once<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.450> them

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
get it first but once you get them

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.770 
get it first but once you get them
you're<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.469> know<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.780> you're

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
you're going to know it and you're

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.979 
you're going to know it and you're
probably<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.980> them<00:00:38.390> it's<00:00:39.390> best<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
probably going to like them it's best to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.290 
probably going to like them it's best to
use<00:00:40.020> your<00:00:40.710> bridge<00:00:41.070> pickup<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> have

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
use your bridge pickup or if you have

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.470 
use your bridge pickup or if you have
humbuckers<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.219> use<00:00:44.399> either<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.820> but

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
humbuckers you can use either one but

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.060 
humbuckers you can use either one but
humbuckers<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.320> seem<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> get<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> stronger

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
humbuckers just seem to get a stronger

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.090 
humbuckers just seem to get a stronger
sound<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> your<00:00:48.090> harmonics<00:00:51.829> some<00:00:52.829> people

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
sound out of your harmonics some people

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.310 
sound out of your harmonics some people
like<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.250> use<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.550> pic<00:00:53.850> i<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.840> i<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.199> get

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
like to use a pic i do because i can get

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.979 
like to use a pic i do because i can get
stronger<00:00:55.649> harmonics<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.530> but<00:00:58.530> uh<00:00:59.989> just

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
stronger harmonics out of it but uh just

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.529 
stronger harmonics out of it but uh just
to<00:01:01.079> let<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.289> know<00:01:01.440> i<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.309> an<00:01:02.460> amp<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.879> i'm

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
to let you know i do have an amp and i'm

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.929 
to let you know i do have an amp and i'm
just<00:01:04.470> messing<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> off<00:01:05.430> right<00:01:05.729> now

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
just messing with it off right now

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.149 
just messing with it off right now
because<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> while<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.500> it's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
because it's like for a while like it's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.500 
because it's like for a while like it's

pretty late at night so i'm going to be
showing<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.049> how<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.100> harmonics<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
showing you how to do your harmonics and

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.719 
showing you how to do your harmonics and
how<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.360> use<00:01:18.360> them<00:01:18.799> okay<00:01:19.799> what<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:20.610> going

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
how to use them okay what you're going

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.760 
how to use them okay what you're going
to<00:01:20.790> want<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.080> pick<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.650> I

said but take your note and then I like
to<00:01:26.430> tap<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.400> 10th<00:01:29.400> fret<00:01:29.810> because<00:01:30.810> that's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
to tap on the 10th fret because that's

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.350 
to tap on the 10th fret because that's
where<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:32.009> strong<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.549> harmonics<00:01:33.210> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
where I get strong this harmonics you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.230 
where I get strong this harmonics you
can<00:01:33.509> give<00:01:33.689> them<00:01:34.400> various<00:01:35.400> other<00:01:35.610> places<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
can give them various other places I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.929 
can give them various other places I
just<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.200> 10<00:01:37.939> there's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
just like to get them all for 10 there's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.630 
just like to get them all for 10 there's
some<00:01:39.180> better<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.610> while<00:01:41.610> you're

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
some better be there and while you're

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.100 
some better be there and while you're
doing<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.150> you're<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.659> dropping

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
doing that you're going to be dropping

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.580 
doing that you're going to be dropping
down<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.290> way<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:45.259> just<00:01:46.259> pulling

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
down the way for and then just pulling

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.249 
down the way for and then just pulling
it<00:01:46.680> back<00:01:46.829> up<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:48.329> shaking<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> little

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it back up and then shaking it a little

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.840 
it back up and then shaking it a little
bit<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:49.649> doing<00:01:49.890> whatever<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.250> want<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> can

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
bit or doing whatever you want you can

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.300 
bit or doing whatever you want you can
just<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.840> plain<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:52.860> pull<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.100> back

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
just do it plain and then pull it back

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.310 
just do it plain and then pull it back
up

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
up

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.110 
up
continue<00:01:54.680> play<00:01:54.860> before<00:01:55.400> you<00:01:55.610> can<00:01:55.760> mess<00:01:55.940> with

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
continue play before you can mess with

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.210 
continue play before you can mess with
it<00:01:56.210> afterwards<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:57.190> do<00:01:58.190> both<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.920> get<00:02:01.070> your

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
it afterwards I do both so to get your

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.670 
it afterwards I do both so to get your
hormone<00:02:01.550> in<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.700> kitchen<00:02:05.410> you're<00:02:06.410> just<00:02:06.500> going

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
hormone in the kitchen you're just going

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.020 
hormone in the kitchen you're just going
to<00:02:06.740> touch<00:02:06.890> lightly<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.670> top<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:07.970> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
to touch lightly on the top of the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.550 
to touch lightly on the top of the
string<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.330> then<00:02:08.509> pull<00:02:08.750> off<00:02:08.959> soon<00:02:09.320> as<00:02:09.350> with

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
string and then pull off soon as with

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.910 
string and then pull off soon as with
you<00:02:09.590> like<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.789> pitch<00:02:11.120> raised<00:02:11.750> because<00:02:12.170> that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
you like the pitch raised because that

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.220
