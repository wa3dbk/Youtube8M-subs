 now many new changes are coming along 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.780
 I was just my tip dance 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.009
 just built a bit off screen 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.450
 and the first update you so on 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.560
 once, of course, it looks natural here 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.729
 above the balcony 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 he has a bit of a problem 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.600
 I've changed that 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.640
 enlarged and from the balcony you 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.280
 now you only see the left side 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.259
 now the new sausage shack which is not yet 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.380
 completely finished of course belongs in 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.239
 a sausage shop not just a house with 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.829
 torches or something but also a grill 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.200
 yes and this grill we will today 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.480
 build because that's a new item 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.040
 from the lidl threshing times motto was 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.349
 I also did it here 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.319
 now fence elongated tack tack tack 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.360
 because the garage and flowers are shaped yes 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.280
 she is here nothing new to 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.079
 just the fact that the garage too 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.299
 little else has a different shape 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.370
 and that the door now everything rises and 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.090
 this is the the bratwurstbude 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.040
 for odorless and wait and if 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.329
 one rear come from here in now 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.370
 it wants to have a door here too 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.870
 zack and now confront this in 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.310
 This sausage became pure and should be 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.260
 move in odorless 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.880
 but of course it can even be odorless 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.920
 not in the in this house in the 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.959
 move in the sausage stall because yes of course 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.099
 that 's exactly why greenfield tells 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.730
 Let's build the grill for now 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:02.549
 how to build this grill yes we go 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.139
 only from the creative now can 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.290
 We look further, so here is it 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.569
 namely a barbecue grill so there we have 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.950
 the grill yes that's the minecraft grill 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.870
 It's just made of coal and iron 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.970
 Built is a relatively simple swing 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.440
 Build how fast is actually easy 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.530
 peasy makes a joke 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.099
 we make cool is just cool there that 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.450
 coal so coal now how do you build that 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:31.430
 here here and then have zack perfectly there 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.620
 We also grill so the grill 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.780
 throw away the torch and have it with you 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.000
 We also like the grill for 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.980
 odorless built because of these guys the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.360
 must also have a working climate which must 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.980
 yes, we also have something to work on 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.260
 have to offer me more than in 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.819
 his current sausage stall because his 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.409
 current sausage fashion is already on the 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.840
 latest version and we just have to stop 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.280
 one more drauflegen so in the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.540
 Grill I pack now here, yes 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.010
 that's just the grill 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.140
 we can do it here too 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.090
 a fan hanging the lamps yes that looks 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.290
 so pretty , you never had that 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.540
 does not look at all 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.909
 the we hang else to go but 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.950
 here somehow so the light is beautiful 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.690
 and here we see the grill yes the 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.069
 Grill erich honestly sees it 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.299
 makes really cool and what can you do 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.099
 because even with a grill 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.859
 Of course it is clear you can with 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.019
 a barbecue and as you have seen 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.510
 even here the creator of the grill 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.370
 Here are some pieces of coal in the 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.840
 cocoon in the charcoal grill had the 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.380
 go there you can see this wise 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.650
 cabbage this wise coal so to speak and on 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.490
 First of all, this grill can be cow 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.720
 roast meat and you can of course 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.870
 roast sausages but of course ask 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.190
 how can you do it at all 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.700
 Roast sausages when in minecraft 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.830
 there are no bratwurst yes there are 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.310
 now a new item in the libretto 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.340
 timeslot because if you go here after 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.830
 looking for sausage then you will find here the 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.440
 rest bratwurst and roll bratwurst 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.870
 is built from three times rock pop shop 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.060
 and for that we first need one 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.169
 swear yes this locks we build ourselves 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.880
 now just out of these diamonds 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.940
 we are one hundred percent in 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:13.300
 have experienced another consequence so so 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.300
 so and whatever I have to sneeze 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.220
 it worked that makes us difficult 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.800
 once enchanted so how did that go? 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.120
 and it's even looking 3 on it 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.979
 means we can our meat and 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.080
 drive better because I heard that 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.150
 the time out on the meadow somewhere 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.820
 gustav aker should be the we can 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:40.260
 kill immediately 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:42.720
 and it shit old that was not 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.760
 one plans then there are still the 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.560
 normal pigs and the gustav aker 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.660
 but the gustav el cadi exist 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.840
 someone there for example osterfeld 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.370
 all the kuster faker and the sld right 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.190
 gustaf has gustav over his 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.510
 Names are yes of course we are 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.830
 take right now to an even more 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:08.340
 our pig hereby and old 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:09.600
 that way and now we can get out of that 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.910
 meat from them now just now 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.620
 the bratwurst have shaped us 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.020
 manufacturer yes these are the bratwÃ¼rste 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.910
 Here is the breathtaking stuff so we 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.530
 get four bratwurst out of here now 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.300
 And these bratwursts have it 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.130
 Of course, you can be natural 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.380
 Of course you need peace of mind 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.420
 I rest bratwurst eat here ne camera 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.630
 Not at all because high bratwurst is 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.950
 not good for the body as everyone knows 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.360
 of course for a bratwurst first too 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.710
 of course you have to eat them 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.780
 to barbecue that means we press the 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.580
 right-click on it and maybe 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.440
 Magnet again it's not possible but 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.580
 only one sausage goes and this one 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.240
 sausage must first be grilled 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.150
 become 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.750
 We throw the bus here first 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.480
 and so needs to know only times there like 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.890
 the bratwurst that has been serviced now 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.020
 and now we can enjoy it 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.650
 eat moment boom 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.450
 that's bratwurst, yes, brat that 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.710
 is the new trend of old you can find the 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.840
 bratwurst writes it to me the comments 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.930
 and yes we'll meet sometime soon 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.930
 again
