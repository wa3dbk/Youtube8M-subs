all group are traveling somewhere

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:29.219 
all group are traveling somewhere

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
together so the group start to know each

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.469 
together so the group start to know each
other<00:01:29.499> we<00:01:29.859> started<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.219> hang<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.850> speak<00:01:31.179> and

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
other we started to hang to speak and

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.980 
other we started to hang to speak and
the<00:01:31.990> synergy<00:01:32.319> of<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.590> group<00:01:32.859> rise<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:33.990> third

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
the synergy of the group rise and third

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.679 
the synergy of the group rise and third
is<00:01:35.289> to<00:01:35.469> see<00:01:35.679> some<00:01:36.100> other<00:01:36.219> city<00:01:36.579> a<00:01:36.969> reversal<00:01:37.600> on

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
is to see some other city a reversal on

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.289 
is to see some other city a reversal on
and<00:01:37.929> get<00:01:38.049> along<00:01:38.319> so<00:01:39.039> I<00:01:39.369> think<00:01:39.789> that<00:01:39.909> this<00:01:39.999> was

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
and get along so I think that this was

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.830 
and get along so I think that this was
pretty<00:01:41.229> surprising

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
pretty surprising

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.679 
pretty surprising
probably<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.009> didn't<00:01:44.220> expected<00:01:44.729> an

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
probably because it didn't expected an
