Rocksteady figure in the leg region as

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.019 
Rocksteady figure in the leg region as
you<00:00:22.910> saw<00:00:23.270> in<00:00:23.420> my<00:00:23.600> review<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.529> legs<00:00:24.770> come<00:00:25.160> not

you saw in my review the legs come not
assembled<00:00:26.660> correctly<00:00:26.779> and<00:00:27.349> you<00:00:27.650> have<00:00:27.740> to

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
assembled correctly and you have to

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.190 
assembled correctly and you have to
basically<00:00:28.279> bend<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:29.270> knees<00:00:29.419> like<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:29.990> to

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
basically bend the knees like that to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.040 
basically bend the knees like that to
get<00:00:30.320> him<00:00:30.410> to<00:00:30.590> stand<00:00:30.860> even<00:00:31.099> straight<00:00:31.759> and<00:00:32.060> then

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
get him to stand even straight and then

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.600 
get him to stand even straight and then
there's<00:00:33.260> also<00:00:33.410> one<00:00:33.739> other<00:00:33.770> issue<00:00:34.130> which<00:00:34.460> you

alright so really what you have to do

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.439 
alright so really what you have to do
the<00:00:43.220> first<00:00:43.370> thing<00:00:43.489> you<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.760> do<00:00:43.910> is<00:00:44.149> you<00:00:44.269> have<00:00:44.329> to

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
the first thing you to do is you have to

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.180 
the first thing you to do is you have to
get<00:00:44.570> some<00:00:44.809> hot<00:00:45.019> water<00:00:45.050> now<00:00:45.649> some<00:00:45.890> people

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
get some hot water now some people

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.119 
get some hot water now some people
recommend<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:47.120> hot<00:00:47.449> air<00:00:47.809> or<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.559> blow<00:00:48.769> dryer

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
recommend the hot air or the blow dryer

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.459 
recommend the hot air or the blow dryer
method<00:00:49.760> I<00:00:49.910> don't<00:00:50.480> prefer<00:00:50.840> that<00:00:50.989> because<00:00:51.350> it

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
method I don't prefer that because it

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.599 
method I don't prefer that because it
can<00:00:51.800> burn<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.910> figures<00:00:53.559> hot<00:00:54.559> water<00:00:54.829> can<00:00:55.219> cause

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
can burn the figures hot water can cause

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.579 
can burn the figures hot water can cause
problems<00:00:56.059> too<00:00:56.239> if<00:00:56.359> you're<00:00:56.480> not<00:00:56.629> careful<00:00:56.870> but

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
problems too if you're not careful but

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.290 
problems too if you're not careful but
as<00:00:57.710> long<00:00:57.859> as<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.070> water<00:00:58.250> is<00:00:58.399> not<00:00:58.550> boiling<00:00:58.850> or

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
as long as the water is not boiling or

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.450 
as long as the water is not boiling or
really<00:00:59.600> close<00:00:59.809> to<00:00:59.989> boiling<00:01:00.199> you<00:01:00.620> will<00:01:00.890> be<00:01:01.100> just

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
really close to boiling you will be just

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.810 
really close to boiling you will be just
fine

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
fine

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.819 
fine
so<00:01:02.390> what<00:01:02.570> I<00:01:02.600> normally<00:01:02.719> do<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.469> course<00:01:03.679> this

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
so what I normally do and of course this

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.560 
so what I normally do and of course this
is<00:01:04.010> different<00:01:04.370> for<00:01:04.519> everybody's<00:01:05.000> microwave

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
is different for everybody's microwave

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.360 
is different for everybody's microwave
and<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.350> temperature<00:01:06.740> of<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.920> water<00:01:07.100> before

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
and the temperature of the water before

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.520 
and the temperature of the water before
you<00:01:07.790> start<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.150> heat<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.480> but<00:01:08.900> I<00:01:08.930> take<00:01:09.260> about<00:01:09.500> a

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
you start to heat it but I take about a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.200 
you start to heat it but I take about a
cup<00:01:09.830> of<00:01:09.980> water<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.640> microwave<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:11.180> for

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
cup of water and the microwave it for

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.240 
cup of water and the microwave it for
about<00:01:11.390> two<00:01:11.780> minutes<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.380> that's<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:13.010> pretty

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
about two minutes and that's a pretty

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.010 
about two minutes and that's a pretty
good<00:01:13.340> temperature<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:14.180> can<00:01:14.390> kind<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.840> use

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
good temperature so you can kind of use

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.020 
good temperature so you can kind of use
that<00:01:15.050> as<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.380> gauge<00:01:15.680> but<00:01:16.280> again<00:01:16.520> do<00:01:16.700> be<00:01:16.850> careful

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
that as a gauge but again do be careful

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.430 
that as a gauge but again do be careful
you<00:01:17.270> don't<00:01:17.300> want<00:01:17.510> it<00:01:17.570> too<00:01:17.690> hot<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.080> don't<00:01:18.290> burn

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
you don't want it too hot and don't burn

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.350 
you don't want it too hot and don't burn
yourself<00:01:18.860> either<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.670> once<00:01:19.850> you<00:01:19.910> have<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.180> hot

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
yourself either so once you have the hot

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.830 
yourself either so once you have the hot
water<00:01:20.600> dunk<00:01:21.050> your<00:01:21.410> figure<00:01:21.800> in<00:01:22.040> up<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:23.090> this

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
water dunk your figure in up to this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.930 
water dunk your figure in up to this
point<00:01:24.170> here<00:01:24.590> at<00:01:24.770> least<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.580> what<00:01:25.730> you

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
point here at least this is what you

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.480 
point here at least this is what you
need<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.300> get<00:01:26.450> hot<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:26.960> soft<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:28.130> once<00:01:28.310> that's

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
need to get hot and soft and once that's

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.570 
need to get hot and soft and once that's
in<00:01:28.730> there<00:01:28.910> I'd<00:01:29.030> say<00:01:29.240> maybe<00:01:29.450> thirty<00:01:29.870> seconds

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
in there I'd say maybe thirty seconds

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.710 
in there I'd say maybe thirty seconds
maybe<00:01:31.580> not<00:01:31.850> even<00:01:32.000> depending<00:01:32.480> on<00:01:32.600> the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
maybe not even depending on the

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.750 
maybe not even depending on the
temperature<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.320> water<00:01:33.500> once<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:34.490> part

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
temperature of the water once this part

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.330 
temperature of the water once this part
is<00:01:34.970> nice<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.510> warm<00:01:35.720> you<00:01:36.290> want<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.770> I'll<00:01:37.100> use<00:01:37.160> a

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
is nice and warm you want to I'll use a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.580 
is nice and warm you want to I'll use a
knife<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:37.970> don't<00:01:38.180> use<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.420> knife<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:39.350> want<00:01:39.440> to

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
knife you don't use a knife you want to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.310 
knife you don't use a knife you want to

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
use a small flat-head screwdriver or

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.510 
use a small flat-head screwdriver or
something<00:01:42.590> else<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:42.950> can<00:01:42.980> get<00:01:43.220> in<00:01:43.340> there

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
something else that you can get in there

you want to go in between those two I do

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.330 
you want to go in between those two I do
it<00:01:50.660> on<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.750> outside<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.980> want<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.160> go<00:01:52.220> in

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
it on the outside but you want to go in

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.030 
it on the outside but you want to go in
between<00:01:52.460> those<00:01:52.820> two<00:01:53.120> and<00:01:53.390> just<00:01:53.450> pop<00:01:53.840> off<00:01:54.080> what

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
between those two and just pop off what

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.380 
between those two and just pop off what
you're<00:01:55.160> really<00:01:55.370> trying<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.640> do<00:01:55.790> is<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:56.090> pry

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
you're really trying to do is to pry

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.620 
you're really trying to do is to pry
this<00:01:56.450> part<00:01:57.050> come<00:01:57.560> on<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:59.180> want<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.360> pry<00:01:59.570> this

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
this part come on you want to pry this

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.350 
this part come on you want to pry this
out<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.530> over<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:00.950> peg<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.550> peg<00:02:01.730> should<00:02:02.000> stay

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
out and over the peg the peg should stay

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.540 
out and over the peg the peg should stay
in<00:02:02.660> on<00:02:03.050> this<00:02:03.290> side<00:02:03.500> so<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.830> can<00:02:03.950> lift<00:02:04.160> this<00:02:04.340> up

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
in on this side so you can lift this up

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.340 
in on this side so you can lift this up
and<00:02:04.670> over<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.240> then<00:02:05.720> this<00:02:05.900> part<00:02:06.200> will<00:02:06.320> be

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
and over and then this part will be

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.740 
and over and then this part will be
disconnected<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.340> can<00:02:07.490> pull<00:02:07.760> this<00:02:08.420> side

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
disconnected and you can pull this side

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.330 
disconnected and you can pull this side
through<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.289> peg<00:02:09.470> will<00:02:09.619> come<00:02:09.830> through<00:02:10.039> with

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
through the peg will come through with

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.220 
through the peg will come through with
it<00:02:10.519> it<00:02:11.090> should<00:02:11.120> happen<00:02:11.480> like<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.110> either

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
it it should happen like that but either

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.140 
it it should happen like that but either
way<00:02:12.440> it'll<00:02:12.980> pop<00:02:13.250> apart<00:02:13.550> one<00:02:13.819> way<00:02:13.970> or<00:02:14.090> another

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
way it'll pop apart one way or another

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.589 
way it'll pop apart one way or another
if<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.569> do<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:15.459> while<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.640> have<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:17.090> hot<00:02:17.330> you

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
if you do that while you have it hot you

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.150 
if you do that while you have it hot you
also<00:02:17.930> want<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.200> remove<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.650> boots<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.099> is

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
also want to remove the boots this is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.370 
also want to remove the boots this is
the<00:02:19.400> second<00:02:19.820> part<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.420> I'll<00:02:20.780> explain<00:02:21.140> why

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
the second part and I'll explain why

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.870 
the second part and I'll explain why
it's<00:02:21.440> not<00:02:21.740> necessary<00:02:22.340> but<00:02:22.550> either<00:02:22.670> way<00:02:22.820> you

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
it's not necessary but either way you

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.800 
it's not necessary but either way you
want<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.300> need<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.540> do

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
want you need to do

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.380 
want you need to do
this<00:02:23.930> part<00:02:24.200> for<00:02:24.739> sure<00:02:24.980> because<00:02:25.280> when<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.180> comes

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
this part for sure because when it comes

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.390 
this part for sure because when it comes
on<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.810> figure<00:02:27.110> it's<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.620> wrong<00:02:27.980> way<00:02:28.160> no

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
on the figure it's the wrong way no

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.670 
on the figure it's the wrong way no
matter<00:02:28.610> what<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:29.110> part<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:30.260> sticks<00:02:30.500> back

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
matter what the part that sticks back

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.140 
matter what the part that sticks back
for<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> calf<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.580> front<00:02:31.849> so<00:02:32.000> that's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
for the calf is in the front so that's

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.740 
for the calf is in the front so that's
no<00:02:32.300> good

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
no good

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.260 
no good
so<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.709> want<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.010> leave<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.280> at<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.580> pop

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
so if you want to leave it at that pop

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.780 
so if you want to leave it at that pop
that<00:02:35.300> off<00:02:35.690> on<00:02:35.870> either<00:02:36.020> side<00:02:36.400> flip<00:02:37.400> them<00:02:37.580> around

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
that off on either side flip them around

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.000 
that off on either side flip them around
leave<00:02:38.239> them<00:02:38.420> on<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.840> same<00:02:39.080> side<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.800> then<00:02:39.890> you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
leave them on the same side and then you

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.440 
leave them on the same side and then you
can<00:02:40.160> just<00:02:40.280> spin<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.640> boot<00:02:40.819> around<00:02:41.120> cuz<00:02:41.330> that's

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
can just spin the boot around cuz that's

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.120 
can just spin the boot around cuz that's
how<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:41.810> normally<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.530> that's<00:02:42.650> not<00:02:42.890> right

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
how it is normally and that's not right

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.780 
how it is normally and that's not right
obviously

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
obviously

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.940 
obviously
so<00:02:44.330> we'll<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.569> pop<00:02:44.780> them<00:02:44.900> off<00:02:45.110> flip<00:02:45.680> this

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
so we'll just pop them off flip this

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.100 
so we'll just pop them off flip this
part<00:02:46.250> around<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:47.209> put<00:02:47.390> them<00:02:47.480> back<00:02:47.599> on<00:02:47.660> and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
part around and put them back on and

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.080 
part around and put them back on and
then<00:02:48.500> put<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.069> together<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.670> way<00:02:49.819> they

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
then put it together the way they

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.050 
then put it together the way they
intended<00:02:50.599> it<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.810> be<00:02:50.959> put<00:02:51.319> together<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:52.610> that

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
intended it to be put together but that

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.360 
intended it to be put together but that
does<00:02:53.330> leave<00:02:53.630> one<00:02:53.660> other<00:02:54.230> problem<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.220> is

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
does leave one other problem and that is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.009 
does leave one other problem and that is
what<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:55.550> show<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.880> off<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.180> my<00:02:56.299> review<00:02:56.810> actually

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
what I show it off in my review actually

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.460 
what I show it off in my review actually
it<00:02:57.739> keeps<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.280> feet<00:02:58.549> kind<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.030> like<00:02:59.209> this<00:02:59.600> so

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
it keeps the feet kind of like this so

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.020 
it keeps the feet kind of like this so
you<00:03:00.530> have<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:00.860> spread<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.250> legs<00:03:01.400> really<00:03:01.730> far

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
you have to spread the legs really far

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.020 
you have to spread the legs really far
to<00:03:02.060> get<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.450> feet<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.810> go<00:03:02.959> flat<00:03:03.430> however<00:03:04.430> you

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
to get the feet to go flat however you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.360 
to get the feet to go flat however you
can<00:03:05.239> do<00:03:05.390> something<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.930> fix<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.260> now<00:03:06.950> this<00:03:07.160> is

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
can do something to fix that now this is

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.630 
can do something to fix that now this is
technically<00:03:07.850> not<00:03:08.239> correct<00:03:08.930> because<00:03:09.430> if<00:03:10.430> you

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
technically not correct because if you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.610 
technically not correct because if you
do<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.910> what<00:03:11.330> we've<00:03:11.480> done<00:03:11.660> just<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:12.290> point

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
do it what we've done just to this point

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.620 
do it what we've done just to this point
you<00:03:13.160> will<00:03:13.280> have<00:03:13.459> all<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.670> pieces<00:03:14.030> where<00:03:14.450> they

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
you will have all the pieces where they

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.750 
you will have all the pieces where they
belong<00:03:14.959> they<00:03:15.530> all<00:03:15.650> have<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.040> ELLs<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.549> this

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
belong they all have the ELLs on this

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.280 
belong they all have the ELLs on this
side<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.420> arse<00:03:17.569> on<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.019> side

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
side and the arse on this side

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.780 
side and the arse on this side
everything's<00:03:19.130> facing<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.610> right<00:03:19.760> direction

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
back on to the knee joint and what you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.309 
back on to the knee joint and what you
want<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.180> do<00:03:50.269> to<00:03:50.390> put<00:03:50.540> them<00:03:50.630> back<00:03:50.750> on<00:03:50.959> is<00:03:51.140> really

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
want to do to put them back on is really

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.900 
want to do to put them back on is really
just<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.739> exact<00:03:52.100> opposite<00:03:52.549> of<00:03:52.579> what<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:52.819> did

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
just the exact opposite of what you did

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.940 
just the exact opposite of what you did
to<00:03:53.030> take<00:03:53.239> them<00:03:53.389> off<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:54.470> should<00:03:54.680> still<00:03:54.920> have

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
to take them off you should still have

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.910 
to take them off you should still have
the<00:03:55.069> peg<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.609> one<00:03:55.880> side<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.870> just<00:03:57.200> kind<00:03:57.799> of

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
the peg in one side so just kind of

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.099 
the peg in one side so just kind of
while<00:03:58.489> it's<00:03:58.639> hot<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:58.970> soft<00:03:59.180> push<00:03:59.690> that<00:03:59.840> peg

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
while it's hot and soft push that peg

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.440 
while it's hot and soft push that peg
through<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:01.010> then<00:04:01.160> using<00:04:01.790> your<00:04:01.940> tool<00:04:02.209> you'll

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
through and then using your tool you'll

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.629 
through and then using your tool you'll
be<00:04:02.569> able<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:03.049> kind<00:04:03.350> of<00:04:03.440> hold<00:04:03.889> the<00:04:04.040> peg<00:04:04.220> in<00:04:04.370> place

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
be able to kind of hold the peg in place

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.330 
be able to kind of hold the peg in place
and<00:04:04.940> push<00:04:05.690> this<00:04:05.930> piece<00:04:06.170> back<00:04:06.530> down<00:04:06.739> over<00:04:07.190> the

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
and push this piece back down over the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.520 
and push this piece back down over the
peg<00:04:07.549> and<00:04:07.910> then<00:04:08.389> the<00:04:08.480> peg<00:04:08.690> will<00:04:08.989> come<00:04:09.260> through

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
peg and then the peg will come through

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.890 
peg and then the peg will come through
you<00:04:10.069> may<00:04:10.220> have<00:04:10.430> some<00:04:10.609> extra<00:04:10.639> little<00:04:11.150> hunks<00:04:11.810> of

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
you may have some extra little hunks of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.050 
you may have some extra little hunks of
plastic<00:04:12.410> in<00:04:12.590> there<00:04:13.340> that's<00:04:13.700> just<00:04:13.760> from

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
plastic in there that's just from

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.020 
plastic in there that's just from
manufacturing<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:15.109> know<00:04:15.200> little<00:04:15.500> bits<00:04:15.739> of

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
manufacturing you know little bits of

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.219 
manufacturing you know little bits of
plastic<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.299> can<00:04:17.570> cut<00:04:17.780> those<00:04:17.870> out<00:04:17.989> if<00:04:18.139> you

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
plastic so you can cut those out if you

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.529 
plastic so you can cut those out if you
want<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.500> I<00:04:18.590> don't<00:04:18.709> care<00:04:19.010> because<00:04:19.100> I<00:04:19.579> just

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
want to I don't care because I just

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:21.879 
want to I don't care because I just
don't<00:04:20.690> care<00:04:20.810> he<00:04:21.019> can't<00:04:21.229> really<00:04:21.320> see<00:04:21.560> him<00:04:21.680> but

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
don't care he can't really see him but

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.310 
don't care he can't really see him but
ok<00:04:22.400> so<00:04:22.460> what<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:22.910> want<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.180> do<00:04:23.300> then<00:04:23.510> is<00:04:23.750> look

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
ok so what you want to do then is look

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.200 
ok so what you want to do then is look
at<00:04:24.560> your<00:04:24.650> figure<00:04:25.039> and<00:04:25.280> be<00:04:25.430> happy<00:04:25.789> that<00:04:25.820> he<00:04:26.060> can

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
at your figure and be happy that he can

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.659 
at your figure and be happy that he can
stand<00:04:26.419> almost<00:04:26.960> perfectly<00:04:27.410> straight<00:04:27.919> as<00:04:28.130> you

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
stand almost perfectly straight as you

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.100 
stand almost perfectly straight as you
can<00:04:28.789> see<00:04:28.970> his<00:04:29.090> feet<00:04:29.330> are<00:04:29.479> almost<00:04:29.750> perfectly

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
can see his feet are almost perfectly

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.540 
can see his feet are almost perfectly
flat<00:04:30.410> there's<00:04:30.770> still<00:04:30.979> a<00:04:31.010> little<00:04:31.280> bit<00:04:31.370> of<00:04:31.460> a

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
flat there's still a little bit of a

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.870 
flat there's still a little bit of a
curve<00:04:31.820> but<00:04:33.010> it's<00:04:34.010> much<00:04:34.310> better<00:04:34.520> so

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
curve but it's much better so

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.640 
curve but it's much better so
technically<00:04:35.570> these<00:04:35.750> two<00:04:35.960> pieces<00:04:36.169> are<00:04:36.409> on<00:04:36.530> the

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
technically these two pieces are on the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.270 
technically these two pieces are on the
wrong<00:04:36.800> side

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
wrong side

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.730 
wrong side
but<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.210> really<00:04:38.450> helps<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.840> figure<00:04:39.170> stand-up

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
but it really helps to figure stand-up

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.160 
but it really helps to figure stand-up
and<00:04:39.980> I<00:04:40.460> think<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.300> should<00:04:41.330> probably<00:04:41.690> do<00:04:42.139> that

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
and I think you should probably do that

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.610 
and I think you should probably do that
if<00:04:42.560> you're<00:04:42.740> willing<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:43.130> use<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:44.360> hot<00:04:44.510> water

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
if you're willing to use the hot water

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.680 
if you're willing to use the hot water
technique<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.950> mean<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.030> can<00:04:47.240> use<00:04:47.389> a<00:04:47.419> hairdryer

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
technique I mean you can use a hairdryer

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.810 
technique I mean you can use a hairdryer
but<00:04:48.169> I<00:04:48.410> wouldn't<00:04:49.100> recommend<00:04:49.340> it<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:49.669> there<00:04:49.790> are

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
but I wouldn't recommend it so there are

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.820 
but I wouldn't recommend it so there are
these<00:04:49.940> guys<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.419> will<00:04:50.600> help<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:51.110> have<00:04:51.800> a

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
these guys that will help you have a

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.980 
these guys that will help you have a
rock<00:04:52.160> steady<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.610> stands<00:04:53.180> much<00:04:53.480> better<00:04:53.780> as

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
rock steady that stands much better as
