if<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.870> notice<00:01:13.230> a<00:01:13.410> diagonal<00:01:13.770> eyes<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.340> then

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
if you notice a diagonal eyes and then

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.990 
if you notice a diagonal eyes and then
they<00:01:14.610> must<00:01:14.820> start<00:01:15.600> becoming<00:01:16.260> media<00:01:16.830> again<00:01:17.070> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
they must start becoming media again it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.070 
they must start becoming media again it
comes<00:01:18.660> big<00:01:19.110> big<00:01:19.500> big<00:01:19.860> big<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.610> long<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.720> very
