00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.819
 yes how ironic would bend be to be interrogated on the cycling track 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.479
 and 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:11.479
 we ask this horrible animal laid on the base 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.470
 in the screens trained hard and on the extent to which the chest and and around the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.699
 barriers to refuting those males 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.060
 everyone has his whisper most people have giessen thinks those images 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.560
 seen images 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.560
 what did you say most afterwards 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.329
 the women smarter and proclaim what went through you that demand for one 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.140
 just scrap the voter 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.180
 yes say it a bit now 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.180
 and you know a kind of welt of projects 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.320
 action of dale to be established 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.020
 dale newspapers 9 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.910
 ma this is it is not completely recovered so mixed special because all newspapers 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.269
 I have a few here together 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.570
 grab them 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.570
 that is volkswagen work 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.470
 with not so fresh anymore 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.180
 and you do not say so fresh anymore I have seen that match myself 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.670
 at least half with an amateur competition that coke had to follow 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.860
 you see now and then sit in was in front then I thought unsure then none 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.150
 soil was not added the day of the candidate may not add ici 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.700
 good is too bad 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.470
 and there he was suddenly the troubled terpstra they said at the bell at the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.530
 Belgian 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.720
 years come on 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.070
 actually calm down 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.230
 and 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.230
 that might also be nice with the chance of a good full face 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.780
 the chapel when I return that has room 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.480
 I'm not going to do that 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.550
 then but not and I touch volunteers it was also a free sale because the 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.850
 headwind house 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.210
 then the wind will appear from behind 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.470
 an umd headwind actually comes a lot 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.660
 yes, ordered drivers are coming back every time 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.120
 therefore it also took a very long time before the FIA ​​lights were revealed and 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.120
 also a fairly large group, the latter also plays a role 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.929
 it is 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.869
 yes I do not constantly damn them 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.229
 the team mates did ask how could it be 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.699
 Amsterdam 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.699
 And then you only come across the commission relatively years 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.769
 and then you only enter that stadium 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.849
 and then 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.889
 yes i learned 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.669
 I didn't even judge it again among the respondents have so great previous ones 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:29.419
 week did 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.189
 it is not certain that the intended strip card will not work and one will fall 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.849
 small the line through it was the last two more times looked well 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:37.939
 within 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.739
 then came from 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.090
 come to remember that last year I spent years in these missions for hours 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.979
 fifth 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:49.859
 last year a normal it would be the trend than next year the 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.629
 first double g ria if I remember correctly a that would be nice 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:59.429
 but it is also very beautiful I have that at the time that park can belong this weekend 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.409
 sata yes 15 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.690
 to the statistics everything is quite right 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.830
 how is it going in his weblog to a lot of people walking around you 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.900
 everyone who pulls on you then just let your sorry other new ones 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.379
 put on shoes 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.749
 and when I saw, I go on stage to see how heavy it is that I see 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.539
 yes very heavy but I had enough space one could not afford 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.739
 what to find 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.819
 and that he also put the moment in the air 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:28.759
 and especially 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.389
 all interviews in things 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.010
 yes but happy 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.499
 from now on to accompany 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.059
 both teams the opponents 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.809
 Ireland doesn't say yesterday 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.029
 they don't attract too much luckily they were 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:45.299
 call to account and shout 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.889
 and then a party 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.989
 yes prices yoga can do a day of boating 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.889
 a nice dinner unfortunately not 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.279
 real bale party of course to the outcome 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:59.870
 We arrive at the end when it is nice and nice to see that whole 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:01.069
 plow 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.029
 whole team but it is not only the riders with guidance and the mission 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:06.519
 first mechanics 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.479
 and they also work time for an intimate when everything just goes through 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.449
 and have everything perfect 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.449
 looks like cycling with super powers 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.169
 the caretakers have 9 all in detail and 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.870
 guidance 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.870
 if the exploration of the course legal game 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.469
 on photos and images 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:30.520
 years that 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.360
 has made paid is they say everyone's victory 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:39.439
 wonder who not from everyone who have been in assendelft already read cake 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.740
 brought to your father's grace 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.280
 it is who has already eaten the horse he has the cake well you have the flowers 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.800
 I think flowers are also for r for your wife 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.719
 those on the children 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.909
 fits if you are not in it 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.259
 that's why i'm home 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.729
 the last few months the blame 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.969
 also think a little bit about the banks 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.009
 occur on rest and 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.300
 no other things and 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.300
 there is also not always this easy 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.080
 also for the man and the children 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.800
 that something like that becomes a plant 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.749
 in the coming weeks tell cover 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:21.300
 with the often left over in the piss of you are becoming a great way 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.460
 that things don't 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.659
 tonight 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.009
 it is about waiting a bit through these programs or yes yes the world 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.009
 runs through tonight 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.930
 a hundred people that day 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.439
 yes I think that in the coming period quietly racing your hobby 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.389
 that a bit by the pressure well with that car that name 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.809
 mua 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:49.870
 well 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.560
 and just watch 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.939
 have taken a few days off carries 4 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:56.089
 it will be alright 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.180
 so the proud man full but that 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.520
 that you radiate he emphasized 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.770
 there is however 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.059
 Chris won the race so missed it 

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:09.650
 if I realize the version now 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.250
 who has this I think you should occasionally get chiang so it is so 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.520
 his editors are rushing this 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.080
 as known 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.530
 one thing is certainly not the theresenwiese hit in the books
