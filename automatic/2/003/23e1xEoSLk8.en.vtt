00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
very simple tools to make animations

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.400 
very simple tools to make animations
let's<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> look<00:00:28.019> at<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.380> there's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.310> drop

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
next page the drop moves a little low

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.940 
next page the drop moves a little low
and<00:00:35.399> again<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.600> rushing<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.530> so

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
and then the drop falls down and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.180 
and then the drop falls down and
squishes<00:00:45.090> even<00:00:45.480> load<00:00:45.690> now<00:00:46.590> let's<00:00:46.829> check<00:00:47.039> out

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
up on the d-pad you get the menu screen

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.289 
up on the d-pad you get the menu screen
and<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.710> get<00:01:10.830> all<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> different<00:01:11.640> drawn

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
drawing tools so for example you see the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.870 
drawing tools so for example you see the
difference<00:01:16.170> pencil<00:01:16.830> tool<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.700> can

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and legs in different positions to make

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.649 
and legs in different positions to make
it<00:02:01.020> look<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.439> he's<00:02:01.649> moving<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.570> you

you press down on the d-pad em you see

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.430 
you press down on the d-pad em you see
animation<00:02:12.569> comes<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.080> life

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
animation comes to life

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.040 
animation comes to life
we<00:02:14.370> see<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> beauty<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.360> flipping<00:02:15.780> out<00:02:15.870> is

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
we see the beauty of flipping out is

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.950 
we see the beauty of flipping out is
using<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.710> extremely<00:02:17.520> simple<00:02:18.300> tools<00:02:18.660> to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
using it's extremely simple tools to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.590 
using it's extremely simple tools to
make<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.440> animations<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.000> let's<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.510> a

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
make this animations so let's have a
