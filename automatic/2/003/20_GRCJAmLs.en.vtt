 now it's for real the two years the environmental company can no longer 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.850
 the western zone and the inspection started very close 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.530
 dawn has an employee surprised when he got to work in the garage 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.119
 or friends who was already taken off the streets she obeyed all transients nothing 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.240
 continued to suffer from poor transport conditions 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:24.219
 It was still early morning in many collectors and drivers of the Eastern 

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:25.800
 caught by surprise 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.699
 arrived to work but the buses could not leave the garage in 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.839
 Most Holy 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.560
 without knowing what to do they waited for information at the door of the company 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.470
 the inspection was set up in at least three points to remove from 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.850
 cars that have managed to get out of the 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.130
 at least ten buses were barred at the large field terminal and had to 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.000
 return to the garage 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.500
 to prevent riots the military police reinforced patrolling near 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.970
 company headquarters 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.820
 The purpose of the action was to comply with a municipal decree that 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.230
 orientation 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.230
 now has to have the vine being operated on are infected 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.310
 was set up to ensure passenger service 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.970
 half past nine in the morning 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.070
 claimed territory 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560
 the state of s 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.390
 everything I heard and 40 minutes of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.610
 I replaced 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.090
 but for not being able to provide a good service 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.440
 mainly because talking to Emtu buses is just bruising him then 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.270
 would have permission revoked 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.799
 in the sights of the municipal transport department 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.900
 there are still two other companies 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.579
 since March last year the companies accepted and western 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.469
 respond to administrative processes to improve the service rendered 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.140
 whereas these prices still have in practice the right of 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.450
 if they can not be recovered, they will be revoked, for example. 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.800
 happened with weight and mental and their vineyards will also be tendered 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.460
 who depends on transportation 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.030
 still not satisfied 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.020
 which improves very nervous and they know 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.230
