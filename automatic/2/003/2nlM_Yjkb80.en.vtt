00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
so we're back with Series three 109 and

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.619 
so we're back with Series three 109 and
what<00:00:02.879> we<00:00:02.939> going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.120> be<00:00:03.179> doing<00:00:03.210> today<00:00:03.480> is

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
what we going to be doing today is

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.960 
what we going to be doing today is
fitting<00:00:04.110> right<00:00:04.140> off<00:00:04.589> roads<00:00:04.920> acoustic<00:00:05.790> mat

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
fitting right off roads acoustic mat

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.629 
fitting right off roads acoustic mat
system<00:00:06.390> now<00:00:07.080> it's<00:00:07.529> quite<00:00:07.770> an<00:00:07.890> easy<00:00:08.010> fit<00:00:08.429> but

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
system now it's quite an easy fit but

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.820 
system now it's quite an easy fit but
there<00:00:08.730> are<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> few<00:00:09.150> things<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.660> consider<00:00:09.830> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
there are a few things to consider the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.620 
there are a few things to consider the
most<00:00:11.010> difficult<00:00:11.429> part<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.120> fitting<00:00:12.450> is

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
most difficult part of the fitting is

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.839 
most difficult part of the fitting is
over<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.349> seat<00:00:13.530> boxes<00:00:13.980> because<00:00:14.490> all<00:00:14.639> land

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
over the seat boxes because all land

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.039 
over the seat boxes because all land
rows<00:00:15.000> are<00:00:15.120> different<00:00:15.450> especially<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.870> one

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
rows are different especially this one

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.180 
rows are different especially this one
which<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.289> got<00:00:16.410> all<00:00:16.529> number<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.859> military

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
which is got all number of military

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
switches latches and catches on it you

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
switches latches and catches on it you
have<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> cut<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> mat<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.880> suit<00:00:21.090> your<00:00:21.210> vehicle

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
have to cut the mat to suit your vehicle

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.269 
have to cut the mat to suit your vehicle
and<00:00:21.840> that's<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.320> only<00:00:22.500> complicated<00:00:23.039> bit<00:00:23.160> that

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
and that's the only complicated bit that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.710 
and that's the only complicated bit that
we're<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> look<00:00:23.820> into<00:00:24.029> so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
we're going to have to look into so

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.179 
we're going to have to look into so
we're<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.230> start<00:00:25.500> by<00:00:25.769> getting<00:00:26.160> the

bulkhead on the inside of the cab this

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.279 
bulkhead on the inside of the cab this
is<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> seat<00:00:45.629> box<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.170> bit

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
is for you seat box this is the bit

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.020 
is for you seat box this is the bit
we've<00:00:46.410> got<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.590> cut<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> first<00:00:47.789> thing<00:00:47.969> we

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
we've got to cut so the first thing we

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.510 
we've got to cut so the first thing we
need<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.539> fit<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.520> self-supporting

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
need to do is fit the self-supporting

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.400 
need to do is fit the self-supporting
panel<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> bulkhead<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.230> means

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
panel on to the bulkhead what that means

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.049 
panel on to the bulkhead what that means
you<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.739> need<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.920> glue<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.879> sits

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
you don't need to glue it it just sits

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.310 
you don't need to glue it it just sits
on<00:00:54.180> there<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.600> we're<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.110> what

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
on there but what we're going to do what

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.799 
on there but what we're going to do what
they<00:00:55.440> advise<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.219> remove<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
they advise you do is remove here the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.020 
they advise you do is remove here the
for<00:00:58.289> your<00:00:58.440> drive<00:00:58.649> instruction<00:00:59.160> plate<00:00:59.730> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
for your drive instruction plate and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.569 
for your drive instruction plate and
actually<00:01:00.840> use<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.739> pin<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> back<00:01:02.370> onto

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
actually use that to pin it back onto

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.090 
actually use that to pin it back onto
the<00:01:02.850> bulkhead<00:01:03.600> I'd<00:01:04.320> quite<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the bulkhead I'd quite like to have that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.410 
the bulkhead I'd quite like to have that
on<00:01:05.250> there<00:01:05.400> anyway<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.240> will<00:01:06.330> just

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
on there anyway and I think it will just

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780 
on there anyway and I think it will just
add<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.869> bit<00:01:07.020> more<00:01:07.049> security<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> mat<00:01:07.950> okay

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
add a bit more security to the mat okay

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.539 
add a bit more security to the mat okay
so<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.060> simply<00:01:09.390> slide<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.860> bulkhead<00:01:11.280> mat<00:01:11.460> in

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
so we simply slide the bulkhead mat in

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.899 
so we simply slide the bulkhead mat in
place<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:13.979> using<00:01:14.010> self-tapping

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
place and then I'm using self-tapping

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.510 
place and then I'm using self-tapping
screws<00:01:15.979> stainless<00:01:16.979> ones<00:01:17.299> just<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:19.130> gently<00:01:20.130> pin

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
screws stainless ones just to gently pin

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.660 
screws stainless ones just to gently pin
that<00:01:20.729> plaque<00:01:21.090> onto<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.220> okay<00:01:23.220> now

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that plaque onto the okay now

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.890 
that plaque onto the okay now
unfortunately<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.270> there's<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.840> many

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
unfortunately because there's so many

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.510 
unfortunately because there's so many
layers<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.259> paint<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.860> vehicle<00:01:26.100> being

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
layers of paint on this vehicle being

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.760 
layers of paint on this vehicle being
military<00:01:26.780> it's<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.170> almost

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
military it's going to be almost

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
military it's going to be almost
impossible<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.579> take<00:01:29.729> these<00:01:29.880> seats<00:01:30.180> off<00:01:30.420> not

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
impossible to take these seats off not

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.990 
impossible to take these seats off not
only<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.619> need<00:01:31.740> access<00:01:32.189> into<00:01:32.700> my<00:01:32.790> seat

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
only that but I need access into my seat

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.969 
only that but I need access into my seat
boxes<00:01:33.390> every<00:01:33.720> day<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:34.200> whenever<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.680> run<00:01:34.829> out<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
boxes every day or whenever I run out of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.289 
boxes every day or whenever I run out of
fuel<00:01:35.130> because<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> fuel<00:01:35.700> tanks<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.090> under

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
fuel because the fuel tanks are under

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.210 
fuel because the fuel tanks are under
both<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.930> passenger<00:01:37.350> side<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> driver's

both the passenger side and the driver's
side<00:01:38.310> seat<00:01:38.549> box<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:40.470> plan<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:40.920> we've

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
side seat box so the plan is that we've

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.830 
side seat box so the plan is that we've
actually<00:01:41.369> put<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> matting<00:01:42.060> system<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.570> place

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
actually put the matting system in place

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.530 
actually put the matting system in place
and<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.560> lip<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.280> sit<00:01:44.820> over<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.450> edge

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and I have it lip just sit over the edge

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.929 
and I have it lip just sit over the edge
here<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> over<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> front<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.909> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
here and over the front here with a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.120 
here and over the front here with a
little<00:01:48.210> section<00:01:48.930> cut<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.649> drop<00:01:49.890> down

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
little section cut for the drop down

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.100 
little section cut for the drop down
latch<00:01:50.460> we're<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.509> continue<00:01:51.899> all<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
latch we're going to continue all the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.700 
latch we're going to continue all the
way<00:01:52.200> through

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
way through

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.060 
way through
obviously<00:01:53.040> cutting<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.729> handbrake<00:01:54.570> and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
obviously cutting for the handbrake and

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.280 
obviously cutting for the handbrake and
just<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.189> as<00:01:56.250> best<00:01:56.880> job<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.119> can<00:01:57.329> now<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> make

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
just do as best job we can now to make

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.330 
just do as best job we can now to make
things<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.560> bit<00:01:58.710> easier<00:01:58.770> what<00:01:59.250> I'm

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
things a little bit easier what I'm

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.859 
things a little bit easier what I'm
going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.729> actually<00:01:59.850> use<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
going to do is actually use the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.020 
going to do is actually use the
handbrake<00:02:01.740> Gator<00:02:02.100> returning<00:02:02.640> plate<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
handbrake Gator returning plate as a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.450 
handbrake Gator returning plate as a
guide<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:04.049> cut<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.560> aperture<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
guide to cut the aperture for the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.980 
guide to cut the aperture for the
handbrake<00:02:05.850> lever<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.329> I'm<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> take

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
handbrake lever and I'm going to take

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.990 
handbrake lever and I'm going to take
the<00:02:07.079> bracket<00:02:07.409> off<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.890> covers<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.670> protects

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the bracket off that covers and protects

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.150 
the bracket off that covers and protects
the<00:02:09.149> switch<00:02:09.330> over<00:02:09.599> tap<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.410> my<00:02:10.500> fuel<00:02:10.770> tanks

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the switch over tap for my fuel tanks

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.369 
the switch over tap for my fuel tanks
and<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.150> will<00:02:12.239> give<00:02:12.330> me<00:02:12.390> an<00:02:12.450> idea<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.870> where

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
and that will give me an idea of where

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.920 
and that will give me an idea of where
things

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
things

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.190 
things
it's<00:02:14.579> so<00:02:15.579> remembering<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.209> this<00:02:16.569> is<00:02:16.840> the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
it's so remembering that this is the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.720 
it's so remembering that this is the
driver<00:02:17.439> side<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:18.010> we're<00:02:18.129> right<00:02:18.280> hand<00:02:18.489> drive

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
driver side and we're right hand drive

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.119 
driver side and we're right hand drive
don't<00:02:19.629> confuse<00:02:20.349> yourself<00:02:20.500> thinking<00:02:21.069> that

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
don't confuse yourself thinking that

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.410 
don't confuse yourself thinking that
this<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.489> section<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:22.000> should<00:02:22.030> remove

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
this is the section you should remove

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.959 
this is the section you should remove
for<00:02:23.109> your<00:02:23.290> handbrake<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:24.370> actually<00:02:24.670> see

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
for your handbrake you actually see

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.679 
for your handbrake you actually see
there's<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.269> slight<00:02:25.510> witness<00:02:26.019> marking<00:02:26.439> here

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
there's a slight witness marking here

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.209 
there's a slight witness marking here
the<00:02:28.689> same<00:02:28.870> shape<00:02:29.200> as<00:02:29.379> this<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.890> I'll<00:02:29.980> show<00:02:30.129> you

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
the same shape as this and I'll show you

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.300 
the same shape as this and I'll show you
that<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.370> detail<00:02:30.639> and<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.599> just<00:02:31.900> sits<00:02:32.310> over

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
that in detail and that just sits over

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.369 
that in detail and that just sits over
the<00:02:33.400> top<00:02:33.579> there<00:02:33.760> look<00:02:33.969> and<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:34.989> cut<00:02:35.230> that

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
the top there look and you can cut that

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.589 
the top there look and you can cut that
out<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.459> we'll<00:02:36.579> do<00:02:36.639> that<00:02:36.670> now<00:02:36.909> do<00:02:37.389> make<00:02:37.569> sure

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
out so we'll do that now do make sure

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.110 
out so we'll do that now do make sure
you've<00:02:37.840> got<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.989> very<00:02:38.230> sharp<00:02:38.560> brand<00:02:39.459> new<00:02:39.639> blade

the<00:02:52.389> trickiest<00:02:52.629> bit<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.900> all<00:02:53.049> I'm<00:02:53.530> going<00:02:53.650> to

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
the trickiest bit of all I'm going to

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.460 
the trickiest bit of all I'm going to
lay<00:02:53.889> the<00:02:54.189> seat<00:02:54.669> box<00:02:54.879> matting<00:02:55.359> over<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.290> top

it's<00:02:56.680> just<00:02:56.799> going<00:02:56.919> to<00:02:56.980> sit<00:02:57.129> there<00:02:57.189> for<00:02:57.340> now

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
it's just going to sit there for now

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.190 
it's just going to sit there for now
we've<00:02:58.120> made<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.299> opportunity<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.840> handbrake

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
we've made the opportunity the handbrake

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.990 
we've made the opportunity the handbrake
and<00:02:59.439> then<00:02:59.859> we're<00:02:59.950> going<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.099> try<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.370> mark<00:03:00.639> all

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
and then we're going to try and mark all

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.750 
and then we're going to try and mark all
the<00:03:01.439> exposed<00:03:02.439> pieces<00:03:02.919> and<00:03:03.159> the<00:03:03.219> areas<00:03:03.519> for<00:03:03.669> the

the exposed pieces and the areas for the
seats<00:03:04.000> they're<00:03:04.659> going<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.840> be<00:03:04.900> cut<00:03:05.109> out<00:03:05.879> one

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
seats they're going to be cut out one

seats they're going to be cut out one
thing<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.060> didn't<00:03:07.239> mention<00:03:07.359> before<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.689> this

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
thing I didn't mention before is this

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.080 
thing I didn't mention before is this
matting<00:03:08.260> is<00:03:08.409> incredibly<00:03:08.919> heavy<00:03:09.159> that's<00:03:10.000> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
matting is incredibly heavy that's the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.879 
matting is incredibly heavy that's the
idea<00:03:10.389> it<00:03:10.510> absorbs<00:03:10.870> all<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.049> sound<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:11.859> you

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
idea it absorbs all the sound so you

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.860 
idea it absorbs all the sound so you
might<00:03:12.069> struggle<00:03:12.310> on<00:03:12.489> your<00:03:12.609> own<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:13.659> if<00:03:13.719> you<00:03:13.780> can

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
might struggle on your own so if you can

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.599 
might struggle on your own so if you can
get<00:03:13.989> two<00:03:14.169> people<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.500> do<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.680> it's<00:03:15.099> worth<00:03:15.370> it

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
get two people to do it it's worth it

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:16.800 
get two people to do it it's worth it
because<00:03:15.669> even<00:03:16.150> this<00:03:16.269> section<00:03:16.569> is<00:03:16.629> quite<00:03:16.719> a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
because even this section is quite a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:27.180 
because even this section is quite a
lump<00:03:25.409> they<00:03:26.409> need<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.680> make<00:03:26.799> sure<00:03:26.979> that<00:03:27.099> you

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
lump they need to make sure that you

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.559 
lump they need to make sure that you
pull<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.519> in<00:03:27.609> nice<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:27.849> tight<00:03:28.060> before<00:03:28.359> you

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
pull it in nice and tight before you

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.689 
pull it in nice and tight before you
mark<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:29.019> because<00:03:29.620> obviously<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:30.189> can't<00:03:30.430> get

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
mark it because obviously it can't get

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.429 
mark it because obviously it can't get
all<00:03:30.909> the<00:03:31.060> way<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.299> with<00:03:31.659> these<00:03:31.810> seats<00:03:32.109> on<00:03:32.260> here

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
all the way on with these seats on here

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:33.569 
all the way on with these seats on here
so<00:03:32.560> these<00:03:32.650> are<00:03:32.799> probably<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.129> cuts<00:03:33.370> I'm<00:03:33.459> going

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
so these are probably the cuts I'm going

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:41.009 
so these are probably the cuts I'm going
to<00:03:33.639> make<00:03:33.729> first<00:03:37.169> I'm<00:03:38.169> using<00:03:38.199> now<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:39.870> lid<00:03:40.870> for

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
to make first I'm using now the lid for

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.259 
to make first I'm using now the lid for
the<00:03:41.109> seat<00:03:41.290> box<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.829> I<00:03:42.370> get<00:03:42.579> access<00:03:42.879> to<00:03:42.909> my<00:03:43.060> fuel

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
the seat box and I get access to my fuel

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.759 
the seat box and I get access to my fuel
for<00:03:43.540> just<00:03:44.169> to<00:03:44.319> run<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.919> line<00:03:45.430> down<00:03:46.329> here<00:03:46.560> next<00:03:47.560> to

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
for just to run a line down here next to

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:48.749 
for just to run a line down here next to
the<00:03:47.859> other<00:03:47.979> seat<00:03:48.189> rail<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.519> know<00:03:48.639> it's

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:48.759 
the other seat rail so I know it's

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:49.649 
the other seat rail so I know it's
straight<00:03:49.060> I<00:03:49.239> know<00:03:49.359> it's<00:03:49.449> in<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.599> right

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
straight I know it's in the right

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.969 
straight I know it's in the right
position<00:03:52.349> I'm<00:03:53.349> actually<00:03:53.530> finding<00:03:53.829> it<00:03:53.949> quite

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:53.979 
position I'm actually finding it quite

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.740 
position I'm actually finding it quite
easy<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.430> work<00:03:54.519> inside<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.239> vehicle<00:03:55.479> on<00:03:55.540> these

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
easy to work inside the vehicle on these

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.179 
easy to work inside the vehicle on these
because<00:03:55.989> once<00:03:56.139> I<00:03:56.290> know<00:03:56.349> where<00:03:56.620> my<00:03:56.709> lines<00:03:56.949> are

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
because once I know where my lines are

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.979 
because once I know where my lines are
it's<00:03:57.310> quite<00:03:57.519> neat<00:03:57.669> you<00:03:58.299> get<00:03:58.479> a<00:03:58.509> good<00:03:58.720> line<00:03:58.959> on

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
it's quite neat you get a good line on

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.670 
it's quite neat you get a good line on
the<00:03:59.199> blade<00:03:59.439> and<00:03:59.979> you<00:04:00.129> can<00:04:00.159> draw<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:01.680> just

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
the blade and you can draw it just

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.719 
the blade and you can draw it just
taking<00:04:03.099> your<00:04:03.189> time<00:04:03.430> take<00:04:04.389> two<00:04:04.689> or<00:04:04.840> three<00:04:08.729> times

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
taking your time take two or three times

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:13.080 
taking your time take two or three times
to<00:04:10.060> get<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.299> cut<00:04:10.569> properly<00:04:11.049> and<00:04:11.879> this<00:04:12.879> will<00:04:13.030> be

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
to get it cut properly and this will be

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.280 
to get it cut properly and this will be
the<00:04:13.180> last<00:04:13.359> time<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.629> use<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:13.840> blade<00:04:14.109> that

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
the last time I use this blade that

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.599 
the last time I use this blade that
needs<00:04:14.470> replacing<00:04:14.709> now<00:04:15.069> that<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.280> can<00:04:15.400> see<00:04:15.430> I'm

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
needs replacing now that you can see I'm

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.719 
needs replacing now that you can see I'm
just<00:04:15.639> cutting<00:04:15.909> through<00:04:16.299> now<00:04:17.280> don't<00:04:18.280> rush<00:04:18.489> it

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
just cutting through now don't rush it

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:19.770 
just cutting through now don't rush it
because<00:04:18.909> it<00:04:19.180> will<00:04:19.269> go<00:04:19.389> through<00:04:19.539> eventually

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
because it will go through eventually

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.300 
because it will go through eventually
once<00:04:20.259> you've<00:04:20.380> got<00:04:20.500> through<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.769> top<00:04:21.039> layer

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
once you've got through that top layer

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.330 
once you've got through that top layer
which<00:04:21.549> is<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.759> toughest<00:04:22.150> bit<00:04:22.950> it'll<00:04:23.950> almost

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
which is the toughest bit it'll almost

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.909 
which is the toughest bit it'll almost
just<00:04:24.580> split<00:04:24.940> off<00:04:25.060> in<00:04:25.210> your<00:04:25.330> hands<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.740> just

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
just split off in your hands and just

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:35.690 
just split off in your hands and just
watch<00:04:27.039> these<00:04:27.190> corners

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.980 

now<00:04:36.700> this<00:04:36.880> is<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.120> third<00:04:37.330> blade<00:04:37.630> I've<00:04:37.810> done

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
now this is the third blade I've done

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.110 
now this is the third blade I've done
I'm<00:04:38.140> about<00:04:38.260> halfway<00:04:38.530> through<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.550> can't

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
I'm about halfway through so I can't

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.910 
I'm about halfway through so I can't
stress<00:04:40.360> enough<00:04:40.480> how<00:04:40.660> much<00:04:40.870> easier<00:04:41.230> it<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.590> if

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
stress enough how much easier it is if

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.510 
stress enough how much easier it is if
you<00:04:42.040> just<00:04:42.070> use<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.400> new<00:04:42.580> blade<00:04:43.020> after<00:04:44.020> every

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
you just use a new blade after every

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.950 
you just use a new blade after every
probably<00:04:45.520> two<00:04:45.820> meters<00:04:46.240> worth<00:04:46.390> of<00:04:46.570> cutting

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
probably two meters worth of cutting

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.200 
probably two meters worth of cutting
lines<00:04:47.170> you've<00:04:47.380> done<00:04:47.620> with<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.280> blade<00:04:48.550> at<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
lines you've done with a blade at the

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.340 
lines you've done with a blade at the
most<00:04:49.890> switch<00:04:50.890> over<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.900> get<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.930> new<00:04:53.110> one<00:04:53.230> in

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
most switch over and get a new one in

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.700 
most switch over and get a new one in
there

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
there

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.340 
there
okay<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:54.520> we've<00:04:54.670> loosely<00:04:55.180> cut<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.960> shape<00:04:56.170> that

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
okay so we've loosely cut the shape that

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.980 
okay so we've loosely cut the shape that
we<00:04:56.440> need<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:57.120> we've<00:04:58.120> just<00:04:58.150> noticed<00:04:58.600> on<00:04:58.690> here

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
we need and we've just noticed on here

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.270 
we need and we've just noticed on here
as<00:04:59.140> well<00:04:59.350> that<00:04:59.380> you've<00:04:59.680> got<00:04:59.830> some<00:05:00.010> witness

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
as well that you've got some witness

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.920 
as well that you've got some witness
marks<00:05:00.610> where<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.210> latches<00:05:01.600> are<00:05:01.660> going<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.840> be

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
marks where the latches are going to be

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.950 
marks where the latches are going to be
on<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.140> boxes<00:05:02.530> so<00:05:02.740> I<00:05:03.210> just<00:05:04.210> draw<00:05:04.420> a<00:05:04.450> line<00:05:04.660> round

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
on the boxes so I just draw a line round

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.400 
on the boxes so I just draw a line round
there<00:05:05.290> where<00:05:05.470> that<00:05:05.500> is<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:07.900> makes<00:05:08.050> it<00:05:08.170> easy<00:05:08.290> for

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
there where that is it makes it easy for

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
there where that is it makes it easy for
me<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.590> cut<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.300> also<00:05:10.300> easier<00:05:10.720> for<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:10.930> see

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
me to cut and also easier for you to see

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.800 
me to cut and also easier for you to see
I've<00:05:12.430> got<00:05:12.580> a<00:05:12.610> new<00:05:12.760> blade<00:05:12.940> in<00:05:13.150> here<00:05:13.390> which<00:05:13.660> is

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
I've got a new blade in here which is

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.590 
I've got a new blade in here which is
very<00:05:13.990> important<00:05:14.320> just<00:05:14.730> going<00:05:15.730> to<00:05:18.390> cut<00:05:19.390> where<00:05:19.540> I

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
very important just going to cut where I

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.940 
very important just going to cut where I
prefer<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.170> cut<00:05:20.350> it<00:05:20.530> from<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.800> other<00:05:20.920> side

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
prefer to cut it from the other side

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.800 
prefer to cut it from the other side
really<00:05:21.670> because<00:05:22.000> you<00:05:22.120> get<00:05:22.270> through<00:05:22.420> that<00:05:22.540> hard

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
really because you get through that hard

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.320 
really because you get through that hard
layer<00:05:23.080> first<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:24.220> then<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:24.610> tends<00:05:24.850> to<00:05:25.000> peel

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
layer first and then it tends to peel

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.180 
layer first and then it tends to peel
nicely<00:05:26.520> but<00:05:29.760> I'm<00:05:30.760> sure<00:05:30.970> we<00:05:31.060> can<00:05:31.210> manage<00:05:31.330> just

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
nicely but I'm sure we can manage just

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.260 
nicely but I'm sure we can manage just
be<00:05:33.190> careful<00:05:33.550> as<00:05:33.610> well<00:05:33.730> on<00:05:33.820> these<00:05:34.000> because

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
be careful as well on these because

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.970 
be careful as well on these because
where<00:05:34.570> you've<00:05:34.720> cut<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.170> if<00:05:35.380> there's<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.650> sharp

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
where you've cut it if there's a sharp

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.670 
where you've cut it if there's a sharp
corner<00:05:36.330> if<00:05:37.330> you<00:05:37.510> don't<00:05:37.690> handle<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.170> right<00:05:38.410> when

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
corner if you don't handle it right when

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.750 
corner if you don't handle it right when
you're<00:05:38.830> putting<00:05:39.040> it<00:05:39.220> in<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:39.520> out<00:05:39.610> of<00:05:39.700> the

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
you're putting it in and out of the

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.390 
you're putting it in and out of the
vehicle<00:05:39.910> you<00:05:40.240> could<00:05:40.480> end<00:05:40.690> up<00:05:40.990> tearing<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.680> and

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
vehicle you could end up tearing it and

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.570 
vehicle you could end up tearing it and
getting<00:05:43.140> something<00:05:44.140> you<00:05:44.320> don't<00:05:44.440> want<00:05:47.430> we<00:05:48.430> go

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
getting something you don't want we go

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.050 
getting something you don't want we go
and<00:05:48.820> that's<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.120> section<00:05:49.480> for<00:05:49.690> our<00:05:50.700> latch<00:05:51.700> now

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
and that's the section for our latch now

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.180 
and that's the section for our latch now
if<00:05:52.150> you're<00:05:52.300> really<00:05:52.540> particular<00:05:53.110> you<00:05:53.650> can<00:05:53.800> sand

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
if you're really particular you can sand

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.210 
if you're really particular you can sand
this<00:05:54.400> material<00:05:54.910> with<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.030> very<00:05:55.240> fine<00:05:56.040> piece<00:05:57.040> of

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
this material with a very fine piece of

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.540 
this material with a very fine piece of
sandpaper<00:05:57.460> on<00:05:57.700> it<00:05:57.850> on<00:05:57.970> a<00:05:58.710> electric<00:05:59.710> sander<00:05:59.890> and

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
sandpaper on it on a electric sander and

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.830 
sandpaper on it on a electric sander and
that<00:06:00.700> will<00:06:00.790> just<00:06:00.940> make<00:06:01.150> it<00:06:01.180> nice<00:06:01.390> and<00:06:01.450> smooth

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
that will just make it nice and smooth

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.660 
that will just make it nice and smooth
so<00:06:02.080> if<00:06:02.350> you're<00:06:02.890> that<00:06:02.980> way<00:06:03.100> inclined<00:06:03.400> you<00:06:03.430> want

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
so if you're that way inclined you want

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.060 
so if you're that way inclined you want
to<00:06:03.730> make<00:06:03.820> a<00:06:03.850> really<00:06:04.270> really<00:06:04.540> nice<00:06:04.690> tidy<00:06:05.620> job<00:06:05.950> of

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
to make a really really nice tidy job of

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.890 
to make a really really nice tidy job of
it<00:06:06.160> if<00:06:06.250> you've<00:06:06.340> got<00:06:06.370> a<00:06:06.780> restoration<00:06:07.780> you're

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
it if you've got a restoration you're

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.850 
it if you've got a restoration you're
doing<00:06:08.140> then<00:06:08.740> that<00:06:09.640> is<00:06:09.790> possible<00:06:10.500> well<00:06:11.500> already

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
doing then that is possible well already

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.200 
doing then that is possible well already
it's<00:06:12.070> making<00:06:12.370> a<00:06:12.430> big<00:06:12.670> difference<00:06:12.880> the

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
it's making a big difference the

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.660 
it's making a big difference the
interior<00:06:13.690> so<00:06:14.230> we've<00:06:14.410> cut<00:06:14.680> round<00:06:14.950> all<00:06:15.280> the<00:06:15.490> seat

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.670 
interior so we've cut round all the seat

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.580 
interior so we've cut round all the seat
frames<00:06:15.940> here<00:06:16.180> we've<00:06:16.990> allowed<00:06:17.230> for<00:06:17.500> these

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
frames here we've allowed for these

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.980 
frames here we've allowed for these
latches<00:06:18.070> the<00:06:18.280> trickiest<00:06:19.060> bit<00:06:19.300> for<00:06:19.480> me<00:06:19.630> was<00:06:19.870> to

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
latches the trickiest bit for me was to

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.990 
latches the trickiest bit for me was to
actually<00:06:20.260> cut<00:06:20.470> the<00:06:20.590> circular<00:06:21.040> hole<00:06:21.070> to<00:06:21.850> allow

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
actually cut the circular hole to allow

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.870 
actually cut the circular hole to allow
for<00:06:22.300> the<00:06:22.390> fuel<00:06:23.110> switchover<00:06:23.620> tap<00:06:23.890> to<00:06:24.040> go<00:06:24.190> on<00:06:24.340> but

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
for the fuel switchover tap to go on but

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.580 
for the fuel switchover tap to go on but
it's<00:06:25.000> all<00:06:25.120> done<00:06:25.300> now<00:06:25.510> so<00:06:26.290> what<00:06:26.380> we've<00:06:26.500> done

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
it's all done now so what we've done

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.870 
it's all done now so what we've done
here<00:06:26.800> is<00:06:26.920> we've<00:06:27.040> actually<00:06:27.190> used<00:06:27.370> the<00:06:27.700> piece

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
here is we've actually used the piece

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.320 
here is we've actually used the piece
that<00:06:28.060> we<00:06:28.150> cut<00:06:28.180> out<00:06:28.440> earlier<00:06:29.440> and<00:06:29.850> just<00:06:30.850> laying

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
that we cut out earlier and just laying

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.820 
that we cut out earlier and just laying
it<00:06:31.480> over<00:06:31.840> the<00:06:31.930> top<00:06:32.080> of<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.260> box<00:06:32.410> there<00:06:32.590> which<00:06:32.710> I

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
it over the top of the box there which I

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.650 
it over the top of the box there which I
think's<00:06:33.100> efficient<00:06:33.550> it's<00:06:34.060> a<00:06:34.090> nice<00:06:34.270> snug<00:06:34.600> fit

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
think's efficient it's a nice snug fit

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.100 
think's efficient it's a nice snug fit
and<00:06:35.320> it<00:06:35.470> just<00:06:35.650> adds<00:06:35.800> a<00:06:35.890> little<00:06:36.040> bit<00:06:36.160> more

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
and it just adds a little bit more

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.050 
and it just adds a little bit more
soundproofing<00:06:38.580> okay<00:06:39.580> so<00:06:39.640> we've<00:06:39.790> got<00:06:39.820> our

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
soundproofing okay so we've got our

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.550 
soundproofing okay so we've got our
bulkhead<00:06:40.479> mat<00:06:40.630> on<00:06:40.810> we've<00:06:41.229> got

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
bulkhead mat on we've got

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.440 
bulkhead mat on we've got
off<00:06:41.650> seat<00:06:42.550> box<00:06:42.730> matter<00:06:42.970> on<00:06:43.060> we're<00:06:43.240> now<00:06:43.300> going

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
off seat box matter on we're now going

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.720 
off seat box matter on we're now going
to<00:06:43.540> fit<00:06:43.690> the<00:06:43.780> footwell<00:06:44.110> map<00:06:44.320> we've<00:06:45.160> taken<00:06:45.400> the

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
to fit the footwell map we've taken the

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.780 
to fit the footwell map we've taken the
gear<00:06:46.240> knobs<00:06:46.480> off<00:06:46.720> the<00:06:47.680> transfer<00:06:48.280> lever<00:06:48.490> and

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:48.790 
gear knobs off the transfer lever and

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.510 
gear knobs off the transfer lever and
the<00:06:49.510> full<00:06:49.960> drive<00:06:50.230> lever<00:06:50.560> and<00:06:50.830> we're<00:06:51.460> just

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
the full drive lever and we're just

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.490 
the full drive lever and we're just
going<00:06:51.700> to<00:06:51.760> slide<00:06:52.060> the<00:06:52.270> map<00:06:52.450> on<00:06:52.600> the<00:06:52.690> top<00:06:52.930> now

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
going to slide the map on the top now

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.659 
going to slide the map on the top now
now<00:06:53.740> would<00:06:53.800> be<00:06:53.919> a<00:06:54.010> good<00:06:54.160> time<00:06:54.370> to<00:06:54.400> clean

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
now would be a good time to clean

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.220 
now would be a good time to clean
everything<00:06:54.910> out<00:06:55.090> treat<00:06:55.510> any<00:06:55.720> metal<00:06:56.050> that<00:06:56.139> you

everything out treat any metal that you

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.690 
everything out treat any metal that you
want<00:06:56.410> to<00:06:56.500> treat<00:06:56.710> before<00:06:57.070> you<00:06:57.160> lay<00:06:57.250> the<00:06:57.370> mat<00:06:57.520> in

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
want to treat before you lay the mat in

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.610 
want to treat before you lay the mat in
wax<00:06:58.360> oil<00:06:58.630> do<00:06:58.870> anything<00:06:59.139> you<00:06:59.200> like<00:06:59.230> but

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
wax oil do anything you like but

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.050 
wax oil do anything you like but
essentially<00:07:00.430> we<00:07:00.520> should<00:07:00.639> just<00:07:00.760> be<00:07:00.880> able<00:07:01.000> to

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
essentially we should just be able to

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:14.030 
essentially we should just be able to
drop<00:07:01.210> that<00:07:01.330> in<00:07:01.480> now<00:07:01.660> and<00:07:01.870> see<00:07:02.050> how<00:07:02.169> it<00:07:02.260> looks<00:07:02.440> so

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.040 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:22.610 

I'll<00:07:15.040> put<00:07:15.160> it<00:07:15.220> over<00:07:15.310> the<00:07:15.490> gearstick<00:07:15.669> first

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.400 

getting<00:07:23.620> it<00:07:23.680> to<00:07:23.800> clear<00:07:24.100> the<00:07:25.020> the<00:07:26.020> hand<00:07:26.229> brakes

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410 
getting it to clear the the hand brakes

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:31.310 
getting it to clear the the hand brakes
tricky<00:07:28.169> although<00:07:29.169> it's<00:07:29.290> not<00:07:29.440> exactly<00:07:29.860> fragile

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:31.320 
tricky although it's not exactly fragile

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.360 
tricky although it's not exactly fragile
you<00:07:32.320> don't<00:07:32.470> want<00:07:32.620> to<00:07:34.590> spike<00:07:35.590> anything<00:07:36.100> through

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.370 
you don't want to spike anything through

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:43.590 
you don't want to spike anything through
it<00:07:36.520> if<00:07:36.700> you<00:07:36.820> can<00:07:36.940> help<00:07:37.060> it<00:07:40.770> okay<00:07:42.450> that<00:07:43.450> was

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:43.600 
it if you can help it okay that was

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:54.630 
it if you can help it okay that was
tricky<00:07:52.169> so<00:07:53.169> with<00:07:53.320> everything<00:07:53.530> in<00:07:53.710> place<00:07:53.979> just

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:54.640 
tricky so with everything in place just

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.360 
tricky so with everything in place just
got<00:07:54.729> to<00:07:54.850> quickly<00:07:55.180> trim<00:07:55.479> around<00:07:55.780> where<00:07:56.050> the

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:56.370 
got to quickly trim around where the

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.590 
got to quickly trim around where the
hinges<00:07:57.370> for<00:07:57.460> the<00:07:57.550> accelerator<00:07:57.970> and<00:07:58.210> also<00:07:58.479> the

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:58.600 
hinges for the accelerator and also the

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.600 
hinges for the accelerator and also the
stock<00:07:58.810> bolts<00:07:59.110> got<00:07:59.289> to<00:07:59.350> come<00:07:59.500> through<00:07:59.770> get<00:08:00.460> that

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:00.610 
stock bolts got to come through get that

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:10.430 
stock bolts got to come through get that
done<00:08:00.789> and<00:08:01.030> I<00:08:01.060> think<00:08:01.150> when<00:08:01.330> we<00:08:01.450> finished

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.500
