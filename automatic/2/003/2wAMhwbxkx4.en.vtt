00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
straight up in their story gear up in

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.580 
straight up in their story gear up in
their<00:01:49.040> toolbox<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.760> into<00:01:51.140> or<00:01:52.140> maybe<00:01:52.200> an

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
engine something like that there's a

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.340 
engine something like that there's a
winch<00:01:55.560> down<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.340> floor<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:57.300> we<00:01:58.140> made

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
winch down in the floor and we made

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.780 
winch down in the floor and we made
mirror<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.830> here<00:02:01.940> in<00:02:02.940> there<00:02:03.770> just<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
mirror in here in there just do the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.820 
mirror in here in there just do the
tires<00:02:05.970> but<00:02:06.300> take<00:02:07.229> your<00:02:07.350> thoughts<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
tires but take your thoughts of that

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.990 
tires but take your thoughts of that
back<00:02:08.040> now<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.090> tire<00:02:09.330> racks<00:02:10.430> we<00:02:11.430> decided<00:02:11.910> so

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
back now the tire racks we decided so

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.430 
back now the tire racks we decided so
we're<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.330> hold<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.600> tires<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:13.050> using<00:02:13.380> a

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
we're going to hold the tires in using a

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.259 
we're going to hold the tires in using a
cargo<00:02:13.920> net<00:02:13.950> over<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.400> top<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.880> rack<00:02:15.030> so

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
cargo net over the top of the rack so

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.840 
cargo net over the top of the rack so
everything<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.690> nice<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:15.870> clean<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.850> just
