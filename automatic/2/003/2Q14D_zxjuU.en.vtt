00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.130
 How can you leave your miss? 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.199
 angola more like a ration is 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.840
 Why should you do this to life? 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.820
 beads have this plastic texture 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.080
 ends up not fooling the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 fish catch and rib depend on the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.860
 night of the day if parents are beating 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.480
 is not to pity the day you have low 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.250
 Catch constant catch low there 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 You'll need to do this. 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.390
 a miss angola glue drying glue 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.360
 quick I'm using here is super 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.440
 Bonder is the best with her to do. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:04.530
 a cotton swab and can not feed you 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.250
 You will find the pod ration is at the bottom of 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.710
 sack of ration there watch you there goes 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.840
 find this enough here if you do not 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.880
 find in the very last case you go you 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.320
 will use a blender put the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.680
 The nation is going to have to leave the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.829
 be that way here just good even 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.930
 Let's start the first thing, and you? 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:40.140
 put the beads on the swab 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:46.909
 After that you take your cola and come 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:53.540
 putting it in the beads without ever knocking 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:58.860
 carefully I covered her all right 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:05.450
 be careful not to taste too and come 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:11.780
 placing the feed the coach ration here 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.860
 this way never dips the beads 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.450
 within the pod action 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.730
 why can it be that when 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.360
 you put there come a lot on one side 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.380
 just and from another stay is discovered and everything 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.680
 but then to avoid this you go 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.380
 picks up with your fingers will put in 5 until 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.690
 that not on any space if 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.760
 need to put a little more of 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:47.300
 glue on the surface here 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:52.100
 add more powder like this here until 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:57.570
 cover all your miss Angola 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:01.260
 today I have one ready to be of this 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.920
 The way you let it dry is let it go 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.780
 a couple of hours to be totally 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:14.450
 sure and I'll show you how 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:19.769
 that's the way you can see it 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.380
 It gets really rough, right, that's okay. 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:28.049
 similar to a reason of truth 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:32.160
 Look there and now only you ride your o 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.860
 his whip there that kind of blood what 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.540
 It is very good for the whip to the minho 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.920
 It's for all kinds of general cuttings there. 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.420
 most used to the right sly fish 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:50.730
 remembering that with the benches of the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:53.070
 tobacco narration she goes is this layer 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.400
 of action dust here that we put 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:00.660
 it's breaking up and it's good for you to prepare 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.390
 some at home in case they lost there 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.920
 You'll have another one to replace. 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.310
 Good, that's what I wanted to move on to. 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.239
 I hope you liked it and 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.239
