00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.900
 We are now considering the option never 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.400
 night in we go and when a person 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.340
 keeps but we regard as principle 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.540
 Lever at the beginning of the simplest see 1 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.060
 through the fulcrum here it is but under the brush and 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.030
 here the handle is now the first direction 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.430
 vector and here is this vector i start it 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.350
 pulls out pull tryin mass 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.520
 pelvis pull on this movement i 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.320
 I try to build a transverse movement 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.380
 that is, this second plane will and 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.270
 the third plane will be this 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.100
 perpendicular, see 1 2 3 1. 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.619
 now look at me for him 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.210
 work now there far away from him 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.850
 I will not reach and he will naturally have time 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.700
 earn some money look i'm here prekhali 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.450
 fix the tack and it rotates here 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:20.660
 this court in the middle of the turn 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.660
 not to yourself and here's the dream 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.090
 once again you are considering knife selection 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.370
 look 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.829
 how 1 2 now see what 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.900
 tying the center of the axis of the spine and 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.019
 I work not with my hands but with the weight of my body 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.340
 amendment 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.590
 what like a blade what is it or a200 knife 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.730
 or bending 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.269
 one sided two sides and closed well 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.510
 first principle of leverage on your or 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.760
 grabbed if the rain level for. not 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.639
 grabs just at start created 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.680
 now through this point of support we give a basin 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:05.819
 pull out in the direction of the radius 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.819
 from countries
