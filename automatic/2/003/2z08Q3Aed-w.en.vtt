00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
build quality is very high the use of

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.250 
build quality is very high the use of
space<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.420> excellent<00:01:39.840> better<00:01:39.990> than<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.140> front

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
space is excellent better than the front

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.140 
space is excellent better than the front
in<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:40.500> rear<00:01:40.680> I've<00:01:41.250> had<00:01:41.400> my<00:01:41.550> three<00:01:41.760> children

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150

in the rear I've had my three children
the<00:01:42.240> rear<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.510> example<00:01:42.900> all<00:01:43.050> their<00:01:43.200> bits<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the rear for example all their bits and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.440 
the rear for example all their bits and
bobs<00:01:43.770> no<00:01:44.010> problem<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:44.430> all<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.210> wife<00:01:45.420> is

handing<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.050> if<00:01:46.140> anything<00:01:46.320> better<00:01:46.950> than<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
handing is if anything better than the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.080 
handing is if anything better than the
escort<00:01:47.550> saloon

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
escort saloon

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.850 
escort saloon
so<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.480> overall<00:01:48.750> impression<00:01:49.050> is<00:01:49.620> quite

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
so the overall impression is quite

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
so the overall impression is quite
favorable<00:01:50.370> but<00:01:50.820> two<00:01:51.000> main<00:01:51.210> cripples<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:52.140> is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
favorable but two main cripples one is

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.320 
favorable but two main cripples one is
noise<00:01:52.530> states<00:01:53.280> tend<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.580> be<00:01:53.700> pretty<00:01:54.120> noisy

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
noise states tend to be pretty noisy

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.300 
noise states tend to be pretty noisy
anyway<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:54.870> with<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.140> car<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:56.040> engine

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
anyway but with this car the engine

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.040 
anyway but with this car the engine
growls<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.970> at<00:01:57.090> low<00:01:57.240> revs<00:01:57.510> it<00:01:57.720> becomes

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
growls at you at low revs it becomes

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.320 
growls at you at low revs it becomes
raucous<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.710> high<00:01:58.860> revs<00:01:59.160> put<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.820> full<00:02:00.060> lock

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
raucous at high revs put on full lock

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.580 
raucous at high revs put on full lock
science<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:00.900> you've<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> dog<00:02:01.320> trapped

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
science if you've got a dog trapped

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.440 
science if you've got a dog trapped
under<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.890> wheel<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.850> other<00:02:02.940> is<00:02:03.090> priced

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
under the wheel the other is priced

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.480 
under the wheel the other is priced
because<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.170> power<00:02:04.350> steering<00:02:04.620> fitted<00:02:05.070> get

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
because with power steering fitted get

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.820 
because with power steering fitted get
very<00:02:05.730> little<00:02:05.970> change<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.660> of<00:02:06.810> 13,000<00:02:07.680> pounds

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
very little change out of 13,000 pounds

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.590 
very little change out of 13,000 pounds
and<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.340> would<00:02:08.790> be<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> real<00:02:09.149> problem<00:02:09.180> for

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
and that would be a real problem for

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.110 
and that would be a real problem for
forward
