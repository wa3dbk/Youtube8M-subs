00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
something we sort of have a tendency to

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.389 
something we sort of have a tendency to
jump<00:01:47.420> into<00:01:47.899> more<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.770> more<00:01:48.920> interesting

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
jump into more and more interesting

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.039 
jump into more and more interesting
stories<00:01:49.789> I'm<00:01:50.030> sure<00:01:50.359> you've<00:01:50.659> noticed<00:01:50.960> this

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
stories I'm sure you've noticed this

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.389 
stories I'm sure you've noticed this
with<00:01:51.229> your<00:01:51.350> friends<00:01:51.679> right<00:01:51.710> somebody<00:01:52.159> starts

with your friends right somebody starts

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.709 
with your friends right somebody starts
telling<00:01:52.609> a<00:01:52.670> story<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:53.060> thing<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:53.359> happened

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
telling a story of a thing that happened

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.599 
telling a story of a thing that happened
and<00:01:53.929> they're<00:01:54.350> like<00:01:54.500> oh<00:01:54.619> well<00:01:54.859> yeah<00:01:55.070> of<00:01:55.250> course

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
and they're like oh well yeah of course

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.160 
and they're like oh well yeah of course
that<00:01:55.820> was<00:01:55.939> interesting<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.600> that<00:01:56.990> that

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
that was interesting that that that

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.709 
that was interesting that that that
happened<00:01:57.710> but<00:01:58.369> you'd<00:01:58.880> never<00:01:59.030> imagine<00:01:59.359> what

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
happened but you'd never imagine what

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.609 
happened but you'd never imagine what
happened<00:02:00.079> two<00:02:00.320> weeks<00:02:00.530> ago<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:02.479> yes<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:03.590> a

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
happened two weeks ago so yes and is a

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.139 
happened two weeks ago so yes and is a
technique<00:02:03.979> from<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.249> improv<00:02:04.549> community<00:02:04.999> and

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
technique from the improv community and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.060 
technique from the improv community and
the<00:02:05.240> idea<00:02:05.749> there<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.049> you<00:02:06.289> want<00:02:06.499> to<00:02:06.619> agree<00:02:06.859> with

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
the idea there is you want to agree with

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.740 
the idea there is you want to agree with
and<00:02:07.280> build<00:02:07.520> upon<00:02:07.670> what<00:02:07.969> another<00:02:08.179> person<00:02:08.539> says

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
and build upon what another person says

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.480 
and build upon what another person says
so<00:02:09.259> when<00:02:09.440> you're<00:02:09.590> talking<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.100> customer

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
so when you're talking to a customer

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.559 
so when you're talking to a customer
you're<00:02:10.580> doing<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.820> customer<00:02:11.120> interview<00:02:11.480> and

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
you're doing a customer interview and

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.089 
you're doing a customer interview and
they<00:02:11.629> start<00:02:11.870> telling<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.230> story<00:02:12.290> be<00:02:12.830> really

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
they start telling you a story be really

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.649 
they start telling you a story be really
careful<00:02:13.459> not<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.819> disagree<00:02:14.330> with<00:02:14.480> or

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
careful not to disagree with or

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.460 
careful not to disagree with or
invalidate<00:02:15.080> anything<00:02:15.319> they're<00:02:15.590> saying<00:02:15.860> and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
invalidate anything they're saying and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.620 
invalidate anything they're saying and
you<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.800> kind<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.130> if<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.880> need<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.210> jump<00:02:18.450> in

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
you can kind of if you need to jump in

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.060 
you can kind of if you need to jump in
and<00:02:18.870> push<00:02:19.050> them<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.260> little<00:02:19.320> bit<00:02:19.530> further<00:02:19.710> say

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
and push them a little bit further say

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.730 
and push them a little bit further say
yes<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.810> something<00:02:21.810> else<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.350> know<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.500> kind

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
yes and something else you know to kind

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.710 
yes and something else you know to kind
of<00:02:22.800> carry<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.190> further<00:02:23.730> down<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.210> down<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
of carry it further down the down the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.080 
of carry it further down the down the
line<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.680> technique<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.730> particularly

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
line that technique is particularly

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.280 
line that technique is particularly
helpful<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:27.540> somebody's<00:02:27.840> getting<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> little

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
helpful if somebody's getting a little

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.630 
helpful if somebody's getting a little
bit<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.470> lost<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.890> their<00:02:29.010> own<00:02:29.100> story<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.580> they

this is when you're talking to a
customer<00:02:55.200> quite<00:02:56.160> often<00:02:56.310> they'll<00:02:56.670> say

troublesome for them to complete a task
right<00:03:02.910> they<00:03:03.180> had<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.570> really<00:03:03.870> hard<00:03:04.050> time<00:03:04.170> with
