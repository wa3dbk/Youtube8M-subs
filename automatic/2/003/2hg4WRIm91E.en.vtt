00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 very good friends welcome back to 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.370
 tweet universe today we are going to teach you 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.630
 a different way of having our 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.630
 wallpapers want to see it 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.630
 let us begin 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.970
 Well, today we're going to start with this 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.620
 tuit called spring paper what 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.470
 we can find in the heart repo 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.890
 your iphone totally free 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.150
 basically this tweet what it does is and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.730
 we will see it right now 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.190
 the power to pre-select us 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.850
 images from our library or from a 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.070
 folder that we want and what 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.030
 what will you do as wallpaper 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.520
 is to make a transition of these photos 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.480
 as you have seen, they have disappeared 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.980
 the icons and the dock 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.100
 that if we tap the screen 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.950
 they reappear and now let's see 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.659
 in the settings 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.090
 exactly 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.990
 the menu that has well we can 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:40.429
 enable and disable in the search 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.520
 from the photos I have it put to see 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.679
 so that my photo library comes out but 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.030
 we can choose another option that would be 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.340
 a folder to which we 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.679
 we wish we would put it right 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.020
 where do you put here folder 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.909
 we would put here the route in which 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.599
 we want the photos to come out 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.590
 that we have saved then we would give 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:06.679
 a photo photo library what we would do 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.509
 would choose our photos the photos 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.959
 we want them to go well 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.519
 in the options of the wallpaper 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:20.250
 we will have here the frequency in which 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:22.620
 we want the photos to change 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.129
 transition from fast medium space to 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.129
 instant 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.550
 the climb I have it put so that 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.380
 look at scale so they can be seen 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.980
 on any scale so they can be seen 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.940
 all the photos equal if we put it in 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.459
 narrow fit 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.110
 what it does is that the photos look like 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.110
 narrow so they enter the screen 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.050
 and in a row screen what it does is that it 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.390
 see the problem on the whole screen 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:56.019
 that has this method the fill screen is 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:59.220
 that there are photos that are going to be cut good 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.630
 here we have the transition mode 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.450
 we can choose not to want to do 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.340
 transition and then good we'll go 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.290
 seeing you the one you like the most 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.209
 even the last rondÃ³n that we can 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.360
 put random I have chosen the one of 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.600
 the cube 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.800
 the direction of transition can be from 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.780
 right to left from left to 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.720
 right towards the button or from the button 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.390
 I have it on the left or 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.330
 right to left sorry 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.800
 and then we can make a souffle of the 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.130
 photos we have chosen for us 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.260
 follow one 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.960
 a numbering in which we have 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.320
 chosen but it is choosing the tweet 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.990
 the photos that you want good I 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.930
 I have an iphone 4 and these options do not 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.350
 they serve in the blur parayas and the zoom does not 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.820
 they would serve me and then in the options of 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.070
 what he wants from what we want 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.890
 remove me in this case you have seen that 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.870
 when I had been for a while 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.330
 gone icons and have 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.310
 disappeared the dock we can also 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.500
 make the status disappear in the bar 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.690
 of state and the time we want that 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.490
 we can put it two seconds five 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.170
 seconds or ten seconds of course 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.750
 five seconds and five seconds 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.410
 everything disappears and well you have already seen 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.799
 the result the result is this 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.030
 phenomenal wallpaper of which no 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.760
 we will bore 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.910
 and the last tweet we're going to see today is 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.100
 flame increase is a tweet that we can 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.620
 find for free in the repo 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.090
 iphone hardware and the truth that is a 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.090
 very peculiar tweet 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.789
 it makes us see as background of 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.030
 screen what our camera records 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.289
 fact 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.599
 you will see how 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.950
 my wallpaper is what it is 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:55.520
 watching my camera 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.760
 the truth that is a very peculiar we 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.830
 creates a menu in settings with which 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.650
 let's see what is here is called 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.850
 increase what we can enable and 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:13.760
 disable and here what we can 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:17.650
 choosing is the time in which 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.650
 we are going to use 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.540
 depending on the application that we open 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:27.560
 as background the first ones are going to be chosen 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.580
 5 seconds the first 10 seconds 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:35.790
 even up to 15 seconds a 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.070
 instantaneous and let's see right now 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.190
 how does this work we have here 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:45.140
 a blacklist of applications in 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.140
 which having 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.560
 having the activated what it does is 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.630
 you will not see the wallpaper 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.170
 For example, well, here we have the 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.170
 phone 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.090
 it is assumed that the first five 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.850
 seconds of recording is going to catch a 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.520
 snapshot to place in the 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.430
 applications in which if we can 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.380
 see that wallpaper and we're going to 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.180
 see right away 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.500
 for example the tea 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.419
 let's see that as wallpaper 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:24.000
 they have taken a snapshot of the 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:28.050
 first five seconds that has been caught 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.650
 with the camera the truth is that it is a 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.729
 very peculiar tweet 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.759
 it's nothing boring 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:39.490
 but that you do have to take into account 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:43.180
 that having the camera activated on 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:47.919
 Battery consumption will be 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:50.590
 and pretty pretty exemplary that is the 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:53.800
 battery you will see how low and how 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:57.430
 decreases spends a lot of battery and 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:01.360
 good until here and today if you liked 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:05.259
 the video do not forget about 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.909
 give a like and if you like and want 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:09.080
 be up to date with the tweets that 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:11.419
 we go 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.430
 making videos so do not forget 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.430
 first see you later
