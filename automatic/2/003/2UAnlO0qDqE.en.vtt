 Good day my name is Alex 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.410
 green welcome to my channel on 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.410
 contrakt wars game and review 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.210
 sniper rifle and navy let me 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.340
 as always, I'll start with a historical reference 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.619
 but you look at frags and I want 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 say I did this review 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.850
 for four days that's not counting 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.829
 rendering a movie and adding it to 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.230
 youtube and strictly speaking therefore 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.969
 for a long time there was no video so what about you 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.190
 arctic warfare magnum holding as the verse 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.809
 This rifle was designed 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.460
 British company accuracy 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.280
 international in the first half of the 80s 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.879
 years for replacing outdated model 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.610
 rifles 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.980
 enfield l 42 which consisted on 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.020
 arming the uk army in general 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.239
 originally held a competition for 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.579
 replacing the obsolete here these m wield 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.619
 all 42 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.650
 the winner is accuracy international 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.229
 with model rm about how Makarov's gun 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.350
 Well, in fact, she was armed with a British 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.390
 the army that is pm armed Tatar 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.750
 army under the designation 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.970
 or 42 mid 80s already Swedish 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.259
 the army is looking for a sniper rifle which 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.960
 could be used in conditions 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.909
 severe with northern weather and accuracy 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.270
 international offers the Swedes exactly a 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.610
 you arctic warfare blinked arctic that is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.710
 arctic conditions which could there 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.500
 shoot at -40 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.030
 they take it for service but 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.640
 British Army thought so and decided 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.049
 also adopt it rifle 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.270
 equipped with an open sighting 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.369
 adaptation and in contract wars 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.040
 do something like this but a little 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.990
 later rifle makers said that 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.860
 maximum effective range 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.090
 rifle n42 800 meters and because of in can 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.340
 reach this range up to 1200 meters 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.369
 but officially registered record 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.840
 range is the impact of defeat purposes 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.259
 a vm is 2475 meters in real 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.659
 of life 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.950
 rifle worth of $ 500 thousand 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.579
 rubles not bad yes 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.010
 weighs about 8 kilograms with a length of 2 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.230
 meter well, that the history of all I wanted 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.299
 I told you now 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.120
 let's talk about the game version 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.329
 and I'll start with the fact that the rifle is located 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.060
 in the fifth network and it costs 290 thousand 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:37.250
 loans well more or less normal 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.239
 still not godly 555 thousand and 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.150
 the very best thing that catches your eye 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.319
 it's just awesome how awesome 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.319
 recoil 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.290
 I lowered her so slightly and direct 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.560
 swing it is equal to about 123 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.829
 This is the most damn huge returns and all 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.480
 bolted in the game at all in bolted yes 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:01.470
 a big return should be but for example 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.340
 orsis and she is equal to 8 only 8 is direct 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:10.049
 pumping sv-98 is equal to about 100 well 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.970
 damn 150 and you them it kapets but although it is 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.709
 principle almost not felt when 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.400
 shot but still if you look at 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.780
 the characteristics are as much as kapets 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.629
 pretty small mobility when 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.760
 on hardcore I played right this is a line about 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.349
 own skin and really her 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.120
 not much compared to others 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.790
 sniper rifles I would like 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.069
 bring this analogy with eva 98 this 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.970
 how would such a dry stick and how would you 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.220
 you can knock her twigs and bushes but 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.739
 This there Zubkov any no offense 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.959
 anyone m4a a6 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.629
 it is like a wooden sword that is to them 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.930
 can be so good damage and injury inflicted 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.510
 Well, somewhere players up to level 40 and here 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.819
 and you already know that silver 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.659
 a sword that can be cut to the people 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.419
 brand stuffing but the office is the same sword 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.000
 but only with a golden handle is such 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.090
 here is an analogy and you have them in task 500 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.099
 vanshotov and we get a set of 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:14.400
 juice 338 it includes silencer juice 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.039
 collimator mts pretty comfortable 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.400
 collimator as on this as it is called 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.400
 on her mpi 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.190
 consoles, too, which is given and and ltsu 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.699
 mobile is cut into 9 units a 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.889
 slaughter on 23 freaking unit and 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.889
 steel mighty sword turns into 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.240
 wooden cracked pancake and lower 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.380
 healthy to the level 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.199
 m4a a6 but accuracy increases pancakes 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.810
 diminishing returns at 8 units and on 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.699
 your page I didnâ€™t download them 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.699
 and somehow I'm with her pretty rarely 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:51.699
 I play here I played with her there man 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.400
 200 probably killed everything and spent there 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.410
 about 200 thousand credits but about it 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.560
 By the way, too, a little later and a page with 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.710
 longing gave me my friend grisha and him for 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.470
 this is a big thank you asked me not 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.110
 gave page in classmates 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.000
 he asked me not to give him about him 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.690
 no information just breach him 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.060
 thank you so much so let me tell you 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:20.280
 characteristics and you give them an accuracy of 90 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.050
 units recoil 150 slaughter 155 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.789
 rate of fire one mobile 46 and 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.820
 recharge 52 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.919
 oh well ohrenet so little penetrability 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.979
 45 by the way is the smallest 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.110
 penetrability among all bolted and with 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.720
 people from 60 armor units already 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.340
 there are problems even a man damn it 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.550
 she has struck more and 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.460
 ohrenet cost in anguish 350 g p 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.669
 cost do not break 600dp and do not break to 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.470
 even very necessary as the price of fix 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:55.780
 one unit three thousand 800 credits 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.690
 This damn that's what we had the most 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.520
 dear scar fn scar-h yes he had 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.470
 so straight 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.979
 mending darling everyone there also spoke 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.289
 too expensive and now carpal 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.719
 I do not know Abakan anymore 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.729
 whether or not Abakan has 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.180
 recently added the cost of one here 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.249
 this one 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:21.369
 repair units are 350 credits at all 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:24.449
 I won't say anything about fn scar but damn it 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:29.919
 you give them three thousand 800 credits 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:32.439
 Ahrenet not get up too much and with 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:35.080
 it can generally lose all lava to 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:38.289
 damn if you stand there in 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.240
 plan you have there their contribution at 60 percent 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.309
 you are generally bankrupt you will become but only 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.419
 probably if you dropped black 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:49.389
 division then you can play and generally 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:52.959
 why not think well damn I'm real 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:55.649
 Here while I shot that is materials I 

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:58.659
 spent about probably two thousand two hundred 

00:06:55.649 --> 00:07:01.990
 of these loans but could have found another 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:03.849
 need to spend although on what in clan though 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.240
 would invest but still bled 200,000 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:08.979
 loans ohrenet how much of pumping 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.659
 I would advise you to pump as far as 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:13.569
 rechargeability is possible 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:15.939
 mobility will be possible by 10 units per 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:18.430
 accuracy because accuracy is only 90 a 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:20.919
 10 more in download will be straight 100 units 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.139
 this is such a thing 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.729
 normal or at least 7 of this will already be 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.800
 principle enough 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:27.939
 and if all this is pumped up then it will be 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.759
 more or less 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:33.399
 playable in general, I personally sniper 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:36.129
 I liked it but put on my shirt 

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:38.169
 no, and I spend slowly loans to everyone 

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:43.139
 thanks for watching subscribe to 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:43.139
 channel like everyone good luck everyone bye
