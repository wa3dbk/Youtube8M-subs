public<00:00:40.350> place<00:00:40.700> your<00:00:41.700> friends<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.000> this

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
public place your friends have this

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.110 
public place your friends have this
these<00:00:43.080> two<00:00:43.950> old<00:00:44.129> radios<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> transmitted

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
these two old radios and transmitted

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.330 
these two old radios and transmitted
between<00:00:45.390> each<00:00:45.690> other<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.950> measure<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
between each other and they measure the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.220 
between each other and they measure the
signal<00:00:47.640> strength<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> closer<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.750> get<00:00:48.960> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
signal strength so the closer you get to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.640 
signal strength so the closer you get to
each<00:00:49.650> other<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.220> louder<00:00:50.489> or<00:00:50.910> longer<00:00:51.540> buses<00:00:51.989> so

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
each other the louder or longer buses so

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.329 
each other the louder or longer buses so
this<00:00:53.220> is<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.580> close<00:00:53.850> really<00:00:54.780> annoying<00:00:55.410> but

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
this is really close really annoying but

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.100 
this is really close really annoying but
when<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.670> try<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.879> find<00:00:57.150> someone<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.809> great

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
when you try to find someone it's great

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.540 
when you try to find someone it's great
so<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.470> you're<00:00:58.589> really<00:00:58.860> far<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.309> piece

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so if you're really far just piece

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.310 
so if you're really far just piece
really<00:00:59.820> quick<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.480> close<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.900> get<00:01:01.050> it

it's a VNC client for an AVR
microcontroller<00:01:32.820> driving<00:01:33.600> an<00:01:33.690> LCD<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.679> if<00:01:34.800> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
microcontroller driving an LCD so if you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.550 
microcontroller driving an LCD so if you
wanted<00:01:35.160> to<00:01:35.220> write<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.960> software<00:01:36.960> project<00:01:37.140> that

wanted to write a software project that

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.090 
wanted to write a software project that
that<00:01:37.890> uses<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> embedded<00:01:39.540> LCD<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.740> could<00:01:40.890> write

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that uses a embedded LCD you could write

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.370 
that uses a embedded LCD you could write
your<00:01:41.460> software<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> pc<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:43.229> would

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
your software on the pc and it would

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.580 
your software on the pc and it would
push<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.189> pixels<00:01:44.610> over<00:01:44.850> using<00:01:45.119> VNC<00:01:45.500> onto<00:01:46.500> the

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:22.239 
got a Geiger counter can you tell us a

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.029 
got a Geiger counter can you tell us a
little<00:05:22.299> bit<00:05:22.479> about<00:05:22.719> your<00:05:22.869> project<00:05:23.079> this<00:05:23.859> is<00:05:24.009> a

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
little bit about your project this is a

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.949 
little bit about your project this is a
Geiger<00:05:24.429> counter<00:05:24.459> that<00:05:24.909> I<00:05:24.939> designed<00:05:25.359> last<00:05:25.599> year

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:25.959 
Geiger counter that I designed last year

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.989

is<00:05:26.319> going<00:05:26.589> to<00:05:26.679> a<00:05:26.739> conference<00:05:27.039> in<00:05:27.399> Germany<00:05:27.849> and

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:27.999 
is going to a conference in Germany and

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:29.939 
is going to a conference in Germany and
I<00:05:28.029> wanted<00:05:28.239> a<00:05:28.329> cool<00:05:28.539> project<00:05:28.779> this<00:05:29.139> year<00:05:29.199> so<00:05:29.919> I

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
I wanted a cool project this year so I

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.009 
I wanted a cool project this year so I
designed<00:05:30.279> this<00:05:30.549> Geiger<00:05:30.789> counter<00:05:31.269> it's

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:32.019 
designed this Geiger counter it's

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:33.599 
designed this Geiger counter it's
basically<00:05:32.349> based<00:05:32.619> around<00:05:32.769> a<00:05:32.949> Geiger<00:05:33.249> Mueller

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:33.609 
basically based around a Geiger Mueller

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:35.819 
basically based around a Geiger Mueller
too<00:05:33.849> and<00:05:34.599> it<00:05:34.749> senses<00:05:35.139> beta<00:05:35.379> and<00:05:35.679> gamma

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:35.829

those<00:05:55.329> can<00:05:55.539> cause<00:05:55.569> tissue<00:05:56.110> heating<00:05:56.709> so<00:05:57.069> they

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
those can cause tissue heating so they

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.709 
those can cause tissue heating so they
can<00:05:57.309> make<00:05:57.459> things<00:05:57.610> hot<00:05:57.909> like<00:05:58.179> your<00:05:58.329> microwave

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
can make things hot like your microwave

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.289 
can make things hot like your microwave
but<00:05:59.379> they<00:05:59.679> don't<00:05:59.860> cause<00:06:00.039> cell<00:06:00.339> damage<00:06:00.610> now

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:01.299 
but they don't cause cell damage now

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:04.499 
but they don't cause cell damage now
ionizing<00:06:02.049> radiation<00:06:02.769> is<00:06:02.919> like<00:06:03.099> x-rays<00:06:03.669> gamma

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
ionizing radiation is like x-rays gamma

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.289 
ionizing radiation is like x-rays gamma
rays<00:06:04.869> or<00:06:05.139> beta<00:06:05.319> particles<00:06:05.889> those<00:06:06.699> actually<00:06:07.089> do

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:07.299 
rays or beta particles those actually do

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:09.209 
rays or beta particles those actually do
cause<00:06:07.569> cell<00:06:07.929> damage<00:06:08.169> because<00:06:08.709> they<00:06:09.039> can

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
cause cell damage because they can

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.279 
cause cell damage because they can
actually<00:06:09.579> make<00:06:09.759> an<00:06:09.909> atom<00:06:10.299> moves<00:06:10.539> an<00:06:10.779> electron

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
actually make an atom moves an electron

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.769 
actually make an atom moves an electron
and<00:06:11.709> that's<00:06:11.889> what<00:06:12.069> causes<00:06:12.279> DNA<00:06:12.639> mutations<00:06:13.509> and

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
and that's what causes DNA mutations and

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.239 
and that's what causes DNA mutations and
all<00:06:14.019> the<00:06:14.199> bad<00:06:14.409> stuff<00:06:14.619> that<00:06:14.799> comes<00:06:15.099> from

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:15.249 
all the bad stuff that comes from

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.609 
all the bad stuff that comes from
radiation<00:06:15.729> exposure<00:06:16.029> but<00:06:16.899> cell<00:06:17.139> phones<00:06:17.409> don't

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:17.619 
radiation exposure but cell phones don't

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:19.799 
radiation exposure but cell phones don't
do<00:06:17.829> that<00:06:18.039> cell<00:06:18.609> phones<00:06:18.849> can<00:06:19.059> make<00:06:19.509> your<00:06:19.629> brain

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:19.809 
do that cell phones can make your brain

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.739 
do that cell phones can make your brain
hot<00:06:20.139> but<00:06:20.679> they<00:06:20.799> won't<00:06:20.979> give<00:06:21.129> you<00:06:21.219> cancer<00:06:21.749> it's

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:22.749 
hot but they won't give you cancer it's

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.119

all the other booths but show off a

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:37.289 
all the other booths but show off a
project<00:06:34.809> so<00:06:35.169> I<00:06:35.199> decided<00:06:35.739> to<00:06:36.009> take<00:06:36.189> my<00:06:36.489> new

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:37.299 
project so I decided to take my new

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:39.179 
project so I decided to take my new
hobby<00:06:37.509> of<00:06:37.719> learning<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.259> bass<00:06:38.409> guitar<00:06:38.439> and

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:39.189 
hobby of learning the bass guitar and

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:42.269 
hobby of learning the bass guitar and
combine<00:06:39.789> it<00:06:39.819> with<00:06:39.969> the<00:06:40.209> old<00:06:40.239> Commodore<00:06:40.779> 64<00:06:41.499> so

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:42.279 
combine it with the old Commodore 64 so

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.519 
combine it with the old Commodore 64 so
my<00:06:42.399> goal<00:06:42.610> was<00:06:42.849> to<00:06:42.909> use<00:06:43.269> the<00:06:43.509> Commodore<00:06:43.929> 64

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:44.529 
my goal was to use the Commodore 64

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.979 
my goal was to use the Commodore 64
sound<00:06:44.860> chip<00:06:45.189> and<00:06:45.459> run<00:06:45.489> all<00:06:46.179> the<00:06:46.360> audio<00:06:46.599> through

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:46.989 
sound chip and run all the audio through

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:51.629 
sound chip and run all the audio through
it<00:06:47.079> so<00:06:47.349> the<00:06:47.469> keys<00:06:47.709> and<00:06:48.159> the<00:06:48.929> strings<00:06:50.639> here's

through<00:07:38.380> tooth<00:07:38.590> to<00:07:38.800> the<00:07:38.889> phone<00:07:39.130> and<00:07:40.120> i'm<00:07:40.240> just

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:40.389 
through tooth to the phone and i'm just

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:41.790 
through tooth to the phone and i'm just
going<00:07:40.569> to<00:07:40.599> tap<00:07:40.810> on<00:07:41.020> the<00:07:41.050> phone<00:07:41.349> and<00:07:41.560> then<00:07:41.680> i

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 
going to tap on the phone and then i

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.890 
going to tap on the phone and then i
blow<00:07:42.039> on<00:07:42.190> here<00:07:42.520> I<00:07:42.639> doubt<00:07:43.419> if<00:07:43.570> I'd<00:07:43.720> had<00:07:43.870> some

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:43.900 
blow on here I doubt if I'd had some
