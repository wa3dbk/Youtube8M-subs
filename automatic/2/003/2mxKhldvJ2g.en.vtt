it's<00:01:32.850> very<00:01:33.030> unlikely<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.659> someone<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.110> sneak

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350

up behind you and you have two very good

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.069 
up behind you and you have two very good
lines<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.920> sight<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.790> high-traffic<00:01:39.420> part<00:01:39.960> of

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
lines of sight on a high-traffic part of

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.210 
lines of sight on a high-traffic part of
the<00:01:40.140> map<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.530> right<00:01:40.710> there<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> should<00:01:41.100> have

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the map and right there I should have

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.740 
the map and right there I should have
probably<00:01:41.430> killed<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.820> guy<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.479> wasn't

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
probably killed that guy but I wasn't

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.530 
probably killed that guy but I wasn't
paying<00:01:42.960> attention<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:44.189> you'll<00:01:45.060> notice<00:01:45.270> in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
paying attention so you'll notice in

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.660 
paying attention so you'll notice in
free-for-all<00:01:46.259> montages<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.040> lot<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> times

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
free-for-all montages a lot of the times

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.999 
free-for-all montages a lot of the times
when<00:01:48.509> people<00:01:48.540> get<00:01:49.079> clips<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.649> when<00:01:49.860> they're

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
when people get clips it's when they're

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.499 
when people get clips it's when they're
at<00:01:50.100> an<00:01:50.310> intersection<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> map<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.479> that

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
at an intersection of the map like that

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.719 
at an intersection of the map like that
where<00:01:51.990> they<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.140> two<00:01:52.890> high-traffic

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
where they have two high-traffic

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.480 
where they have two high-traffic
high-traffic<00:01:54.689> areas<00:01:55.140> under<00:01:55.649> control<00:01:56.219> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
high-traffic areas under control and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.429 
high-traffic areas under control and
it's<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.270> long<00:01:57.479> line<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> sight<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.259> can

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
it's a long line of sight so you can

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.260 
it's a long line of sight so you can
often<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.890> an<00:01:59.159> advantage<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.729> them<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
often have an advantage on them with the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.330 
often have an advantage on them with the
sniper<00:02:00.509> rifle<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.110> also<00:02:01.860> if<00:02:02.100> you're

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
sniper rifle and also if you're

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.770 
sniper rifle and also if you're
anticipating<00:02:02.610> them<00:02:03.090> coming<00:02:03.420> you'll<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.659> an

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
anticipating them coming you'll have an

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.149 
anticipating them coming you'll have an
advantage<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.350> long<00:02:04.560> line<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.770> sight<00:02:05.009> like

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
advantage on a long line of sight like

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.570 
advantage on a long line of sight like
that<00:02:05.310> too<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:05.880> they'll<00:02:06.270> have

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
that too because they'll have

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.249 
that too because they'll have
look<00:02:06.790> for<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.360> you'll<00:02:07.780> know<00:02:07.930> exactly

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
look for you and you'll know exactly

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.800 
look for you and you'll know exactly
where<00:02:08.470> they<00:02:08.590> are<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.580> that's<00:02:10.000> why<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.300> lot<00:02:10.780> of

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
where they are so that's why a lot of

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.170 
where they are so that's why a lot of
clips<00:02:11.440> usually<00:02:11.860> happen<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.400> intersections

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
clips usually happen on intersections

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.750 
clips usually happen on intersections
like<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.540> because<00:02:14.430> when<00:02:15.430> people<00:02:15.670> are

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
like that because when people are

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.280 
like that because when people are
running<00:02:15.850> at<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.180> usually<00:02:16.660> you're<00:02:17.110> going<00:02:17.230> to

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
running at you usually you're going to

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.050 
running at you usually you're going to
have<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.470> big<00:02:17.860> advantage<00:02:18.070> on<00:02:18.370> them<00:02:18.490> when<00:02:18.790> you're

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
have a big advantage on them when you're

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.910 
have a big advantage on them when you're
at<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.510> corner<00:02:19.900> like<00:02:20.020> that<00:02:20.200> because<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.890> can

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
at a corner like that because you can

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.560 
at a corner like that because you can
pop<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.610> out<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.000> corner<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.390> they're

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
pop in and out of the corner and they're

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.550 
pop in and out of the corner and they're
going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.780> be<00:02:22.870> running<00:02:22.990> right<00:02:23.290> down<00:02:23.410> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
going to be running right down the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.210 
going to be running right down the
middle<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.950> alley<00:02:24.610> basically<00:02:25.210> and<00:02:25.890> if<00:02:26.890> you

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
middle of the alley basically and if you

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.250 
middle of the alley basically and if you
go<00:02:27.400> watch<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.790> free<00:02:27.970> throw<00:02:28.150> montage<00:02:28.600> right<00:02:29.110> now

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
go watch a free throw montage right now

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260 
go watch a free throw montage right now
you'll<00:02:29.590> notice<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.460> ton<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.030> clips

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
you'll notice that a ton of the clips

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.210 
you'll notice that a ton of the clips
are<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.720> places<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.860> it's<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.070> very

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
are in places like this and it's a very

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.430 
are in places like this and it's a very
good<00:02:33.430> tactic<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.940> use<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.360> strongly<00:02:34.840> suggest<00:02:35.080> it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
good tactic to use I strongly suggest it

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.020 
good tactic to use I strongly suggest it
whether<00:02:36.040> you're<00:02:36.190> going<00:02:36.340> for<00:02:36.400> montage<00:02:36.850> clips

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
whether you're going for montage clips

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.030 
whether you're going for montage clips
or<00:02:37.360> for<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.630> high<00:02:37.780> scoring<00:02:38.140> game<00:02:38.410> with<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.800> low

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
or for a high scoring game with a low

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.690 
or for a high scoring game with a low
amount<00:02:39.460> of<00:02:39.550> deaths<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:40.180> works<00:02:40.480> very<00:02:40.720> well<00:02:40.840> and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
amount of deaths it works very well and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.250 
amount of deaths it works very well and
you<00:02:42.700> should<00:02:42.850> only<00:02:42.970> really<00:02:43.150> do<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.720> non

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
you should only really do this in non

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.590 
you should only really do this in non
objective<00:02:44.740> game<00:02:44.890> modes<00:02:44.950> because<00:02:45.640> like<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.540> said

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
objective game modes because like I said

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.090 
objective game modes because like I said
you<00:02:46.750> have<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.110> be<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.410> objective<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.950> non

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
you have to be the objective and non

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.980 
you have to be the objective and non
objective<00:02:48.310> game<00:02:48.700> modes<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.120> objective<00:02:49.870> game

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
objective game modes and objective game

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.449 
objective game modes and objective game
modes<00:02:50.050> if<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.410> want<00:02:50.590> kills<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
modes if you want kills you have to

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.760 
modes if you want kills you have to
watch<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.880> objective<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.570> try<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:52.990> defend

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
watch the objective and try and defend

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.260 
watch the objective and try and defend
it<00:02:53.890> basically<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.459> get<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.610> lot<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.850> kills<00:02:55.000> and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
it basically to get a lot of kills and

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.990 
it basically to get a lot of kills and
play<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.959> defensive<00:02:56.170> role<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.860> defending<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
play a defensive role in defending the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.720 
play a defensive role in defending the
flag<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.920> something<00:02:59.920> else<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.670> should

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
flag so something else that I should

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.430 
flag so something else that I should
probably<00:03:01.000> mention<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.600> if<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.050> guys<00:03:02.170> don't

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
probably mention is if you guys don't

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.930 
probably mention is if you guys don't
know<00:03:02.560> what<00:03:02.590> peer<00:03:02.950> team<00:03:03.130> deathmatch<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.730> this

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
know what peer team deathmatch is this

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.730 
know what peer team deathmatch is this
game<00:03:04.120> mode<00:03:04.300> I'm<00:03:04.390> playing<00:03:04.570> right<00:03:04.720> here<00:03:04.959> there's

own black ops gameplay for five months

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.009 
own black ops gameplay for five months
so<00:04:05.830> that<00:04:06.150> was<00:04:07.150> pretty<00:04:07.299> crazy<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.810> thought

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
so that was pretty crazy and I thought

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.259 
so that was pretty crazy and I thought
that<00:04:08.350> I<00:04:08.830> needed<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.670> post<00:04:09.850> some<00:04:09.970> more<00:04:10.090> black

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
that I needed to post some more black

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.150 
that I needed to post some more black
ops<00:04:10.450> because<00:04:10.840> I've<00:04:11.170> gotten<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.680> lot<00:04:11.860> more

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
ops because I've gotten a lot more

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.920 
ops because I've gotten a lot more
subscribers<00:04:12.700> in<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.120> last<00:04:13.299> five<00:04:13.480> months<00:04:13.780> and

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
subscribers in the last five months and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.930 
subscribers in the last five months and
my<00:04:14.080> channel<00:04:14.410> has<00:04:14.890> grown<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:15.190> lot<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.670> figured

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
my channel has grown a lot and I figured

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.000 
my channel has grown a lot and I figured
probably<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:17.080> lot<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.410> you<00:04:17.500> guys<00:04:17.590> haven't<00:04:17.979> even

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
probably a lot of you guys haven't even

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.470 
probably a lot of you guys haven't even
seen<00:04:18.310> me<00:04:18.430> play<00:04:18.609> black<00:04:18.820> ops<00:04:18.970> before

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
seen me play black ops before

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.790 
seen me play black ops before
so<00:04:19.540> I<00:04:19.570> thought<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:19.840> might<00:04:20.080> as<00:04:20.170> well<00:04:20.230> post<00:04:20.590> them

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.300 
so I thought I might as well post them
because<00:04:21.250> it's<00:04:22.180> been<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.390> while<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:23.130> yeah<00:04:24.130> so

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
because it's been a while and yeah so

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.100 
because it's been a while and yeah so

movement tutorial where I'll go over how

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.630 
movement tutorial where I'll go over how
to<00:05:25.450> effectively<00:05:26.050> move<00:05:26.410> around<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.740> map<00:05:26.890> like

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
to effectively move around the map like

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.430 
to effectively move around the map like
a<00:05:27.670> good<00:05:27.940> player<00:05:28.210> and<00:05:28.480> it'll<00:05:29.050> improve<00:05:29.380> your

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
a good player and it'll improve your

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.490 
a good player and it'll improve your
alertness<00:05:30.250> and<00:05:30.670> effectiveness<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.480> it'll<00:05:32.410> be

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
alertness and effectiveness and it'll be

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.980 
alertness and effectiveness and it'll be
pretty<00:05:32.620> interesting<00:05:33.160> it's<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.660> it's<00:05:34.660> not<00:05:34.870> as

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
pretty interesting it's a it's not as

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.330 
pretty interesting it's a it's not as
basic<00:05:35.320> as<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:35.440> would<00:05:35.680> think<00:05:35.890> there's<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:36.160> lot

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
basic as you would think there's a lot

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.450 
basic as you would think there's a lot
of<00:05:36.390> differences<00:05:37.390> with<00:05:37.750> how<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.740> new<00:05:39.190> player

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
of differences with how a new player

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.280 
of differences with how a new player
moves<00:05:39.700> compared<00:05:40.180> to<00:05:40.300> how<00:05:40.450> a<00:05:40.480> player<00:05:41.110> that's

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
moves compared to how a player that's

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.650 
moves compared to how a player that's
been<00:05:41.500> playing<00:05:41.710> for<00:05:41.920> like<00:05:42.070> four<00:05:42.340> years<00:05:42.370> has<00:05:42.940> has

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
been playing for like four years has has

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.780 
been playing for like four years has has
learned<00:05:44.140> how<00:05:44.260> to<00:05:44.290> move<00:05:44.530> so<00:05:44.860> I'll<00:05:45.280> go<00:05:45.520> over<00:05:45.550> that

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
learned how to move so I'll go over that

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.130 
learned how to move so I'll go over that
I<00:05:45.820> think<00:05:46.120> it'll<00:05:46.240> improve<00:05:46.540> a<00:05:46.690> lot<00:05:46.780> of<00:05:46.900> people's

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
I think it'll improve a lot of people's

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.770 
I think it'll improve a lot of people's
games<00:05:47.350> and<00:05:47.710> it's<00:05:48.610> it's<00:05:49.060> subtle<00:05:49.330> but<00:05:49.540> it<00:05:49.630> makes

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
games and it's it's subtle but it makes

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.320 
games and it's it's subtle but it makes
a<00:05:49.870> difference<00:05:50.200> so<00:05:50.460> yeah<00:05:51.460> I've<00:05:51.700> been<00:05:52.120> planning

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
a difference so yeah I've been planning

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.300 
a difference so yeah I've been planning
on<00:05:52.510> doing<00:05:52.720> that<00:05:52.750> and<00:05:53.080> another<00:05:53.800> thing<00:05:54.040> that

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
on doing that and another thing that

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.560 
on doing that and another thing that
I've<00:05:54.400> been<00:05:54.550> planning<00:05:54.820> to<00:05:54.850> do<00:05:55.000> for<00:05:55.210> a<00:05:55.240> while<00:05:55.390> now

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
I've been planning to do for a while now

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.460 
I've been planning to do for a while now
and<00:05:55.600> I<00:05:55.780> still<00:05:55.900> haven't<00:05:56.080> done<00:05:56.200> it<00:05:56.260> is<00:05:56.440> a

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
and I still haven't done it is a

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.860 
and I still haven't done it is a
sensitivity<00:05:57.340> picking<00:05:58.060> tutorial<00:05:58.510> so<00:05:58.660> how<00:05:58.810> to

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
sensitivity picking tutorial so how to

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.380 
sensitivity picking tutorial so how to
properly<00:05:59.530> pick<00:05:59.770> a<00:05:59.800> sensitivity<00:06:00.280> it<00:06:01.000> involves

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
properly pick a sensitivity it involves

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.700 
properly pick a sensitivity it involves
a<00:06:01.450> lot<00:06:01.570> of<00:06:01.630> things<00:06:01.900> that<00:06:02.080> a<00:06:02.140> lot<00:06:02.320> of<00:06:02.350> people<00:06:02.620> I

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
a lot of things that a lot of people I

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.710 
a lot of things that a lot of people I
don't<00:06:02.740> think<00:06:02.890> have<00:06:03.130> covered<00:06:03.490> it<00:06:03.700> involves

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
don't think have covered it involves

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.610 
don't think have covered it involves
well<00:06:06.720> maybe<00:06:06.900> I'll<00:06:07.050> just<00:06:07.080> save<00:06:07.320> it<00:06:07.440> for<00:06:07.560> the

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
well maybe I'll just save it for the

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.470 
well maybe I'll just save it for the
video<00:06:07.710> but<00:06:08.040> yeah<00:06:08.220> anyway<00:06:08.550> so<00:06:08.610> look<00:06:09.090> forward<00:06:09.330> to
