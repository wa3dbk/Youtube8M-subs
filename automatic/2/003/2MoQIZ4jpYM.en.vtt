00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.330 
so it's quite good image quality it's
not<00:02:06.899> bad<00:02:07.170> either<00:02:07.200> considering<00:02:07.920> its<00:02:08.160> from<00:02:08.190> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
not bad either considering its from a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.890 
not bad either considering its from a
phone<00:02:11.420> we<00:02:12.420> are<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.629> Wi-Fi<00:02:13.080> now<00:02:13.260> I'm<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.530> bit<00:02:13.680> wary

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
phone we are on Wi-Fi now I'm a bit wary

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.470 
phone we are on Wi-Fi now I'm a bit wary
that<00:02:14.110> if<00:02:14.230> we<00:02:14.319> were<00:02:14.439> to<00:02:14.560> do<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.769> 3G<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.489> video

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
that if we were to do on 3G the video

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.050 
that if we were to do on 3G the video
quality<00:02:16.720> would<00:02:17.079> reduce<00:02:17.549> quite<00:02:18.549> dramatically

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
quality would reduce quite dramatically

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.770 
quality would reduce quite dramatically
but<00:02:19.420> I'm<00:02:19.659> yet<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.900> try<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.349> out
