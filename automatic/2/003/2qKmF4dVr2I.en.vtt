00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 to start knitting like this 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.910
 cap need to tie a pattern in order 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.099
 to determine the size of the cap 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.389
 since this cap tally is not on 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.150
 circle rule so i'm doing so petty 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.480
 would increase and decrease 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.660
 I take the circumference of this cap 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.420
 bottom of the very last row tule 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.359
 Hats I have 3 columns with 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.600
 nakidy front relief column 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.750
 and three double crochets 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.850
 way i will knit a pattern in this 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.489
 case I tied the sample 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.860
 take exactly the last row so 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.780
 activity is determined by tule 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.850
 and here we will do on the bottom 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.770
 additions until we get we get to 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.059
 the required number of bars in this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.239
 I connected the case 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.430
 here are 4 rapoport one rapoport and just 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.730
 three double crochet front 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.540
 relief column with 3 double crochets 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.200
 since i will knit hats in a circle 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.180
 accordingly rapoport will be 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.189
 repeat in this way because 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.280
 that I will knit in patterns straight and 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.990
 the opposite direction when i see 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.759
 my face is three 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.610
 double crochet face relief 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.860
 column 3 double crochet and when 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.530
 I see on the seamy side I will knit 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.659
 three double crochet and purl 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.400
 embossed front column with 3 columns 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 nakida for these stripes 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.329
 complied in principle, too, as if not 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.759
 necessarily because it is a sample 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.549
 he will not need you and so 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.750
 here i have tied the sample in this case 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.119
 my sample 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.939
 consists of four reports and is equal to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.369
 about 11 centimeters I 'm going 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.149
 take the cap on the head circumference 44 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.479
 centimeter 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.799
 that is, I take 4 rapoporta multiply by 44 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.600
 and divide by 11 centimeters which I have 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.170
 turned out accordingly for me 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.430
 it turns out 16 that is, I will have to 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.840
 repeat this part 16 rapoport 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.640
 on head circumference 44 centimeters 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.110
 that is, how should I get to dial 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.480
 I will be 16 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.200
 rays that is, at first I will tell you how 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.200
 do it
