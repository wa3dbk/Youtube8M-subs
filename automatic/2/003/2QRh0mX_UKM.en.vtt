well<00:01:39.679> but<00:01:40.189> that's<00:01:40.520> what<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:41.030> thought<00:01:41.299> about

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
well but that's what I thought about

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.050 
well but that's what I thought about
when<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:41.899> got<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:42.530> product<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.369> was<00:01:43.549> thinking

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
when I got this product I was thinking

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.139 
when I got this product I was thinking
this<00:01:44.509> might<00:01:45.109> be<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.409> cheaper<00:01:45.979> similar<00:01:46.579> version

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
this might be a cheaper similar version

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.230 
this might be a cheaper similar version
because<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.590> don't<00:01:48.859> know<00:01:49.009> I<00:01:49.039> when<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.729> opened<00:01:50.149> it

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
because I don't know I when I opened it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.319 
because I don't know I when I opened it
the<00:01:50.390> consistency<00:01:50.840> looked<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.710> same<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.460> I

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
the consistency looked the same and I

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.510 
the consistency looked the same and I
mean<00:01:53.539> I<00:01:53.990> don't<00:01:54.409> know<00:01:54.500> why<00:01:54.619> this<00:01:54.679> was<00:01:55.069> hoping

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
mean I don't know why this was hoping

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.969 
mean I don't know why this was hoping
maybe<00:01:55.909> I<00:01:56.149> could<00:01:56.360> find<00:01:56.659> a<00:01:56.840> cheaper<00:01:57.200> one<00:01:57.380> or

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
maybe I could find a cheaper one or

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.130 
maybe I could find a cheaper one or
something<00:01:58.369> similar<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.329> tried<00:01:59.659> this<00:01:59.840> and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
something similar but I tried this and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.620 
something similar but I tried this and
it<00:02:00.799> is<00:02:01.009> not<00:02:01.520> like<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.780> does<00:02:03.109> not<00:02:04.100> hold<00:02:04.819> I

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
it is not like that it does not hold I
