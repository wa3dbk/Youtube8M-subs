00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.170
 the trench coat is a basic garment in 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.959
 the closet of any woman for three 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.210
 simple reasons one is practical 2 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.620
 timeless and 3 we are left with everything we are going to 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.620
 see these beautiful options that I found 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 let's start with a very casual look and 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.009
 This trench coat is long for people 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.380
 that jumps is perfect has a height 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.900
 very good also lets discover a little 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 of the legs then nothing happens if 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.379
 they set the interesting thing about this trench 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.290
 coat is that it has no buttons is this 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.420
 amazing is also very clean the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.129
 design only has belt which 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.540
 they can tie it as strong as 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.339
 want to hip height or the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.260
 Waist will normally waist 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.170
 I put on a little bun can be done 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.809
 you some special knot or a knot 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.190
 Normal double knot is the perfect choice 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.430
 they can also leave it loose and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.229
 tie that same same bow in 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.830
 the back and let all the 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.690
 outfit 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.540
 I am teaching is the closed me 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.369
 I put a shirt under white for 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.990
 contrast a bit and to keep it 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.790
 casual look may have opted 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.200
 for another shirt color I like 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.560
 use the basics to see that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.680
 parents you can combine the jeans there 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.540
 they are in color the basic color the truth 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.240
 is that you could opt for one more 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.189
 intense or lighter no matter I chose 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.990
 that they were tube to sue them sheen 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.110
 very nice 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.680
 and much calf styling can 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.409
 use them 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 also without doubling nothing happens tennis 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.830
 because I wanted to contrast the fabric 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.450
 of this train chute is quite elegant 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.080
 then the contrast with the tennis 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.750
 it's very cool 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.420
 I like that they are also to dress but 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.490
 they still keep the classic a necklace 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.830
 a large necklace with the tones that 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.590
 we also see in general in the outfit not 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.229
 could be missing and a handbag is not 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.759
 a bag is rather a portfolio if it 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.200
 they go in a hurry and I know who to take a 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.929
 accessory that looks cute that looks 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.750
 cute can opt for this portfolio 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.549
 has a print simulating that it is a viper 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.909
 and it looks amazing in any color that 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.909
 choose 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.060
 another option also casual would be this 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.560
 trench coat this is the basic if not 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.659
 they have none in their closet this is the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.060
 Ideal choice is camel color is the most 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.040
 common and also combines with everything has 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.409
 the typical buttons like that are the most 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.150
 which closes as crossed and apart 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.459
 includes a belt so we 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.860
 we can go back mini mini waist 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.480
 putting it as tight as possible 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.040
 I never respect the belt and always 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.390
 I make myself like a knot or a knot 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.709
 you can respect it and it follows 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.170
 watching very well I put on a scarf is 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.150
 looking for more each one is stamping I wanted 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.470
 which will highlight other colors apart from 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.180
 the colors we're going to see in 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.940
 this look could do any 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.739
 patterned stitches stripes pictures to me 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.750
 they like flowers because we can 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.750
 use in spring summer autumn or also 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.549
 in winter some fitted leggings 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.920
 notched and black to disguise the 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.230
 size of my legs if you do not know 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.510
 feel comfortable or feel that they are very 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.639
 you fill your legs this option is 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.430
 ideal will make them see much more 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.090
 stylized and thin shoes 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.799
 low 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.850
 we continue with low shoes because 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.710
 We are looking for comfortable looks 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.680
 These have tip ends 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.080
 They simulate having snakes crocodiles skin 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.900
 whatever is obviously synthetic but 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.300
 it looks amazing this like 30 on top of 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.680
 These shoes I absolutely love 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.420
 black if you could use some 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.940
 Loafers of another red color would look 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.730
 spectacular with this look I'm 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.130
 using a bag this bag is in size 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.230
 medium has some signs out there 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.830
 but it also remains discreet ideal 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.830
 for this look 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.730
 and they will go out at night a train with 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.650
 can help them as a coat as a sweater 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.720
 It's perfect, too, if it's raining 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.200
 it's also an ideal option I'm using 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.140
 a lace dress is a dress that 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.080
 reaches the waist and after circulating 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.870
 pretty flirtatious I wanted to put on me a 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.710
 trench coat with strong color this 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.170
 product is in deep green green 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.910
 I really like that he does not have buttons either 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.340
 it only has a closure now we're going 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.040
 to see type jacket with a long closure 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.420
 long and obviously the belt that 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.190
 I always tell them that it's great because 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.720
 our waist can make a knot 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.490
 two knots and this time I kept it 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.830
 open are set so that you see a 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.740
 little of the dress is open to 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.630
 sides closed shoes I'm 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.310
 thinking that this look is ideal in itself 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.140
 It rains or stops when it does a little bit of 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.000
 cold nothing more closed shoes that 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.100
 They also have stiffness and reach 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.770
 Ankle is not used much this type 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.529
 of shoes I recommend them a lot 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.359
 I'm using a bag 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.579
 we can take it as well as I bring it 

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:06.619
 loaded or in the hand has enough 

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:08.779
 rhinestones is vintage I love the 

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:10.459
 things that are no longer this 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.799
 belonged to my grandmother surely 

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:14.419
 some great aunt or whoever has 

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:16.339
 things of this style that are 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.929
 truly beautiful and no longer 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.429
 we can find nowhere and 

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:22.059
 complete perfect any of your 

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:22.059
 night looks 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.360
 Hello 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.969
 and this is the last option for you to give 

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:37.739
 that a trench coat can also 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.599
 use as dresses I chose a color 

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:41.399
 clear to see that there are many 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.319
 variety will find them in all 

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:45.419
 colors even in pastels if they are followed 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:48.239
 watching smart and very funny 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.949
 I wanted to acintur arme more this obviously 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:52.139
 it has buttons is the typical and it came 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.819
 with an equal belt of the same color 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.879
 I took it off and decided to put it on my own 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:59.129
 touch a much thicker gray belt 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.139
 and black I really like that the buckle 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.879
 be huge and call attention is 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.369
 completely woven you could 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.229
 opt for some gold plated or a 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:11.039
 option like this also looks very good 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:14.069
 Closed shoes with type print 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.979
 Viper I like the contrast he makes in 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:20.610
 shades of gray and black go chord too 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.319
 with this belt that I bring the height 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.049
 of the trench coat you decide it to me 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:27.059
 I like very much to look leg with some 

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:29.189
 shoes that show you 

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:32.579
 can opt for ones that do not have 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:35.489
 some armband or ankle boots could 

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:37.499
 also be an ideal option finally 

00:06:35.489 --> 00:06:39.390
 a bag this time look for the bag 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:43.350
 I was flirtatious that I had some 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:45.660
 Maybe a pebble is velvet 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.340
 ideal to use in any season 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.500
 it does not matter that the velvet if you 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.940
 during winter because the colors the 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.740
