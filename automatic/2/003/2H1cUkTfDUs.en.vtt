00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
good against my team which kind of sucks

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.370 
good against my team which kind of sucks
because<00:01:14.360> when<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.509> team's<00:01:15.750> week<00:01:16.049> again

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
because when my team's week again

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410 
because when my team's week again
something<00:01:16.799> its<00:01:16.979> weak<00:01:17.159> again<00:01:17.430> something<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.210> i

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
something its weak again something so i

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.300 
something its weak again something so i
don't<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.470> opportunity<00:01:20.280> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
don't really have the opportunity of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.820 
don't really have the opportunity of
having<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.509> between<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.110> i<00:01:22.320> kind<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
having that in between so i kind of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
having that in between so i kind of
figured<00:01:22.950> he's<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> go<00:01:23.580> out<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:23.700> the

figured he's going to go out with the
tyranitar<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.869> i<00:01:25.159> predicted<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.189> by<00:01:26.490> going

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
I'm not really happy that he actually

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.029 
I'm not really happy that he actually
has<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:06.119> go<00:02:06.270> off<00:02:06.360> my<00:02:06.509> volcarona<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.380> so

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
has it I go go off my volcarona here so

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.410 
has it I go go off my volcarona here so
anything<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.399> doesn't<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.910> one<00:02:09.149> shot

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
anything that doesn't get one shot

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.900 
anything that doesn't get one shot
though<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.190> should<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.489> sent<00:02:11.730> out

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
though I should have just sent out

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.670 
though I should have just sent out
something<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.480> fortress

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
something like fortress

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.949 
something like fortress
or<00:02:13.769> anything<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.909> and<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.450> kept<00:02:15.840> my

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
or anything like that and just kept my

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.530 
or anything like that and just kept my
Vulcan<00:02:16.439> on<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.769> back<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.909> he's<00:02:18.150> going<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:18.390> go

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
Vulcan on the back but he's going to go

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.539 
Vulcan on the back but he's going to go
with<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.750> Fire<00:02:18.959> Blast<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.709> course<00:02:19.980> never

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.750 
with the Fire Blast of course never
misses<00:02:21.120> here<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.109> I'm<00:02:22.920> going<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.189> take<00:02:23.370> most<00:02:23.640> of

misses here so I'm going to take most of

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.069 
misses here so I'm going to take most of
that<00:02:23.849> damage<00:02:23.909> are<00:02:24.390> going<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.599> get<00:02:24.689> hit<00:02:24.870> by<00:02:25.019> the

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
that damage are going to get hit by the

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.190 
that damage are going to get hit by the
sandstorm<00:02:25.859> and<00:02:26.159> I'm<00:02:27.150> going<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.629> actually<00:02:27.810> go

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
sandstorm and I'm going to actually go

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.039

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
and of course that has a high chance of

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.220 
and of course that has a high chance of
hitting<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.200> he<00:02:34.349> does<00:02:34.560> takes<00:02:35.400> me<00:02:35.639> out<00:02:36.230> that
