old intercooler setup for 350 horsepower
it's<00:00:11.480> a<00:00:11.629> the<00:00:11.839> pipes<00:00:12.139> are<00:00:12.320> a<00:00:12.349> bit<00:00:12.469> oversized

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
it's a the pipes are a bit oversized

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.640 
it's a the pipes are a bit oversized
guys<00:00:13.129> if<00:00:14.059> you're<00:00:14.209> gonna<00:00:14.329> go<00:00:14.539> for<00:00:14.570> 350<00:00:15.200> or<00:00:15.349> above

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
guys if you're gonna go for 350 or above

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.860 
guys if you're gonna go for 350 or above
you<00:00:16.250> really<00:00:16.520> don't<00:00:16.700> need<00:00:16.850> 3-inch<00:00:17.270> pipe<00:00:17.510> unless

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:17.870 
you really don't need 3-inch pipe unless

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.140 
you really don't need 3-inch pipe unless
you're<00:00:18.110> like<00:00:18.280> upwards<00:00:19.280> of<00:00:19.460> like<00:00:19.490> 800

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
you're like upwards of like 800

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.550 
you're like upwards of like 800
horsepower<00:00:20.360> I<00:00:20.660> wouldn't<00:00:21.140> even<00:00:21.230> recommend

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
horsepower I wouldn't even recommend

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.010 
horsepower I wouldn't even recommend
getting<00:00:21.890> three<00:00:22.370> inch<00:00:22.490> pipe<00:00:22.720> two<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:23.870> a<00:00:23.900> half

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
getting three inch pipe two and a half

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.040 
getting three inch pipe two and a half
inch<00:00:24.230> is<00:00:24.350> great<00:00:24.970> on<00:00:25.970> a<00:00:26.060> land<00:00:26.330> speed<00:00:26.570> car<00:00:26.900> they

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
inch is great on a land speed car they

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.080 
inch is great on a land speed car they
actually<00:00:27.320> use<00:00:27.440> two<00:00:27.950> inch<00:00:28.190> pipe<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:28.850> got

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
actually use two inch pipe and got

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.540 
actually use two inch pipe and got
really<00:00:29.840> really<00:00:30.170> good<00:00:30.500> success<00:00:30.710> like<00:00:31.220> high

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
really really good success like high

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.329 
really really good success like high
flow<00:00:31.910> numbers<00:00:32.140> so<00:00:33.140> some<00:00:33.559> people<00:00:33.829> tell<00:00:34.039> me<00:00:34.160> that

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:34.339 
flow numbers so some people tell me that

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:35.950 
flow numbers so some people tell me that
it's<00:00:34.850> different<00:00:35.089> because<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:35.539> land<00:00:35.719> speed

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
it's different because the land speed

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.849 
it's different because the land speed
car<00:00:36.199> is<00:00:36.289> set<00:00:36.499> up<00:00:36.589> a<00:00:36.679> bit<00:00:36.890> differently<00:00:38.440> but<00:00:39.440> you

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
car is set up a bit differently but you

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.919 
car is set up a bit differently but you
know<00:00:40.010> numbers<00:00:40.820> like<00:00:40.999> that<00:00:41.030> don't<00:00:41.359> really<00:00:41.600> lies

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:41.929 
know numbers like that don't really lies

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:44.799 
know numbers like that don't really lies
so<00:00:42.350> why<00:00:43.249> go<00:00:43.489> three<00:00:43.820> inch<00:00:43.969> if<00:00:44.179> two<00:00:44.390> inch<00:00:44.570> can

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
so why go three inch if two inch can

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.809 
so why go three inch if two inch can
flow<00:00:45.109> high<00:00:45.469> enough<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.949> push<00:00:46.219> a<00:00:46.249> land<00:00:46.550> speed

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819 
flow high enough to push a land speed

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:48.970 
flow high enough to push a land speed
car<00:00:47.089> to<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.420> brink<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:48.530> know<00:00:48.769> what<00:00:48.890> I'm

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
car to the brink you know what I'm

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.779 
car to the brink you know what I'm
saying<00:00:49.219> but<00:00:49.819> anyways<00:00:50.440> yeah<00:00:51.440> my<00:00:52.309> rear<00:00:52.579> wheel

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
saying but anyways yeah my rear wheel

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.239 
saying but anyways yeah my rear wheel
bearings<00:00:53.210> that<00:00:53.300> are<00:00:53.539> destroyed<00:00:54.109> look<00:00:55.039> at<00:00:55.159> the

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:55.249 
bearings that are destroyed look at the

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:58.599 
bearings that are destroyed look at the
taps<00:00:55.519> this<00:00:56.269> cap<00:00:56.539> is<00:00:56.749> like<00:00:56.960> ground<00:00:57.350> down<00:00:57.679> so

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
taps this cap is like ground down so

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.309 
taps this cap is like ground down so
thin<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:58.969> it<00:00:59.149> cut<00:00:59.479> me<00:00:59.629> when<00:00:59.749> I<00:00:59.780> took<00:01:00.019> it<00:01:00.139> off

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
thin that it cut me when I took it off

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:03.360 
thin that it cut me when I took it off
you<00:01:00.620> can<00:01:01.280> see<00:01:01.429> a<00:01:01.460> ridge<00:01:02.210> in<00:01:02.389> there

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
you can see a ridge in there

they suck my wheel bearings that they

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.910 
they suck my wheel bearings that they
didn't<00:01:11.689> tighten<00:01:11.840> properly<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.680> proper

spec they look fine but they jiggle all

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.749 
spec they look fine but they jiggle all
over<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.649> place<00:01:18.829> which<00:01:19.009> we<00:01:19.130> love<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.399> should

there's<00:01:33.619> my<00:01:33.799> EMM<00:01:34.219> 90<00:01:34.579> that<00:01:34.670> I'm<00:01:34.789> rebuilding

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
there's my EMM 90 that I'm rebuilding

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.030 
there's my EMM 90 that I'm rebuilding
it's<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:36.960> pristine<00:01:37.350> shape<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.890> only

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
it's a really pristine shape the only

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.170 
it's a really pristine shape the only
thing<00:01:38.160> I<00:01:38.250> was<00:01:38.310> wrong<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.820> front

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
thing I was wrong with it was the front

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.090 
thing I was wrong with it was the front
seal<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:40.080> bad<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> leaked<00:01:40.950> oil

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
seal was bad so that leaked oil

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.640 
seal was bad so that leaked oil
everywhere<00:01:41.550> so<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.150> decided<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.620> take<00:01:43.620> it

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
everywhere so I just decided to take it

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.620 
everywhere so I just decided to take it
all<00:01:43.830> apart<00:01:44.160> clean<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.030> I'm

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
all apart clean it out and I'm

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.570 
all apart clean it out and I'm
rebuilding<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.260> from<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> ground<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.370> to

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
rebuilding it from the ground up so to

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.670 
rebuilding it from the ground up so to
speak

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
coming from my exhaust but only when I'm

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.500 
coming from my exhaust but only when I'm
near<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.040> exhaust<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.670> hear<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.060> it's<00:02:40.330> kind

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
near the exhaust can I hear it it's kind

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.449 
near the exhaust can I hear it it's kind
of<00:02:40.569> weird<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.900> only<00:02:41.049> happens<00:02:41.379> sometimes<00:02:41.830> I'm

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
of weird it only happens sometimes I'm

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.940 
of weird it only happens sometimes I'm
not<00:02:42.580> really<00:02:42.670> sure<00:02:42.879> what<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.030> make<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.239> it

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
and I smooth consistent idle I think it

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.410 
and I smooth consistent idle I think it
actually<00:02:53.079> might<00:02:53.409> be<00:02:53.439> my<00:02:53.890> exhaust<00:02:54.670> hanger<00:02:55.090> up

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
actually might be my exhaust hanger up

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.649 
actually might be my exhaust hanger up
