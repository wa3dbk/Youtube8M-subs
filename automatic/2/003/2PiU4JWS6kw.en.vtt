00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.250
 Y 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.160
 yes 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.230
 marc was approaching to finally kiss 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.710
 sophie when her cell phone alone 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.920
 both were uncomfortable with the interruption 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:38.250
 but Sofia finally responded to the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.489
 few seconds I wish I had not done it 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.580
 in the band manager and it did not sound 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.040
 for nothing happy very began to 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.920
 shout to them he ordered you to forget the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.470
 personal problems and demanded that he 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 will present immediately in the trial 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.190
 to prepare the function of the day 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.379
 following he even said that he himself 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.800
 would control the meeting to 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.200
 keep the pasta between everyone but 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.020
 Sophie was not willing to forget me 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.990
 and much less to get on stage 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.260
 virtual friend who had betrayed him and 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.770
 the man he had humiliated 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.550
 dust the phone full of sadness is 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.550
 He headed to his room 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.280
 March had been waiting for the but 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.770
 Sofia was so confused by everything 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.950
 that had happened and I do not notice that when leaving 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.649
 he left it alone at the reception 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.130
 he came to his room and sat on the 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.130
 computer 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.160
 immediately began to write despite 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.430
 that he knew that the fans would not be 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.930
 happy announcement on your page that a 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:16.739
 from that moment he left dark live 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.670
 that had been without doubt one of the days 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.670
 toughest of your life 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.069
 marc on the other hand was disappointed and 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:32.069
 I did not know what to do I could not go back to 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.040
 his department by joey order and 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.920
 obviously having dinner with the neighbor no longer 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.560
 it was an option 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.280
 he believed that his end did not feel the same as 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.250
 he and that saddened him so he decided 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.410
 finally go to some bar in the city 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.410
 to try to clear your mind 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.660
 Jennifer was a bit bored studying 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.629
 to cross themselves loving so that life with their 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.300
 friend after frustrating his plans he 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.670
 I had put a little bad love but 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.920
 only a little that is that when I and 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.920
 kissed did not try to stop it 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.310
 do not 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.990
 on Saturday morning Jennifer returned 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.540
 to his house and went straight to the room 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.230
 of sophie to tell her how it had been 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.230
 your night 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.390
 do not 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.099
 I found him crying and I can not 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.099
 understand why 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.480
 It was there when her friend explained everything 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.370
 what happened with ronnie and with his retirement 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.040
 from the band 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.260
 however he omitted the detail of 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.330
 tell them about the situation with marc 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.540
 what was the most anguished 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.660
 although her friend was with joey 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.690
 little had felt something for that then 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.450
 she did not dare to tell him what she 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.540
 it happened to his neighbor 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.700
 Jennifer tried to comfort her but nothing of 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.639
 what he was doing was enough to get him 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.979
 a smile 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.379
 so he promised to prepare him the 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.020
 Breakfast richer than ever 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:31.680
 I would have eaten and when was the kitchen 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.110
 to prepare him he called Ã¡lex the cousin of 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.659
 her friend and with whom she was very close 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.749
 to help him lift the 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.749
 cheer up 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.030
 I would not have resorted to it if I was not 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.210
 Absolutely necessary 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.150
 but I was very worried and there was never 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.820
 seen sophie so bad 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.900
 she promised that after lunch 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.900
 I would be in the apartment 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.240
 marc woke up and walked listlessly 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:07.150
 towards the kitchen to prepare something 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.150
 before beginning your exercise routine 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.560
 It did not feel good 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.520
 and sophie were encouraged to talk in one 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.520
 to the other after what happened
