00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.410
 Today I want to give you a top secret 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.030
 spor locations of secret gang cars 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.720
 be like no one between the two 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.520
 the voodoo sport.de is extremely secret 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.340
 and probably few to hardly 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.350
 someone will know this spawn and first 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.060
 Once the gang of cars is so and 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.859
 understand exactly why the ball 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.510
 actually always at the spawn 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.540
 stands at the most different courses 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.550
 cars first this is going on 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.530
 car what you wish for example 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.210
 if it does with the tornado if you 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.430
 let the tornados build gang bangs 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 you want a tornado yourself 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.649
 simply pulled from the street worked out 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.120
 then you get the spot of the final 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.370
 100% to 80 percent you get the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.870
 tornados bonn for example now stay 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.030
 me at the tornado this is a classic 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.590
 to 80 percent get him then if 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.629
 her self with a car of 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.860
 vehicle category of the classics rome ride 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.600
 to 80 percent 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.399
 if no classic at the moment 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 Road driving simply changes several times 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.350
 the lobby so that classics on the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.700
 Road warning so change faster too 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.110
 the cars on the street like in 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.100
 look at various lobbies 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.590
 because he probably knows it 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.470
 even it was just felt 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.270
 for hours only five cars rum on the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.979
 then always one street and then 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.540
 the same cars are the cars 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.260
 change very much in your own lobbies 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.210
 Rare 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.680
 that means the lobby changes accordingly 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.270
 saves a lot of time and is not so 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.439
 wait a long time for the classics 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.180
 and that's the first one now 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.680
 basic tips about that at all 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.200
 classics and themselves here 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.820
 mainly in the video revolves 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.320
 to bring sport at all and now 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.130
 I wish you much fun in the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.570
 secret locations so fitting for example 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.310
 I thought I'll start right away 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.900
 with the tornado on here has that 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.820
 lucky a tornado right on the 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.229
 street found and first of all 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.630
 I'll show you the rough street ii 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.820
 is here of all of them 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.909
 By the way, the following cars with the green ones 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.040
 hue this gang reigns in 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.450
 the tomb of street very close to the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.070
 big city on this small dead end 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.200
 I'll show you here now 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.849
 this little dead end parking lot and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.569
 this car park right on this the 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.670
 match 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.230
 aspen yellow gears cars here on the 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.549
 Parking was grad no yellow courses 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.349
 car therefore i have my luck on the 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.150
 following parking you tried and 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.030
 there but actually two 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.760
 yellow tornadoes you see the color yourself 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.159
 at the windows is completely dark 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.870
 black and this car is complete 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.730
 had its day that is so you can also 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.950
 With all cars save money for all 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.920
 The following gang cars are pretty 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.439
 strongly upgraded and if you then that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.329
 same car so the tornado from one 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.980
 want to find other courses then must 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.250
 her easy to this location comes like that 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.189
 a gang can be found here with a 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.019
 weird metals gray-white paint 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.459
 I especially know these corridors 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.829
 but not in any case we have then 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.680
 here a new original car what a lot 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.870
 Rarely is in this varnish and also 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.480
 sport again this car for two 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.849
 So she has a car right away 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.769
 your buddy, we come with, however 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.169
 the viewty to this location with the 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.299
 hair test whether obscured spawn anyway 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.699
 no other car in the video with the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.739
 but then find it open 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:17.430
 we another bio the one from a gang 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.069
 the cars matte claret with 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.959
 a white pia effect so painted 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.000
 a material effect that it on all 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.319
 cool and then another 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.699
 horny color and this car is 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.009
 Of course, pretty strong again 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.479
 however, the gears are upgraded cars 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.579
 unfortunately god is not all full 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.799
 upgraded but relatively strong with it 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.030
 Can you say with each gang 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.430
 car are pretty much the same 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.079
 upgraded a lot of money in things 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.120
 save tuning and besides, these are 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.340
 cars still cool here again 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.509
 with the bio the hardtop however 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.370
 come to the parking lot 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.259
 There you will find a yellow biotie 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.939
 open with open and so you can 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.530
 then with this pio with the hood 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.560
 open to the other sport comes so that 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.729
 her a burgundy pearl effect matt 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.340
 biotie can spawn and here 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:04.469
 Do you see another example of the 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.090
 buddy in the green biotie in the 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:07.650
 brook street here very tight band like 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.780
 very right at the beginning on the map 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.400
 saw the air there is this 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.889
 always on a firm parking lot along 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.209
 It is simply tested on the street and 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.219
 come now to the banana 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.169
 We will notice that 1 ton 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:21.750

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.430

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.500
 come to me 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.840
 very well known before this went 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.449
 at that time in gta san andreas first 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.660
 over the tomb street has ruled and 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.449
 later by emperor johnson's green crew 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.500
 green gear if I have it 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.110
 was turned off and thus on 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.600
 the troisdorf street was expelled 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.370
 where all the green cars are now 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.100
 stand here in gta 5 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.470
 and now at the bug an her example 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.300
 Again , the yellow car is also here 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.280
 By the way, with the pineapple and no here 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.440
 car in this parking lot for the men 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.810
 there is only in this fixed gang 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.150
 from four place the car here anyway 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.310
 the buga me again in yellow too 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.380
 pretty strong and as always 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.759
 like every gear car and we come 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.349
 anyway with the puck on her here too 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.360
 this spain we had, however 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.570
 just this tornado again with the 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.910
 Silver paint is due and now 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.310
 already spontaneously who was promised 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.259
 is right here in the desert 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.449
 at this place right next to one 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.250
 old gas station and because there is 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.940
 also a race directly if I 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.160
 Do not be fooled 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.510
 and that's where it is 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.130
 buddy the banks we are short 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.659
 and then they are back to 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.210
 come back from this spot and 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.110
 That's why this car has 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.400
 drove back 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.560
 that means you just have to drive away for a short time 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.539
 if you where you just bypassed saves 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.400
 this car to 100 percent and the 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.500
 Voodoo will also be 100 percent in 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.810
 This village always drive around the best 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.370
 It's raining in this weather when it rains 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.800
 and the sun shines easily is like that 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.110
 spawn this car at 100 percent in 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.599
 this village i hope you have this 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.490
 if like 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.530
 yes, I would be happy if we could 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.479
 create goal 106 for this video 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.669
 because it could be a harder one 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.539
 work for all cars the secret caspar 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.000
 to find 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:07.070
 if your car was not in it yet 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.630
 the not the spawn point 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.710
 know then write this name of the 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.610
 authors just go to the 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.080
 comments clean 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.970
 maybe I'll even bring it off then 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.099
 this car even another next 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.539
 tutorial if we find enough cars 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.900
 of which not yet the spore locations 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.099
 know 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.050
 then I could well imagine 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.370
 about this a next tutorial too 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.169
 and of course I want to 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.940
 still happy about one or the other 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.780
 new subscribers and much more 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.789
 I hope we meet next 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.789
 see you again by then yes
