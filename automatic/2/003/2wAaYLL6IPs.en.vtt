what you want you want to run but I have

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.369 
what you want you want to run but I have
made<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.980> chart<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.250> kind<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.089> compare<00:00:15.360> each<00:00:16.020> of

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
made a chart to kind of compare each of

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.519 
made a chart to kind of compare each of
the<00:00:16.710> solar<00:00:17.250> upgrades<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.720> goes<00:00:18.840> up<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.140> 15

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the solar upgrades and it goes up to 15

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.560 
the solar upgrades and it goes up to 15
minutes<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.369> figured<00:00:20.730> after<00:00:20.939> 15<00:00:21.390> minutes

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
minutes and I figured after 15 minutes

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.910 
minutes and I figured after 15 minutes
people<00:00:21.990> already<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.500> build<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.800> they

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
people already have the build that they

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.700 
people already have the build that they
want<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:24.090> if<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.539> look<00:00:25.199> at<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> chart

want up so if you look at the chart
which<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.039> should<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> link<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.760> the

the last one piggy bank and solar tree

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
the last one piggy bank and solar tree
starting<00:01:24.570> out<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.750> 250<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:25.650> moving<00:01:25.860> down

starting out at 250 and then moving down

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.710 
starting out at 250 and then moving down
you'll<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> five<00:01:26.909> minutes<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> catch<00:01:27.540> up

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you'll see it five minutes you catch up

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.109 
you'll see it five minutes you catch up
to<00:01:27.810> piggy<00:01:27.990> bank<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:30.000> much

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to piggy bank and then you pretty much

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.719 
to piggy bank and then you pretty much
beat<00:01:30.509> everything<00:01:31.020> after<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:33.020> my<00:01:34.020> opinion<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
beat everything after that my opinion is

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.730 
beat everything after that my opinion is
pretty<00:01:35.729> much<00:01:35.850> don't<00:01:36.180> run<00:01:36.479> solar<00:01:36.840> tree<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.560> its

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
pretty much don't run solar tree on its

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.940 
pretty much don't run solar tree on its
own<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.250> takes<00:01:38.460> way<00:01:38.700> too<00:01:38.729> long<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.150> get

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
own it takes way too long to get

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.660 
own it takes way too long to get
beneficial<00:01:42.380> piggy<00:01:43.380> bank<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.979> much<00:01:44.430> better

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
beneficial piggy bank is a much better

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.910 
beneficial piggy bank is a much better
option<00:01:44.759> mostly<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.290> start<00:01:46.740> off

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
option mostly because you can start off

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.580 
option mostly because you can start off
with<00:01:47.130> more<00:01:47.579> than<00:01:47.759> one<00:01:47.939> upgrade<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:49.320> you're

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
with more than one upgrade so if you're

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.200 
with more than one upgrade so if you're
lone<00:01:49.770> star<00:01:50.040> you'll<00:01:50.220> get<00:01:50.369> dynamite<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:51.030> an

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
lone star you'll get dynamite with an

you<00:02:17.069> want<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.840> pretty<00:02:19.200> much<00:02:19.319> need<00:02:19.530> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
you want so you pretty much need a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.990 
you want so you pretty much need a
character<00:02:19.829> that<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.129> deal<00:02:20.459> with<00:02:20.609> that<00:02:20.640> pretty

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
character that can deal with that pretty

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.470 
character that can deal with that pretty
well<00:02:21.180> I'd<00:02:21.659> say<00:02:21.689> clunk<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.500> best<00:02:22.680> candidate

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
well I'd say clunk is the best candidate

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.520 
well I'd say clunk is the best candidate
you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.569> pretty<00:02:24.689> much<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:24.989> start<00:02:25.260> off<00:02:25.319> with

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
you can pretty much just start off with

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.729 
you can pretty much just start off with
boots<00:02:25.819> piggy<00:02:26.819> bank<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.180> solar<00:02:27.420> tree<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.409> be

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
boots piggy bank and solar tree and be

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.140 
boots piggy bank and solar tree and be
fine<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.280> most<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.639> game<00:02:29.670> because<00:02:30.030> you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
fine for most of the game because you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.959 
fine for most of the game because you
can<00:02:30.389> just<00:02:30.420> stack<00:02:30.989> health<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.439> his<00:02:31.560> bite<00:02:31.969> but

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
can just stack health on his bite but

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.289 
can just stack health on his bite but
