screw directly into the freezer that's a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.380 
screw directly into the freezer that's a
bad<00:01:21.810> idea<00:01:22.250> if<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.180> number

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
bad idea if you see this little number

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.820 
bad idea if you see this little number
right<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.259> temperature<00:01:25.710> in

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
right here that's a temperature in

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
right here that's a temperature in
Celsius<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> temperature<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.600> inside

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
Celsius what the temperature is inside

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.490 
Celsius what the temperature is inside
it's<00:01:29.009> designed<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> freezer<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.900> you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it's designed to be a freezer so if you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.620 
it's designed to be a freezer so if you
leave<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> freezer<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.119> gonna<00:01:33.329> freeze

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
leave it as a freezer it's gonna freeze

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.130 
leave it as a freezer it's gonna freeze

2x4 all the way around about eight feet
I<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.640> bought<00:02:30.849> one<00:02:30.880> from<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.900> know<00:02:32.019> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
I just bought one from you know the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.979 
I just bought one from you know the
hardware<00:02:32.470> store<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.580> then<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.420> lined<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.959> with

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
hardware store and then I lined it with

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.740 
hardware store and then I lined it with
some<00:02:35.350> styrofoam<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:36.250> since<00:02:36.850> styrofoam<00:02:37.420> makes

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
some styrofoam and since styrofoam makes

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.780 
some styrofoam and since styrofoam makes
this<00:02:37.959> really<00:02:38.319> like<00:02:38.830> nails<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.489> chalkboard

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
this really like nails on a chalkboard

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.259 
this really like nails on a chalkboard
sound<00:02:40.299> whenever<00:02:40.569> you<00:02:41.580> glaze<00:02:42.580> over<00:02:42.819> it

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
sound whenever you glaze over it

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.650 
sound whenever you glaze over it
I<00:02:43.299> put<00:02:44.049> some<00:02:44.680> silver<00:02:45.430> duct<00:02:45.760> tape<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.299> just

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
I put some silver duct tape on it just

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.420 
I put some silver duct tape on it just
to<00:02:47.080> help<00:02:47.319> with<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.620> sound<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.130> doesn't

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
to help with that sound so it doesn't

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.280 
to help with that sound so it doesn't
make<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:48.670> noise<00:02:48.819> anymore<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.900> ridge<00:02:50.080> it's

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
make that noise anymore the ridge it's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.940 
make that noise anymore the ridge it's
making<00:02:50.620> right<00:02:50.769> there<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.560> duct<00:02:53.769> tape

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
making right there in the duct tape

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.500 
making right there in the duct tape
that's<00:02:54.220> just<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.580> probe<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.180> see<00:02:55.360> what

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
that's just the probe to see what

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.199 
that's just the probe to see what
temperature<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.019> really<00:02:56.319> is<00:02:56.440> inside<00:02:56.940> co2<00:02:57.940> tank

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
temperature it really is inside co2 tank

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.660 
temperature it really is inside co2 tank
it's<00:02:58.959> green<00:02:59.260> that's<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.739> color<00:03:00.069> for<00:03:00.220> oxygen

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
it's green that's the color for oxygen

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.140 
it's green that's the color for oxygen
in<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.880> states<00:03:01.150> but<00:03:02.400> whatever<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:03.670> it's<00:03:04.030> not

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
in the states but whatever so it's not

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.170 
in the states but whatever so it's not
oxygen<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.750> assure<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.019> it's<00:03:05.349> co2<00:03:06.180> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
oxygen and I assure you it's co2 and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.729 
oxygen and I assure you it's co2 and
then<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:08.230> got<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.880> United<00:03:09.880> States<00:03:10.120> regulator

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
then it's got a United States regulator

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.140 
then it's got a United States regulator
attached<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.100> with<00:03:12.250> an<00:03:12.370> adapter<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:12.940> cost

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
attached to it with an adapter that cost

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.599 
attached to it with an adapter that cost
me<00:03:13.299> about<00:03:13.450> ten<00:03:13.660> bucks<00:03:13.920> if<00:03:14.920> you're<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.280> Japan

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
too much on that other than just to see

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.280 
too much on that other than just to see
how<00:04:20.720> it's<00:04:20.900> done<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:23.090> take<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.540> cap<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:24.050> drill

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
how it's done you take the cap you drill

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.620 
how it's done you take the cap you drill
two<00:04:24.470> holes<00:04:24.500> in<00:04:24.980> it<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.250> then<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.210> put<00:04:26.420> these

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
two holes in it and then you put these

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.180 
two holes in it and then you put these
pieces<00:04:27.170> these<00:04:27.620> valve<00:04:28.240> quick<00:04:29.240> connects<00:04:30.190> the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
pieces these valve quick connects the

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.850 
pieces these valve quick connects the
the<00:04:31.580> male<00:04:31.760> ones<00:04:32.090> on<00:04:32.330> top<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.200> cap<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.680> then

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
the male ones on top of the cap and then

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.390 
the male ones on top of the cap and then
you<00:04:34.670> glue<00:04:34.910> them<00:04:36.010> because<00:04:37.010> it's<00:04:37.130> basically

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
you glue them because it's basically

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.280 
you glue them because it's basically
like<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.640> straw<00:04:38.060> fitting<00:04:38.480> in<00:04:38.600> there<00:04:38.780> holds

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
like a straw fitting in there holds

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.770 
like a straw fitting in there holds

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
pressure very nicely go with these

fantastic<00:04:48.680> they<00:04:49.190> cost<00:04:49.400> me<00:04:49.550> about<00:04:49.669> a<00:04:49.790> hundred

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
fantastic they cost me about a hundred

fantastic they cost me about a hundred
bucks<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.570> tried<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:50.990> go<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.200> cheap<00:04:51.410> route

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
bucks I tried to go the cheap route

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.350 
bucks I tried to go the cheap route
first<00:04:51.860> with<00:04:52.160> luer<00:04:52.340> locks<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:52.850> whatnot

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
first with luer locks and whatnot

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.480 
first with luer locks and whatnot
they<00:04:54.020> don't<00:04:54.200> have<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.470> right<00:04:54.620> flow<00:04:54.919> there

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
they don't have the right flow there

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.570 
they don't have the right flow there
they're<00:04:56.180> very<00:04:56.210> difficult<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.900> go<00:04:57.140> on<00:04:57.380> to<00:04:58.190> twist

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
they're very difficult to go on to twist

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.820 
they're very difficult to go on to twist
on<00:04:58.760> and<00:04:58.940> off<00:04:59.030> they're<00:04:59.300> messy<00:05:00.010> and<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:02.360> just

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
on and off they're messy and it just

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.350 
on and off they're messy and it just
it's<00:05:03.830> ridiculous<00:05:04.460> how<00:05:04.610> much<00:05:04.790> effort<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.240> put

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
it's ridiculous how much effort you put

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.690 
it's ridiculous how much effort you put
into<00:05:05.660> something<00:05:05.780> just<00:05:06.350> to<00:05:06.440> make<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:06.700> cheaper

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
into something just to make it cheaper

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.430 
into something just to make it cheaper

coated them around the superglue with

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.830 
coated them around the superglue with
j-b<00:05:47.570> weld<00:05:48.040> to<00:05:49.040> make<00:05:49.190> them<00:05:49.370> sturdy<00:05:49.669> and<00:05:49.940> then<00:05:50.540> I

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
j-b weld to make them sturdy and then I

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.360 
j-b weld to make them sturdy and then I
coated<00:05:51.320> them<00:05:51.650> on<00:05:52.190> the<00:05:52.400> inside<00:05:52.760> with<00:05:53.510> silicone

that's gonna happen anyway you just
connect<00:06:04.280> this<00:06:04.430> to<00:06:04.700> the<00:06:04.880> dip<00:06:05.870> tube<00:06:06.080> to<00:06:06.350> the

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
connect this to the dip tube to the

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.130 
connect this to the dip tube to the
liquid<00:06:08.210> side<00:06:08.740> in<00:06:09.740> my<00:06:09.830> case<00:06:10.690> so<00:06:11.690> it<00:06:11.810> works<00:06:11.960> out

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
liquid side in my case so it works out

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.930 
liquid side in my case so it works out
really<00:06:12.320> nicely<00:06:12.590> this<00:06:13.160> these<00:06:13.460> have<00:06:13.490> an<00:06:13.820> auto

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
really nicely this these have an auto

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.490 
really nicely this these have an auto
shutoff<00:06:14.300> feature<00:06:14.419> on<00:06:14.900> them<00:06:15.050> so<00:06:15.140> you<00:06:15.229> don't<00:06:15.410> get

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
shutoff feature on them so you don't get

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.790 
shutoff feature on them so you don't get
messy<00:06:16.060> and<00:06:17.060> you<00:06:17.330> can<00:06:17.510> also<00:06:17.630> pressurize<00:06:18.500> a

messy and you can also pressurize a

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.870 
messy and you can also pressurize a
bottle<00:06:19.640> and<00:06:19.790> leave<00:06:20.690> it
