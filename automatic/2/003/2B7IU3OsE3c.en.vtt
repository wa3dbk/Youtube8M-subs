00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Have you ever had the feeling, that you fall into the abyss?

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:11.364
You fly, you fly and you can't stop, and the thoughts from the past haunt you.

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:15.450
You want to have someone to talk to, but nobody is there.

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:21.462
Only you and your inner self, which may be several. And it all looks like madness.

00:00:21.872 --> 00:00:23.256
My name is Nastya.

00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:27.254
I won't talk about where I was born, when and how much I weighed,

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:33.938
What was my first word and how I used to blow bubbles with my nose and everyone around was touched and clapping.

00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:37.105
As far as I remember myself, I was always lonely.

00:00:37.694 --> 00:00:44.688
I wanted to be like everyone, I wanted to spend time with my friends and just think about nothing.

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:49.291
I wanted to have a family, to have children, to stay home all of my life and to play the role of a good mother.

00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:52.541
But, alas, I am me.

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:57.873
In the kindergarden I was very shy and didn't talk to anyone.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.056
I was thinking about something all the time and believed in fairytale,

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:04.491
thinking that the world around me is a dream.

00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:10.137
I saw dreams not so often and always slept with the light turned on,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.231
as I'm still doing so.

00:01:15.014 --> 00:01:18.704
I am 22 years old and I still get lost when I am asked this question.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:31.547
In primary school I've described my future job, which was a little bit unusual, but we were given this task and I think it was well done.

00:01:31.677 --> 00:01:32.615
I wanna be a Good person

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:47.092
When I was a teenager I had acne, all of my face and neck were covered with large blue painful pimples and my eyes were always red from crying because of the reaction of the society to my appearance.

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:55.184
I started to apply cosmetics to my face to hide this problem, because none of the cosmetologists couldn't cure it.

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:02.929
I've never considered myself beautiful. I liked doing make up and creating a new face to myself.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:14.163
It calmed me. I've understood that it created the illusion that I was not me, but the other person,who gets disapproval people's views, and I was just a spectator who is watching all of this from the outside.

00:02:15.205 --> 00:02:18.526
School is the most difficult experience, which I had to live through.

00:02:21.123 --> 00:02:27.921
I heard eternal reproaches from teachers because of my appearance and the words like "Look at yourself in the mirror. What do you look like?"

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.317
But I didn't like to look in the mirror, it was hung, just not to make me sad everytime.

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:42.319
Children are not the marionettes, but little persons with their own characters and ideologies.

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:46.524
At school I found out a lot about romantic relationships...

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.855
And it made me shocked.

00:02:48.993 --> 00:02:56.604
when my classmates were discussing relationships with seniors and sharing with information how somebody was drunk, where and how they vomited.

00:02:57.202 --> 00:03:05.969
I've just made sure of the right decision, that I will never ever drink alcohol and smoke-It is terrible!

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:17.576
I wasn't an excellent student, because I thought, that x and y, fractions and roots will not be useful in my life, I was not interested in what year someone has died.

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:22.410
But when we asked why do we need it, we were answered "It will be useful for you in life"

00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:30.238
One day at the market a woman looked at me and said "Oh my God, what a nightmare!"

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.208
I burst into tears and ran away, I was hurt and in pain.

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:42.254
I couldn't explain to an adult woman, that inner ugliness is much more worse than external defects.

00:03:42.602 --> 00:03:49.930
because the appearance is a plasticine,it changes all the time, but it is very difficult to put down a man's internal ugliness

00:03:53.229 --> 00:04:00.228
When I got my first job, a thief in mask rushed to our salon with a gun, just like in the movie.

00:04:00.744 --> 00:04:04.064
He demanded to take off all the gold and give all the money.

00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:09.574
In this moment in a couple of seconds all of my life ran before my eyes, I was hold by fear.

00:04:09.974 --> 00:04:20.213
I've never been a fan of gold and diamonds, but my mom has given me a pendant on a memory before she left, which I never parted with, but then I didn't hesitate to give it.

00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:32.749
It was an unpleasant situation because after the robbery, people, which were supposed to protect me, laughed at me for a long time, and then I felt a lie and injustice.

00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:46.001
Since that time I don't wear gold, and I doy see any value in it - it is only an object to attract attention, both positive and destructive.

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:55.178
When I was taken on the job, they said that I was very bright and creative, but after a while I annoyed them,

00:04:55.178 --> 00:05:01.678
and I was put on the street with the same words "Look at yourself in the mirror, what do you look like".

00:05:04.115 --> 00:05:11.060
I didn't leave home for a few months. Because of the rejection of my appearance, I became a hostage in my own apartment.

00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:13.696
Day and night have found new colors.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:22.636
I lost faith in myself and my strength. I have no place here. I'm nobody and I can nothing to do, and I am terrible and unlucky.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.057
Why me? Why?

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.146
I repeated these words every day.

00:05:27.788 --> 00:05:32.791
When there was not a drop of hope I found support in the Internet, or rather they found me,

00:05:33.255 --> 00:05:42.177
people who were interested in me and my life absolutely changed my life and views. From a pessimist, I became an optimist, I changed my mind.

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:57.248
Not so kind people also wrote to me, offering fiction and money, but only a thing can be sold in the store, and people need to be humans and not lose a sense of dignity.

00:05:57.398 --> 00:06:03.440
No matter what situation happens in life, no matter how much money is needed, it is not necessary to stoop and fall.

00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:09.141
I said to myself that I will have everything I want in 2 years! And so it happened.

00:06:10.822 --> 00:06:15.001
I wrote to myself that I will be able to do everything and listed all what I want.

00:06:16.324 --> 00:06:19.958
Belief in yourself and support-that's what I needed so many years.

00:06:24.658 --> 00:06:32.698
I've changed everything,nutrition and attitude to people, despite the fact that they showed a negative and I smiled to them in answer.

00:06:33.636 --> 00:06:40.931
I refused to eat meat after watching the video how it is produced, how cruely and inhumanely someone's life is taken.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.630
Fear and compassion merged into one big ban.

00:06:44.782 --> 00:06:50.883
Michelle Phan and Promise Phan became my inspiration for creating my own channel, which I am very grateful to them for.

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:53.891
Youtube and you became my life.

00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:58.372
I don't know if I can call myself a happy person. Rather lucky,

00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:06.821
because 3 years ago I didn't have anything, no family, no life, no interest in anything.

00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:11.276
You returned the faith in a fairytale that I have seen as a child,

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:15.736
without you I wouldn't have done so I am very grateful to you.

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:21.014
Nothing's impossible- these words from the song of Depeche Mode became my motto in life.

00:07:23.227 --> 00:07:27.546
All the problems are temporary, there is the sun after the rain,

00:07:27.885 --> 00:07:33.347
everything will turn out to one who never gives up and nobody will hurt the one who smiles in answer to negative.

00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:45.134
My story wasn't very joyful, but I wanted to tell you about my worldview and to show, that it's not necessary to follow the crowd and change ourselves.

00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:53.794
It's not necessary to kill a child inside you and try to become an adult quickly, live every minute of your childhood and believe in a miracle,

00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:57.863
because life is a fairytale, which you create for yourself.

00:07:58.257 --> 00:08:00.707
You should know that you are special!

00:08:01.021 --> 00:08:02.484
I love you all very much.
