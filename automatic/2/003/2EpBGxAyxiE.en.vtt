00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
thing but I'm let's see if he canceled

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.150 
thing but I'm let's see if he canceled

the council to play I canceled the pylon

began his time but always forced is a

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.620 
began his time but always forced is a
score<00:03:57.500> shine<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:58.430> run<00:03:58.610> as<00:03:58.940> drone<00:03:59.480> out

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
score shine to run as drone out

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.940 
score shine to run as drone out
somewhere<00:03:59.990> else<00:04:00.140> actually<00:04:00.560> looked<00:04:00.740> like<00:04:00.860> he

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
somewhere else actually looked like he

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.260 
somewhere else actually looked like he
was<00:04:01.070> going<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.220> try<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.430> set<00:04:01.640> up<00:04:01.670> his<00:04:01.910> Drona<00:04:02.150> a

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
was going to try and set up his Drona a

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.930 
was going to try and set up his Drona a
third<00:04:02.570> base<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:03.920> instead<00:04:04.160> he's<00:04:04.340> just<00:04:04.580> waited

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
third base but instead he's just waited

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.790 
third base but instead he's just waited
in<00:04:05.030> GaN<00:04:05.210> Jin's<00:04:05.420> thrown<00:04:05.660> at<00:04:05.810> that<00:04:05.960> that<00:04:06.440> natural

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
in GaN Jin's thrown at that that natural

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.290 
in GaN Jin's thrown at that that natural
expansion<00:04:07.070> he's<00:04:07.370> gonna<00:04:07.520> swears<00:04:07.820> he<00:04:07.940> said<00:04:08.120> that

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
expansion he's gonna swears he said that

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.270 
expansion he's gonna swears he said that
strong<00:04:08.570> I<00:04:08.780> don't<00:04:09.590> know<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:09.800> map<00:04:09.950> very<00:04:10.100> well

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
strong I don't know this map very well

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.710 
strong I don't know this map very well
so<00:04:10.400> okay<00:04:10.670> there<00:04:10.820> is<00:04:10.910> another<00:04:11.120> expansion<00:04:11.420> down

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
so okay there is another expansion down

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.970 
so okay there is another expansion down
here<00:04:11.900> at<00:04:11.959> school<00:04:12.080> good<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.500> know<00:04:14.830> where<00:04:15.830> the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
here at school good to know where the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.979 
here at school good to know where the
drone<00:04:16.250> going<00:04:16.609> so<00:04:17.359> he's<00:04:17.480> going<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.630> set<00:04:17.810> up<00:04:17.900> his

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
drone going so he's going to set up his

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.080 
drone going so he's going to set up his
third<00:04:18.140> base<00:04:18.290> there<00:04:18.470> bc<00:04:19.160> has<00:04:19.430> got<00:04:19.580> his<00:04:19.730> cannons

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
third base there bc has got his cannons

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.190 
third base there bc has got his cannons
out<00:04:20.180> because<00:04:20.359> he<00:04:20.450> knew<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:20.630> there<00:04:20.900> is<00:04:20.989> what

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
out because he knew that there is what

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.610 
out because he knew that there is what
must<00:04:21.350> have<00:04:21.440> been<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.560> nova<00:04:21.770> pool<00:04:21.979> otherwise

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
must have been a nova pool otherwise

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.960 
must have been a nova pool otherwise
think<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:24.740> yeah<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:24.980> think<00:04:25.340> I'm<00:04:25.520> spending<00:04:25.820> over

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
think so yeah I think I'm spending over

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.430 
think so yeah I think I'm spending over
school<00:04:26.150> because<00:04:26.389> otherwise<00:04:26.690> be<00:04:27.230> soon

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
school because otherwise be soon

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.440 
school because otherwise be soon
probably<00:04:27.620> we've<00:04:27.800> gotten<00:04:28.070> is<00:04:28.100> this<00:04:29.060> nexus

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
probably we've gotten is this nexus

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.090 
probably we've gotten is this nexus
first<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:29.960> think<00:04:30.020> he<00:04:30.230> has<00:04:30.320> Nexus<00:04:30.740> after<00:04:31.010> his

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
first I think he has Nexus after his

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.720 
first I think he has Nexus after his
cannons<00:04:31.430> there<00:04:33.340> anyway<00:04:34.340> we're<00:04:34.490> probably

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
cannons there anyway we're probably

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.030 
cannons there anyway we're probably
gonna<00:04:34.910> see<00:04:35.120> is<00:04:35.389> shine<00:04:36.200> you<00:04:36.590> know<00:04:36.710> he's

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
gonna see is shine you know he's

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.530 
gonna see is shine you know he's
probably<00:04:37.280> gonna<00:04:37.520> switch<00:04:37.940> up<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:38.300> get<00:04:38.419> some

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
probably gonna switch up and get some

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.720 
probably gonna switch up and get some
drones<00:04:38.900> because<00:04:39.650> these<00:04:39.830> probes<00:04:40.340> out<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.639> his

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
drones because these probes out of his

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.770 
drones because these probes out of his
base<00:04:40.910> so<00:04:41.090> he's<00:04:41.300> not<00:04:41.450> going<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.600> know<00:04:41.690> if

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
base so he's not going to know if

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.159 
base so he's not going to know if
there's<00:04:41.930> more<00:04:42.050> serling's<00:04:42.470> coming<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:45.050> know

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
there's more serling's coming you know

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.240 
there's more serling's coming you know
that<00:04:45.320> seems<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.680> be<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.800> kind<00:04:45.950> of<00:04:46.040> thing<00:04:46.220> you

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
that seems to be the kind of thing you

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.040 
that seems to be the kind of thing you
could<00:04:46.430> be<00:04:46.550> doing<00:04:46.700> although<00:04:47.330> who<00:04:47.510> knows<00:04:47.540> I<00:04:47.900> mean

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
could be doing although who knows I mean

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.290 
could be doing although who knows I mean
actually<00:04:48.740> in<00:04:48.800> this<00:04:48.830> kind<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.130> situation<00:04:49.250> up<00:04:49.760> 10

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
actually in this kind of situation up 10

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.150 
actually in this kind of situation up 10
I<00:04:50.510> wouldn't<00:04:50.990> be<00:04:51.050> surprised<00:04:51.380> if<00:04:51.560> shine<00:04:51.770> decides

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
I wouldn't be surprised if shine decides

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.030 
I wouldn't be surprised if shine decides
to<00:04:52.280> do<00:04:52.430> try<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.240> zergling<00:04:53.660> run<00:04:53.960> by<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.380> just<00:04:54.860> get

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
to do try a zergling run by and just get

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.010 
to do try a zergling run by and just get
some<00:04:55.070> masters<00:04:55.520> Earthlings<00:04:55.880> and<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.900> know

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
some masters Earthlings and you know

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.310 
some masters Earthlings and you know
tries<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.970> stomp<00:04:58.970> down<00:04:59.090> on<00:04:59.270> bc<00:04:59.600> with<00:04:59.750> a<00:04:59.780> kind<00:05:00.260> of

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
tries to stomp down on bc with a kind of

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.710 
tries to stomp down on bc with a kind of
a<00:05:00.410> timing<00:05:00.800> thing<00:05:00.830> get<00:05:01.639> to<00:05:02.060> get<00:05:02.360> that<00:05:02.540> third

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
a timing thing get to get that third

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.860 
a timing thing get to get that third
hatchery<00:05:03.110> and<00:05:03.139> then<00:05:04.030> you<00:05:05.030> know<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.570> try<00:05:05.720> and

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
hatchery and then you know to try and

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.050 
hatchery and then you know to try and
mass<00:05:06.080> ling<00:05:06.410> him<00:05:06.530> but<00:05:07.130> we'll<00:05:07.310> see<00:05:07.490> be<00:05:07.729> sooo<00:05:07.910> is

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
mass ling him but we'll see be sooo is

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.340 
mass ling him but we'll see be sooo is
setting<00:05:08.330> his<00:05:08.450> probe<00:05:08.720> around<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.110> long<00:05:09.320> way

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
setting his probe around the long way

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.530 
setting his probe around the long way
just<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.770> try<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.160> somehow<00:05:11.000> get<00:05:11.240> asked<00:05:11.450> out

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
just to try and somehow get asked out

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.570 
just to try and somehow get asked out
and<00:05:11.750> like<00:05:11.990> i<00:05:12.080> said<00:05:12.139> really<00:05:12.889> likes<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:13.250> scout

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
and like i said really likes that scout

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.659 
and like i said really likes that scout
he's<00:05:14.090> gonna<00:05:14.270> try<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:15.010> actually<00:05:16.010> he<00:05:16.400> may<00:05:16.610> have

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
he's gonna try and actually he may have

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:17.770 
he's gonna try and actually he may have
been<00:05:16.790> actually<00:05:16.910> looking<00:05:17.360> for<00:05:17.540> hidden

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
been actually looking for hidden

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.290 
been actually looking for hidden
expansions<00:05:18.410> actually<00:05:18.830> so<00:05:19.760> that<00:05:19.880> my<00:05:20.000> bandwagon

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
expansions actually so that my bandwagon

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.590 
expansions actually so that my bandwagon
is<00:05:20.660> probe<00:05:20.900> down<00:05:21.050> that<00:05:21.260> way<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:23.300> gotta<00:05:23.450> get

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
is probe down that way you gotta get

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.090 
is probe down that way you gotta get
intercepted<00:05:24.080> by<00:05:24.290> those<00:05:24.470> circling<00:05:24.830> so<00:05:24.950> he's

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
intercepted by those circling so he's

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.950

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
get asked out on the main base he's just

gonna go ahead and do his thing and hope
everything<00:05:31.220> plays<00:05:31.400> out<00:05:31.580> okay<00:05:33.160> whoa<00:05:34.160> is<00:05:34.460> that

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
everything plays out okay whoa is that

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.490 
everything plays out okay whoa is that
okay<00:05:35.060> yeah<00:05:35.210> so<00:05:35.600> that<00:05:35.750> mineral<00:05:36.050> spot<00:05:36.289> has<00:05:36.470> a

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
okay yeah so that mineral spot has a

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.779 
okay yeah so that mineral spot has a
hundred<00:05:36.830> myrtles<00:05:37.100> they<00:05:37.220> just<00:05:37.400> pointed<00:05:37.520> at

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
hundred myrtles they just pointed at

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.490 
hundred myrtles they just pointed at
that<00:05:37.940> so<00:05:38.180> that<00:05:38.330> i<00:05:38.660> mentioned<00:05:39.169> that<00:05:39.229> in<00:05:39.380> the

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
that so that i mentioned that in the

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.590 
that so that i mentioned that in the
first<00:05:40.010> set<00:05:40.310> between<00:05:40.640> really<00:05:41.150> in<00:05:41.240> shine<00:05:41.450> how

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
first set between really in shine how

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.370 
first set between really in shine how
there's<00:05:41.780> a<00:05:41.840> mineral<00:05:42.140> patch<00:05:42.320> that<00:05:43.100> is<00:05:43.160> um

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
there's a mineral patch that is um

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.350 
there's a mineral patch that is um
smaller<00:05:45.380> and<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:46.310> if<00:05:46.580> you<00:05:46.640> combine<00:05:46.850> that<00:05:47.060> out

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
smaller and so if you combine that out

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.909 
smaller and so if you combine that out
maybe<00:05:47.570> you<00:05:47.780> need<00:05:47.930> to<00:05:47.990> mind<00:05:48.169> that<00:05:48.380> out<00:05:48.530> too<00:05:48.770> long

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
maybe you need to mind that out too long

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.529 
maybe you need to mind that out too long
to<00:05:49.220> open<00:05:49.340> up<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.700> gap<00:05:49.850> to<00:05:49.880> get<00:05:50.180> behind<00:05:50.300> your

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
to open up the gap to get behind your

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.600 
to open up the gap to get behind your
mineral<00:05:50.810> line<00:05:50.960> so<00:05:51.919> 100<00:05:52.280> mils<00:05:52.430> is<00:05:52.580> a

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
mineral line so 100 mils is a

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.010 
mineral line so 100 mils is a
substantial<00:05:53.210> amount<00:05:53.270> of<00:05:53.419> minerals<00:05:53.660> fish<00:05:53.840> even

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
substantial amount of minerals fish even

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.960 
substantial amount of minerals fish even
my<00:05:54.229> expansion<00:05:54.919> for<00:05:55.039> a<00:05:55.130> while<00:05:55.340> to<00:05:55.490> get<00:05:55.729> rid<00:05:55.910> of

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
my expansion for a while to get rid of

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.260 
my expansion for a while to get rid of
that<00:05:56.030> mineral<00:05:56.330> typically<00:05:56.900> oh<00:05:57.970> actually<00:05:58.970> all

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
that mineral typically oh actually all

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.950 
that mineral typically oh actually all
those<00:05:59.600> mineral<00:05:59.930> patches<00:06:00.289> are<00:06:00.440> low<00:06:01.840> that<00:06:02.840> one

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
those mineral patches are low that one

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.620 
those mineral patches are low that one
has<00:06:03.080> two<00:06:03.260> thousand<00:06:03.740> other<00:06:03.889> one<00:06:04.039> at<00:06:04.130> 1701<00:06:05.090> had

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
has two thousand other one at 1701 had

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.120 
has two thousand other one at 1701 had
like<00:06:05.810> six<00:06:06.229> hundred<00:06:06.620> or<00:06:06.710> something<00:06:06.979> like<00:06:07.070> that

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
like six hundred or something like that

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.040 
like six hundred or something like that
so<00:06:07.820> those<00:06:07.970> mineral<00:06:08.240> patches<00:06:08.539> actually<00:06:08.840> mined

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
so those mineral patches actually mined

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.420 
so those mineral patches actually mined
out<00:06:09.139> pretty<00:06:09.350> quickly<00:06:09.590> so<00:06:09.710> that's<00:06:09.950> interesting

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
out pretty quickly so that's interesting

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.730 
out pretty quickly so that's interesting
um<00:06:10.970> what<00:06:11.389> I'm<00:06:11.510> going<00:06:11.960> to<00:06:11.990> do<00:06:12.139> like<00:06:12.410> I<00:06:12.440> said<00:06:12.650> I'm

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
um what I'm going to do like I said I'm

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.930 
um what I'm going to do like I said I'm
going<00:06:12.830> to<00:06:12.919> do<00:06:13.010> some<00:06:13.280> at<00:06:13.430> previous<00:06:13.760> that<00:06:13.850> I'm

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
going to do some at previous that I'm

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.760 
going to do some at previous that I'm
actually<00:06:14.060> going<00:06:14.270> to<00:06:14.360> try<00:06:14.510> and<00:06:14.539> go<00:06:14.770> download

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
actually going to try and go download

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.110 
actually going to try and go download
maps<00:06:16.039> and<00:06:16.250> go<00:06:16.340> ahead<00:06:16.460> and<00:06:16.580> play<00:06:16.729> some<00:06:16.789> games

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
maps and go ahead and play some games

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.000 
maps and go ahead and play some games
and<00:06:17.330> really<00:06:18.050> mess<00:06:18.260> around<00:06:18.410> with<00:06:18.650> a<00:06:18.680> really

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
and really mess around with a really

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.550 
and really mess around with a really
good<00:06:19.250> feel<00:06:19.460> for<00:06:19.700> for<00:06:20.660> the<00:06:20.750> quirks<00:06:21.020> of<00:06:21.020> the<00:06:21.350> maps

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
good feel for for the quirks of the maps

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.740 
good feel for for the quirks of the maps
but<00:06:22.520> in<00:06:22.669> the<00:06:22.729> meantime<00:06:22.910> piece<00:06:23.210> of<00:06:23.360> going<00:06:23.510> for<00:06:23.720> a

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
but in the meantime piece of going for a

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.909 
but in the meantime piece of going for a
pretty<00:06:23.960> similar<00:06:24.320> thing<00:06:24.500> to<00:06:24.530> what<00:06:24.620> he<00:06:24.770> did<00:06:24.889> last

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
pretty similar thing to what he did last

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.219 
pretty similar thing to what he did last
time<00:06:25.280> I'm<00:06:25.820> going<00:06:26.450> for<00:06:26.600> the<00:06:26.630> Stargate<00:06:27.110> the

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
time I'm going for the Stargate the

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.610 
time I'm going for the Stargate the
Citadel<00:06:28.120> last<00:06:29.120> time<00:06:29.270> we<00:06:29.450> saw<00:06:29.630> him<00:06:29.750> get<00:06:30.410> a<00:06:30.470> bunch

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
Citadel last time we saw him get a bunch

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.409 
Citadel last time we saw him get a bunch
of<00:06:30.710> Corsairs<00:06:31.190> trying<00:06:31.550> to<00:06:31.610> move<00:06:31.729> out<00:06:31.849> with<00:06:32.030> a<00:06:32.060> a

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
of Corsairs trying to move out with a a

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.779 
of Corsairs trying to move out with a a
Coursera<00:06:33.169> zealot<00:06:33.560> and<00:06:33.680> a<00:06:33.830> single<00:06:34.130> Archon<00:06:34.460> army

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:34.789 
Coursera zealot and a single Archon army

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:36.230 
Coursera zealot and a single Archon army
and<00:06:34.970> do<00:06:35.510> it

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
and do it

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.689 
and do it
Tommy<00:06:36.900> pushed<00:06:37.199> that<00:06:37.349> way<00:06:37.530> didn't<00:06:38.400> quite<00:06:38.490> work

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
Tommy pushed that way didn't quite work

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.839 
Tommy pushed that way didn't quite work
out<00:06:38.880> for<00:06:39.120> him<00:06:39.180> and<00:06:39.710> I'm<00:06:40.710> still<00:06:41.460> reeling<00:06:41.669> from

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:41.849 
out for him and I'm still reeling from

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:43.189 
out for him and I'm still reeling from
the<00:06:42.060> fact<00:06:42.240> that<00:06:42.330> he<00:06:42.419> gave<00:06:42.630> up<00:06:42.810> that<00:06:42.960> game<00:06:43.169> I

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
the fact that he gave up that game I

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.540 
the fact that he gave up that game I
thought<00:06:43.560> he<00:06:43.680> was<00:06:43.740> still<00:06:43.889> able<00:06:44.069> to<00:06:44.220> push<00:06:44.370> back

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
thought he was still able to push back

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.240 
thought he was still able to push back
that<00:06:44.759> that<00:06:45.120> um<00:06:45.389> that<00:06:46.050> attack<00:06:46.380> having<00:06:47.069> killed

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
that that um that attack having killed

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.830 
that that um that attack having killed
off<00:06:47.430> so<00:06:47.669> many<00:06:47.759> drones<00:06:48.060> how<00:06:48.300> to<00:06:48.360> kill<00:06:48.569> off<00:06:48.720> an

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
off so many drones how to kill off an

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.120 
off so many drones how to kill off an
entire<00:06:49.110> expansion<00:06:49.500> I<00:06:49.710> thought<00:06:49.860> he<00:06:49.949> was<00:06:50.039> gonna

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
entire expansion I thought he was gonna

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.610 
entire expansion I thought he was gonna
push<00:06:50.490> that<00:06:50.639> back<00:06:50.880> and<00:06:51.180> and<00:06:52.080> take<00:06:52.319> the<00:06:52.440> game<00:06:52.590> I

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
push that back and and take the game I

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.200 
push that back and and take the game I
mean<00:06:52.889> why<00:06:53.009> couldn't<00:06:53.069> he<00:06:53.340> just<00:06:53.490> sacrifice<00:06:54.000> as

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
mean why couldn't he just sacrifice as

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.059 
mean why couldn't he just sacrifice as
natural<00:06:54.599> and<00:06:54.750> go<00:06:54.840> to<00:06:54.900> base<00:06:55.199> maybe<00:06:55.800> he<00:06:55.979> had

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:56.069 
natural and go to base maybe he had

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:57.710 
natural and go to base maybe he had
mined<00:06:56.280> out<00:06:56.430> of<00:06:56.550> his<00:06:56.639> main<00:06:56.819> base<00:06:57.030> and<00:06:57.300> so<00:06:57.509> he

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
mined out of his main base and so he

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.559 
mined out of his main base and so he
wasn't<00:06:57.930> going<00:06:58.139> to<00:06:58.199> be<00:06:58.259> able<00:06:58.349> to<00:06:59.300> keep<00:07:00.300> mining

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:00.569 
wasn't going to be able to keep mining

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:01.939 
wasn't going to be able to keep mining
for<00:07:00.780> his<00:07:00.900> main<00:07:01.050> base<00:07:01.229> something<00:07:01.680> I<00:07:01.740> don't<00:07:01.889> know

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949 
for his main base something I don't know

pretty<00:07:14.130> much<00:07:14.280> the<00:07:14.400> neo<00:07:14.550> Sauron<00:07:14.940> bill<00:07:16.009> spire

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:17.009 
pretty much the neo Sauron bill spire

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:18.499 
pretty much the neo Sauron bill spire
going<00:07:17.280> up<00:07:17.400> at<00:07:17.550> that<00:07:17.639> third<00:07:17.849> expansion<00:07:18.180> so

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:18.509 
going up at that third expansion so

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:19.760 
going up at that third expansion so
that's<00:07:18.690> actually<00:07:18.990> going<00:07:19.080> to<00:07:19.169> throw<00:07:19.319> be<00:07:19.500> so<00:07:19.650> off

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
that's actually going to throw be so off

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.110 
that's actually going to throw be so off
a<00:07:19.800> little<00:07:20.009> bit<00:07:20.159> if<00:07:20.669> he<00:07:20.789> doesn't<00:07:20.970> know<00:07:21.090> that

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
a little bit if he doesn't know that

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.110 
a little bit if he doesn't know that
expansion<00:07:21.599> is<00:07:21.840> there<00:07:22.080> I'm<00:07:22.530> sure<00:07:22.740> he<00:07:22.860> knows<00:07:23.120> the

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
expansion is there I'm sure he knows the

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.270 
expansion is there I'm sure he knows the
the<00:07:24.840> mineral<00:07:25.229> location<00:07:25.740> is<00:07:25.830> there<00:07:25.979> he's<00:07:26.130> going

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
the mineral location is there he's going

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.439 
the mineral location is there he's going
to<00:07:26.340> check<00:07:26.520> their<00:07:26.729> with<00:07:26.849> this<00:07:27.030> with<00:07:27.300> his

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:27.449 
to check their with this with his

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:29.570 
to check their with this with his
corsair<00:07:27.930> but<00:07:28.650> in<00:07:28.770> the<00:07:28.830> meantime<00:07:29.009> he<00:07:29.280> does<00:07:29.460> not

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 
corsair but in the meantime he does not

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.580 
corsair but in the meantime he does not
see<00:07:29.849> the<00:07:29.970> spire<00:07:30.240> in<00:07:30.509> the<00:07:30.630> natural<00:07:31.139> or<00:07:31.289> the<00:07:31.409> main

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
see the spire in the natural or the main

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.290 
see the spire in the natural or the main
and<00:07:31.919> so<00:07:32.430> they<00:07:32.550> might<00:07:32.669> be<00:07:32.819> wondering<00:07:33.060> what's

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 
and so they might be wondering what's

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.550 
and so they might be wondering what's
going<00:07:33.479> on<00:07:33.599> here<00:07:33.780> although<00:07:33.990> he<00:07:34.110> must<00:07:34.319> assume

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 
going on here although he must assume

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.629 
going on here although he must assume
that<00:07:34.620> there's<00:07:34.949> some<00:07:35.069> kind<00:07:35.220> of<00:07:35.250> tech<00:07:35.430> at<00:07:35.580> the

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 
that there's some kind of tech at the

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:38.719 
that there's some kind of tech at the
other<00:07:35.759> one<00:07:35.909> at<00:07:36.509> the<00:07:36.659> other<00:07:37.280> at<00:07:38.280> the<00:07:38.430> other<00:07:38.550> base

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:38.729 
other one at the other at the other base

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:40.520 
other one at the other at the other base
he's<00:07:39.360> not<00:07:39.509> going<00:07:39.630> to<00:07:39.659> know<00:07:39.780> if<00:07:39.870> it's<00:07:40.020> a<00:07:40.169> spire

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
he's not going to know if it's a spire

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.550 
he's not going to know if it's a spire
tech<00:07:40.770> or<00:07:40.949> if<00:07:41.070> it's<00:07:41.219> a<00:07:41.430> you<00:07:41.969> know<00:07:42.380> needless<00:07:43.380> tech

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 
tech or if it's a you know needless tech

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.140 
tech or if it's a you know needless tech
there's<00:07:43.770> this<00:07:43.919> fire<00:07:44.159> that<00:07:44.759> is<00:07:44.849> gonna<00:07:45.000> be<00:07:45.090> able

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.150 
there's this fire that is gonna be able

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.120 
there's this fire that is gonna be able
to<00:07:45.270> more<00:07:45.449> some<00:07:46.380> skirts<00:07:46.680> but<00:07:46.800> it<00:07:46.919> looks<00:07:47.099> like

he's going to lose another overlord

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.570 
he's going to lose another overlord
before<00:07:50.039> he's<00:07:50.430> able<00:07:50.490> to<00:07:52.280> deal<00:07:53.280> with<00:07:53.490> that
