00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.310
 welcome i am joshua and today we are 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.589
 here to understand how to update spybot 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.790
 to the latest version available 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.340
 using thatcher string 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.450
 everything we need is available 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.179
 on the page that I will leave you in 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.369
 description or the waste file 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.100
 thatcher the update files that 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.740
 will be updated precisely as 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.500
 the development goes on and the jar file of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 spybot to version 16 49 that there 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.359
 will serve to be able to carry out 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.949
 upgrade with thatcher string 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.250
 once you have downloaded everything you create one 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.829
 folder and enter all files 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.309
 so you should have the string 16 49 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.829
 this and update point file 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.440
 bps that I renamed spybot com is the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.300
 string file thatcher to perform 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.600
 the update we should simply 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.510
 create this run bot 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.730
 how do we just create a new one 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.930
 text document that you can call it 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.469
 how do you want in this case I have it 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.949
 called plan and inside it will go 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.340
 written this string or java minus 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.180
 jar the name of thatcher string 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.159
 obviously with the extension the name of the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.659
 file on which we want to apply 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.759
 updating 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.369
 so in this case version 16 49 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.470
 i spybots the number the file it contains 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.960
 update as we have seen 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.659
 here he renamed it spybot bam e 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.360
 obviously with its extension is the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.400
 name of the file that will have to exit once 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.890
 updated and in this case it 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.290
 renamed final spybot of course 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.270
 also with the extension once 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.960
 written it all down and make sure you have it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.600
 written well you just make file save 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.560
 with name go on save as all 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.740
 file and in the bottom write to it point bat e 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.079
 save it once you have created it 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.670
 ram point bat to upgrade now 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.920
 all you have to do is run a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.290
 double click on run to start it 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.590
 as you have seen a quick one will open 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.259
 window cmd windows is once 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.929
 fact that the updated giar will be created 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.239
 now with this you can update e 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.360
 start your multiplayer servers that 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.690
 obviously the plugins will support there is a 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.950
 quick test to see if it works like 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.260
 you can see all the files come 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.170
 created correctly and if we go to 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.780
 write the version command you can 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.489
 see that we will have our spybot 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.620
 completely updated 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.480
 obviously this procedure is valid for 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.800
 all future updates 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.989
 until at least they continue 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.209
 update it in this way is the string 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.100
