00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
about for this year is corn there has

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.170 
about for this year is corn there has

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
been a GMO variety of sweet corn on the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.500 
been a GMO variety of sweet corn on the
market<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:52.020> years<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:53.300> Monsanto<00:00:54.300> is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
market for years but Monsanto is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
market for years but Monsanto is
introducing<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.289> variety<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.890> year<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.460> is

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
introducing a variety this year and is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.420 
introducing a variety this year and is
hoping<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.449> take<00:00:57.600> over<00:00:57.809> about<00:00:58.079> 40%<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
hoping to take over about 40% of the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
hoping to take over about 40% of the
sweet<00:00:59.670> corn<00:00:59.850> market<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.480> summer<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.289> that's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
sweet corn market this summer so that's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.590 
sweet corn market this summer so that's
going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.800> become<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.489> very<00:01:02.760> high<00:01:03.000> risk<00:01:03.239> high

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
going to become a very high risk high

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.320 
going to become a very high risk high
profile<00:01:04.110> crop<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.710> summer<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.729> grew<00:01:06.060> corn

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
profile crop this summer we grew corn

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.630 
profile crop this summer we grew corn
last<00:01:06.630> year<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.290> did<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> hybrid<00:01:08.130> variety

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
last year and we did a hybrid variety

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.460 
last year and we did a hybrid variety
but<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.360> we're<00:01:09.510> thinking<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.020> year<00:01:10.260> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
but what we're thinking this year is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.190 
but what we're thinking this year is
that<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.979> will<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.580> some<00:01:11.970> open<00:01:12.450> pollinated

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that we will get some open pollinated

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.219 
that we will get some open pollinated
certified<00:01:14.189> organic<00:01:14.520> corn<00:01:15.240> seeds<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.930> start

certified organic corn seeds and start

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.840 
certified organic corn seeds and start
growing<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.369> save<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
growing that out so that we can save the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.960 
growing that out so that we can save the
seeds<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.420> make<00:01:19.020> sure<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:20.100> non-gmo

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970

non-gmo<00:02:53.380> project<00:02:53.620> verified<00:02:53.860> eggs<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:54.760> that

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
non-gmo project verified eggs so that

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.530 
non-gmo project verified eggs so that
they'll<00:02:55.090> be<00:02:55.120> available<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.170> grocery<00:02:56.350> stores

thanks to the work that the non-gmo

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.520 
thanks to the work that the non-gmo
project<00:03:09.790> has<00:03:10.209> done<00:03:10.420> over<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.900> last<00:03:11.050> five

project<00:03:14.890> verified<00:03:15.190> options<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:16.989> when

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
project verified options and so when

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.350 
project verified options and so when
we're<00:03:17.440> buying<00:03:17.680> packaged<00:03:18.250> foods<00:03:18.640> we<00:03:18.940> look<00:03:19.150> for

so that we know that chemical pesticides
and<00:03:24.970> fertilizers<00:03:25.570> have<00:03:25.840> been<00:03:26.019> avoided<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.620> we

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
and fertilizers have been avoided and we

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.009 
and fertilizers have been avoided and we
also<00:03:27.370> look<00:03:27.730> for<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.329> non-gmo<00:03:28.780> project
