00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
fiberglass yacht and the one behind me

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.990 
fiberglass yacht and the one behind me
has<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.220> particularly<00:00:05.819> bad<00:00:06.029> case<00:00:07.849> scrape<00:00:08.849> away

the<00:00:09.120> anti<00:00:09.480> foul<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.230> can<00:00:10.380> see<00:00:10.530> the

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
the anti foul and you can see the

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.490 
the anti foul and you can see the
problem<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.599> the<00:00:12.599> shelf<00:00:12.870> coat<00:00:13.110> has<00:00:13.259> allows

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
problem is the shelf coat has allows

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.410 
problem is the shelf coat has allows

coat is stripped away and the substrate
measured<00:00:35.880> for<00:00:36.120> moisture<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:37.079> reading

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
measured for moisture this reading

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.580 
measured for moisture this reading
should<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:38.010> fine<00:00:38.660> what<00:00:39.660> vacuum<00:00:40.140> pads<00:00:40.410> are

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
should be fine what vacuum pads are

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.530 
should be fine what vacuum pads are
attached<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> hull<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.820> suck<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
attached to the hull and suck out the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.150 
attached to the hull and suck out the
moisture<00:00:42.690> until<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> hull<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.829> dry<00:00:44.100> enough

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
moisture until the hull is dry enough

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.869 
moisture until the hull is dry enough
for<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.850> completely<00:00:45.360> new<00:00:45.600> outer<00:00:46.230> layer<00:00:46.879> it

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
for a completely new outer layer it

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.950 
for a completely new outer layer it
takes<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.149> lot<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.300> time<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.750> expertise

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.570 

so<00:00:53.960> what<00:00:54.110> we<00:00:54.230> need<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.380> do<00:00:54.620> then<00:00:54.860> is<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:55.400> put

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
so what we need to do then is to put

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.700 
so what we need to do then is to put
some<00:00:55.850> sort<00:00:56.090> of<00:00:56.240> layer<00:00:56.540> this<00:00:57.020> impervious<00:00:57.680> to

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
some sort of layer this impervious to

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.970 
some sort of layer this impervious to
water<00:00:58.010> over<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.060> top<00:00:59.090> of<00:00:59.540> our<00:00:59.990> polyester<00:01:00.680> and

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
water over the top of our polyester and

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.329 
water over the top of our polyester and
the<00:01:01.370> answer<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:02.270> this<00:01:02.570> stuff<00:01:02.870> it's<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:03.860> two<00:01:04.040> pack

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
the answer is this stuff it's a two pack

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.870 
the answer is this stuff it's a two pack
epoxy<00:01:05.300> called<00:01:06.110> gel<00:01:06.350> shield<00:01:06.620> 200<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.760> we're

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
epoxy called gel shield 200 and we're

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.650 
epoxy called gel shield 200 and we're
going<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.060> see<00:01:08.240> how<00:01:08.360> easy<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:08.750> is<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.320> put<00:01:09.500> on<00:01:10.660> to

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
going to see how easy it is to put on to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.600 
going to see how easy it is to put on to
actually<00:01:11.930> apply<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.350> gel<00:01:12.800> shield<00:01:13.160> you'll

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
actually apply the gel shield you'll

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.460 
actually apply the gel shield you'll
need<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:13.880> get<00:01:14.000> rid<00:01:14.240> of<00:01:14.540> all<00:01:14.900> your<00:01:14.930> old

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
need to get rid of all your old

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.770 
need to get rid of all your old
antifouling<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:16.940> might<00:01:17.210> be<00:01:17.360> timely

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
antifouling and it might be timely

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.109 
antifouling and it might be timely
anyway<00:01:18.110> because<00:01:18.290> as<00:01:18.560> we<00:01:18.680> can<00:01:18.830> see<00:01:19.040> this<00:01:19.250> one<00:01:19.490> is

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
anyway because as we can see this one is

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.600 
anyway because as we can see this one is
actually<00:01:20.320> long<00:01:21.320> overdue<00:01:21.560> for<00:01:21.860> replacing<00:01:22.130> the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
actually long overdue for replacing the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.310 
actually long overdue for replacing the
easiest<00:01:25.610> way<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.820> remove<00:01:26.180> anti<00:01:26.509> foul<00:01:26.750> is<00:01:27.110> with

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
easiest way to remove anti foul is with

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.920 
easiest way to remove anti foul is with
a<00:01:27.350> professional<00:01:27.950> slurry<00:01:28.340> blast<00:01:28.729> your<00:01:29.720> boat

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
a professional slurry blast your boat

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.630 
a professional slurry blast your boat
will<00:01:30.050> be<00:01:30.110> curtain'd<00:01:30.590> off<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.130> protect<00:01:31.430> your

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
will be curtain'd off and protect your

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.150 
will be curtain'd off and protect your
neighbors<00:01:32.080> bear<00:01:33.080> in<00:01:33.200> mind<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.530> not<00:01:33.740> all<00:01:33.800> boat

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
neighbors bear in mind that not all boat

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.950 
neighbors bear in mind that not all boat
guards<00:01:34.550> will<00:01:34.820> actually<00:01:35.119> allow<00:01:35.390> slurry

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
guards will actually allow slurry

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.889 
guards will actually allow slurry
blasting<00:01:36.440> on<00:01:36.590> their<00:01:36.770> premises<00:01:37.750> this<00:01:38.750> is

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
blasting on their premises this is

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.670 
blasting on their premises this is
because<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.649> slurry<00:01:39.979> which<00:01:40.940> is<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.090> mixture<00:01:41.509> of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
because the slurry which is a mixture of

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.880 
because the slurry which is a mixture of
olivine<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:42.920> sharp<00:01:43.790> sand<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.930> actually<00:01:45.440> very

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
olivine and sharp sand is actually very

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.650 
olivine and sharp sand is actually very
powerful<00:01:46.160> stuff<00:01:46.670> when<00:01:47.090> mixed<00:01:47.360> with<00:01:47.390> water

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
powerful stuff when mixed with water
