going<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:58.579> want<00:01:58.789> to<00:01:58.850> just<00:01:59.030> loosely<00:01:59.469> lock<00:02:00.469> it

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
going to want to just loosely lock it

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:17.390 
going to want to just loosely lock it
down<00:02:00.799> just<00:02:01.219> snug

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.360 

okay<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.459> if<00:02:18.579> I<00:02:18.640> using<00:02:18.909> the<00:02:18.969> jointer<00:02:19.209> pal<00:02:19.450> in

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
okay so if I using the jointer pal in

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.319 
okay so if I using the jointer pal in
conjunction<00:02:21.370> with<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.760> dial<00:02:22.150> indicator

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
conjunction with the dial indicator

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.050 
conjunction with the dial indicator
we're<00:02:22.840> able<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.260> find<00:02:24.099> top<00:02:24.370> dead<00:02:24.549> center<00:02:24.909> and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
we're able to find top dead center and

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.929 
we're able to find top dead center and
keep<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.810> jointer<00:02:26.049> knife<00:02:26.370> flush<00:02:27.370> with<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
keep the jointer knife flush with the

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.629 
keep the jointer knife flush with the
outfeed<00:02:28.510> side<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.019> jointer<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.549> can

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
outfeed side of the jointer so you can

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.740 
outfeed side of the jointer so you can
see<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.909> magnetic<00:02:31.799> back<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:33.040> magnets<00:02:33.400> are

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
see the magnetic back the magnets are

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.300 
see the magnetic back the magnets are
pulling<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.840> knife<00:02:34.959> up<00:02:35.349> is<00:02:35.650> exactly<00:02:35.829> what<00:02:36.280> I

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
pulling the knife up is exactly what I

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.379 
pulling the knife up is exactly what I
want<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.639> do<00:02:38.819> okay<00:02:39.819> because<00:02:39.939> we're<00:02:40.209> using

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389 
want it to do okay because we're using

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.629 
want it to do okay because we're using
this<00:02:40.599> magnetic<00:02:40.989> jig<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:41.980> jointer<00:02:42.310> pal<00:02:42.459> we

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
this magnetic jig this jointer pal we

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.179 
this magnetic jig this jointer pal we
know<00:02:42.849> that<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.930> knives<00:02:44.109> are<00:02:44.290> flush<00:02:44.620> with<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
know that the knives are flush with the

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.009 
know that the knives are flush with the
outfeed<00:02:45.609> table<00:02:45.969> and<00:02:46.150> we<00:02:46.389> know<00:02:46.510> what<00:02:46.689> we

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
outfeed table and we know what we

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.509 
outfeed table and we know what we
already<00:02:47.169> know<00:02:47.379> we're<00:02:47.620> top<00:02:47.919> dead<00:02:48.069> center<00:02:48.370> is

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
already know we're top dead center is

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.920 
already know we're top dead center is
because<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:48.849> determined<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.329> earlier<00:02:49.719> on

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
because we determined that earlier on

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.110 
because we determined that earlier on
the<00:02:50.109> cutter<00:02:50.319> head<00:02:50.500> service<00:02:50.919> with<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.939> dial

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
the cutter head service with the dial

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.209 
the cutter head service with the dial
indicator<00:02:52.299> so<00:02:53.230> now<00:02:53.349> all<00:02:53.530> we<00:02:53.650> need<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:53.829> do<00:02:54.010> now

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.219 
indicator so now all we need to do now

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.619 
indicator so now all we need to do now
is<00:02:54.459> position<00:02:54.939> the<00:02:54.969> edge<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.359> the<00:02:55.449> knife

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
is position the edge of the knife

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.860 
is position the edge of the knife
underneath<00:02:56.469> of<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:57.819> plunger<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.419> dial

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
underneath of the plunger of the dial

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.869 
underneath of the plunger of the dial
indicator<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.620> we'll<00:03:00.099> know<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.579> nut

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
indicator and we'll know that the nut

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.610 
indicator and we'll know that the nut
the<00:03:01.000> tip<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.329> knife<00:03:01.540> or<00:03:02.169> the<00:03:02.290> edge<00:03:02.379> of<00:03:02.500> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
the tip of the knife or the edge of the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.039 
the tip of the knife or the edge of the
knife<00:03:02.769> is<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.040> top<00:03:03.430> dead<00:03:03.639> center<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.180> once<00:03:04.930> we

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
knife is that top dead center so once we

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.539 
knife is that top dead center so once we
do<00:03:05.169> that<00:03:05.349> we<00:03:05.500> can<00:03:05.650> go<00:03:05.769> ahead<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.189> just<00:03:06.310> tighten

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
do that we can go ahead and just tighten

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:37.920 
do that we can go ahead and just tighten
down<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:08.230> knife<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.919> cutter<00:03:09.099> head

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.619 

okay<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:38.680> once<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:38.950> get<00:03:39.129> two<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:40.150> bolts

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
okay so once I get two of the bolts

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.720 
okay so once I get two of the bolts
tightened<00:03:41.170> down<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.620> go<00:03:42.129> I'd<00:03:42.370> like<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.519> go<00:03:42.670> ahead

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
tightened down I go I'd like to go ahead

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
underneath of the plunger and see if it

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.610 
underneath of the plunger and see if it
reads<00:04:42.510> zero<00:04:43.370> at<00:04:44.370> top<00:04:45.150> dead<00:04:45.330> center<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:45.900> it

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
reads zero at top dead center and it

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.510 
reads zero at top dead center and it
does<00:04:48.170> okay<00:04:49.170> so<00:04:49.230> thanks<00:04:49.710> for<00:04:49.770> watching<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:50.340> hope
