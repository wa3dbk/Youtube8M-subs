than other sports in the United States

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.430 
than other sports in the United States
because<00:01:49.090> it's<00:01:49.300> it's<00:01:49.570> it's<00:01:50.020> almost<00:01:50.260> like<00:01:50.410> a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
because it's it's it's almost like a
