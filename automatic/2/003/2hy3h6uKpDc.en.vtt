00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.460
 Yesterday, you saw here part of the second day of our journey. 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.259
 Pantanal South-Mato Grosso 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.570
 until the more than 100 miles of pure emotion 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.219
 asks for fine contemplation 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.519
 we passed dozens of farms 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.650
 and in each of these venues the story to tell 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.329
 pioneer story 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.720
 and a lot of bravery and updating of this part of the Pantanal 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.609
 did you work late? 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.589
 your arrival at Old Port 10 of Ox Cart 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.180
 to greet the targets and after opening a shop after opened 4 2 the two men 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.160
 already arrived here integrated with the same virus 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.100
 and was born with a typically Pantanal population are these men who 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.540
 builds from the raising of oxen and cows 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.910
 this breeding of horses 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.040
 of their food prices 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.220
 the construction of their homes the true Pantanal identity 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.160
 of the entity that has its greatest expression in the daily deal of the place I 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.470
 I loved the other one here 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.890
 I already lived in rio de janeiro 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.080
 the demon of the state and another five months of the year 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.220
 and are these natural beauties of the pantaneiro man 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.880
 which attracts more and more tourists with each passing day 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.620
 to welcome them are created new and modern lodges 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.800
 some until we are surprised after twenty he traveled through the wetland 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.520
 if we are all 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.600
 and tired 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.160
 we have not finally arrived 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.900
 a beautiful pajamas cave hostel what you would do 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.880
 the airport reaction field 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.490
 now the place is very beautiful 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.160
 If it will happen from now on, come with me. 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
 which is illegal in the middle of the wetland 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.380
 I believe he is charged today. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.180
 tourism emsetur that ecotourism 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.080
 it represents today a form of 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.660
 encourage 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.209
 the pantaneiro man with the permanence here 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.679
 here in this region 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.619
 and is a form of environmental preservation as well 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.029
 because ecotourism it encourages 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.819
 but I do not 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.390
 sustainable tourism is not 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.269
 and it was here in the carburet pousada we spent the night of the second day of travel 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.849
 It was so delicious that at the end of the day it was difficult to choose the best 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.139
 image of porto santo 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.419
 so the delay provided squares the lush nature of the wetland so 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:35.950
 it's not possible 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.229
 first people 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:39.319
 the effort to walk the whole 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.239
 the fun one 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.890
 and appeared at 20 15 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.190
 a aline pellegrino is spoken in africa we show in the 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.159
 has no way 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.369
 nervous and because he forgot the mayor 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:55.909
 next year 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.930
 in his order that any Brazilian may fail to come 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:01.899
 in effect this spirit 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:04.879
 and companionship 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.879
 like nature as we like 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.910
 and enjoy the team 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.859
 many passes the fabulous 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.899
 very 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.520
 visual check-in 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.799
 we arrive 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.249
 I'm being and I ended up falling 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.079
 the head will be to the face 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.140
 the next day has five more 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.460
 my images our cameraman the segment makes on the margins of a great 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.649
 natural lobby 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:34.059
 and as we are on a farm the farm are Pauline 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.309
 he does not lose the opportunity to be rewarded 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:41.609
 for a taste I use the milk taken at the time but nevertheless we are there in the inn of 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:42.809
 obidos 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:47.109
 to enjoy a delicious breakfast made on the wood stove play 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.279
 to gain typically pantaneiro 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.279
 She likes to lose, I'm now. 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.599
 Paulo 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.359
 to make a trip like this you must be very well filled 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.989
 first of all, never forget the hat 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.849
 government bodies 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.239
 a good shoe 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.419
 a lot of water 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.279
 as hostile reservation 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:14.519
 the four-by-four car wear sunscreen 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.299
 and claimed allowed on this trip 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.299
 and the camera 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.789
 and there we go for the third day of travel we still have many stops in 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.909
 Sao paulino farm to observe and register nature 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.050
 the sky is clean 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.259
 orders promises 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.409
 we passed many centennial farms along the way 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.879
 we continue to find 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.969
 the fire department 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.969
 capybaras 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.759
 but never - we are highly half way 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.050
 every year about 200 kilometers in the middle of the wetland 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.069
 but it's just local 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.409
 what else caught our attention 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.409
 was this month Acorizal 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.100
 in the distance we have the first rain of the trip in a few minutes it arrives until 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.759
 we 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.879
 nature also thanks me for a way to refresh from 38 degrees of temperature 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:10.990
 what was he doing that day? 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.900
 but the heavy rain helped little more than 500 thousand doses of vaccines 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.680
 expelled 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.110
 now it is two-thirty in the afternoon until arriving at the inn are over 80 pounds 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.169
 how to train your dragon has nothing in the woods 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.139
 she comes to strengthen here 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.550
 is that rice road as Paraguayan and a 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.520
 and here we go 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.620
 now the two come full with fpf 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.120
 for us 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.909
 sheet apparel 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.599
 if I welcome you 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.919
 in the middle of the bush the business is to improvise 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.039
 until a table 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:47.949
 with chair 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:49.400
 at this time 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.589
 the jump was in the height 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.309
 after three games 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:57.989
 some if enabled to walk on foot to better appreciate the some nature 

00:05:57.989 --> 00:05:59.169
 kilometers ahead 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:00.689
 a must stop 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.669
 these workers 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.639
 also attract attention 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.729
 and there they are in the treetops we got pretty close the first one appears 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.360
 is the black maximum and much observed 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.039
 next to a female 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.430
 in the same tree appears a couple 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.369
 discussed between the branches a female carries a cub on the back 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:25.490
 almost at the end of the afternoon we arrived here in transpantaneira 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.139
 the climb that was built 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.680
 to make the connection and has one end to the other of the wetland 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.430
 and here, walking by these guys 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.430
 visuals like studying a radio that burris 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:46.419
 where it is finishing once more the marsh-mato-grossense 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.150
 provides us 

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:02.260
 months after 11 hours of travel 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.029
 I asked too much to move forward. 

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:08.729
 the inflation of the car at the time of delivery should need after 11 hours more 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:10.139
 we finally arrived 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.360
 in the guesthouse otter pitch all because tired after much rain 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.129
 cool if I go at night 

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:22.740
 and let's change a rested was created and the new ecological circuit paper 

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:26.330
 ecology roma by the pope as those who are proposing the ecological tour 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.499
 organ 

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:29.710
 nectar 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.889
 the total wetland as we speak 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:33.820
 stay at ease 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.820
 and anyone who wants to do is just get in touch with us
