 Yes from January to January

 I've been describing how to use the iPhone 4 since then . 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:17.690
 At first I got a lot of games at first. 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.690
 I used it a lot when I was looking for something. 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:28.259

 Ah, I 'm using a lot of things I can not do. 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.390
 I think I'm searching the most for a while. 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:46.540
 First and foremost I'll write something first when I buy an iPhone 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.950
 I was thinking I buy a smartphone for example, used to eat 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.790

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.950

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:03.400
 4 First- time fashion brochures and companies are now the most 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:09.100

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:20.830
 Things to compulsory, rather than writing a personal dream 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:27.110
 I think Nene to work is the greatest act of going to work, why is the number of days 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.950
 It's too good. I use it the most when I feel sick.

 4 Use a lot of maps, go to the right-hand neighborhood and find the exit 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.400

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:13.930
 What I did not do was search for work in the morning, but what meeting in the morning 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:19.310
 I have to find an idea, but I can not find it at home or in the company. 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.680
 Because it is so frequent in the subway, it is compact. 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.430
