people eating animals without thinking

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.520 
people eating animals without thinking
about<00:00:18.870> it<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.940> and<00:00:20.940> that's<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.050> case<00:00:22.200> you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
know and as time went I started learning

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.380 
know and as time went I started learning
about<00:00:25.950> veal<00:00:26.370> calves<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.090> how<00:00:27.180> they<00:00:27.330> were

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
about veal calves and how they were

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.980 
about veal calves and how they were
raised

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
raised

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.210 
raised
and<00:00:28.140> my<00:00:28.350> grandmother<00:00:28.710> told<00:00:28.890> me<00:00:28.980> about<00:00:29.100> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and my grandmother told me about that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.710 
and my grandmother told me about that
when<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.610> in<00:00:29.700> high<00:00:29.820> school<00:00:29.850> so<00:00:30.270> I<00:00:30.510> stopped

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
when I was in high school so I stopped

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
when I was in high school so I stopped
eating<00:00:30.750> veal<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.410> then<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.340> traveled<00:00:32.669> around

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
eating veal and then I traveled around

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.430 
eating veal and then I traveled around
the<00:00:32.879> country<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.270> early<00:00:33.329> 1980s<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.350> I

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the country in the early 1980s and I

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.329 
the country in the early 1980s and I
learned<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.980> environmental

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339 
learned about the environmental

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.099 
learned about the environmental
consequences<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> harms<00:00:36.659> caused<00:00:36.899> by

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:37.109 
consequences and the harms caused by

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:38.599 
consequences and the harms caused by
that<00:00:37.289> and<00:00:37.589> I<00:00:37.859> learned<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.429> could

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
that and I learned that you could

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.729 
that and I learned that you could
actually<00:00:38.760> live<00:00:39.210> without<00:00:39.929> eating<00:00:40.589> other

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
actually live without eating other

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.599 
actually live without eating other
animals<00:00:40.859> so<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.609> went<00:00:41.850> vegan<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.269> 1985<00:00:43.429> and<00:00:44.429> the

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
animals so I went vegan in 1985 and the

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:45.919 
animals so I went vegan in 1985 and the
more<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.789> looked<00:00:45.030> into<00:00:45.089> this<00:00:45.329> issue<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.749> more<00:00:45.899> I

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
more I looked into this issue the more I

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.009 
more I looked into this issue the more I
saw<00:00:46.230> how<00:00:46.979> impactful<00:00:47.699> it<00:00:47.819> was<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.300> animals<00:00:48.719> for

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
saw how impactful it was for animals for

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.229 
saw how impactful it was for animals for
the<00:00:49.109> environment<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.859> people<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.460> how<00:00:50.999> most

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the environment for people and how most

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.629 
the environment for people and how most
people<00:00:51.390> were<00:00:51.749> unwittingly<00:00:52.440> engaged<00:00:53.159> in<00:00:53.489> this

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:53.639 
people were unwittingly engaged in this

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:56.239 
people were unwittingly engaged in this
industry<00:00:54.350> harming<00:00:55.350> animals<00:00:55.499> harming

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.249

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
themselves harming the planet and so in

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.819 
themselves harming the planet and so in
1986<00:00:59.789> when<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.600> co-founded<00:01:01.049> Farm<00:01:01.229> Sanctuary<00:01:01.440> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
1986 when we co-founded Farm Sanctuary I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.829 
1986 when we co-founded Farm Sanctuary I
started<00:01:02.429> going<00:01:02.729> into<00:01:02.909> these<00:01:03.120> places<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.690> see

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
started going into these places to see

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.329 
started going into these places to see
firsthand<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.500> was<00:01:04.620> happening<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.070> felt<00:01:05.250> it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
firsthand what was happening I felt it

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.630 
firsthand what was happening I felt it
was<00:01:05.430> very<00:01:05.640> important<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:07.980> we<00:01:08.430> were

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
was very important to know what we were

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760 
was very important to know what we were
talking<00:01:09.000> about<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:09.660> would<00:01:09.840> go<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.230> and<00:01:10.470> see

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
talking about so we would go in and see

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460 
talking about so we would go in and see
animals<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.480> cages<00:01:12.990> where<00:01:13.380> they

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
animals you know in cages where they

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.810 
animals you know in cages where they
were<00:01:13.590> confined<00:01:13.800> so<00:01:14.130> tightly<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.520> couldn't

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
were confined so tightly they couldn't

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.970 
were confined so tightly they couldn't
move<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.660> were<00:01:15.720> clanking<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.440> screaming<00:01:16.860> to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
move they were clanking and screaming to

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.340 
move they were clanking and screaming to
get<00:01:17.070> out<00:01:17.390> we'd<00:01:18.390> find<00:01:18.630> living<00:01:18.870> animals

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
get out we'd find living animals

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.980 
get out we'd find living animals
discarded<00:01:20.010> like<00:01:20.040> garbage<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:21.000> trash<00:01:21.390> cans<00:01:21.420> or

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
discarded like garbage in trash cans or

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.070 
discarded like garbage in trash cans or
on<00:01:22.110> piles<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.500> dead<00:01:22.650> animals<00:01:23.010> and<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.780> very

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
on piles of dead animals and it was very

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.650 
on piles of dead animals and it was very
difficult<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.800> imagine<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.540> we

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
difficult as you can imagine so we

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.840 
difficult as you can imagine so we
started<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.290> rescuing<00:01:28.950> these<00:01:29.070> animals<00:01:29.550> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
started then rescuing these animals and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.170 
started then rescuing these animals and
in<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.600> sense<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> way<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.580> were

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
in a sense it was a way that we were

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.750 
in a sense it was a way that we were
able<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.600> help<00:01:33.720> individuals<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.830> also<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
able to help individuals and also to

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.690 
able to help individuals and also to
help<00:01:36.150> ourselves<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> heal<00:01:37.290> ourselves<00:01:37.700> you

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
help ourselves and to heal ourselves you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.130 
help ourselves and to heal ourselves you
know<00:01:38.730> seeing<00:01:39.060> all<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.360> horror<00:01:39.660> and<00:01:39.780> not

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
know seeing all this horror and not

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.510 
know seeing all this horror and not
being<00:01:40.320> able<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.650> anything<00:01:40.980> about<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.250> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
being able to do anything about it is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240 
being able to do anything about it is
pretty<00:01:42.060> challenging<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> being<00:01:43.800> able<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.040> see

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
pretty challenging so being able to see

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.060 
pretty challenging so being able to see
animals<00:01:44.670> heal<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.510> start<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.260> walk<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.920> then

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
animals heal and start to walk and then

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.370 
animals heal and start to walk and then

the<00:02:22.620> former<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.400> live<00:02:23.550> in<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.760> way<00:02:23.849> that's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
the former to live in a way that's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.460 
the former to live in a way that's
compassionate<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.780> aligned<00:02:25.050> with<00:02:25.200> their<00:02:25.349> own

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
compassionate and aligned with their own

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.680 
compassionate and aligned with their own
compassionate<00:02:26.400> values<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:27.030> just<00:02:27.420> sort<00:02:27.599> of

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
compassionate values so I just sort of

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.180
