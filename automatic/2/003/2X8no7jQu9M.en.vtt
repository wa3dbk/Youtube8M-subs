00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
shape so let's go through the process so

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.679 
shape so let's go through the process so
here<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.179> go<00:01:15.109> I'll<00:01:16.109> hit<00:01:16.289> lock<00:01:17.359> then<00:01:18.359> within<00:01:18.539> one

again one to four seconds turn it off do
a<00:01:32.939> third<00:01:33.299> time<00:01:35.119> went<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> four<00:01:36.450> seconds<00:01:36.959> we'll

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:37.139 
a third time went to four seconds we'll

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:42.349 
a third time went to four seconds we'll
hit<00:01:37.259> lock<00:01:39.829> turn<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.979> off<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.179> more

hit lock turn it off and then one more

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:53.239 
hit lock turn it off and then one more
time<00:01:45.649> now<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.709> doors<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.520> locked<00:01:52.099> turn<00:01:53.099> it

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
time now the doors just locked turn it

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.159 
time now the doors just locked turn it
off

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:54.169 
off

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:59.260 
off
let's<00:01:55.169> make<00:01:55.349> sure<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.770> works<00:01:57.590> lock

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
let's make sure that it works lock

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.510 
let's make sure that it works lock
unlock<00:02:00.270> once<00:02:00.599> that's<00:02:00.929> the<00:02:01.049> driver<00:02:01.349> side<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:02.369> it

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
unlock once that's the driver side in it

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.799 
unlock once that's the driver side in it
again<00:02:03.679> all<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:05.099> other<00:02:05.219> doors<00:02:05.459> unlock<00:02:05.880> we'll

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:06.809 
again all the other doors unlock we'll

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:11.500 
again all the other doors unlock we'll
lock<00:02:06.989> it<00:02:07.049> again<00:02:07.729> let's<00:02:08.729> also<00:02:08.909> test<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.420> trunk

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
lock it again let's also test the trunk

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.589 
lock it again let's also test the trunk
and<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:13.140> works<00:02:13.319> too<00:02:14.269> so<00:02:15.269> that's<00:02:15.450> how<00:02:15.540> you

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
and that works too so that's how you

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.790 
and that works too so that's how you
program<00:02:15.870> an<00:02:16.409> Acura<00:02:16.920> TL<00:02:17.280> key<00:02:17.549> fob
