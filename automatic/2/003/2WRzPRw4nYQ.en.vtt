00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.480
 welcome to today's video 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.030
 Today I want something like that again 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.690
 try how to transform 4 mm 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.139
 Video 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.930
 Today I will be such a fashion 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.640
 Try this video means that I am 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.760
 another face in my face 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.070
 I like to paint a perpetrator 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.230
 Look, she has a total like that 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.289
 develops that you can according to mine and 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.179
 I'll just try that today 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.129
 let's just start the office I'll be like this 

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:38.559
 how they started brown with my eyes 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.559
 and it works 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:51.710
 [Music] 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.710
 [Applause] 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.739
 [Music] 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.739
 [Applause] 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.490
 what others do not strengthen 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.049
 I prefer showing that just me 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.039
 take it alone and sometimes more money 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.039
 an eye on 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.410
 [Music] 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.410
 Now I ask Eyeshadow and 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.580
 [Music] 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:41.370

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.370
 neumÃ¼nster 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:00.170
 I applied four fingers and 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.170
 now 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.190
 [Music] 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.870
 I thought it would be easier 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.400
 but you always see each other 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.400
 always underestimates everything 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:37.180
 [Music] 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.180
 but 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.270
 [Music] 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:03:03.209
 interesting also during the week is that 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:04.769
 impressive already something i know 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.930
 it not I did my best 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.840
 and that's the best I can get out of it 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.099
 skills racing got so and 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:20.540
 but now I should make-up 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:20.540
 an appointment was okay that's it 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.860
