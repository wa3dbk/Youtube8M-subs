know<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.140> was<00:01:01.289> easier<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> use<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:03.110> some

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
know that it was easier to use with some

if<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.900> pretty<00:01:07.110> good<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.619> there<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
if it pretty good in here there was a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.200 
if it pretty good in here there was a
little<00:01:08.250> bit<00:01:08.340> tightness<00:01:08.790> trying<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> actually

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
little bit tightness trying to actually

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.960 
little bit tightness trying to actually
put<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.229> all<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> ways<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.520> way<00:01:11.640> but

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
put it in all the ways all the way but

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.200 
put it in all the ways all the way but
anyways<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:14.070> did<00:01:14.280> actually<00:01:14.400> work<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.939> that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
anyways it did actually work with that

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.910 
anyways it did actually work with that
case<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.780> there's<00:01:15.900> certain<00:01:16.140> cases<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.650> will

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
case and there's certain cases that will

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.120 
case and there's certain cases that will
work<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.090> wear<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.770> lot<00:01:20.070> of
