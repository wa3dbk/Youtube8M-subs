now<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.410> rush<00:04:14.770> ability<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:15.490> I<00:04:15.550> keep<00:04:15.910> using

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
now the rush ability that I keep using

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.900 
now the rush ability that I keep using
lets<00:04:17.049> them<00:04:17.290> charge<00:04:17.920> into<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.400> enemy<00:04:18.730> and

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
lets them charge into the enemy and

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.930 
lets them charge into the enemy and
damage<00:04:19.480> them<00:04:19.690> as<00:04:19.900> they<00:04:20.170> as<00:04:20.410> they<00:04:20.980> resist<00:04:21.459> n<00:04:21.670> to

damage them as they as they resist n to
them<00:04:24.570> but<00:04:25.570> another<00:04:25.870> reason<00:04:25.990> why<00:04:26.290> i<00:04:26.320> like<00:04:26.530> the

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
them but another reason why i like the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.760 
them but another reason why i like the
bills<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:27.040> because<00:04:28.200> when<00:04:29.200> they<00:04:29.350> use<00:04:29.530> their

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
bills is because when they use their

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.220 
bills is because when they use their
mine<00:04:30.070> shafts<00:04:30.460> they<00:04:30.760> can<00:04:30.970> bake<00:04:31.600> they<00:04:31.810> act<00:04:31.990> like

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
mine shafts they can bake they act like

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.120 
mine shafts they can bake they act like
the<00:04:32.350> Goblin<00:04:32.860> tunnels<00:04:34.410> like<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.590> Goblin<00:04:35.980> can

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
the Goblin tunnels like the Goblin can

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.010 
the Goblin tunnels like the Goblin can
move<00:04:36.280> from<00:04:36.460> tunnel<00:04:36.760> Tintin<00:04:37.330> also<00:04:37.630> if<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:37.840> can

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
move from tunnel Tintin also if I can

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.920 
move from tunnel Tintin also if I can
build<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.730> mine<00:04:39.730> shaft<00:04:39.760> over<00:04:40.180> here<00:04:40.450> say<00:04:40.690> I'll

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
build a a mine shaft over here say I'll

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:48.450 
build a a mine shaft over here say I'll
have<00:04:41.350> an<00:04:41.470> instant<00:04:42.100> transfer

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460
