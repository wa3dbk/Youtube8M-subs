00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the PC that we're using and we're going

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.510 
the PC that we're using and we're going
to<00:00:55.199> choose<00:00:55.440> steam<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.190> already

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
to choose steam so it's already

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.849 
to choose steam so it's already
highlighted<00:00:56.850> let's<00:00:57.570> choose<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
highlighted let's choose that and you

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
highlighted let's choose that and you
can<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.340> our<00:00:59.370> main<00:00:59.730> screen<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
can see on our main screen it's going to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.939 
can see on our main screen it's going to
change<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> full<00:01:02.489> screen<00:01:02.879> steam<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.769> can

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
change to a full screen steam and we can

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.980 
change to a full screen steam and we can
actually<00:01:05.180> navigate<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
actually navigate on that so we have the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.440 
actually navigate on that so we have the
exact<00:01:07.290> same<00:01:07.320> thing<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:08.189> mirrored<00:01:09.030> right

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
exact same thing see mirrored right

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.050 
exact same thing see mirrored right
there<00:01:09.659> streaming<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.530> our<00:01:10.680> device<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.310> really

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
there streaming to our device and really

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.899 
there streaming to our device and really
smooth<00:01:12.390> actually<00:01:13.070> pretty<00:01:14.070> good<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.820> we

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
smooth actually pretty good so if we

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.190 
smooth actually pretty good so if we
want<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.090> look<00:01:15.240> at<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> store<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
and you can see the response time is

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.940 
and you can see the response time is
right<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.930> point
