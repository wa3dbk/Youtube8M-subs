00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.640
 a good long route involving guitarist 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.810
 If you are also mistaken, you can do something again with intros 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 called gays relevant to the brothers 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.809

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:33.460
 which was directly through 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.170
 pass on type of manual 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.530
 marius alder of the winter 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 the opening tune intro there we have the beauty of our very first lessons 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.470
 thought 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.050
 after all, that will also be the case until some people see that not only do we start looking 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.050
 with one introduces ahoy 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.380
 we look at the fourth position of the middle finger 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.050
 on the mind to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.580
 fourth position 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.990
 and ring finger 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.440
 because they taste fourth position 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.440
 the same applies to the first yellow strings 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.270
 can underline the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.270
 back to the holidays 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.460
 a slider with the if you were back a dip utrecht and given 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.550
 the car was against it 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.810

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.260
 yes as to 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.180
 incidentally, I see as small 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.980
 also a role 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.880
 place to 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.240
