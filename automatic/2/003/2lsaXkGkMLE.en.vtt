00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.579
 very fine so that they are formed 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.840
 then well over that is something like

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.850
 we need to stir it all up 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:05.150
 and leave to swell 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.150
 twenty minutes of water we do not add 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.210

 gelatin to roll with us 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.010
 formed later and did not fall apart 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:34.190
 that is, we mix like that 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:38.730
 rub in meat as spices and gelatin 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.950
 leave the chicken for 20 minutes 20 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.280
 minutes the meat is ready now for us 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.860
 you need to shift to plastic wrap 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.260
 this is very tight we put everything on 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:55.770
 wrap and wrap in several 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:58.250
 just lay out the meat tightly enough 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.250
 each other 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.439
 to make it evenly 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:18.379
 pack the edges as tightly as possible and 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.430
 we will wrap several films 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:25.840
 again so that we do not get water 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.980
 inside roll and roll turned us 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.980
 fairly uniform 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:04:07.430
 then pick up twist 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:11.329
 with tight enough we wrapped 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:17.930
 roll like that cling film and now 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:20.269
 still squeeze it in such a context man 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:40.940
 involved that we lay meat 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:49.370
 very bad inside the roll is ready now 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:55.190
 water inside you will not get roll 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:58.150
 we put in the crock-pot and we fill it 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:02.710
 all cold water 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.710
 the roll must be completely covered with water 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.200
 here I have gone liter 750 close 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.120
 cover 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:26.760
 roll will be cooked on fire mode 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:29.180
 type of product bird add time through 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:34.020
 hour roll will be fully prepared 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.870
 passed in an hour roll we are ready now 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.560
 roll must be taken out and cooled when 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.560
 room temperature 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.939
 pack very carefully 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.739
 Now we have such a roll 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:53.219
 it must be cooled at room temperature 

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:56.189
 temperature at least one and a half hours after 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:58.129
 then put into the refrigerator for 3-4 hours and 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:01.499
 better all night 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:06.149
 Well, my roll lay all night in 

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:08.179
 the fridge that's how it looks in 

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:08.179
 cut 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:17.599
 I will cut the size I will remove the film so 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:17.599
 more convenient 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:29.050
 pieces cut into any size 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:29.050
 fine though thick 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:36.539
 such a mask is such a sausage with us 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:38.870
 it turned out such a chicken roll 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.629
 I got this is the best alternative 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.240
 sausage roll turned out very tasty 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:47.639
 a very fragrant husband walks beside me 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.629
 swallows saliva waits when it can 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.030

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:53.039
