00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.150
 man 8 and we're going to meet the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.150
 laterals ok and we leave it like this 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.150
 it's not going to touch him good mastographic and 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.219
 we passed and right now that is not all the 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.219
 explanation I told you earlier 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:26.090
 look how interesting it looks like 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.610
 immediately and greece we made the 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.700
 first door we put part of the bottom 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.250
 we put it to one we thought and 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.330
 so it did not stay here we can observe the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.250
 seams as I told them they are up 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.519
 six centimeters nothing more here says it 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.879
 looking back can see over the 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.970
 black ribbon here is very simple that 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.339
 us in this if it is a method that you 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.400
 I want to teach these are very 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.390
 beautiful very soft person we do 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.470
 in this case 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.210
 good let's put a hair 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.440
 on an interlining that you most 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:11.080
 please and we will do it as if it were 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.080
 a forum of this whole body 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.720
 is the reinforcement to this fabric so that it does not 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 we are so soft and in fact it is 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.009
 some of the characteristics of the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.380
 bags that are all armed follows 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:33.990
 being strong in this area is given 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:36.360
 and that's how I just had nobody can 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.560
 please do not go repeat that this 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.729
 moment of vélez nine integers 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.490
 then what about this one because once 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.929
 we have already placed all this with your 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.360
 reinforcements we also face 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.940
 right with right and we will know 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.970
 for his right lateral blog e 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.170
 left as we stay a part 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.190
 very important commented to pass it with 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.190
 right first 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.120
 in because it happens to us 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.240
 so we put it right with rights 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.690
 we face and with the sides as 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.690
 what else 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.210
 let's go here 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:35.070
 past here we have this is what I give 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.900
 he had said paper center 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.550
 soft and this is the the boat of the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.260
 ball 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.330
 the fabric that you have around there 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.650
 cotton that is left over they put 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.120
 anything to make it more 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.410
 damn we know it by the lateral ones and 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.410
 we are left this way 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.930
 that is, for them to locate 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.440
 the intermediary guys and it already seemed another 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.100
 thing, look, it's armed, it's 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.130
 right and is make up is not a 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.620
 technique and kobe ​​is leading going on 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.980
 here before us to kill this 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.890
 but we come back with parents who saw how 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.290
 it remains we must do what only 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.200
 in the corners that are being the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.200
 normally they are square 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.900
 yes 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.710
 technically it is then like sanxenxo 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.790
 as always I say very easy you 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.510
 place 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.420
 in the shape of a triangle they open their culture to 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.439
 that put their hands to the bottom 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.150
 of them I bring little mark so that they see 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:05.560
 something bigger then what are we going 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.689
 do here let's match up is 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.650
 built that under the bottom that 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.650
 have the lining 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.590
 this seam of the middle I recommend you 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.860
 whenever I cut in this little corner or 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.920
 case of a golecito that works so that 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.680
 open well and be easier 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.100
 so here we are going to make you 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.350
 we make a unique media so it's not 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.960
 a straight cut and I have a little bit more 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.520
 movement in this case just for 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.360
 questions of time we are going to 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.370
 put them a pin quoted ok the same 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.120
 let's do the other side we repeat 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.120
 the operation 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.040
 we open the seam those are crimes 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.440
 simple but that make a great 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.200
 difference in the finish of any 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.980
 piece that we do ok already what 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:05.780
 we have so now we are going to flip 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.780
 to put the used 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.670
 see how he immediately gets rid of 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.400
 the nice clear that we do not have now 20 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.150
 and exactly because it is not simply 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.730
 as if it were a sun 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.480
 then how I do not want this is going to be 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.370
 in this way that their two houses are 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.380
 are your side ribbons are your 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.700
 rings side where we will 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.500
 pass the tapes 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.200
 we have this and we have babies 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.220
 drawer medicines that now we see it 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.660
 right right here it is and we have 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.500
 our dogs that we had already 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.360
 known the pocket we had faced 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.300
 in fact with de right with been the 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.450
 natural and that same allow me to 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.590
 I said that on the disk at the moment what 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.750
 let's do on the liner ok and then 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.680
 since we are practically finishing 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.380
 what we do we are going to introduce the lining 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.660
 within the body football are not going to 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.540
 flip it will leave for the part 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.880
 we all face done with right by 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.090
 the inside part and then in the 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.860
 body that is to the right everything we go 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:22.600
 to introduce this tense leather very 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.730
 well before continuing with this step I 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.920
 I'm going to open the one that is here finished 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:31.110
 to show you some little details 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.160
 look for example let's open here to 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.500
 observe 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.690
 what he professes in the next part 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.910
 to do exactly to see here 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.490
 we have the lining that I'm putting 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:45.190
 twine as it is indicating and in the 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.960
 another part if we are going to know him 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.020
 the whole part of carrió for you 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.820
 can you see how that piecita is made 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.540
 true so good here we have this 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.640
 open and let's go back to 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.740
 close I had it with the cord cited very 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.740
 ok let's make a small cut
