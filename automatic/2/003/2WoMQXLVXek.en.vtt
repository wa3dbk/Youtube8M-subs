00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
go from Morgan Schneiderlin because I

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.870 
go from Morgan Schneiderlin because I
actually<00:01:57.840> packed<00:01:58.229> him<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.640> there's<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.700> lot<00:01:59.850> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
actually packed him and there's a lot of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.160 
actually packed him and there's a lot of
hype<00:02:00.060> around<00:02:00.240> him<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.570> moment<00:02:00.690> he's<00:02:00.990> got

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
hype around him in a moment he's got

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.450 
hype around him in a moment he's got
three<00:02:01.440> goals<00:02:01.680> already<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.010> year<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.400> that's

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
three goals already this year and that's

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.860 
three goals already this year and that's
more<00:02:02.760> than<00:02:02.820> what<00:02:03.090> he<00:02:03.150> got<00:02:03.299> last<00:02:03.510> year<00:02:03.690> in<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
more than what he got last year in the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.170 
more than what he got last year in the
BPL<00:02:04.260> so<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.710> think<00:02:05.340> he<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.090> a

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
BPL so I think he is going to have a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.610 
BPL so I think he is going to have a
good<00:02:06.330> year

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
good year

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.770 
good year
and<00:02:06.770> he<00:02:07.010> was<00:02:07.130> ok<00:02:07.520> on<00:02:07.640> fee<00:02:07.820> for<00:02:08.060> he<00:02:08.180> could<00:02:08.360> do

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and he was ok on fee for he could do

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.810 
and he was ok on fee for he could do
with<00:02:09.020> being<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.290> little<00:02:09.500> bit<00:02:09.650> faster<00:02:09.860> garlic

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
with being a little bit faster garlic

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.220 
with being a little bit faster garlic
everything<00:02:11.360> lamela<00:02:11.690> on<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.900> right-hand<00:02:12.170> side

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
everything lamela on the right-hand side

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.550 
everything lamela on the right-hand side
he's<00:02:12.560> been<00:02:12.770> downgraded<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:15.140> don't

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
he's been downgraded and and I don't

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.200 
he's been downgraded and and I don't
really<00:02:15.650> know<00:02:16.190> why<00:02:16.550> because<00:02:16.730> he<00:02:16.940> didn't<00:02:17.150> play

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
really know why because he didn't play

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.880 
really know why because he didn't play
many<00:02:17.480> games<00:02:17.540> last<00:02:17.900> year<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:18.380> maybe<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.770> bit

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
many games last year so maybe it's a bit

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.860 
many games last year so maybe it's a bit
of<00:02:18.950> an<00:02:19.040> unfair<00:02:19.160> downgrade<00:02:19.880> book<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.210> fever<00:02:20.810> he

a bit more pace we've got Nasri on the
left-hand<00:02:29.180> side<00:02:29.240> I'm<00:02:29.630> not<00:02:29.810> too<00:02:30.080> happy<00:02:30.290> with

left-hand side I'm not too happy with
this<00:02:30.650> card<00:02:30.920> being<00:02:31.100> left<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> field<00:02:31.580> card<00:02:31.880> I'd

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
this card being left the field card I'd

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.480 
this card being left the field card I'd
rather<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.360> become<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.020> he<00:02:33.830> was<00:02:33.980> wasted<00:02:34.400> at

rather it become and he was wasted at

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.400 
rather it become and he was wasted at
left<00:02:34.670> mid<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:34.880> thought<00:02:35.270> it<00:02:35.540> was<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> left<00:02:36.080> forward

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410

left mid I thought it was a left forward
maybe<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.740> bit<00:02:36.920> be<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> bit<00:02:37.460> different<00:02:37.670> cuz<00:02:37.970> he

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
maybe a bit be a bit different cuz he

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.730 
maybe a bit be a bit different cuz he

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
great so I decided to try happy cease a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.000 
great so I decided to try happy cease a
4-1<00:03:17.750> game<00:03:17.780> because<00:03:18.290> he's<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.440> very<00:03:18.739> cheap

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
4-1 game because he's a very cheap

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.460 
4-1 game because he's a very cheap

alternative and I have to say he was a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.410 
alternative and I have to say he was a
lot<00:03:21.800> better<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.280> know<00:03:22.400> it's<00:03:22.730> anyone<00:03:23.000> game<00:03:23.030> but
