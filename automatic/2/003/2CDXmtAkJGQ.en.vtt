00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.000 
now here's the actual like removing of
the<00:03:37.220> monitor<00:03:37.670> now<00:03:38.329> here<00:03:38.810> they<00:03:39.110> Isis<00:03:39.799> including

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
the monitor now here they Isis including

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.699 
the monitor now here they Isis including
very<00:03:40.610> hard<00:03:40.910> foam<00:03:41.239> which<00:03:41.959> I<00:03:42.200> would<00:03:42.380> have<00:03:42.500> liked

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
very hard foam which I would have liked

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.440 
very hard foam which I would have liked
to<00:03:42.829> see<00:03:43.040> something<00:03:43.400> more<00:03:43.579> like<00:03:43.760> soft<00:03:44.120> form

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
to see something more like soft form

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.020 
to see something more like soft form
foam<00:03:44.959> as<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.380> takes<00:03:45.650> damage<00:03:45.950> very<00:03:46.370> easily<00:03:46.579> much

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
foam as it takes damage very easily much

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.220 
foam as it takes damage very easily much
better<00:03:47.329> and<00:03:47.750> in<00:03:48.500> my<00:03:49.090> panel<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.299> actually<00:03:50.480> had<00:03:50.900> or

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
better and in my panel I actually had or

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.630 
better and in my panel I actually had or
at<00:03:51.319> least<00:03:51.470> on<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.680> foam<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.190> had<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.340> crack<00:03:52.610> in

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
at least on the foam I had a crack in

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.229 
at least on the foam I had a crack in
the<00:03:52.849> foam<00:03:53.060> which<00:03:53.780> is<00:03:53.810> less<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.530> be<00:03:54.650> desired<00:03:55.239> but

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
the foam which is less to be desired but

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.990 
the foam which is less to be desired but
it<00:03:56.780> still<00:03:57.260> arrived<00:03:57.769> in<00:03:57.980> full<00:03:58.220> working<00:03:58.549> order

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
it still arrived in full working order

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.090 
it still arrived in full working order
and<00:03:59.209> there<00:03:59.780> was<00:03:59.900> no<00:04:00.109> dead<00:04:00.350> pixels<00:04:00.829> or<00:04:00.950> anything

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
and there was no dead pixels or anything

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.650 
and there was no dead pixels or anything
so<00:04:01.519> hopefully<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.060> stays<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.299> way

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
so hopefully it stays that way

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.550 
so hopefully it stays that way
and<00:04:03.340> now<00:04:04.340> we<00:04:04.819> will<00:04:05.000> move<00:04:05.329> on<00:04:05.600> to<00:04:06.200> me<00:04:06.319> just

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
and now we will move on to me just

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.080 
and now we will move on to me just
taking<00:04:06.769> out<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.040> panel<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:07.579> you<00:04:07.670> can<00:04:07.790> see<00:04:07.970> the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
taking out the panel and you can see the

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.809 
taking out the panel and you can see the
stand<00:04:08.450> or<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.840> arm<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.709> monitor<00:04:10.100> attaches<00:04:10.579> to

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
stand or the arm the monitor attaches to

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.990 
stand or the arm the monitor attaches to
now<00:04:11.569> sadly<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:13.010> does<00:04:13.310> not<00:04:13.489> have<00:04:13.700> all<00:04:13.730> those

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
now sadly it does not have all those

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.870 
now sadly it does not have all those
cool<00:04:14.269> features<00:04:14.720> like<00:04:14.750> hide<00:04:15.230> adjust<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:16.100> also

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
cool features like hide adjust and also

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.360 
cool features like hide adjust and also
rotation<00:04:17.450> things<00:04:17.660> like<00:04:17.780> that<00:04:18.019> but<00:04:18.530> we<00:04:18.650> do<00:04:18.769> get

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
rotation things like that but we do get

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.250 
rotation things like that but we do get
a<00:04:19.400> little<00:04:19.639> bit<00:04:19.850> of<00:04:19.940> tilting<00:04:20.419> like<00:04:20.810> I<00:04:21.019> believe

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
a little bit of tilting like I believe

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.830 
a little bit of tilting like I believe
from<00:04:21.410> 5<00:04:21.709> 2<00:04:22.130> or<00:04:22.340> negative<00:04:22.580> 5<00:04:22.880> to<00:04:23.210> 20<00:04:23.539> degrees

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
from 5 2 or negative 5 to 20 degrees

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.560 
from 5 2 or negative 5 to 20 degrees
which<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.200> pretty<00:04:24.470> good<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:25.060> that's<00:04:26.060> now<00:04:26.539> just

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
which is pretty good and that's now just

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.090 
which is pretty good and that's now just
