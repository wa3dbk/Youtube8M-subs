novice drivers I think that these type

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.890 
novice drivers I think that these type
of<00:03:02.830> walls<00:03:03.160> are<00:03:03.370> very<00:03:03.520> important<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.870> think

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
of walls are very important and I think

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.810 
of walls are very important and I think
the<00:03:05.260> more<00:03:05.470> states<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.010> take<00:03:06.310> part<00:03:06.490> of<00:03:06.640> these

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
the more states to take part of these

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.200 
the more states to take part of these
