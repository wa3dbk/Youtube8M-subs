00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.820
 They may say that you passed the first test 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.439
 next to look at poles 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.209
 the points do the sentence execution year 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.919
 so we still have some question marks there 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.919
 Here's why my name on the ball isn't right 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.359
 for that matter there are even more sufficient homework but yes when you are out 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.060
 if you want to take three points with heerenveen, then you shouldn't do that 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.689
 whining and just being content 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.099
 and that working and standing at home is even easier in a few days and 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.589
 can do 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.020
 utrecht and psv 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.899
 after training you can't do anything with it 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.760
 so you can imagine and I'll let you get creative and you can 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.930
 just watch 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.820
 the moment you have two days between those two games then 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.310
 the team is tactically not doing so much in training no 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.110
 that is therefore not possible 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.220
 how do you look at this match against psv 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.129
 the whole talented young group 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.149
 the medium that is full of a distance of quality 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.620
 yes in the end unfortunately just has a really hard time 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.130
 is fighting and yes 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.700
 it is a matter of waiting when when the skate side thus zuma 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.390
 a team that is full of quality 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.350
 I remember going to the game when it was said that FC Twente and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.780
 psv comparable teams the small four million and I find it difficult 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.690
 just like in the hague directors criticize money handling because you think 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.760
 I know nothing there 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.870
 the name then you have to add several more 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.960
 buyers themselves 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 I'm going to cry out a volunteer 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.850
 not not have not been very confused 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.369
 Perhaps it has been the advantage that yes that is what I mean 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.220
 to be able to do we are going to fall 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.530
 on psv there were immediately at the feet fantastic start 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.020
 without the spotlight too full 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.760
 yes we have a bit more rest in our way of working 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.970
 apply climbing so the media estimate less on top 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.740
 and that may have been a very big advantage 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.710
 At the moment there is also a safe return to Nijmegen for a small profit 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.509
 is that not the case that you are a bit earlier or 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.509
 and this is perhaps the own half the game dropped there 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.069
 after the latter 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.240
 yes yes a handicap together something where you have no influence on a real branch 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.449
 worry about it 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.719
 Sure want to know who is playing on the other side of an area 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.019
 Anna's farm police are both newly awake people 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.079
 for that matter the 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.269
 but in that sense I don't have that much out of just yes the intention would be different 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.239
 his than singing is a different player than roeselare 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.409
 and they stand at the balls of quality wool and at moments for kick-off 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.159
 before the kick-off but know that you are going to play then you know how to how 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.049
 to combat 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.980
 here I now have a sort of marathon of four races in ten days 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.369
 we notice that a bit on the group 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.129
 and that says they are extra sharp 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.379
 but I must honestly say that ours is a little bit before that 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.359
 overdone 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.159
 then but in that sense everyone has a tough program just by that 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.919
 canceled match of groningen it is a match that really needs extra 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:03.849
 play 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.319
 if you are very much cult leader towards the all competitions you do 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.809
 plays is a team that wants the refined 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:12.210
 could have and that is vitesse 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.559
 after a night king 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:17.499
 the only team that later possibly based on the program boss 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.539
 users might have 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.629
 and for the rest half we have it will program the rest of the team
