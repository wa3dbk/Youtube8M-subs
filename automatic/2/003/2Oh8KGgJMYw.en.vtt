00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
something because and they'll think that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
now I'm wrong I haven't done this in a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.550 
now I'm wrong I haven't done this in a
while<00:01:46.909> ok<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.590> once<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.799> play<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> CD

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
while ok so once you play the CD

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.870 
while ok so once you play the CD
you'll<00:01:52.220> be<00:01:52.399> able<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.880> rip<00:01:53.380> CD<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:55.399> click<00:01:55.640> that

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
and rip CD and this will probably take a

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.010
