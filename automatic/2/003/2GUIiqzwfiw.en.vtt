about that once you get robbing started
it<00:05:33.260> is<00:05:33.560> it<00:05:34.130> is<00:05:34.310> almost<00:05:34.550> impossible<00:05:34.910> to<00:05:35.540> start

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
it is it is almost impossible to start

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.500 
it is it is almost impossible to start

entrance feeder you can also use this on

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.530 
entrance feeder you can also use this on
the<00:05:42.800> top<00:05:43.070> of<00:05:43.280> your<00:05:43.400> frames<00:05:43.790> like<00:05:44.090> I<00:05:44.270> do<00:05:44.330> the

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
the top of your frames like I do the

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.720 
the top of your frames like I do the
quail<00:05:44.750> feeder<00:05:45.160> now<00:05:46.810> another<00:05:47.810> way<00:05:48.080> that<00:05:48.730> you

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
quail feeder now another way that you

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.790 
quail feeder now another way that you
can<00:05:49.910> use<00:05:50.780> this<00:05:51.320> jar<00:05:51.710> on<00:05:52.160> top<00:05:52.370> of<00:05:52.850> the<00:05:52.910> frames<00:05:53.270> is

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
can use this jar on top of the frames is

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.130 
can use this jar on top of the frames is
simply<00:05:54.800> put<00:05:55.010> two<00:05:55.190> sticks<00:05:55.550> there<00:05:55.820> and<00:05:56.090> let<00:05:56.810> the

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
simply put two sticks there and let the

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.000 
simply put two sticks there and let the
the<00:05:57.170> jar<00:05:57.770> set<00:05:58.640> them<00:05:58.850> that<00:05:59.060> needs<00:05:59.270> to<00:05:59.360> be<00:05:59.450> level

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
the jar set them that needs to be level

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.640 
the jar set them that needs to be level
let<00:06:01.010> the<00:06:01.160> jar<00:06:01.430> sit<00:06:02.330> on<00:06:02.450> the<00:06:02.570> sticks<00:06:02.870> and<00:06:03.110> the

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
let the jar sit on the sticks and the

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.620 
let the jar sit on the sticks and the
bees<00:06:03.860> can<00:06:04.160> crawl<00:06:04.400> underneath<00:06:04.820> the<00:06:05.030> sticks<00:06:05.330> and

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
bees can crawl underneath the sticks and

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.180 
bees can crawl underneath the sticks and
get<00:06:05.780> to<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:06.050> syrup<00:06:06.550> but<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:09.110> quail<00:06:09.410> feeder<00:06:09.740> is

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
get to the syrup but the quail feeder is

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.270 
get to the syrup but the quail feeder is
it's<00:06:10.610> hard<00:06:10.880> to<00:06:10.970> be<00:06:11.210> if<00:06:12.020> a<00:06:12.200> hive<00:06:12.440> is<00:06:12.680> starving

it's hard to be if a hive is starving

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.760 
it's hard to be if a hive is starving
and<00:06:13.490> you<00:06:14.390> want<00:06:14.570> to<00:06:14.660> save<00:06:14.900> them<00:06:15.140> in<00:06:15.440> cold

and you want to save them in cold
weather<00:06:16.060> that<00:06:17.060> top<00:06:17.330> feeder<00:06:17.660> in<00:06:17.900> my<00:06:18.050> opinion<00:06:18.530> is

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
weather that top feeder in my opinion is

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.200 
weather that top feeder in my opinion is
the<00:06:19.280> only<00:06:19.430> way<00:06:19.610> to<00:06:19.670> go

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
the only way to go

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.320 
the only way to go
now<00:06:20.540> some<00:06:20.990> people<00:06:21.440> if<00:06:22.040> a<00:06:22.250> hive<00:06:22.460> is<00:06:22.730> starving

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
now some people if a hive is starving

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.020 
now some people if a hive is starving
and<00:06:23.540> they<00:06:23.630> don't<00:06:23.840> have<00:06:24.050> a<00:06:24.440> top<00:06:24.830> feeder<00:06:25.130> they
