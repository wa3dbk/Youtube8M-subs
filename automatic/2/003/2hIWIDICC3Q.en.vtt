00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
behind the back but like I always say

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.810 
behind the back but like I always say
the<00:00:31.679> devil<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> details<00:00:32.579> that's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
basketball from either of those behind

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
basketball from either of those behind
the<00:00:49.829> backs<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.250> go<00:00:50.430> into<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> jump<00:00:51.059> shot<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.690> you

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the backs and go into a jump shot so you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.639 
the backs and go into a jump shot so you
want<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.020> make<00:00:52.110> sure<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.350> keeping<00:00:52.440> those

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
want to make sure you're keeping those

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
want to make sure you're keeping those
dribbles<00:00:53.219> fairly<00:00:53.579> high<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.030> comes<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
dribbles fairly high so it comes up to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.029 
dribbles fairly high so it comes up to
about<00:00:54.539> hip<00:00:54.930> height<00:00:55.110> maybe<00:00:55.379> even<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> little<00:00:55.949> bit

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
about hip height maybe even a little bit

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.860 
about hip height maybe even a little bit
higher<00:00:56.309> that's<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> makes<00:00:57.390> curry<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
higher that's what it makes curry so

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.479 
higher that's what it makes curry so
deadly<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.320> two<00:00:58.440> dribbles<00:00:58.620> cuz<00:00:58.920> at<00:00:59.039> any<00:00:59.250> given

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
deadly up two dribbles cuz at any given

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
deadly up two dribbles cuz at any given
moment<00:00:59.699> he<00:00:59.940> could<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> jump<00:01:00.510> shot<00:01:00.719> off<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
moment he could get a jump shot off and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.540 
moment he could get a jump shot off and
that's<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.559> makes<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> fender<00:01:02.129> stay<00:01:02.309> close

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that's what makes the fender stay close

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130 
that's what makes the fender stay close
to<00:01:02.730> him<00:01:02.850> which<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.390> also<00:01:03.539> what<00:01:03.750> allows<00:01:03.840> him<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
to him which is also what allows him to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.299 
to him which is also what allows him to
get<00:01:04.290> past<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> fenders<00:01:04.949> cousin<00:01:05.189> your

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
get past the fenders cousin your

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.890 
get past the fenders cousin your
defenders<00:01:05.700> tighter<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.390> easier<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.780> get

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
defenders tighter it's easier to get

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.899 
defenders tighter it's easier to get
past<00:01:07.170> them<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.950> pull<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> far<00:01:08.490> off<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
past them if they pull you far off you

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.370 
past them if they pull you far off you
