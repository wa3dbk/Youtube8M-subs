3PM Trying to get out of bed

It's 4 o'clock and I'm still in bed

00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:16.161
I feel so lazy you cannot blame me I don't want to go out and meet my friends

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:19.771
I want to be alone

00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.461
Turn of the radio

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.371
What's the point of this song?

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.061
I just want to play pong!

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:29.191
