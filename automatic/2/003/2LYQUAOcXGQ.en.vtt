other puddle or coop coop or then you
can<00:02:48.090> add<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.540> there<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.740> little<00:02:50.130> bit<00:02:50.520> this

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
can add in there like a little bit this

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.780 
can add in there like a little bit this
coolant<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.510> same<00:02:51.750> level<00:02:52.200> water<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.010> then

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
coolant and same level water and then

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.000 
coolant and same level water and then
you<00:02:53.970> know<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.510> there's<00:02:55.260> enough<00:02:55.680> this

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
you know that there's enough this

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.410 
you know that there's enough this
coolant<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.090> then<00:02:57.690> there's<00:02:57.930> one<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.420> good

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
coolant and then there's one a good

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.690 
coolant and then there's one a good
information<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.709> add<00:03:01.950> maybe<00:03:02.459> a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
information that if you add maybe a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.479 
information that if you add maybe a
little<00:03:02.820> bit<00:03:03.180> more<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.410> coolant<00:03:05.070> like<00:03:05.310> in

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
little bit more this coolant like in

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.290 
little bit more this coolant like in
here<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.390> not<00:03:06.680> very<00:03:07.680> very<00:03:08.370> padding<00:03:09.000> because

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
here it is not very very padding because

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.610 
here it is not very very padding because
the<00:03:10.020> system<00:03:10.560> Autocar<00:03:11.120> automatically<00:03:12.620> takes

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
the system Autocar automatically takes

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.290 
the system Autocar automatically takes
away<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.400> extra<00:03:15.050> coolant<00:03:16.050> but<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.070> not

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
away this extra coolant but it is not

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.110 
away this extra coolant but it is not
not<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.630> idea<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.350> we<00:03:19.620> add<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:20.130> bottle<00:03:20.940> in

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
not the idea that we add this bottle in

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.110 
not the idea that we add this bottle in
pool<00:03:21.390> only<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:22.560> this<00:03:22.770> full<00:03:23.070> line<00:03:23.310> focus<00:03:23.940> in

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
pool only in this full line focus in

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.680 
pool only in this full line focus in
this<00:03:24.300> level

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
this level

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.009 
this level
I<00:03:24.780> love<00:03:24.989> level<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:26.280> here<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.299> little

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
I love level is in here that is little

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:28.539 
I love level is in here that is little
bit<00:03:28.080> lower

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
bit lower

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.100 
bit lower
okay<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.820> when<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.060> have<00:03:30.390> added<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:31.049> thing

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
okay and when you have added this thing

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.759 
okay and when you have added this thing
you<00:03:32.070> take<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.640> cap<00:03:33.480> in<00:03:33.720> hat<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.230> there<00:03:34.440> and

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
you take this cap in hat in there and

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.320 
you take this cap in hat in there and
you<00:03:35.250> take<00:03:35.519> than<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.030> carefully<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:38.330> 10

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
you take than this carefully and then 10

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.770 
you take than this carefully and then 10
important<00:03:40.080> think<00:03:40.950> that<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.360> this

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
important think that that the this

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.120 
important think that that the this
adding<00:03:43.380> when<00:03:44.250> motor<00:03:44.519> is<00:03:44.880> hot<00:03:45.320> don't<00:03:46.320> add<00:03:46.739> this

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
adding when motor is hot don't add this

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.990 
adding when motor is hot don't add this
coolant<00:03:47.640> because<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.630> cap<00:03:48.900> can<00:03:49.560> can<00:03:50.430> explode

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
coolant because this cap can can explode

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.840 
coolant because this cap can can explode
in<00:03:51.329> out<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.959> because<00:03:52.440> this<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.850> boiling

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
in out and because this is boiling

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.250 
in out and because this is boiling
boiling<00:03:54.720> hot<00:03:55.160> coolant<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.549> open<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:57.720> cap

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
boiling hot coolant and open this cap

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.240 
boiling hot coolant and open this cap
only<00:03:58.500> when<00:03:58.829> motor<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.400> called<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:01.650> it's

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
only when motor is called and and it's

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.350 
only when motor is called and and it's
it's<00:04:02.549> not<00:04:02.790> hot

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
it's not hot

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.870 
it's not hot
this<00:04:03.540> model<00:04:03.900> okay<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.920> thank<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:05.640> for
