00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.590

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.600
 looking at what happens then 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.300

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.940
 if there is a I had a pipe or in the mouth 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.940
 not everything was a slow motion 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.640

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.640

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.420
 international 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.140

 You do not look where you look at me 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.879
 They took a look at what is fat 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.300
 look what is valued in the problem 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.300
 of the problem 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.450
 it's okay 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.420
 but we're going to win none can not be 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.459
 this 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.459
 How sad, this is already 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:22.250
 or else you're not going this 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.250
 voices I do not say well with all 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:29.840

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.640

 well we are in this 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.319
 if you keep trying while I'm 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.630
 seeing 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.980
 I'm seeing that I have the impressions 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.980
 what do they have to do 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.660
 as here as it was that you have here to see 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.660
 what it was like to teach again 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:16.500
 the mirrors 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:19.130

 let's go on the other say careers 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:51.210

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.999
 elche with the new method 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.289

 the wings 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.180

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.180
 others 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.400
