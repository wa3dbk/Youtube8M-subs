00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.010 

all<00:00:04.770> right<00:00:04.890> well<00:00:05.040> here's<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.899> solution<00:00:06.899> that

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
all right well here's the solution that

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.270 
all right well here's the solution that
I<00:00:07.140> came<00:00:07.200> up<00:00:07.380> with<00:00:08.570> basically<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.600> just<00:00:09.930> had<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> I

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
I came up with basically I just had a I

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.799 
I came up with basically I just had a I
took<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> brand<00:00:11.969> new<00:00:12.120> eighth<00:00:12.330> inch<00:00:12.540> drill<00:00:12.750> bit

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
took a brand new eighth inch drill bit

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.049 
took a brand new eighth inch drill bit
nice<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.410> sharp<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.460> drilled<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.820> whole

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
nice and sharp and just drilled a whole

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.540 
nice and sharp and just drilled a whole
series<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.840> holes<00:00:16.049> right<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.040> there<00:00:17.279> as<00:00:17.460> close

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
series of holes right in there as close

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.740 
series of holes right in there as close
as<00:00:17.790> I<00:00:17.880> could<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> each<00:00:18.300> other

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
as I could to each other

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.690 
as I could to each other
the<00:00:19.080> idea<00:00:19.410> being<00:00:19.619> like<00:00:19.919> a<00:00:19.950> paperclip<00:00:20.399> you've

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
the idea being like a paperclip you've

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.609 
the idea being like a paperclip you've
been<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> paperclip<00:00:21.450> back<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.169> forth<00:00:22.349> enough

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
been to paperclip back and forth enough

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.420 
been to paperclip back and forth enough
times<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.160> eventually<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.060> breaks<00:00:24.210> because

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
times and eventually it breaks because

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.700 
times and eventually it breaks because
everything<00:00:26.430> else<00:00:26.610> on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.390> whole<00:00:27.630> length<00:00:28.470> of

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
everything else on the whole length of

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.979 
everything else on the whole length of
the<00:00:28.829> dash<00:00:29.130> has<00:00:29.399> been<00:00:29.610> cut<00:00:29.880> except<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:30.869> this

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
the dash has been cut except for this

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.980 
the dash has been cut except for this
area<00:00:31.279> I<00:00:33.410> use<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.590> drill<00:00:35.690> just<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:36.840> it

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
area I use the drill just because it

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.700 
area I use the drill just because it
really<00:00:37.800> seemed<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> best<00:00:38.490> tool<00:00:39.710> your

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
really seemed like the best tool your

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.220 
really seemed like the best tool your
toolbox<00:00:41.130> maybe<00:00:41.490> more<00:00:41.780> well<00:00:42.780> equipped<00:00:43.140> than

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
toolbox maybe more well equipped than

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.560 
toolbox maybe more well equipped than
mine<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.880> got<00:00:45.090> something<00:00:45.390> better<00:00:45.450> for

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
mine and if you got something better for

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.880 
mine and if you got something better for
this<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:45.990> go<00:00:46.110> ahead<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.410> use<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.650> but<00:00:46.800> this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
this then go ahead and use it but this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.250 
this then go ahead and use it but this
is<00:00:47.040> what<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.220> used<00:00:47.580> and<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.810> I'm<00:00:48.870> gonna<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:49.170> if

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is what I used and now I'm gonna see if

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.240 
is what I used and now I'm gonna see if
I<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.790> bend<00:00:50.790> this<00:00:51.560> back<00:00:52.560> and<00:00:52.710> forth<00:00:52.950> to

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
I can bend this back and forth to

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.790 
I can bend this back and forth to
actually<00:00:53.880> break<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.500> area<00:00:55.739> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
actually break all the little area in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.190 
actually break all the little area in
between<00:00:56.250> those<00:00:56.370> holes<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:57.720> I<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:58.110> can

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
between those holes and see if I we can

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:42.500 
between those holes and see if I we can
get<00:00:58.290> this<00:00:58.410> -<00:00:58.650> out

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.930 

all<00:01:43.510> right<00:01:43.690> let's<00:01:43.840> try<00:01:43.990> something<00:01:44.260> else

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
all right let's try something else

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.730 
all right let's try something else
okay<00:01:45.940> so<00:01:46.030> pending<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:46.600> did<00:01:46.780> almost<00:01:46.930> nothing<00:01:47.170> so

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
okay so pending it did almost nothing so

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.090 
okay so pending it did almost nothing so
now<00:01:48.280> what<00:01:48.460> I'm<00:01:48.550> gonna<00:01:48.700> try<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.860> small

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
now what I'm gonna try just a small

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.210 
now what I'm gonna try just a small
little<00:01:51.310> cold<00:01:51.610> chisel<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:53.020> hammer<00:01:53.220> let's

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
little cold chisel and a hammer let's

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:21.150 
little cold chisel and a hammer let's
see<00:01:54.400> where<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:54.550> gets<00:01:54.850> me<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:21.010> working

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
see where that gets me it's working

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:36.080 
see where that gets me it's working
pretty<00:02:21.400> good<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:22.510> keep<00:02:22.750> going

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.400 

that's<00:02:37.090> nearly<00:02:37.450> all<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.720> them<00:02:37.870> just<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.260> few

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
that's nearly all of them just a few

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:51.830 
that's nearly all of them just a few
more<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.739> go

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.050 

okay<00:02:54.240> it's<00:02:55.240> free<00:02:55.480> all<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> way<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.850> one<00:02:57.850> little

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
okay it's free all the way in one little

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.470 
okay it's free all the way in one little
spot<00:02:59.070> right<00:03:00.070> there

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
spot right there

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:13.290 
spot right there
that<00:03:01.480> means<00:03:01.780> it's<00:03:02.580> super-new<00:03:11.580> that's<00:03:12.580> it<00:03:12.790> she

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
little cleanup work along this edge that

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.660 
little cleanup work along this edge that
we<00:04:01.970> cut<00:04:02.970> drilled<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:04.310> chiseled<00:04:05.310> away<00:04:05.340> that

but other than that she's in real good

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.110 
but other than that she's in real good
shape<00:04:08.880> I'm<00:04:09.540> happy<00:04:09.870> with<00:04:10.790> well<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.850> thought<00:04:12.000> I'd

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
shape I'm happy with well I thought I'd

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.530 
shape I'm happy with well I thought I'd
jump<00:04:12.270> back<00:04:12.420> in<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> truck<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:14.420> give<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.510> a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
jump back in the truck and give you a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.849 
jump back in the truck and give you a
shot<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.870> what<00:04:15.990> it<00:04:16.049> looks<00:04:16.230> like<00:04:16.380> without<00:04:16.560> the

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
shot of what it looks like without the

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.729 
shot of what it looks like without the
dash<00:04:17.549> in<00:04:17.820> there<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.180> this<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:18.930> just<00:04:19.109> great<00:04:19.470> I'm

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
dash in there and this is just great I'm

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.039 
dash in there and this is just great I'm
I'm<00:04:20.280> really<00:04:20.760> happy<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:21.060> did<00:04:21.120> this<00:04:21.330> because<00:04:21.750> it

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
I'm really happy I did this because it

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.950 
I'm really happy I did this because it
makes<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:22.890> lot<00:04:23.070> easier<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:24.210> get<00:04:24.360> in<00:04:24.510> here

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
makes it a lot easier to to get in here

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.010
