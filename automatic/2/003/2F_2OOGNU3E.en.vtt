8000 RPM red spring clutch spring so

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.060 
8000 RPM red spring clutch spring so
you'll<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:49.620> accurate<00:00:49.770> enough

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
you'll know if it's accurate enough

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.160 
you'll know if it's accurate enough
because<00:00:50.579> they'll<00:00:51.090> pull<00:00:51.270> away<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.780> roughly

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
because they'll pull away like roughly

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.889 
because they'll pull away like roughly
8,000<00:00:52.710> rpm<00:00:53.039> we're<00:00:53.190> guessing<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
8,000 rpm we're guessing so it's just a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:05.479 
8,000 rpm we're guessing so it's just a
turtle<00:00:55.410> on<00:01:02.750> see<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.780> at<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> moment<00:01:04.489> he's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
turtle on see that at the moment he's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:18.810 
turtle on see that at the moment he's
reading<00:01:05.909> nothing

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:02:25.800 

Oh

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.270 

think<00:02:26.810> I'll<00:02:27.019> just<00:02:27.140> run<00:02:27.500> out<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.680> petrol<00:02:28.069> that

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
think I'll just run out of petrol that

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.619 
think I'll just run out of petrol that
one<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:29.180> bunch<00:02:30.050> for<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:31.150> only<00:02:32.150> had<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> small

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
one a bunch for I only had a small

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.600 
one a bunch for I only had a small
amount<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:32.989> there<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.769> was<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.920> fourteen

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
amount in there so that was a fourteen

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.280 
amount in there so that was a fourteen
thousand<00:02:35.090> rpm<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:36.379> fourteen<00:02:36.800> thousand<00:02:38.290> one

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
thousand rpm for fourteen thousand one

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.470 
thousand rpm for fourteen thousand one
hundred<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.620> sixty<00:02:40.129> rpm<00:02:40.549> groups<00:02:40.849> ice<00:02:41.120> and

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
hundred and sixty rpm groups ice and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.410 
hundred and sixty rpm groups ice and
seem<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.080> be<00:02:42.170> pulling<00:02:42.440> away<00:02:42.530> good<00:02:43.060> get<00:02:44.060> on<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
seem to be pulling away good get on the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.509 
seem to be pulling away good get on the
mark<00:02:44.959> as<00:02:45.379> we<00:02:45.530> see<00:02:45.680> attempt<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.040> page<00:02:46.220> still

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
mark as we see attempt to page still

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.170 
mark as we see attempt to page still
working<00:02:46.879> well

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.190 

well<00:02:50.180> then<00:02:50.349> let's<00:02:51.349> seem<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.590> work<00:02:51.709> well<00:02:51.739> then

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
well then let's seem to work well then

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.479 
well then let's seem to work well then
so<00:02:54.200> if<00:02:54.530> you're<00:02:54.680> wondering<00:02:55.040> where<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.250> put<00:02:55.400> your

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
so if you're wondering where to put your

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.170 
so if you're wondering where to put your
sensor<00:02:55.849> on<00:02:55.940> an<00:02:56.090> RPM<00:02:56.510> on<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:57.110> baja<00:02:57.560> from<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.790> DX

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
sensor on an RPM on a baja from the DX

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.870 
sensor on an RPM on a baja from the DX
spectrum<00:02:59.810> s<00:03:00.260> then<00:03:00.799> that's<00:03:01.340> how<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.489> do<00:03:01.730> it

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
spectrum s then that's how you do it

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.610 
spectrum s then that's how you do it
look<00:03:02.060> at<00:03:02.180> my<00:03:02.299> other<00:03:02.390> video<00:03:02.959> when<00:03:03.200> you'll<00:03:03.380> see

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
look at my other video when you'll see

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.280 
look at my other video when you'll see
where<00:03:03.980> I'll<00:03:04.099> put<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:05.269> now<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.390> did<00:03:05.660> it<00:03:05.690> you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
where I'll put it and now I did it you

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.590 
where I'll put it and now I did it you
kill
