00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
often looking at the aim time I'm very

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.860 
often looking at the aim time I'm very
surprised<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.559> see<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.520> 2.7<00:01:00.210> seconds

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
surprised to see that it's 2.7 seconds

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.510 
surprised to see that it's 2.7 seconds
because<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.289> feels<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.590> lot<00:01:01.739> lower<00:01:02.039> than<00:01:02.190> that

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
because it feels a lot lower than that

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.579 
because it feels a lot lower than that
the<00:01:03.000> bloom<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> tank<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> accuracy

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the bloom on the tank and the accuracy

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.410 
the bloom on the tank and the accuracy
mean<00:01:05.100> you're<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.580> spend<00:01:05.850> very<00:01:06.270> little

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
mean you're going to spend very little

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.719 
mean you're going to spend very little
time<00:01:06.780> aiming<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:07.830> time<00:01:08.070> shooting<00:01:08.430> and

time aiming and more time shooting and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.940 
time aiming and more time shooting and
there's<00:01:09.689> where<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> upside<00:01:10.770> out

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
there's where we get to the upside out

there's where we get to the upside out
the<00:01:11.070> tank<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> damage<00:01:11.729> per<00:01:11.909> minute<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.390> about

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
the tank the damage per minute is about

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.039 
the tank the damage per minute is about
2100<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.610> very<00:01:14.970> good<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.630> tr7

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
2100 and that's very good for a tr7

little bit lower in the damage per
minute<00:01:20.220> Department<00:01:21.259> for<00:01:22.259> example<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> t29

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.149 
minute Department for example the t29
deals<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.299> 1,600<00:01:25.140> damage<00:01:25.439> per<00:01:25.619> minute<00:01:25.650> so

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159

in front of you I'm not saying you

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.209 
in front of you I'm not saying you

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
should just run out in front of

everybody and eat shots because your

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.929 
everybody and eat shots because your
life<00:01:58.110> expectancy<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.430> very<00:01:59.460> low

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
life expectancy is going to be very low

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.520 
life expectancy is going to be very low
I'm<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.630> saying<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.320> option

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
I'm just saying that it's a good option

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.609 
I'm just saying that it's a good option
to<00:02:01.920> keep<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.340> mind<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:03.479> armor<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> tank<00:02:04.320> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to keep in mind the armor on the tank is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.839 
to keep in mind the armor on the tank is
not<00:02:05.280> good<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.500> beyond<00:02:07.500> not<00:02:07.950> good<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
not good it is beyond not good the

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.059 
not good it is beyond not good the
listed<00:02:09.300> armor<00:02:09.569> thickness<00:02:09.780> isn't<00:02:10.349> terrible<00:02:10.830> so

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
listed armor thickness isn't terrible so

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.750 
listed armor thickness isn't terrible so
you're<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.520> have<00:02:11.610> some<00:02:12.120> protection

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
you're going to have some protection

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.059 
you're going to have some protection
against<00:02:13.180> things<00:02:13.480> like<00:02:13.599> over<00:02:14.170> matching<00:02:14.560> but

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
against things like over matching but

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.220 
against things like over matching but
the<00:02:15.220> problem<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.180> armor<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.569> straight<00:02:17.110> up

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
the problem is the armor is straight up

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.009 
the problem is the armor is straight up
and<00:02:17.409> down<00:02:17.470> with<00:02:17.860> no<00:02:18.069> angles<00:02:18.579> even<00:02:19.329> tanks<00:02:19.780> like

and down with no angles even tanks like

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.940
