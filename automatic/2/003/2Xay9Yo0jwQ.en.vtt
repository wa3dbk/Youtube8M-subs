00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 I have to admit that I've been looking 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.980
 exceptional animals around the world as 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.540
 This is one of them - the valencia- 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.700
 urban 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.940
 popularly known as val es visión 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.880
 these amazing creatures rest 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.700
 quiet in urban areas by phil a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.450
 22 kilos in weight and usually travel in 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.820
 herd 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.580
 they are easily distinguishable from 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.580
 others for their blue spine 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.440
 despite 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.940
 of being peaceful creatures and 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.100
 docile they will not hesitate to mark their 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.120
 territory 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:53.180
 in search of fertile females with whom 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.680
 copulate and have offspring 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.680
 do not you colleague rays 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.660
 or the shrewdness of having in my skull 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.660
 99 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.580
 normal 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 good 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.509
 for more 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.330
 the mothers will take me over 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.000
 today I came with a new video blog and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:30.340
 this time I will explain the bicycles 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.679
 shared and let's see 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.630
 against I think there are more things very 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:39.659
 good that he has them 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.490
 the bikes that you can have 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:48.030
 before you can take it to any 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.310
 hour is available 24 hours a day and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.009
 that means that you can take it 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.859
 both day and night surely 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.979
 many of you bastards take them 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:01.020
 with a fart you flip after leaving 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.439
 partying 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.140
 the poor are not for the affairs of 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.860
 functional mayor order 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.860
 for nothing 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.890
 Y 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.030
 power of day colleague 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.550
 pretty hard 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.540
 Let's bike tank has a 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.330
 great durability are tough 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.110
 I believe that it is running over someone 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.110
 is already 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.220
 the fertilizer let's say it's enough 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.800
 economic the bastards have gone 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.470
 rising little by little but good if at 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.819
 beginning it cost 18 euros and now it's 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.300
 about 24 euros 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:06.410
 and the truth still seems like a day 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.100
 think that 24 euros 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.100
 you can have 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.840
 24 degrees 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.110
 each one also another positive aspect 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.420
 is that you do not need to refuel 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.270
 obviously they go with your energy 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.610
 and they are unlimited or you do not have to 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.050
 to refuel and nothing that's a 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.790
 positive aspect because you also 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.060
 will save gas and does not pollute the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.830
 environment go by land and by water 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.830
 no kidding 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.050
 detail should be illuminated by their 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.330
 love such praise before the system of 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.590
 lights 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.080
 cons and cons has the weight are some 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.210
 little gorditas of 22 kilos of bonito 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.800
 number I think they have put them 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.800
 heavy so they can not be stolen 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:06.310
 they are there you take them and I tell you that they do not 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:10.640
 can take your fingernail something else negative 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.600
 the speed are broken the poor me not 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.240
 I have thrown because the team 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.030
 maintenance because to take care of 3000 bikes 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.980
 It takes time for the truth to be 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.360
 valencia a city not so big by 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.880
 example 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.320
 london the bicycle system 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.330
 shared that you have are 6,000 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.100
 bicycles for men social men 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.780
 this huge city compared to 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.030
 animal valence that has three thousand 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.950
 tickets at your disposal more things 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.440
 negative of the vall in bikes 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.540
 I do not know what mania these bikes have but 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.160
 when you want to take a bike 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.240
 although video station shows mind 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.580
 very bikes and it's your turn to look for other 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.430
 another thing is that when you have a 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.440
 bike and you want to leave that bike just 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.690
 It's full of murphy law bikes 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.810
 Pure style crisis because when you 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.150
 you need a bike there are no bikes and when 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.040
 you want to leave your bike there is no place to 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.550
 leave the bike is supposed 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.860
 that every 30 and the first 30 minutes 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.260
 who left the vine and are free but to 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.050
 the time you spend those 30 minutes you 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.440
 and directly charge your card 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.440
 credit 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.610
 now of a system you drive and 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:30.750
 just for the misfortune you go to a 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.490
 site and there is no gap because they are 15 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.569
 more minutes to look for that body 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.889
 that the truth 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:40.849
 rita jota decides who she is 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.849
 that happened 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:49.130
 and forget about when it's raining because you're going 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.130
 to wet 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.040
 but it is clicked because it does not have a camera 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.040
 whipped gum 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.460
 and you hit a voice and people and over 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.440
 you fall to the wet floor of nuns more 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.260
 most distinctive defenses understanding the 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.350

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:45.170
 a greeting and until another video chao and 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.270
