does they have the fractures and when i

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.890 
does they have the fractures and when i
use<00:00:36.730> them<00:00:36.940> for<00:00:37.120> my<00:00:37.240> otha<00:00:37.420> vehicle<00:00:37.720> roll

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
use them for my otha vehicle roll

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.280 
use them for my otha vehicle roll
instead<00:00:38.410> they<00:00:39.130> have<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.640> lot<00:00:40.030> less<00:00:40.240> drop<00:00:40.540> and<00:00:40.870> a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
instead they have a lot less drop and a

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.050 
instead they have a lot less drop and a
lot<00:00:41.530> faster<00:00:42.070> projectile<00:00:42.490> speed<00:00:42.670> so<00:00:42.880> they're

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
lot faster projectile speed so they're

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.850 
lot faster projectile speed so they're
easy<00:00:43.240> to<00:00:43.450> hit<00:00:43.540> with<00:00:43.780> honestly<00:00:44.560> I'm<00:00:44.680> not<00:00:44.740> sure

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
easy to hit with honestly I'm not sure

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.190 
easy to hit with honestly I'm not sure
about<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.220> dps<00:00:45.580> actually<00:00:46.000> but<00:00:46.480> they<00:00:46.810> are<00:00:46.960> not

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
about the dps actually but they are not

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:57.600 
about the dps actually but they are not
nearly<00:00:47.560> as<00:00:47.680> good<00:00:47.980> against<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.310> infantry<00:00:56.610> nice

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
nearly as good against the infantry nice

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:06.160 
nearly as good against the infantry nice
they're<00:00:58.210> nice<00:00:58.750> they're<00:00:59.110> with<00:00:59.350> a<00:00:59.380> c4

the things about Max's that makes them

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.469 
the things about Max's that makes them
as<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.100> rewarding<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.180> are<00:01:36.450> very

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
as a rewarding is that they are very

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.410 
as a rewarding is that they are very
very<00:01:37.350> useful<00:01:37.920> very<00:01:37.950> strong<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> base

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
very useful very strong in the base

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.999 
very useful very strong in the base
capture<00:01:39.720> mechanics<00:01:40.350> now<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.560> can't<00:01:40.799> capture

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
capture mechanics now you can't capture

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.620 
capture mechanics now you can't capture
any<00:01:41.340> points<00:01:41.640> while<00:01:41.790> you're<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.210> yourself

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
any points while you're in it yourself

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
any points while you're in it yourself
but<00:01:43.080> now<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.799> circuit<00:01:44.280> domination

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
but now with the circuit domination

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.430 
but now with the circuit domination
points<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.270> don't<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.960> worry<00:01:46.200> about

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
points you don't have to worry about

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.130 
points you don't have to worry about
being<00:01:46.890> left<00:01:47.160> out<00:01:47.490> which<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.270> something<00:01:48.929> that<00:01:49.080> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
being left out which is something that I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.590 
being left out which is something that I
realized<00:01:49.679> that<00:01:49.830> I<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.429> missing<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.880> lot<00:01:51.060> when<00:01:51.570> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
realized that I was missing a lot when I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480 
realized that I was missing a lot when I
was<00:01:51.659> flying<00:01:52.020> again<00:01:52.830> of<00:01:52.920> course<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.340> keep

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
was flying again of course they keep

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.880 
was flying again of course they keep
track<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.940> map<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:55.050> fly<00:01:55.289> over<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
track of the map and just fly over a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.550 
track of the map and just fly over a
base<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.940> empire<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.690> capturing<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
base that your empire is capturing and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.109 
base that your empire is capturing and
you<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:58.860> get<00:01:58.950> those<00:01:59.159> points<00:01:59.670> even<00:01:59.819> if<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
you will get those points even if you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.630 
you will get those points even if you
just<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.569> for<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.750> few<00:02:00.869> seconds<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:02.069> i

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
just there for a few seconds but i

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.550 
just there for a few seconds but i
always<00:02:02.850> keep<00:02:03.149> forgetting<00:02:03.569> that<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.229> now<00:02:04.350> in

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
always keep forgetting that so now in

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.710 
always keep forgetting that so now in
certain<00:02:04.920> crowded<00:02:05.550> situations<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.360> splash

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
certain crowded situations the splash

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.359 
certain crowded situations the splash
damage<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.259> these<00:02:07.409> pounders<00:02:07.890> are<00:02:08.009> actually

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
damage of these pounders are actually

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.630 
damage of these pounders are actually
quite<00:02:08.580> effective<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.220> this<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.519> those

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
quite effective and this is one of those

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.180 
quite effective and this is one of those
situations<00:02:11.819> I'm<00:02:12.540> shooting<00:02:12.959> down<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
situations I'm shooting down on the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.850 
situations I'm shooting down on the
players<00:02:14.459> below<00:02:15.000> me<00:02:15.209> here<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.630> if<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.350> miss<00:02:16.410> them

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
players below me here and if I miss them

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.160 
players below me here and if I miss them
then<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.940> splash<00:02:18.180> damage<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.750> ground<00:02:18.959> is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
then the splash damage on the ground is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.229 
then the splash damage on the ground is
still<00:02:19.290> going<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.650> do<00:02:19.799> significant<00:02:20.340> damage<00:02:20.519> now

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
still going to do significant damage now

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.509 
still going to do significant damage now
there's<00:02:21.390> been<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.570> lot<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.810> talk<00:02:22.350> about<00:02:22.530> balance

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
there's been a lot of talk about balance

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.920 
there's been a lot of talk about balance
when<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.760> comes<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.510> pounders

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
when it comes to the pounders

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.380 
when it comes to the pounders
specifically<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:26.010> don't<00:02:26.820> see<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.060> big

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
specifically I don't see the big

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.750 
specifically I don't see the big
difference<00:02:27.810> between<00:02:27.930> these<00:02:28.470> weapons<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.280> any

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
difference between these weapons and any

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.520 
difference between these weapons and any
other<00:02:29.910> weapons<00:02:30.329> I<00:02:30.600> think<00:02:30.959> they're<00:02:31.079> all<00:02:31.230> very

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
other weapons I think they're all very

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.949 
other weapons I think they're all very
very<00:02:31.860> strong<00:02:32.220> that's<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.150> me<00:02:33.239> there<00:02:33.870> are

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
very strong that's just me there are

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.509 
very strong that's just me there are
always<00:02:34.110> going<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.440> be<00:02:34.470> situations<00:02:35.040> where<00:02:35.130> one

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
always going to be situations where one

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.920 
always going to be situations where one
and<00:02:35.700> max<00:02:35.850> weapon<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.329> going<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.660> be<00:02:36.780> better

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and max weapon is going to be better

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.110 
and max weapon is going to be better
than<00:02:37.200> another<00:02:37.440> max<00:02:37.709> weapon<00:02:38.160> but<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.850> seems<00:02:39.000> to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
than another max weapon but it seems to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.210 
than another max weapon but it seems to
me<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.840> any<00:02:40.079> area<00:02:40.500> or<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.769> fight<00:02:41.010> that

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
me that in any area or in a fight that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.360 
me that in any area or in a fight that
is<00:02:41.370> supposed<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.820> be<00:02:42.000> dominated<00:02:42.510> by<00:02:42.540> infantry

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
is supposed to be dominated by infantry

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.819 
is supposed to be dominated by infantry
Max's<00:02:44.370> are<00:02:44.549> just<00:02:44.730> dominating<00:02:45.200> infantry<00:02:46.200> but

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
Max's are just dominating infantry but

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.440 
Max's are just dominating infantry but
then<00:02:46.980> again<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.459> think<00:02:47.820> most<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.090> us<00:02:48.299> already

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
then again I think most of us already

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.080 
then again I think most of us already
know<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.230> that's<00:02:49.680> my<00:02:49.920> opinion<00:02:50.190> you're<00:02:50.880> going

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
second one which means that I had to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.090 
second one which means that I had to
play<00:04:05.060> for<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.390> couple<00:04:05.959> of<00:04:06.110> more<00:04:06.440> days<00:04:06.470> until<00:04:06.860> I

play for a couple of more days until I
got<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.790> erection<00:04:08.209> for<00:04:08.330> both<00:04:08.510> arms<00:04:08.930> so

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
got to the erection for both arms so

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.870 
got to the erection for both arms so
some<00:04:09.709> people<00:04:09.920> actually<00:04:09.980> argue<00:04:10.430> that<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.760> day

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
some people actually argue that the day

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.150 
some people actually argue that the day
pounders<00:04:11.269> is<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.840> best<00:04:12.049> weapon<00:04:12.470> against

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
pounders is the best weapon against

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.940 
pounders is the best weapon against
infantry<00:04:13.489> players<00:04:13.790> I<00:04:14.120> disagree<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:15.110> I<00:04:15.380> think

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
infantry players I disagree that I think

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.130 
infantry players I disagree that I think
that<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.190> mercy<00:04:16.580> was<00:04:16.729> better<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.959> same

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
that the mercy was better and the same

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.330 
that the mercy was better and the same
way<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.350> blue<00:04:18.620> shift<00:04:18.859> of<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.100> vanu

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
way the blue shift of the vanu

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.949 
way the blue shift of the vanu
sovereignty<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:20.269> me<00:04:20.359> those<00:04:20.510> weapons<00:04:20.750> are

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
sovereignty to me those weapons are

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.290 
sovereignty to me those weapons are
actually<00:04:21.229> a<00:04:21.260> very<00:04:21.470> similar<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.130> at<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.120> end

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
actually a very similar and at the end

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.670 
actually a very similar and at the end
of<00:04:23.390> this<00:04:23.510> video<00:04:23.690> I'm<00:04:24.020> going<00:04:24.140> to<00:04:24.200> show<00:04:24.380> you<00:04:24.440> the

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
of this video I'm going to show you the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.490 
of this video I'm going to show you the
onslaught<00:04:25.280> which<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.790> started<00:04:26.120> using<00:04:26.500> I've

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
onslaught which I started using I've

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.140 
onslaught which I started using I've
only<00:04:27.620> used<00:04:27.800> them<00:04:28.040> once<00:04:28.340> or<00:04:28.669> twice<00:04:28.820> actually

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
only used them once or twice actually

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.659 
only used them once or twice actually
but<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.410> far<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.680> actually<00:04:30.860> think<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.280> the

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
but so far I actually think that the

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.550 
but so far I actually think that the
dedicated<00:04:32.300> in<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:32.600> infantry<00:04:32.900> weapons<00:04:33.260> are

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
dedicated in the infantry weapons are

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.620 
dedicated in the infantry weapons are
still<00:04:33.919> better<00:04:34.220> against<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.760> infantry<00:04:35.240> than

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
still better against the infantry than

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.239 
still better against the infantry than
the<00:04:36.110> pounders

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:40.249 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.790
