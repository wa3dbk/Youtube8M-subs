00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.689
 [Music] 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:09.730
 how are you I hope they are perfect I 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.950
 I'm super happy that you're watching 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.980
 another one of my videos seriously 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.619
 thank you very much today I wanted to upload 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.630
 a very simple look is what I use done 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.089
 to leave on a normal day and I want 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.909
 see different but not so produced today 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:27.640
 it's very simple for you to be able to 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:30.400
 go out on the street any day with a 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.529
 father combination in your eyes I wanted to use 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.289
 this pencil that is man in cream what 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.600
 I bought and wanted to show you nothing more than 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.000
 you can also see how cute this cost me 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.160
 super cheap like about 15 pesos or something 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.750
 so it's just to see that 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.699
 touch you can give your makeup 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.609
 daily to see that little bit different 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.609
 I want you to see very well how I made this 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.650
 look already at this precise moment we are going to 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.930
 see how it is done 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.970
 this time I will start all different 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.160
 my videos and first I'm going to put the 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.960
 liquid makeup all over the face 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.790
 [Music] 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.280
 let's take our corrector well 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.590
 creamy and we're going to put it in the area 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:18.340
 the dark circles you can blur it to 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.830
 tap with your fingers we put our 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.130
 base of shadows or first all over the 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.130
 eyelid 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.240
 now we are going to seal all this with 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.100
 our powder 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.650
 [Music] 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.000
 with our eyebrow shadow we are going to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.370
 delineate the and color the very well 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.680
 this is the cream shadow pencil that 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.170
 I told you what we're going to use is this 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.450
 mark you can have any other and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.410
 we will apply it as eyeliner with 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.410
 very careful 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.600
 you could use any other color that 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.030
 I combined that day 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.890
 [Music] 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.830
 you can clean the tip with a paper 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.680
 so that he repaints a lot better 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.380
 try that in the end is this little tail 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.920
 and now with our liquid eyeliner 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.680
 let's start to be very very thin 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.230
 our delineated 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.469
 this must be a little bit more 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.049
 perfection so take your time and 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.930
 do it also with a tail here at 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.850
 final 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.580
 [Music] 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.620
 I first make the figure and then the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.220
 filling because it makes me a little bit more 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.060
 easy 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.310
 [Music] 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.540
 and more or less that way the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.540
 double delineated 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:55.650
 in china more lashes and then we put 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.650
 mascara many many layers 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.290
 do not forget to put mascara on the eyelashes 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.290
 down 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.680
 if something is stained better use a 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.990
 cotton swab for cleaning 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.180
 let's put the blush that you like 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.090
 [Music] 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.549
 for the lips this time I'm going to 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.849
 use this matte colored rosita that is 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.849
 divine and ready this is the final look 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.050
 I hope you liked it very much 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.690
 this video because although they do not create it the 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.150
 I do with a lot of love, it gives me a lot 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.460
 satisfaction to know that someone likes 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.220
 someone serves him and someone sees me 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.680

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.520
 describe what they will see in the why 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.520
 suddenly they tell me 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:22.380
 and will embody the video and the title of that 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.150
 thousand of exaggerated and daring that I 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.160
