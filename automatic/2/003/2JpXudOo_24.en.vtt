00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
have a dual layer one you don't want to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.730 
have a dual layer one you don't want to
be<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:03.090> pretty<00:02:03.570> marked<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.619> will

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
be like it's pretty marked up so it will

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.010 
be like it's pretty marked up so it will
show<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:06.360> way<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.509> understand

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
show you you can that way you understand

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.680 
show you you can that way you understand
your<00:02:07.500> space<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.039> feel<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> DVD<00:02:08.729> so

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
your space and I feel that on the DVD so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.640 
your space and I feel that on the DVD so
you<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.869> add<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> couple<00:02:10.200> files<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
you can add a couple files and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
you can add a couple files and
then<00:02:12.220> what<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.790> does<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.269> it<00:02:13.420> converts<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:13.930> to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
then what this does is it converts it to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.140 
then what this does is it converts it to
the<00:02:15.670> DVD<00:02:16.540> format<00:02:17.140> for<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:18.519> have<00:02:18.670> your<00:02:18.790> formats

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
the DVD format for you have your formats

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.240 
the DVD format for you have your formats
right<00:02:19.299> here<00:02:19.629> in<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:20.500> US<00:02:20.769> so<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.069> use<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.459> TSE<00:02:22.150> and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
right here in the US so I use a TSE and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.470 
right here in the US so I use a TSE and
should<00:02:24.250> have<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.700> look<00:02:24.879> at<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.180> does<00:02:25.329> have

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
should have a look at that it does have

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.220 
should have a look at that it does have
pal<00:02:25.659> so<00:02:26.079> you<00:02:26.140> get<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.680> PL<00:02:27.099> for<00:02:27.909> if<00:02:28.180> you're<00:02:28.390> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
pal so you get the PL for if you're the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.720 
pal so you get the PL for if you're the
European<00:02:29.799> countries<00:02:30.099> I<00:02:30.220> guess<00:02:30.370> that's<00:02:30.579> where

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
European countries I guess that's where

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.009 
European countries I guess that's where
they<00:02:30.819> use<00:02:30.970> them<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:33.370> want<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.579> use<00:02:33.730> that

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
they use them but you want to use that

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.530 
they use them but you want to use that
