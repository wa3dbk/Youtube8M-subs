00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 teams racing has been flea 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.280
 I am video blogger and will be here today 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.599
 Test the team 40 f 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.099
 I will be the six big ones here 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.269
 riding a roller coaster that means I will 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.519
 most of my time probably 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.940
 spend upside down and you can with 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.940
 to be there 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.919
 important here is colossus that is the 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.250
 highest wooden roller coaster in Europe 60 meters 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.419
 high 110 km h fast and 45 g 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.829
 you pressed into the seat and like yourself 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.949
 I can feel it now 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.949
 on 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.020
 so that was cool out I have 15 now 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.550
 Collect miles on the twitter app 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.550
 can I make now 111 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.990
 and then it starts after the first 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.990
 train 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.760
 here she finds the flight of the demons that 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.650
 there germany first winkler the 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.180
 means one sits virtually not on the 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.630
 but seemed beside it 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.670
 your feet dangle in the air, so to speak 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.590
 In total, you are five times head over 800 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.760
 meter long is the whole roller coaster 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.760
 I would say let's go 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.120
 then I'm still a tip to the train 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.980
 is to give then that is you trying 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.900
 either to top or to put 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.610
 At the very back of the back you just have one 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.650
 again much more this feeling of 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.460
 upside down and out at the side 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.680
 Of course you hang and you have the front 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.670
 simply a great view so completely 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.670
 in the front or the whole way 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.340
 we are now in hydraulic space 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.260
 of the upgrade and up here wants one 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.610
 metal chair that will be the train 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.410
 on the rollercoaster, so to speak 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.790
 catapults so there is no mountain 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.590
 the first up and then down 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.520
 the whole thing goes inside 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.970
 from 24 seconds from zero to 100 km / h 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.680
 5.1 g 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.700
 that is quite a blatant 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.690
 power and 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.690
 curious; excited 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.130
 so that was now Germany's first 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.360
 catapult roller coaster and of course 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.950
 I also scan the qr-code here and 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:55.570
 Of course I also do that with alfie 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:57.130
 the miller km is the limit 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.840
 North Germany's only slopes 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.280
 looping track and it fits 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.480
 here the limits special where it is 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.250
 is super sharp and if you have them 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.250
 this is how it works 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.290
 June 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.440
 b klub the classic here in the heath park 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.230
 four times upside down two loopings 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.210
 and two spirals worldwide unique 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.020
 course and I would say that 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.020
 Let's take a look now 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.710
 I am standing here now in front of the octopus 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.480
 is Germany's first dive coaster 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.430
 means you stay there for a short while 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.200
 stand up with your feet above you 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.820
 dangle abyss and then falls into this 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.299
 ask in it's even more 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.010
 looping the loop 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.430
 I am very much looking forward to this 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.430
 roller coaster 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.939
 I made it I am now 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.289

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.360
