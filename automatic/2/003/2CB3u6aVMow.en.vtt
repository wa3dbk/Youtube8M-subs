00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.650
 Hello everyone, today let's prepare together a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.650
 sweet tiramisu semifreddo 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:27.000
 the ingredients for this recipe are 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.990
 400 g of biscuits 5 egg yolks plus three 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.050
 album the 150 g of sugar 500 grams of 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.660
 mascarpone 250 milliliters of cream from 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.870
 fit sweetened coffee as required 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.420
 cocoa bitter enough for first thing 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 let's whip the cold cream from the fridge until stiff 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.870
 stop 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.960
 when it is mounted we let it rest 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.140
 in the fridge and continue with the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.140
 Preparation 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.940
 then divide the egg whites from the yolks 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.550
 don't forget that for the recipe there 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.380
 3 moves plus two shifts will be needed 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.410
 therefore two egg whites will be placed by 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.410
 part 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.630
 add the egg yolks and the sugar e 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.470
 we beat up to make the mixture 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.470
 clear and fluffy 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.899
 then add the mascarpone and 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.799
 working with whips we do the 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.799
 mariech hut scream 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.640
 at this point we add a pinch of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.210
 salt the egg whites and whisk them up 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.210
 stop 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.600
 we just have to assemble everything 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.490
 so like a spatula doing a lot 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.500
 attention so that all Russian mountains 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.330
 let the yolk mixture absorb 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.330
 and mascarpone first the cream 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.819
 and finally the egg whites we always mix 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.079
 from top to bottom gently 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.579
 our land is ready 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.159
 let's put it in the fridge while we proceed 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.049
 then with a lining a mold 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.599
 we take a pan will tell us to draw 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.159
 the fund with the card stopped now 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.319
 taking the height measurement of the 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:36.109
 our mold we cut the biscuits that 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.389
 we will need them to coat the edges in 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.879
 on squares and sweetened coffee only 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:43.189
 from the part that will go inside then 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.019
 the unsweetened Sardinian face e 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.709
 we position there along all the edges 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.709
 of the mold 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.220
 we always see even with the ladyfingers 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.349
 basis of our parfait this time 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.980
 however we insult the ladyfingers in coffee 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.980
 canceled 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.150
 we just have to pour on ours 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.150
 base the cream 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.650
 if you want at the center we can put the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.420
 ladyfingers we cut 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.020
 at the beginning always on when there 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.100
 then lightly in the coffee we cover 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.100
 that distant grima 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.170
 we bring the surface back with the help of 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.170
 a fork 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.340
 and sprinkle with bitter cocoa 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.680
 in our semifreddo it now goes into 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.180
 freezer for at least three firings 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.800
 an hour before serving let's pull it 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.450
 out of the freezer and put them in 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.010
 fridge
