the one problem with this is because

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.149 
the one problem with this is because
apple's<00:01:36.509> interface<00:01:36.930> doesn't<00:01:37.470> expect<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
be able to do something like this even

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.850 
be able to do something like this even
if<00:01:39.600> you're<00:01:39.720> interacting<00:01:40.350> you'll<00:01:40.500> still<00:01:40.740> have

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
if you're interacting you'll still have

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.880 
if you're interacting you'll still have
your<00:01:40.920> timer<00:01:41.540> in<00:01:42.540> terms<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.049> how<00:01:43.439> quickly<00:01:43.680> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
your timer in terms of how quickly it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.069 
your timer in terms of how quickly it
goes<00:01:44.070> off<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.640> that's<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.149> issue<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.689> it

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
goes off so that's one issue but it

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
goes off so that's one issue but it
definitely<00:01:46.439> makes<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.770> much<00:01:46.979> more<00:01:47.250> usable

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
definitely makes this much more usable

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.580 
definitely makes this much more usable
and<00:01:48.770> makes<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.979> something<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.000> i<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:52.500> know

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
and makes it something that i you know

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.340 
and makes it something that i you know
really<00:01:52.950> enjoy<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.270> once<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:54.750> go<00:01:54.899> ahead<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
really enjoy so once we go ahead and

this<00:05:24.699> is<00:05:24.880> really<00:05:25.060> cool<00:05:25.270> in<00:05:25.449> conjunction<00:05:25.810> with

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
this is really cool in conjunction with

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.330 
this is really cool in conjunction with
processes<00:05:26.500> and<00:05:26.680> as<00:05:26.800> well<00:05:27.270> available<00:05:28.270> memory

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
processes and as well available memory

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.499 
processes and as well available memory
it<00:05:30.340> makes<00:05:30.580> it<00:05:30.789> really<00:05:31.389> easy<00:05:31.590> to<00:05:33.030> know<00:05:34.030> how<00:05:34.360> much

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
it makes it really easy to know how much

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.240 
it makes it really easy to know how much
resources<00:05:34.990> you<00:05:35.229> have<00:05:35.470> when<00:05:35.650> you're<00:05:35.800> using<00:05:35.979> say

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
resources you have when you're using say

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
background err so you also have more

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.649 
background err so you also have more

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
refreshed dock respring and power power

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.180

turned<00:05:40.900> it<00:05:40.990> off<00:05:41.110> free<00:05:41.349> spring<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:41.919> will<00:05:42.009> reach

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
turned it off free spring and will reach

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.219 
turned it off free spring and will reach
spring<00:05:42.430> your<00:05:42.550> spring<00:05:42.789> would<00:05:43.000> refresh<00:05:43.570> and

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
spring your spring would refresh and

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.020 
spring your spring would refresh and
will<00:05:44.349> go<00:05:44.470> to<00:05:44.500> more<00:05:44.800> this<00:05:45.370> basically<00:05:45.699> you<00:05:45.789> can

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
will go to more this basically you can

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.689 
will go to more this basically you can
set<00:05:46.240> more<00:05:46.479> toggles<00:05:47.169> and<00:05:47.349> dock<00:05:47.979> applications

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
set more toggles and dock applications

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.339 
set more toggles and dock applications
as<00:05:48.820> well<00:05:49.000> so<00:05:49.180> I'll<00:05:49.240> show<00:05:49.419> you<00:05:49.479> toggles<00:05:50.169> you

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
as well so I'll show you toggles you

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.390 
as well so I'll show you toggles you
just<00:05:50.500> have<00:05:50.620> different<00:05:50.889> things<00:05:51.039> so<00:05:51.190> you<00:05:51.280> could

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
just have different things so you could

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.670 
just have different things so you could
turn<00:05:51.550> location<00:05:52.030> services<00:05:52.389> all<00:05:52.659> on<00:05:52.840> or<00:05:53.020> off<00:05:53.169> you

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
turn location services all on or off you

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.260 
turn location services all on or off you
could<00:05:53.860> put<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.520> phone<00:05:54.669> into<00:05:54.849> airplane<00:05:54.880> mode

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
could put the phone into airplane mode

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.600 
could put the phone into airplane mode
right<00:05:55.599> from<00:05:55.840> there<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.349> dock<00:05:56.770> application<00:05:57.430> so

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
right from there and dock application so

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.770 
right from there and dock application so
basically<00:05:57.880> you<00:05:58.030> could<00:05:58.120> have<00:05:58.300> an<00:05:58.389> application

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
basically you could have an application

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.390 
basically you could have an application
that<00:05:59.020> you<00:05:59.110> want<00:05:59.259> to<00:05:59.320> be<00:05:59.409> able<00:05:59.469> to<00:05:59.620> launch<00:05:59.800> we

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
that you want to be able to launch we

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.450

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
could say through here through the

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.920 
could say through here through the
search<00:06:03.699> but<00:06:04.180> you<00:06:04.240> don't<00:06:04.389> want<00:06:04.509> there<00:06:04.659> to<00:06:04.690> be<00:06:04.810> an
