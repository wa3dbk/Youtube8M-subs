both<00:02:09.910> my<00:02:10.119> side<00:02:10.539> as<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.140> can<00:02:11.319> see<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:12.010> did<00:02:12.400> four

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
both my side as you can see I did four

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.430 
both my side as you can see I did four
one<00:02:13.420> two<00:02:13.810> three

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.830 

and<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.950> did<00:02:17.100> four<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:17.670> as<00:02:17.820> well<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.570> they're

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
and I did four here as well and they're

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.260 
and I did four here as well and they're
really<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.320> perfect<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.040> guys<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:21.030> that's

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
really not perfect you guys but that's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.690 
really not perfect you guys but that's
okay<00:02:21.600> because<00:02:22.040> we're<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:23.220> gonna<00:02:23.310> stretch

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
okay because we're just gonna stretch

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.810 
okay because we're just gonna stretch
them<00:02:23.970> out<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.210> a<00:02:24.270> little<00:02:24.510> bite<00:02:24.690> egging<00:02:25.080> on<00:02:25.170> them

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
them out of a little bite egging on them

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.040 
them out of a little bite egging on them
so<00:02:26.820> it's<00:02:27.330> kind<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.480> hard<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.690> do<00:02:27.840> when<00:02:27.960> I'm

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
so it's kind of hard to do when I'm

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.090 
so it's kind of hard to do when I'm
holding<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.680> I'm<00:02:29.190> with<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.520> camera<00:02:30.060> but<00:02:31.100> let

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
holding one I'm with the camera but let

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.270 
holding one I'm with the camera but let
me<00:02:32.190> see<00:02:32.430> what<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.670> do<00:02:33.060> no<00:02:33.960> you're<00:02:34.920> not<00:02:34.980> next

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
hands and you would just pretty much

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.340
