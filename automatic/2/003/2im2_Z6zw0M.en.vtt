we<00:00:04.690> like<00:00:04.870> to<00:00:04.900> think<00:00:05.170> of<00:00:05.260> liquitex<00:00:05.590> products<00:00:06.040> as

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:06.189 
we like to think of liquitex products as

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:07.830 
we like to think of liquitex products as
a<00:00:06.250> professional<00:00:06.970> acrylic<00:00:07.330> system

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:07.840 
a professional acrylic system

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.030 
a professional acrylic system
yeah<00:00:08.080> and<00:00:08.200> that's<00:00:08.260> because<00:00:08.620> they<00:00:08.710> can<00:00:08.830> all<00:00:09.010> be

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
yeah and that's because they can all be

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.730 
yeah and that's because they can all be
mixed<00:00:09.550> together<00:00:09.700> easily<00:00:10.410> yeah<00:00:11.410> you've<00:00:11.560> got<00:00:11.710> a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
mixed together easily yeah you've got a

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.830

chisel<00:00:20.950> and<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.280> fine<00:00:21.520> nib<00:00:22.000> yeah<00:00:22.510> now<00:00:22.660> when

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
chisel and the fine nib yeah now when

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.480 
chisel and the fine nib yeah now when
the<00:00:22.960> Lotus<00:00:23.110> with<00:00:23.320> this<00:00:23.440> all<00:00:23.740> the<00:00:23.800> same<00:00:24.130> color

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
the Lotus with this all the same color

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.460 
the Lotus with this all the same color
but<00:00:24.789> in<00:00:25.030> in<00:00:25.300> something<00:00:25.630> like<00:00:25.720> spray<00:00:26.140> or

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
but in in something like spray or

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.890 
but in in something like spray or
markers<00:00:27.039> it's<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:27.970> delivery<00:00:28.240> system<00:00:28.750> there

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
markers it's the delivery system there

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.620 
markers it's the delivery system there
because<00:00:29.170> you<00:00:29.260> have<00:00:29.440> such<00:00:29.619> a<00:00:29.650> fine<00:00:30.550> mist<00:00:30.910> of<00:00:31.210> the

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
because you have such a fine mist of the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.540 
because you have such a fine mist of the
spray<00:00:32.379> that<00:00:32.410> comes<00:00:32.800> out<00:00:32.980> in<00:00:33.190> this<00:00:33.309> case

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
spray that comes out in this case

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.160 
spray that comes out in this case
because<00:00:34.270> you<00:00:34.329> have<00:00:34.449> a<00:00:34.480> very<00:00:34.690> very<00:00:34.809> thin<00:00:35.140> layer

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
because you have a very very thin layer

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.200 
because you have a very very thin layer
of<00:00:35.679> what<00:00:35.800> comes<00:00:36.039> out<00:00:36.219> in<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.519> markers<00:00:36.999> to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
of what comes out in the markers to

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.790 
of what comes out in the markers to
seeing<00:00:37.569> some<00:00:37.749> of<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:37.899> papers<00:00:38.229> showing

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
seeing some of the papers showing

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.349 
seeing some of the papers showing
through<00:00:39.069> there<00:00:39.219> so<00:00:39.609> you<00:00:39.670> almost<00:00:40.120> get<00:00:40.329> a

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
through there so you almost get a

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.599 
through there so you almost get a
difference<00:00:40.690> between<00:00:40.929> a<00:00:40.960> mass<00:00:41.199> tone<00:00:41.530> and<00:00:42.100> an

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
difference between a mass tone and an

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.090 
difference between a mass tone and an
undertone<00:00:43.179> right<00:00:43.479> there<00:00:43.749> but<00:00:44.469> same<00:00:44.649> color<00:00:44.920> all

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
undertone right there but same color all

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.770 
undertone right there but same color all
the<00:00:45.190> way<00:00:45.249> across<00:00:45.429> I<00:00:45.850> also<00:00:46.089> have<00:00:46.329> that<00:00:46.479> heater

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
the way across I also have that heater

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.930 
the way across I also have that heater
what<00:00:47.350> we've<00:00:47.499> done<00:00:47.739> is<00:00:48.100> we<00:00:48.429> put<00:00:48.609> a<00:00:48.670> strip<00:00:48.850> of

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
soft body across here and then we put

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.399 
soft body across here and then we put
the<00:00:51.129> ink<00:00:51.280> on<00:00:51.460> top<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.850> that<00:00:51.999> heavy<00:00:52.780> body<00:00:53.049> over

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
because we're using the same acrylic

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.240 
because we're using the same acrylic
pigments<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.489> binder<00:01:04.770> yeah<00:01:05.770> why<00:01:06.070> don't<00:01:06.130> we

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250

you get a little bit of green that comes
through<00:01:35.830> there<00:01:36.010> and<00:01:48.480> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:50.560> mix<00:01:50.710> those<00:01:50.860> two

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
through there and you can mix those two

that in if we wanted to add what else
let's<00:01:56.530> add<00:01:56.740> some<00:01:57.190> other<00:01:58.120> color<00:01:58.450> in<00:01:58.750> there

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
let's add some other color in there

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.350 
let's add some other color in there
again<00:01:59.860> these<00:02:00.010> are<00:02:00.159> all<00:02:00.190> compatible<00:02:00.700> now<00:02:01.180> that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
again these are all compatible now that

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.180 
again these are all compatible now that
wouldn't<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:01.960> wouldn't<00:02:02.260> be<00:02:02.350> possible<00:02:02.620> if

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
wouldn't that wouldn't be possible if

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.920 
wouldn't that wouldn't be possible if
this<00:02:03.370> was<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.580> solvent<00:02:04.060> based<00:02:04.090> spray<00:02:04.720> we

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
this was a solvent based spray we

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.450 
this was a solvent based spray we
wouldn't<00:02:05.170> be<00:02:05.260> able<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.440> put<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.950> water-based

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
wouldn't be able to put a water-based

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.950 
wouldn't be able to put a water-based
acrylic<00:02:06.550> in<00:02:06.909> salt<00:02:07.120> and<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.270> spray<00:02:07.510> you<00:02:07.659> get<00:02:07.810> this

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
acrylic in salt and a spray you get this

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.380 
acrylic in salt and a spray you get this
gunk<00:02:08.409> it's<00:02:09.129> kind<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.369> just<00:02:09.489> messed<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.179> we

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
gunk it's kind of just messed that we

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.660 
gunk it's kind of just messed that we
wouldn't<00:02:11.019> want<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.290> go<00:02:11.409> together<00:02:11.709> so<00:02:12.549> it's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
wouldn't want to go together so it's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.339 
wouldn't want to go together so it's
nice<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.849> be<00:02:12.999> able<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.180> do<00:02:13.329> that<00:02:13.510> now<00:02:13.930> obviously

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
nice to be able to do that now obviously

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.680 
nice to be able to do that now obviously
