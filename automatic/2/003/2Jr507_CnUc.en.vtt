started we have to change those values

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.220 
started we have to change those values
in<00:02:15.110> unity<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.970> quick<00:02:17.180> way<00:02:17.390> for<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.990> is

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
in unity the quick way for that is is

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.440 
in unity the quick way for that is is
just<00:02:18.260> go<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:19.040> date<00:02:21.069> pray<00:02:22.069> settings<00:02:22.840> imp<00:02:25.450> we

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
just go to a date pray settings imp we

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.820 
just go to a date pray settings imp we
will<00:02:26.720> find<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:28.000> pretty<00:02:29.000> finit<00:02:30.550> joystick<00:02:31.660> and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
will find this pretty finit joystick and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.340 
will find this pretty finit joystick and
we<00:02:33.830> have<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.400> change<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.970> mouse<00:02:35.239> X<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
we have to change the mouse X and the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.140 
we have to change the mouse X and the
mouth<00:02:36.590> one<00:02:39.430> sensitivity<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.519> have<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.940> set

mouth one sensitivity you have to set

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.580 
mouth one sensitivity you have to set
the<00:02:41.300> one<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:43.250> value<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.209> set<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.660> 0.5

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
the one that value have to set the 0.5

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.540 
the one that value have to set the 0.5
this<00:02:46.160> value<00:02:46.550> just<00:02:46.850> for<00:02:46.940> do<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.239> little<00:02:47.959> delay

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
this value just for do a little delay

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.290 
this value just for do a little delay
for<00:02:50.019> or<00:02:51.019> did<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.440> sensitivity<00:02:52.340> because<00:02:53.090> when

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
for or did the sensitivity because when

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.090 
for or did the sensitivity because when
you<00:02:53.450> download<00:02:53.989> your<00:02:54.350> project<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:54.980> the

you download your project to the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.729 
you download your project to the
PlayStation<00:02:55.670> Vita<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.600> sensitivity<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.470> too

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
PlayStation Vita the sensitivity is too

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.580 
PlayStation Vita the sensitivity is too
high<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:59.140> was<00:03:00.140> using<00:03:00.590> us<00:03:02.110> different<00:03:03.110> values

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
high so I was using us different values

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.390 
high so I was using us different values
for<00:03:04.360> test<00:03:05.360> my<00:03:05.569> projects<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.620> one<00:03:06.830> works

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
for test my projects and this one works

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.670 
for test my projects and this one works
good<00:03:07.760> for<00:03:07.790> me<00:03:08.180> but<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.810> can<00:03:09.019> change<00:03:09.260> if<00:03:09.530> you

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
good for me but you can change if you

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.900 
good for me but you can change if you
want<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.690> here<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.950> important<00:03:13.459> thing

we have to change the sensitivity to 1
that<00:03:34.489> value<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.660> this<00:03:36.109> one<00:03:36.380> should<00:03:36.590> be<00:03:36.620> invert

Johnny now just take one so right now
this<00:03:49.840> configuration<00:03:50.260> should<00:03:51.190> be<00:03:51.400> worth<00:03:51.640> so

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
this configuration should be worth so

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.000 
this configuration should be worth so
let's<00:03:53.110> try<00:03:53.560> make<00:03:54.459> sure<00:03:54.760> first<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.780> are
