like<00:00:28.199> cycling<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> huge<00:00:29.609> sport<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
like cycling is not a huge sport in the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.060 
like cycling is not a huge sport in the
United<00:00:30.300> States<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.140> I've<00:00:31.260> had<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.650> inform

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
United States so I've had to inform

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.880 
United States so I've had to inform
myself<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.910> from<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> gather<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.739> do

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
myself and from what I gather you can do

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.500 
myself and from what I gather you can do
a<00:00:34.920> restart<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.850> there's<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> mechanical

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
a restart if there's a mechanical

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.540 
a restart if there's a mechanical
failure<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.530> from<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> stories<00:00:38.280> I've

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
failure but from all the stories I've

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.819 
failure but from all the stories I've
seen<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> internet<00:00:39.629> there<00:00:40.260> were<00:00:40.379> no<00:00:40.530> there

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
seen on the internet there were no there

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.119 
seen on the internet there were no there
was<00:00:40.920> no<00:00:41.100> mechanical<00:00:41.670> failure<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.510> is

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
was no mechanical failure so this is

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.350 
was no mechanical failure so this is
clearly<00:00:44.129> an<00:00:45.090> act<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.510> cheating<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.410> yet

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
clearly an act of cheating and yet

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.029 
clearly an act of cheating and yet
within<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.629> world<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.989> cycling<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.590> seems<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
within the world of cycling it seems to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.410 
within the world of cycling it seems to
be<00:00:50.129> something<00:00:50.399> that's<00:00:50.700> done<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> time

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
be something that's done all the time

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
be something that's done all the time
and<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.140> such<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.620> big<00:00:52.770> deal

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and it's not such a big deal

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.830 
and it's not such a big deal
see<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.210> asking<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> question<00:00:54.750> there

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
see I was asking the question there

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.270 
see I was asking the question there
wasn't<00:00:55.110> interest<00:00:55.350> between<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
wasn't interest between that and the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
wasn't interest between that and the
Chinese<00:00:56.670> badminton<00:00:56.910> team<00:00:57.600> deliberately

mortal sin and another sport it isn't

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
mortal sin and another sport it isn't
and<00:01:26.420> both<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.450> them<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:27.840> British<00:01:28.140> sports<00:01:28.470> on

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and both of them are British sports on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.429 
and both of them are British sports on
takes<00:01:30.500> place<00:01:31.500> they<00:01:31.829> certainly<00:01:32.400> are<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.000> how

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
takes place they certainly are but how

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.609 
takes place they certainly are but how
how<00:01:34.439> far<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.250> push<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.700> before<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
how far can one push it before it

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.420 
how far can one push it before it
becomes<00:01:37.619> cheating<00:01:39.170> well<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.439> think<00:01:40.590> when

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
becomes cheating well I think when

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.800 
becomes cheating well I think when
you're<00:01:41.579> dealing<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:41.909> commercialized

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you're dealing with commercialized

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.350 
you're dealing with commercialized
sports<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.040> push<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.640> far<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
sports you can push it as far as the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.660 
sports you can push it as far as the
audience<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.110> willing<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.680> believe<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
audience is willing to believe it and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
audience is willing to believe it and
let<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.030> go<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.509> soon<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.960> stop<00:01:49.229> making

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
tied again with South Africa so they

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.440 
tied again with South Africa so they
could<00:02:06.990> stay<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.500> Wales<00:02:07.770> rather<00:02:08.640> than<00:02:08.940> travel

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450

to<00:02:09.629> Glasgow<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.890> also<00:02:11.129> out<00:02:11.580> there<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
to Glasgow it's also out there and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.900 
to Glasgow it's also out there and
nobody<00:02:12.330> seems<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.720> be

nobody seems to be

nobody seems to be
talking<00:02:13.240> about<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.660> one<00:02:13.810> but<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.050> clearly

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
talking about that one but that clearly

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.030 
talking about that one but that clearly
was<00:02:14.920> not<00:02:15.190> giving<00:02:16.150> your<00:02:16.450> best<00:02:16.660> effort<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.650> think

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
was not giving your best effort I think

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.730 
was not giving your best effort I think
in<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.490> cycling<00:02:18.940> thing<00:02:19.180> within<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.350> world<00:02:20.530> of

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
in the cycling thing within the world of

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.440 
in the cycling thing within the world of
cycling<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.370> seems<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:24.160> people<00:02:24.760> aware

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
cycling it seems that the people aware

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.170 
cycling it seems that the people aware
know<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.740> British<00:02:27.010> game<00:02:27.280> was<00:02:27.550> was<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
know that the British game was was the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.630 
know that the British game was was the
best<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.590> think<00:02:29.770> they're<00:02:30.160> willing<00:02:30.340> to

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
best and so I think they're willing to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.590 
best and so I think they're willing to
give<00:02:30.820> them<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.420> little<00:02:31.990> bit<00:02:32.200> more<00:02:32.500> leeway<00:02:32.740> than

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
give them a little bit more leeway than

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.830 
give them a little bit more leeway than
others

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
others

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.570 
others
then<00:02:35.110> again<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.710> chat<00:02:35.950> said<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.310> Chinese

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
then again the chat said the Chinese

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.640 
then again the chat said the Chinese
double<00:02:37.450> scheme<00:02:37.720> was<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.080> best<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.560> world

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
double scheme was the best in the world

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.040 
double scheme was the best in the world

that<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.320> don't<00:03:08.530> think<00:03:08.770> we're<00:03:09.190> going<00:03:09.340> to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
that and I don't think we're going to

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.820 
that and I don't think we're going to
solve<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.120> next<00:03:10.330> five<00:03:10.600> minutes<00:03:11.170> but

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.540 
solve it in the next five minutes but
you<00:03:12.670> know<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.970> idea<00:03:13.420> was<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:14.550> sports

you feel it's political do you feel then

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.920 
you feel it's political do you feel then
we've<00:04:06.160> got<00:04:06.310> politics<00:04:06.820> in<00:04:07.000> sport<00:04:07.330> do<00:04:07.600> we<00:04:07.750> now

we've got politics in sport do we now

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.040 
we've got politics in sport do we now
tarnish<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.730> whole<00:04:10.000> mission<00:04:10.330> statement<00:04:10.930> of

tarnish the whole mission statement of
the<00:04:11.200> Olympics<00:04:11.650> well<00:04:11.850> politics<00:04:12.850> as<00:04:13.090> this<00:04:13.209> where

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
the Olympics well politics as this where

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.720 
the Olympics well politics as this where
we're<00:04:13.630> headed<00:04:13.930> now<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:14.530> think<00:04:14.739> what<00:04:15.070> maybe

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
we're headed now and I think what maybe

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.820 
we're headed now and I think what maybe
would<00:04:16.180> happen<00:04:16.419> Stephen<00:04:16.720> is<00:04:16.810> that<00:04:16.840> because

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
would happen Stephen is that because

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.199 
would happen Stephen is that because
this<00:04:17.950> has<00:04:18.010> been<00:04:18.250> looked<00:04:18.430> at<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.910> been<00:04:19.030> looked

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
this has been looked at and been looked

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.940 
this has been looked at and been looked
upon<00:04:19.299> by<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.720> IOC<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.500> from<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.770> highest

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
upon by the IOC so from the highest

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.190 
upon by the IOC so from the highest
level<00:04:21.340> then<00:04:21.700> maybe<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.090> rule<00:04:22.419> change<00:04:22.450> would

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
level then maybe a rule change would

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.900 
level then maybe a rule change would
come<00:04:23.440> in<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.740> think<00:04:24.130> you<00:04:24.190> know<00:04:24.280> we<00:04:24.400> talked<00:04:24.729> about

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
come in I think you know we talked about

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.370 
come in I think you know we talked about
the<00:04:25.090> badminton<00:04:25.570> yochay

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
the badminton yochay

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.470 
the badminton yochay
changed<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.770> system<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.430> play<00:04:27.670> a<00:04:27.910> group

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
changed that system to play a group

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.050 
changed that system to play a group
system<00:04:28.990> did<00:04:29.140> they<00:04:29.260> instead<00:04:29.500> of<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.680> round-robin

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
system did they instead of a round-robin

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.540 
system did they instead of a round-robin
which<00:04:31.060> allowed<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:32.440> system<00:04:33.040> for<00:04:33.250> them<00:04:33.370> to

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
which allowed that system for them to

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.030 
which allowed that system for them to
sort<00:04:33.700> of<00:04:33.820> throw<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.480> games<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:35.230> manufacture

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
sort of throw the games to manufacture

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.500 
sort of throw the games to manufacture
their<00:04:36.190> way<00:04:36.340> through<00:04:36.670> so<00:04:37.060> had<00:04:37.240> they<00:04:37.360> not

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
their way through so had they not

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.690 
their way through so had they not
changed<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:39.040> wouldn't<00:04:39.280> have<00:04:39.370> happened

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
changed that it wouldn't have happened

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.400 
changed that it wouldn't have happened
so<00:04:40.060> will<00:04:40.330> they<00:04:40.510> change<00:04:40.810> do<00:04:41.080> you<00:04:41.110> think<00:04:41.290> they'll

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
so will they change do you think they'll

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.820 
so will they change do you think they'll
look<00:04:41.590> at<00:04:41.740> changing<00:04:42.220> this<00:04:42.340> rules<00:04:42.610> in<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:43.830> would

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
look at changing this rules in I would

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.500 
look at changing this rules in I would
assume<00:04:45.070> that<00:04:45.130> they<00:04:45.490> would<00:04:45.700> isn't<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.360> the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
assume that they would isn't that the

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.200 
assume that they would isn't that the

nature of sport though you operate

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.020 
nature of sport though you operate
within<00:04:49.450> a<00:04:49.690> set<00:04:49.930> of<00:04:50.050> rules<00:04:50.320> that<00:04:50.500> everybody
