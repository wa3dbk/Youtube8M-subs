holes in them the front ones on his
four-wheeler<00:00:15.929> were<00:00:16.260> terrible<00:00:16.820> they<00:00:17.820> wouldn't

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
four-wheeler were terrible they wouldn't

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.540 
four-wheeler were terrible they wouldn't
stay<00:00:18.210> up<00:00:18.650> and<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.740> couldn't<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.039> fix<00:00:20.340> them

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
stay up and you couldn't really fix them

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.450 
stay up and you couldn't really fix them
so<00:00:21.020> he<00:00:22.020> wound<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:22.410> beating<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> whole<00:00:22.890> set<00:00:23.189> for

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
so he wound up beating the whole set for

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.910 
so he wound up beating the whole set for
pretty<00:00:23.850> cheap<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.630> took<00:00:25.199> these<00:00:25.380> off<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.710> back

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
pretty cheap and took these off the back

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.439 
pretty cheap and took these off the back
and<00:00:26.130> they've<00:00:26.250> got<00:00:26.400> excellent<00:00:26.730> trade<00:00:27.119> but

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and they've got excellent trade but

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.429 
and they've got excellent trade but
they've<00:00:27.630> been<00:00:27.779> sitting<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.619> while<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.640> I

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
they've been sitting for a while and I

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
they've been sitting for a while and I
mounted<00:00:31.439> them<00:00:31.560> three<00:00:32.309> days<00:00:32.460> ago<00:00:32.700> when<00:00:33.030> they

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
mounted them three days ago when they

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.540 
mounted them three days ago when they
they<00:00:33.809> still<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.290> plenty<00:00:34.829> air<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.280> them<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
they still have plenty air in them I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.040 
they still have plenty air in them I
mean<00:00:35.700> they<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.149> don't<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.600> they've<00:00:36.840> really

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
mean they I don't think they've really

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 
mean they I don't think they've really
gone<00:00:37.170> down<00:00:37.440> at<00:00:37.559> all<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:38.280> had<00:00:38.460> five<00:00:38.730> pounds<00:00:39.149> in

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
gone down at all they had five pounds in

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.090 
gone down at all they had five pounds in
them<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.870> seemed<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:40.980> they

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
them and that seemed to be what they

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.569 
them and that seemed to be what they
have<00:00:41.250> today<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:43.040> believe<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.219> should<00:00:44.250> be

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
have today so I believe they should be

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.529 
have today so I believe they should be
fine<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.600> purposes<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:48.649> anyway<00:00:49.649> I

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
fine for the purposes of this anyway I

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.819 
fine for the purposes of this anyway I
replace<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.780> wheel<00:00:51.930> bearing<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.559> hub<00:00:52.829> I

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
replace the wheel bearing on this hub I

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.189 
replace the wheel bearing on this hub I
didn't<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:55.949> any<00:00:56.100> video<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.989> all

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
didn't get any video of it but it's all

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.010 
didn't get any video of it but it's all
good<00:00:58.500> now<00:00:59.180> though<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> rear<00:01:00.510> wheel<00:01:00.719> bearing

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
good now though the rear wheel bearing

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.619 
good now though the rear wheel bearing
seems<00:01:01.289> okay<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.940> didn't<00:01:03.180> even<00:01:03.300> bother<00:01:03.510> with

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
seems okay so I didn't even bother with

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.260 
seems okay so I didn't even bother with
it<00:01:03.930> not<00:01:04.890> from<00:01:05.129> now<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> might<00:01:05.519> end<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:05.970> replacing

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it not from now I might end up replacing

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.760 
it not from now I might end up replacing
it<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> might<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.260> loose<00:01:07.560> but

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it it might be a little loose but

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.850 
it it might be a little loose but
nothing<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> other<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.670> was<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:10.380> anyway
