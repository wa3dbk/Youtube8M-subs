 Hi, my name is Hannes and that's Tupac. We built the painted table. 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:01:02.680
 We're both big fans of the series "The Song of Ice and Fire" by George RR Martin and the HBO series "A Game of Thrones". We like to play board games, especially "Game of Thrones" by Fantasy Flight Games. 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.920
 We thought it would be great to own the painted table that appears in the books and series. 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.380
 We talked about the different components and how we would shape them. But then we realized that the project was just going to be too big. 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 We spent too much money and for some components we did not know how to do it. As we decided not to start the project. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:50.600
 But the idea did not leave us. A few months later the topic came up again and we said this time: Okay, we'll do it. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:11.260
 Logically, we started the project with the planning. How would we realize it? How would we replace the characters and game elements commonly used in the board game? 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:22.260
 The second step was to make the Westeros coats of arms on their own, so that we could put them on the boxes and pawns. 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:40.720
 The table is really big with 3x1,50m. So it would have been silly to take the normal components of the board game for the table 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:50.280
 So we used miniatures of "Perry Miniatures" and poker chips to represent the different command markers. 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:59.000
 The table is made of insulating material, so it is not too heavy. So it can be transported well 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.760
 Our miniatures and game elements are transported in magnetized boxes, so they are safe during transport. 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.460
 We have replaced the power markers with flags 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.740
 We replaced the playing cards you normally use in the board game with scrolls. 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:49.120
 We have replaced the character playing cards that are commonly used with hero markers and hero miniatures. We used "Dark Sword" miniatures 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:57.760
 They have a number of very cool miniatures inspired by "The Song of Ice and Fire". 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.420
 We built the painted table primarily for ourselves. 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:18.540
 We wanted to play on it and have now made a completely different and great gaming experience. 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.220
 and now we want to share the table with the public. 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.020
 It's so much fun to play on the table that we want to share it with other people. 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:34.240
 So we want to show the table to as many people as possible and we are open to suggestions on how to use the table. 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.180
 We have tons of ideas on how to improve other board games for a better gaming experience. 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.420
 You will see some projects from us .......... in the near future.
