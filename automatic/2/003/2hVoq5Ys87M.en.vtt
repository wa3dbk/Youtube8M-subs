cracker<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.100> wanted<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.490> become<00:02:56.850> more

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
cracker that I wanted to become more

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.500 
cracker that I wanted to become more
flexible<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.050> built<00:02:58.860> oil<00:02:59.280> into<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.730> recipe

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
flexible so I built oil into the recipe

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.170 
flexible so I built oil into the recipe
just<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.650> see<00:03:01.950> with<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.220> make<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.880> stay

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
just to see with that make it stay

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.050 
just to see with that make it stay
softer<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.470> don't<00:03:05.280> know<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.760> would<00:03:05.880> even

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
softer I don't know if that would even

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.720 
softer I don't know if that would even
work<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.020> just<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.320> thought<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.980> not

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
work but it's just a thought that not
