 hello redoubts I am kobe welcome to 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.510
 my channel paper for my ink the day of 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.720
 today I am in the branch window 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.029
 galleries by oriente yes yes and I'm with 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.970
 A very special friend is perhaps the 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:26.580
 strong pay channel guard 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:33.180
 we already know a mouth that is called 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:37.100
 actually called and he did the second 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.100
 It was a twitter girl who was called 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.280
 but I saw it in the Andrean channel 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.190
 addiction and really liked it 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.290
 if we are like this 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:56.220
 It's the first time I have 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.220
 so the first question 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.890
 awesome a very well-known book that you 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.920
 like it very much I am here proud and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.360
 prejudice of jane I do not know why then if 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.659
 you do not know him really I do not know where 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.659
 you have been 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:29.890
 because I like 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:34.300
 and good to me what else 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.550
 I liked this one of edge before with 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.950
 the secrets of the author's universe 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.390
 Benjamin 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.380
 It is very green and I recommend it 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.659
 very much from the editorial tunnel 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.909
 the next question is root of 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.479
 rebels a book that does not concentrate on 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.479
 a single theme 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.680
 in Mexican high school reading homework 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.719
 and I really liked it because it's 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.869
 as a satire to the government of still 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.869
 very well 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.619
 and I say I say it does not concentrate on a 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.930
 only subject because if in addition selection 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.930
 of being a satire of what it is 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.750
 Y 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.140
 although above all many subjects because 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.480
 apart as many people and many 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.739
 stories then more than anything because of that 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.810
 I chose it the third book is Alberto 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.810
 villarreal a book with a very cover 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.140
 good and I study for this know 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.860
 you who love books and 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.000
 as fornos 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.290
 and the brothers grimm 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.230
 I say it has a very sexy cover 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.420
 because it has is green and has a 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.640
 tastings that comes and has details 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.640
 very nice muddy and makes hard paste 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.780
 it's very nice this I got it I 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.780
 He sent gift ball 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:21.260
 and the book as well as what to do with 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.260
 bad because they see the cover like these 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:29.280
 and it's a very good story 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.280
 I like love 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.870
 Fourth question is André has said 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.030
 a book that you have had a lot of fun and 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.030
 me for these shadow hunters 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.190
 let's say it's the first but I chose 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.319
 where I put because the truth when I 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.239
 I read for the first time it was first 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.010
 semester 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.140
 and meco what happened to me laughing with the 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.280
 james lines because it has very good 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.560
 jokes 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.360
 It's very classic where you spies everything 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.870
 that I invested a lot 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.410
 I say that the after why so many 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.410
 fights 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.230
 To anybody 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.940
 do you have 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.380
 next question mariana gonzález 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.959
 mariana go as you want 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.380
 call a very corny book the truth is not 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.380
 I know well why 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.690
 but I like the assistant 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.650
 I am eternally you were the best 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:33.410
 because it has a huge amount of 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.410
 phrases and super-sweet young people 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.260
 and I say that I have forgiven me if you 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.540
 I call love that for the first book 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:48.180
 It is from Federico Moccia an Italian author 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:51.500
 and the truth really I do not know extras in 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.500
 developed places 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.490
 nice the next question 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.490
 sebastián no 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:12.660

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:15.690
 Well, for this question, it seems 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.580
 stopira carlos gets and this is the 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.020
 book that I liked the most was the 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.510
 first I read in the shadow of the wind 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.220
 and it has a gorgeous gorgeous prose 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.410
 I love it seriously I think that 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.860
 everyone should read something from the 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.860

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:33.289
 I as I found no author 

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:34.759
 Spanish I chose a Mexican one that good 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.810
 vote the world knows it because it's very 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.690
