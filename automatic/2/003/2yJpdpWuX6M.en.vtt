attacking<00:00:25.560> defensive<00:00:26.490> towers<00:00:26.670> first<00:00:27.680> so<00:00:28.680> they

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
attacking defensive towers first so they

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.890 
attacking defensive towers first so they
will<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.279> doing<00:00:29.429> four<00:00:29.789> times<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.300> damage<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
defensive towers instead of the usual

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.530 
defensive towers instead of the usual
resources<00:00:34.489> another<00:00:35.489> thing<00:00:35.760> about<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.120> ninjas

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
resources another thing about the ninjas

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.160 
resources another thing about the ninjas
is<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:36.989> did<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.469> hit<00:00:38.129> point<00:00:38.430> first<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:38.910> well

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
is they did get hit point first as well

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.220 
is they did get hit point first as well

53 to 70 90 points now other than the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
53 to 70 90 points now other than the
increase<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.780> hit<00:00:48.930> points<00:00:49.320> these<00:00:49.829> low<00:00:50.309> level

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
increase in hit points these low level

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.439
