motherboards<00:02:22.099> this<00:02:22.939> is<00:02:23.120> some<00:02:23.420> thermal<00:02:23.930> grease

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
motherboards this is some thermal grease

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.759 
motherboards this is some thermal grease
here<00:02:24.969> just<00:02:25.969> a<00:02:26.150> little<00:02:26.420> bit<00:02:26.749> not<00:02:27.139> filled<00:02:27.469> and

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
here just a little bit not filled and

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.670 
here just a little bit not filled and
toot<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.099> up<00:02:28.249> and<00:02:28.489> these<00:02:29.480> are<00:02:29.780> voltage<00:02:30.200> adapter

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
toot it up and these are voltage adapter

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.599 
toot it up and these are voltage adapter
so<00:02:31.040> uh<00:02:31.069> less<00:02:31.790> noise<00:02:32.120> but<00:02:32.599> also<00:02:32.870> less<00:02:33.230> rpm<00:02:33.609> with

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
so uh less noise but also less rpm with
