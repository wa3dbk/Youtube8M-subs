replaced by fibrous tissue see that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.729 
replaced by fibrous tissue see that

more subtly throughout here but if you
were<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> stain<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:06.869> collagen<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.770> the

were to do a stain for collagen like the

were to do a stain for collagen like the
trichrome<00:01:08.490> stain<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.479> would<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.530> this

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
trichrome stain you would see that this

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.990
