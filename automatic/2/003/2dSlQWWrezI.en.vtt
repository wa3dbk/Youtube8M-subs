these<00:00:17.220> frames<00:00:17.730> together<00:00:19.369> and<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.580> told<00:00:20.820> you

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
these frames together and I told you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.839 
these frames together and I told you
that<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.270> had<00:00:21.450> to<00:00:21.570> wait<00:00:21.810> till<00:00:22.279> it<00:00:23.279> got<00:00:23.430> warmer

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
that we had to wait till it got warmer

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.900 
that we had to wait till it got warmer
before<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.330> shipped<00:00:24.630> us<00:00:24.810> our<00:00:25.910> wax

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
before they shipped us our wax

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.030 
before they shipped us our wax
foundation<00:00:27.720> because<00:00:28.259> when<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.560> gets<00:00:28.649> cold<00:00:28.950> it

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
foundation because when it gets cold it

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.799 
foundation because when it gets cold it
gets<00:00:29.099> brittle<00:00:29.309> that<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.700> breaks<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.180> it's

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:30.809 
gets brittle that it breaks so it's

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:36.260 
gets brittle that it breaks so it's
heated<00:00:31.110> up<00:00:31.290> so<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.340> ordered<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:33.260> box<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:35.270> small

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
heated up so we ordered a box of small

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.500 
heated up so we ordered a box of small

holds<00:00:39.930> about<00:00:40.079> 50<00:00:42.469> pieces<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.710> wax<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.899> we've

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
holds about 50 pieces of wax and we've

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.220 
holds about 50 pieces of wax and we've
used<00:00:47.120> most<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.929> a<00:00:48.960> couple

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
can fix it and then some bobby pins I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.080 
can fix it and then some bobby pins I
know<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> lot<00:01:27.300> of<00:01:27.330> guys<00:01:27.570> use<00:01:27.870> wire<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.490> will

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
know a lot of guys use wire but I will

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.150

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
I would've did this in the beginning

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.010 
I would've did this in the beginning
when<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:59.180> was<00:02:00.180> putting<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> things<00:02:00.810> together

when I was putting the things together

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.830 
when I was putting the things together
but<00:02:01.440> like<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.740> said<00:02:02.010> this<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.430> my<00:02:02.460> first<00:02:02.940> first

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
but like I said this is my first first

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.300 
but like I said this is my first first
attempt<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.440> this<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.770> want<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.980> cut<00:02:08.160> that

attempt at this so you want to cut that
out

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.770 

then<00:02:12.050> what<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.440> do<00:02:12.650> is<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:14.390> take<00:02:14.570> your

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
then what you do is you take your

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
that trough there okay and once it goes

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.780 
that trough there okay and once it goes
in<00:02:26.540> it'll<00:02:27.350> just<00:02:27.560> kind<00:02:27.710> of<00:02:27.890> lay<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.340> there<00:02:28.550> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
in it'll just kind of lay in there and
