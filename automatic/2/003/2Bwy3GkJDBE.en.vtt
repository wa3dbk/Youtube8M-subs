wasn't really challenging I kind of did
like<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.969> little<00:01:00.270> issue<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.949> being<00:01:01.949> white

like a little issue with being white
skinned<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.239> was<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> only<00:01:03.780> thing

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
skinned that was really the only thing

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.039 
skinned that was really the only thing
that<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:05.189> maybe<00:01:05.519> more<00:01:06.119> challenging<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.900> me

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that was maybe more challenging for me

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320

kind<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.520> sense<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.850> feel<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.180> you're

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
kind of in a sense you feel like you're

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.820 
kind of in a sense you feel like you're
not<00:01:09.360> accepted<00:01:10.020> by<00:01:10.860> your<00:01:11.220> own<00:01:11.400> race<00:01:12.560> but<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
not accepted by your own race but that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.760 
not accepted by your own race but that
was<00:01:13.950> kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> something<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:15.619> that<00:01:16.619> was

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
was kind of something that I that was

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
was kind of something that I that was
one<00:01:16.890> issue<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.460> had<00:01:17.820> growing<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
one issue really I had growing up the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.710 
one issue really I had growing up the
next<00:01:19.439> question<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.100> which<00:01:20.540> backgrounds<00:01:21.540> do

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
next question is which backgrounds do

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.260 
next question is which backgrounds do
embrace<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
embrace the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.840 
embrace the
while<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.570> grade<00:01:24.870> school<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.680> would<00:01:26.370> say<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
while in grade school I would say I

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100 
while in grade school I would say I
would<00:01:27.000> tell<00:01:27.120> you<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.390> was<00:01:27.540> more<00:01:27.660> mixed<00:01:27.870> in

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
would tell you that I was more mixed in

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.690 
would tell you that I was more mixed in
the<00:01:28.230> black<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.800> then<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.160> high<00:01:29.340> school<00:01:29.670> I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the black and then at high school I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.790 
the black and then at high school I
would<00:01:29.880> say<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.480> more<00:01:30.570> black<00:01:30.960> than<00:01:31.020> Mexican

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
would say I was more black than Mexican

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.000 
would say I was more black than Mexican
but<00:01:32.490> today<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.330> identify<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.290> being<00:01:34.410> mixed<00:01:34.620> I

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
but today I identify with being mixed I

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.880 
but today I identify with being mixed I
am<00:01:35.430> black<00:01:35.730> and<00:01:36.060> Mexican<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.440> think<00:01:37.680> that's

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
am black and Mexican and I think that's

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.220 
am black and Mexican and I think that's
just<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.400> me<00:01:38.610> becoming<00:01:39.110> accepting<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
just with me becoming accepting of

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.160 
just with me becoming accepting of
myself<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.160> I<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.760> that<00:01:41.970> takes<00:01:42.300> time<00:01:42.540> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
myself and I think that takes time to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.810 
myself and I think that takes time to
help<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.890> mixture<00:01:44.400> and<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> think<00:01:44.730> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
help like with mixture and I think it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.370 
help like with mixture and I think it
just<00:01:44.970> kind<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.180> takes<00:01:45.390> time<00:01:45.630> time<00:01:45.900> to<00:01:46.200> really

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
just kind of takes time time to really

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.980 
just kind of takes time time to really
figure<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.160> who<00:01:47.400> you<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.360> for<00:01:48.420> me

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
figure out who you are and for me

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.040 
figure out who you are and for me
personally<00:01:49.170> identify<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.220> people<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:51.300> not

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
personally identify with people and not

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.250 
personally identify with people and not
one<00:01:52.320> more<00:01:52.500> than<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.800> other<00:01:53.900> okay<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:54.930> the

makes<00:03:29.520> being<00:03:29.900> multicultural<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.050> beautiful

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
makes being multicultural a beautiful

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.400 
makes being multicultural a beautiful
thing<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.190> think<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.850> just<00:03:33.060> kind<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:33.990> think

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
thing I think that just kind of I think

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.010 
thing I think that just kind of I think
I<00:03:34.560> kind<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.770> acted<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.250> previous<00:03:36.020> answer

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
I kind of acted on the previous answer

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.250 
I kind of acted on the previous answer
but<00:03:37.350> in<00:03:37.530> my<00:03:37.680> opinion<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.130> being<00:03:39.020> from<00:03:40.020> two

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
but in my opinion is being from two

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.240 
but in my opinion is being from two
cultures<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:41.730> create<00:03:42.060> its<00:03:42.480> own<00:03:42.720> being<00:03:43.500> mix<00:03:43.739> its

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
cultures to create its own being mix its

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.930 
cultures to create its own being mix its
own<00:03:44.370> category

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
own category

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.759 
own category
I<00:03:45.120> think<00:03:45.900> being<00:03:46.260> from<00:03:46.500> two<00:03:46.650> different

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
I think being from two different

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.770 
I think being from two different
cultures<00:03:47.040> could<00:03:47.519> be<00:03:47.670> just<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.150> beautiful<00:03:48.600> thing

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
cultures could be just a beautiful thing

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.780 
cultures could be just a beautiful thing
all<00:03:48.959> in<00:03:49.080> its<00:03:49.260> own<00:03:49.380> not<00:03:50.010> having<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.459> identify

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
all in its own not having to identify

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.470 
all in its own not having to identify
with<00:03:51.300> only<00:03:51.450> one<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:52.050> you<00:03:52.260> are<00:03:52.530> more<00:03:52.800> than<00:03:53.480> one

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
with only one but you are more than one

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.190 
with only one but you are more than one
thing<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:54.810> think<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:55.050> just

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
thing that I think is just

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.339 
thing that I think is just
and<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:58.700> last<00:03:58.940> question<00:03:59.180> in<00:03:59.660> any<00:03:59.959> advice<00:04:00.170> is

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
and the last question in any advice is

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.250 
and the last question in any advice is
someone<00:04:00.620> who<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.830> struggling<00:04:01.099> with<00:04:01.280> their

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
someone who is struggling with their
