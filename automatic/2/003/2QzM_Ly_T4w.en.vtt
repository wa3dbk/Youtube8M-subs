say<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.940> rules<00:03:18.210> are<00:03:18.540> sexist<00:03:18.990> but<00:03:19.260> I

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
say that the rules are sexist but I

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.160

don't<00:03:19.710> think<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.730> i<00:03:21.090> think<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.570> rules<00:03:21.780> are

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.250 
they're not like upper butt or anything
but<00:04:35.400> they're<00:04:35.580> just<00:04:35.729> enforcing<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:36.720> policy

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
but they're just enforcing the policy

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.830 
but they're just enforcing the policy
I'm<00:04:37.620> sure<00:04:37.979> they<00:04:38.160> have<00:04:38.310> something<00:04:38.669> like<00:04:39.150> when

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
I'm sure they have something like when

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.600 
I'm sure they have something like when
you<00:04:39.960> stand<00:04:40.260> up<00:04:40.410> in<00:04:40.590> your<00:04:40.710> hands<00:04:41.010> are<00:04:41.100> down<00:04:41.220> your

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
you stand up in your hands are down your

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.159 
you stand up in your hands are down your
shorts<00:04:41.729> can't<00:04:42.030> be<00:04:42.150> any<00:04:42.330> shorter<00:04:42.720> than<00:04:42.870> your

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
shorts can't be any shorter than your

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.860 
shorts can't be any shorter than your
fingers<00:04:43.380> are<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.280> all<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:45.389> that's<00:04:45.600> pretty

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
fingers are and all that that's pretty

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.750 
fingers are and all that that's pretty
much<00:04:46.020> what<00:04:46.320> my<00:04:46.350> high<00:04:46.830> school<00:04:47.160> was<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:47.610> they're

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
much what my high school was so they're

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.909 
much what my high school was so they're
just<00:04:47.910> enforcing<00:04:48.540> a<00:04:48.960> policy<00:04:49.470> they're<00:04:49.740> not

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
just enforcing a policy they're not

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.000 
just enforcing a policy they're not
trying<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.430> say<00:04:50.760> that<00:04:50.870> women<00:04:51.870> are<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.560> piece<00:04:52.979> of

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
trying to say that women are a piece of

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.240 
trying to say that women are a piece of
meat<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.970> men<00:04:54.389> automatically<00:04:55.380> want<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.040> rape

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
meat that men automatically want to rape

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.520 
meat that men automatically want to rape
and<00:04:56.580> they<00:04:56.699> should<00:04:56.910> cover<00:04:57.180> their<00:04:57.630> meany<00:04:58.020> bodies

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
and they should cover their meany bodies

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.909 
and they should cover their meany bodies
so<00:04:59.010> that<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.280> men<00:04:59.310> aren't<00:04:59.729> distracted<00:05:00.510> I

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
so that the men aren't distracted I

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.710 
so that the men aren't distracted I
think<00:05:01.919> it's<00:05:02.070> more<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.460> question<00:05:02.850> of<00:05:03.419> being

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
think it's more a question of being

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.860 
think it's more a question of being
respectful<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:06.330> high<00:05:06.479> school<00:05:06.750> was

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
respectful and the high school was

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.540 
respectful and the high school was
trying<00:05:07.139> to<00:05:07.260> say<00:05:07.410> they're<00:05:07.740> trying<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.160> prepare

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
trying to say they're trying to prepare

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.990 
trying to say they're trying to prepare
them<00:05:08.820> for<00:05:08.850> work<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.050> whatnot<00:05:10.410> which<00:05:10.680> is<00:05:11.010> their

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
them for work and whatnot which is their

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.159 
them for work and whatnot which is their
argument<00:05:12.600> I<00:05:12.870> think<00:05:12.990> essentially<00:05:13.560> by<00:05:13.860> her

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
argument I think essentially by her

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.540 
argument I think essentially by her
freaking<00:05:16.169> out<00:05:16.320> about<00:05:16.680> this<00:05:16.860> dress<00:05:17.310> code

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
freaking out about this dress code

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.790 
freaking out about this dress code
policy<00:05:17.840> she's<00:05:18.840> essentially<00:05:19.229> making<00:05:19.590> a

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
policy she's essentially making a

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.100 
policy she's essentially making a
mountain<00:05:20.220> out<00:05:20.490> of<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:20.699> molehill<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.449> by<00:05:21.690> making

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
mountain out of a molehill and by making

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.200 
mountain out of a molehill and by making
it<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:22.470> mountain<00:05:22.979> out<00:05:23.160> of<00:05:23.280> this<00:05:23.550> little<00:05:23.910> tiny

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
it a mountain out of this little tiny

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.830 
it a mountain out of this little tiny
mol/l<00:05:24.539> she's<00:05:25.080> kind<00:05:25.380> of<00:05:26.479> cheapening<00:05:27.479> or

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
mol/l she's kind of cheapening or

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.500 
mol/l she's kind of cheapening or
weakening<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.710> effect<00:05:29.100> of<00:05:29.400> anyone<00:05:30.150> else<00:05:30.300> is

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
weakening the effect of anyone else is

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.930 
weakening the effect of anyone else is
trying<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:30.990> fight<00:05:31.350> for<00:05:31.680> women's<00:05:32.130> rights<00:05:32.490> to

trying to fight for women's rights to

trying to fight for women's rights to
not<00:05:33.630> be<00:05:33.930> seen<00:05:34.200> as<00:05:34.530> a<00:05:34.560> piece<00:05:34.889> of<00:05:34.919> meat<00:05:35.310> just

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
not be seen as a piece of meat just

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.180 
not be seen as a piece of meat just
because<00:05:36.450> women<00:05:36.810> should<00:05:36.990> have<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.200> ability<00:05:37.830> to

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
because women should have the ability to

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.250 
because women should have the ability to
wear<00:05:38.789> whatever<00:05:39.030> they<00:05:39.300> want<00:05:39.539> without<00:05:39.870> being

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
seen as sexual objects doesn't mean that

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.469 
seen as sexual objects doesn't mean that
they<00:05:43.590> should<00:05:43.800> be<00:05:43.950> running<00:05:44.430> around<00:05:44.639> scantily

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479
