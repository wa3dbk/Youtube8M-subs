00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.820
 hello good kids we are here with 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.510
 a new video and good this time with the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.939
 dcr a pretty pretty streak killed me 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.330
 I think two of the nuclear and one 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.000
 pretty pretty fake way because 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.000
 they were born out of nowhere where I thought 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.980
 it was controlled but good was a 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.110
 game that I liked so much better myself 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.510
 also quite because I already had it almost 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.910
 and with the franc as you will know it is 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.610
 quite complicated to get 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.190
 nuclear because we have that much with 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.170
 Care where we put ourselves apart 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.559
 that I'm going with the franc without any 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.590
 secondary school or a c4 I do not have but I have 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.720
 the people because there are many times that 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.780
 So it helps you get them out of 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.520
 of the houses or if they are stuck in if 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.320
 they are for example here uploaded in the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.470
 top part of ay good as 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.300
 you will have seen I have put the intro with 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.700
 another song because I saw that we liked it 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.670
 a lot with the other was a little 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.460
 too epic I would say but hey I've 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.910
 changed because this since I do not know what 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.430
 do if leave as it was but 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.930
 changing the dog to make it look better 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.160
 because I already mentioned that it looked a bit 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.800
 blurry and we're not there is the 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.619
 remove and leave directly nor 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.600
 He came in so tell me because I'm 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.900
 pretty striped with this theme of the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.550
 intro I do not know what to do very well and nothing 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.229
 Here I leave you we are going to see that the 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.660
 starting as you see what I liked the most 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.600
 I'm from this game because that's what it is 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.580
 get into the flags and charge me then 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.220
 two or three while I'm catching and 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.470
 so get the streak as fast as possible 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.970
 possible but good with the franc is 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.870
 quite complicated here I got 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.460
 charge me one but attention 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.970
 there are many times that you can not 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.010
 risk too much to charge you 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.540
 the while they are while you're there 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.780
 taking here I already had clouds area of 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.940
 helicopter that did not have to 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.710
 released because there were 35 seconds left 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.130
 I noticed very well that I am always 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.290
 spend enough and that is the single 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.960
 helicopter you see it to you the pm that arrived 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.640
 the helicopter I do not know very well why 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.950
 because it's also that helps a lot with 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.920
 to go with the franc then to not you 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.890
 so come to sack number always 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.320
 when with the other nuclear that that complaint 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.760
 jacket then to be a partner there 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.460
 with storms of assault it helps 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.560
 enough because we are getting there 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.960
 still gradually you do not go to 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.410
 mogollÃ³n and good because that's what I was wearing 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.420
 so I do not know what all of them were 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.170
 of sack because if you get two or three 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.270
 there 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.300
 to sack with the franc you can not 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.700
 react many times and more without carrying 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.770
 secondary and nothing because I when I go 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.960
 with the franco I like to take out the nuclear 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.290
 with only with the franc here 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.940
 and I said I 'll see if I wait for 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.520
 go by bye and so I charge two or 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.580
 three because he had no western or anything and 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.520
 I got the streak because if I do not go to Asia 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.950
 I go out with the franc without v or anything that 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.960
 I was wearing it is quite complicated but 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.560
 try to control this part and then 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.570
 already when I saw that they were already doing 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.000
 well up in the part of a then it's already 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.800
 go ahead a bit but it 's that I can not 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.170
 here you can see that they were eating me 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.200
 I was just 15 and they were already doing 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.440
 up here but good there is there 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.300
 a pineapple that does not abuse much either 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.960
 I know if I load one or two as much with 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.960
 the people who usually never use 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.540
 I speak of this of the lethal that is 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.410
 better or nothing because it's that with the ub 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.410
 sad I do not know I like it much more 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.390
 Take the C4 because you see it 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.180
 come and you can let go and in the moment 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.880
 that you see what happens then it bursts 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.850
 some entities because you can throw it have 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.590
 enough damage but it is that there are times 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.019
 you loose them and while 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.650
 is about to burst because they are pulled and 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:20.109
 because the fragmentation is that there 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.199
 Sometimes you have to wait there 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.240
 enough to make it burst and what 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.280
 good is that you can make it bounce that 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.530
 that's pretty good bounce and it's 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.660
 goal within the houses thing that with the 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.000
 second and it's more complicated but 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.760
 good still I prefer the betis c4 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.669
 and that I do not use them and just at the beginning 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.889
 of the game yes that used them because then 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.449
 all the people went with Betis and for 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.729
 cover you like this by areas was pretty 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.479
 well especially with a franc with a 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.940
 light also go pretty well because 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.220
 you can lightly cover yourself with the 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.800
 betty while you're loading because 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.210
 it takes two hours to load and there are many 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.400
 times they kill you because of the issue of that 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.740
 with the light ones and with the franc for that 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.960
 to have a controlled area and know 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.550
 where do you come from more or less good 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.070
 here I saw myself quite in a hurry and now 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.889
 apart from that I was not obese or anything 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.350
 nothing was missing for the next one to get 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.780
 inspire me here that I thought not 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.639
 there was nobody but they almost killed me for the 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.189
 back 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.039
 and stabbing steve zahn time the aspire 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:26.219
 but throwing the sparks because I 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.990
 I saw coming that came behind me and not 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.389
 I knew very well where they were here to 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.729
 get that run of 25 was 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.069
 quite nervous because with the franc 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:38.550
 Well, I get a little more nervous 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:41.550
 with that with a normal weapon, not because it's 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.889
 harder here I already thought that the 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.479
 had controlled as you see I said this 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.849
 hallway over here I can catch the 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.039
 pretty good with the franc to see if 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.930
 I get two or three of them but it's 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.669
 that did not go down 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.830
 they were going through that part that 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.229
 from here I could control it but now 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.060
 there was a moment that did not come out 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:03.120
 they went down I know they were to fill doing 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.770
 no one was coming to get me this 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.389
 what I said around here has to come to 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.699
 someone because it is this spam by itself 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.490
 I like it a lot when we have them there 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.919
 controlled but that's not going down like 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.500
 You see, I tried to get in like that a bit because 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.539
 I had two casualties I said that he took it out 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.610
 there taking advantage of the sad v above me 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.860
 finished the ub sad and this one fix where 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.979
 it goes out because they were all the team 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:29.340
 up and I was born there right there when I 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:32.340
 I did not have clouds but I liked it 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.870
 quite the streak thought must 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.880
 be up this game because I 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.889
 liked it a lot and you've already seen the 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.080
 francÃ s the last thing that I got to that and 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.320
 Nothing I hope you liked and until 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.320
 the next
