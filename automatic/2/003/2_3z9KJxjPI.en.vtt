ideas and make it into something that

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.559

you could hold in your hand they

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.749 
you could hold in your hand they
developed<00:01:36.500> three<00:01:36.830> things<00:01:37.159> that<00:01:37.369> are<00:01:37.460> still

part<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.179> you<00:01:38.750> know<00:01:38.869> very<00:01:39.170> basic<00:01:39.679> aeronautical

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
part of you know very basic aeronautical

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.550 
part of you know very basic aeronautical
principles<00:01:40.700> today<00:01:41.049> they<00:01:42.049> understood<00:01:42.470> the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
principles today they understood the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.039 
principles today they understood the
airplane<00:01:42.950> had<00:01:43.159> to<00:01:43.310> balance<00:01:43.459> on<00:01:43.819> three<00:01:44.420> axes<00:01:44.840> in

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
airplane had to balance on three axes in

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.770 
airplane had to balance on three axes in
the<00:01:45.140> air<00:01:45.549> roll<00:01:46.549> was<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.060> one<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.450> was<00:01:47.539> very

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
the air roll was the one that was very

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.730 
the air roll was the one that was very
hard<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.440> understand<00:01:49.929> so<00:01:50.929> they<00:01:51.229> developed<00:01:51.500> a

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
hard to understand so they developed a

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.520 
hard to understand so they developed a
system<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.250> wing<00:01:52.520> warping<00:01:52.850> where<00:01:53.599> the<00:01:54.170> shape

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
system of wing warping where the shape

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.160 
system of wing warping where the shape
of<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.890> fliers<00:01:55.399> wings<00:01:55.879> actually<00:01:56.569> changed<00:01:57.020> in

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
of the fliers wings actually changed in

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.460 
of the fliers wings actually changed in
the<00:01:57.259> air<00:01:57.379> just<00:01:57.830> like<00:01:57.979> bird's<00:01:58.369> wings<00:01:58.729> do<00:01:59.470> they

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
the air just like bird's wings do they

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.350 
the air just like bird's wings do they
thought<00:02:00.739> about<00:02:00.979> power<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.670> they<00:02:02.119> thought

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
thought about power and they thought

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.109 
thought about power and they thought
about<00:02:02.660> push<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.610> they<00:02:04.610> knew<00:02:04.789> they<00:02:04.970> needed

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
about push and they knew they needed

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.650 
about push and they knew they needed
some<00:02:05.569> sort<00:02:05.929> of<00:02:06.670> propeller<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.420> date<00:02:08.599> no
