g'day<00:00:00.780> folks<00:00:01.129> let's<00:00:02.129> test<00:00:02.399> out<00:00:02.610> my<00:00:02.760> recent

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
g'day folks let's test out my recent

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.150 
g'day folks let's test out my recent
piece<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.689> wreck<00:00:04.170> filler<00:00:04.470> that<00:00:04.589> I<00:00:04.770> found<00:00:05.040> today

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
piece of wreck filler that I found today

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.230 
piece of wreck filler that I found today
swapmeet<00:00:05.850> recently<00:00:07.340> 4.5<00:00:08.340> terabytes<00:00:08.940> of

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
swapmeet recently 4.5 terabytes of

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.140 
swapmeet recently 4.5 terabytes of
storage<00:00:09.380> expansion<00:00:10.820> unfortunately<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.849> didn't

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
storage expansion unfortunately I didn't

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.330 
storage expansion unfortunately I didn't
realize<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.630> needs<00:00:12.840> vaults<00:00:13.349> drives<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.099> first

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
realize it needs vaults drives the first

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.820 
realize it needs vaults drives the first
five<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.670> them<00:00:14.969> with<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> operating<00:00:15.830> system

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
five of them with the operating system

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.480 
five of them with the operating system
on<00:00:16.890> them<00:00:17.779> I<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.650> them<00:00:19.859> about<00:00:20.250> five

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
on them I can get them about five

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.700 
on them I can get them about five
hundred<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:20.970> fifty<00:00:21.090> dollars<00:00:21.630> but<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.410> not

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
hundred and fifty dollars but it's not

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.290 
hundred and fifty dollars but it's not
higher<00:00:23.010> my<00:00:23.310> priorities<00:00:23.850> list<00:00:26.060> yeah<00:00:27.060> I'm<00:00:27.210> gonna

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
higher my priorities list yeah I'm gonna

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.700 
higher my priorities list yeah I'm gonna
power<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.689> up<00:00:27.750> anyway<00:00:28.109> see<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.529> does

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
power it up anyway see what it does

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.529 
power it up anyway see what it does
probably<00:00:29.070> nothing<00:00:29.730> without<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> signal<00:00:30.420> from

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
probably nothing without a signal from

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.780 
probably nothing without a signal from
its<00:00:30.689> controller<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.309> power<00:00:32.520> supplies

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
its controller but the power supplies

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.090 
its controller but the power supplies
might<00:00:33.000> kick<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.559> it<00:00:34.559> doesn't<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
might kick in it doesn't actually have a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.040 
might kick in it doesn't actually have a
power<00:00:35.280> button<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.870> think<00:00:36.930> it's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
power button so it's just I think it's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.959 
power button so it's just I think it's
just<00:00:37.230> relying<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> power<00:00:37.980> rail<00:00:38.280> server<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
just relying on the power rail server to

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.150 
just relying on the power rail server to
come<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.780> always<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.700> its<00:00:41.700> Dell

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.420 
squared
pretty<00:00:51.480> decent<00:00:51.690> stuff<00:00:52.140> they're<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:53.100> twenty

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
pretty decent stuff they're about twenty

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
pretty decent stuff they're about twenty
thousand<00:00:53.850> dollars<00:00:54.120> when<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.300> knew<00:00:54.649> about

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
thousand dollars when they knew about

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.279 
thousand dollars when they knew about
this<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.219> here<00:00:57.050> apparently<00:00:58.050> they're<00:00:58.199> all

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
this one here apparently they're all

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.020 
this one here apparently they're all
formatted<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.640> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
formatted and that's it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.240 
formatted and that's it
so<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.710> need<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.190> master<00:01:03.090> vault<00:01:03.510> drives<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
so I need the master vault drives the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.560 
so I need the master vault drives the
two<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.460> four<00:01:05.700> gigabyte<00:01:07.670> 15,000<00:01:08.670> rpm<00:01:09.180> drives

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
two or four gigabyte 15,000 rpm drives

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.929 
two or four gigabyte 15,000 rpm drives

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.600 
for the first five slots and the rest of
them<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.150> storage<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:14.130> let's<00:01:14.340> turn<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
them are storage but let's turn the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:50.640 
them are storage but let's turn the
power<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.119> what<00:01:15.240> happens

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
spitting about one at a time that one's

not<00:01:53.240> doing<00:01:53.540> anything

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:09.820 

that<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:56.780> was<00:01:57.020> trying

and it's trying to sort out problems

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.800 
and it's trying to sort out problems
with<00:03:15.080> those<00:03:15.290> drivers<00:03:15.650> or<00:03:15.920> not<00:03:16.100> but<00:03:16.480> not<00:03:17.480> happy

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.509 

yeah

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
yeah

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.750 
yeah
errors<00:03:30.180> going<00:03:30.420> away<00:03:31.370> that's<00:03:32.370> just<00:03:32.579> slightly

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
errors going away that's just slightly

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.399 
errors going away that's just slightly
initializing<00:03:33.719> him<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.930> working<00:03:34.200> out<00:03:34.319> what

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
initializing him and working out what

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:40.680 
initializing him and working out what
they're<00:03:34.590> doing<00:03:35.299> it's<00:03:36.299> really<00:03:36.510> cool

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.540 

but<00:03:41.260> didn't<00:03:41.470> pay<00:03:41.590> much<00:03:41.800> for<00:03:41.830> it<00:03:42.160> for<00:03:42.310> what<00:03:42.430> it

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
but didn't pay much for it for what it

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.070 
but didn't pay much for it for what it
is<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:42.850> think<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.090> drives<00:03:43.360> themselves<00:03:43.600> are

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
is I think the drives themselves are

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.190 
is I think the drives themselves are
worth<00:03:44.110> more<00:03:44.470> than<00:03:44.530> what<00:03:44.740> I<00:03:44.770> paid<00:03:45.070> for<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.430> but

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
worth more than what I paid for it but

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.780 
worth more than what I paid for it but
let's<00:03:47.200> just<00:03:47.470> say<00:03:47.680> at<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.190> moment<00:03:48.520> it's<00:03:48.700> a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
let's just say at the moment it's a

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.360 
let's just say at the moment it's a
doorstop<00:03:49.240> until<00:03:49.570> I<00:03:49.600> can<00:03:49.810> get<00:03:49.960> the<00:03:50.230> 5<00:03:50.950> volt

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
doorstop until I can get the 5 volt

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.440 
doorstop until I can get the 5 volt
drives<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:53.320> then<00:03:53.440> keep<00:03:53.680> these<00:03:53.860> 5<00:03:54.270> 300<00:03:55.270> gig

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
drives and then keep these 5 300 gig

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.650 
drives and then keep these 5 300 gig
drives<00:03:55.780> as<00:03:55.990> storage<00:03:56.500> or<00:03:56.950> extra<00:03:57.790> like<00:03:58.120> backups

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
drives as storage or extra like backups

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.790 
drives as storage or extra like backups
just<00:03:58.720> put<00:03:58.960> them<00:03:59.110> in<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.320> cupboard

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
just put them in the cupboard
