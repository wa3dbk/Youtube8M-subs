 [Music] 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.600
 hello welcome to the stand kitchen and 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.820
 today we are going to make a spectacular 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.540
 budinger these are the ingredients that 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.840
 We are going to need half a liter of milk 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.630
 150 grams of sugar 4 eggs 200 grams 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.810
 of bread approximately one tablespoon 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.300
 liquid vanilla soup and sugar for 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.880
 make the candy 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.529
 this is very simple as simple as 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.000
 the flan 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:37.120
 or I put the half liter of milk in a 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.870
 big bowl with 200 grams of spam 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.500
 let it get wet it gets soaked and left 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:49.050
 this pill ok after this what 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.050
 we have to do is add the sugar 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.990
 the vanilla 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.850
 and the eggs 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.449
 very well then we revolve all this what 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.040
 we integrated well a little while so that 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.460
 Dissolve the sugar and mix with the 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.460
 bread 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.510
 you integrate all the ingredients I'm going 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.510
 to try a little 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.800
 always try it a little bit because there's 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.200
 people who like it sweeter or less 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.780
 this amount of sugar for me is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.360
 perfect one thing that I want to tell you 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.600
 do not forget that you can add 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.750
 Raisins of grapes is not what comes to mind 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.000
 Today I'm going to do it like that of all the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.010
 life without going through grapes without anything but 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 you can add him and another little thing 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.210
 what I want to tell you also is that there 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.860
 people that out there do not have vanilla in 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.710
 that moment in the house but with a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.540
 lemon peel without cutting it without 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.640
 have the white part inside the lemon 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.770
 because bitter what you can do is 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.890
 heat the milk put the cascarita of the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.330
 lemon then take out the lemon and with 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.250
 that starts preparing the preparation 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.700
 we 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.500
 saying this we are going to fill our pudding 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.500
 it was very good 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.540
 I already have money with candy 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.360
 and whoever does not know how to make candy can 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.849
 look for the recipe for homemade flan in the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.900
 sandy kitchen that explained how 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:27.200
 make quick candy easy as 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.450
 always good that way our 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.790
 pudding cited now what we are going to do is 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.440
 put something the source I want them 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.330
 say something regarding the source 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.250
 first it has to be a source where 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.569
 can put it in the oven and make it 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.319
 quite high because we are going to put 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.380
 liquid and I have a piece of paper here 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.720
 kitchen because if we put in the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.010
 budding so directly in the water what 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.630
 what will you do when it starts to boil 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.330
 batic and tiqui tiqui tiqui is going to 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.400
 start moving and going to get the water 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.640
 then I put a piece of paper 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.810
 kitchen I put the pudding 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.959
 and then I add water and water 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.250
 more or less the amount that I need 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.080
 for this source the source can be 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.900
 a little bit more too, I have 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.700
 is for oven then I always use it 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.500
 that I have like you have to use what 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.020
 what's home 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.170
 the amount told them of water more or 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.780
 less is a finger than with a finger of water 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.350
 at the source is more than enough 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.830
 so we 're going to take it to the oven 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:36.040
 about one hour at least 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.440
 a 200-degree oven and when it's over 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.050
 the hour we are going to click with a stick or 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.390
 with a little knife and if it comes out dry he wants 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.319
 say it's done and if we're not going to 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.140
 leave a little more if you see that 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.000
 it 's getting pretty dark 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.720
 this part that is already pulling 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.069
 Quemadito has not cooked quietly 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.540
 and it needs a little more cooking 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.930
 calmly and add a paper 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.269
 aluminum well on top so it's going to 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.060
 keep cooking but you are not going to 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.769
 burn the little part above ok 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.739
 Well we 're going to put it in the oven then 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.239
 one hour or more what is needed and 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.560
 then I show you how the 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.400
 result 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.989
 good guys after an hour of 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.960
 baked 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.039
 that's how my bread pudding was, I tell you that 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.069
 the ideal is to leave it 24 hours in the refrigerator 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.569
 but I took it out a bit earlier because 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.310
 I wanted to finish the video I wanted 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:37.360
 unmold it and I wanted to show you how 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.030
 had stayed if they were like that 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.009
 all retinue is because they are missing the 24 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.770
 hours understand why then the 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.199
 candy dissolves a little bit more and 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.449
 it is all more juice cited equally the 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.389
 candy that remains in the mold is going to 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.069
 dissolve and you can add it I put a 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.039
 mint leaf to present and in a 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:05:00.880
 nice plate good end of the recipe 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:03.669
 guys know it's something very simple is 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.800
 very rich is super economic is like 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.310
 make a flan and add a little bread 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.650
 and it stays this way is a very dish 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.620
 cute to serve as a dessert if you liked
