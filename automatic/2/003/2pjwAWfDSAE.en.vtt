00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.110 
anytime NASCAR makes changes to the car
it's<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.200> an<00:00:07.319> effort<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.649> race<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.429> fine<00:00:08.820> line

important changes were made for safety
the<00:00:24.060> roll<00:00:24.330> cage<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:25.260> beefed<00:00:25.590> up<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.699> steel
