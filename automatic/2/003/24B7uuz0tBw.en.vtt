00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:22.580
 for the initial phrase in the exchange phrase one 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:27.220
 once or twice, there was a 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:52.480
 pictures send in total six final 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:52.480
 even using u2 returns from the pinto dollar 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:03.799
 the phrase she all had well with 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.140
 bigger for those who are already lighter than me 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:11.150

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.240

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.670
 ae 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:31.099

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:36.860
 together here in the low time warns 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:39.890
 I do not go out anymore, I left the Sunday. 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.890
 of Sun 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.790
 reached its end and the bass to do 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.790
 pizzas the keyboard that would be a joke 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.840
 So you also about the outcome already 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.120

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.580
 have more municipal release can already 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:29.130
 use only the u did not leave the 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:33.540
 old rhythm will not do just goes to the air to 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.460
 water is good to share a sun where 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:45.470
 second rate after the first verse 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:45.470
 will go into the normal goal 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.320
 but it is still a practice 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:05:05.360
 I see that the owner is not down there. 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:18.980
 Do you think it's a retreat? 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:34.730
 as the sun goes down badly on the first lap 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:38.260
 now mother suns and simon out on the 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.260
 part of the set 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:08.310
 then I myself do the movements in the 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:14.760
 forum you have the best in 2005 by 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:16.860
 every text goes the question I can not 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.610
 Doing it direct can make shape 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.860
 direct 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.770
 I told you there, you read if you realize that you do not 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.770
 direct and indirect 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:58.740
 Where is the world chorus going here? 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:58.740
 bad or basic 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:28.000
 we called coming back pro pro 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:32.550
 in exchange the low dollar also returns 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:37.180
 to the sun there's another southern way 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:39.280
 likes the music and is one more in our 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.490
 military repertoire is a big 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.520
 and I'm still strong and strong and if God 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.520
 want to
