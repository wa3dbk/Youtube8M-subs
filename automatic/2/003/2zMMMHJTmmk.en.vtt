00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
nice little trick that I found in

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.990 
nice little trick that I found in
theater<00:00:14.910> mode<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.570> make<00:00:16.350> Machinima's<00:00:17.190> and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
theater mode to make Machinima's and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.980 
theater mode to make Machinima's and
things<00:00:18.270> better<00:00:18.600> or<00:00:18.869> easier<00:00:19.580> more<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:20.699> less<00:00:20.990> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
things better or easier more or less and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.990 
things better or easier more or less and
more<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.529> par<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> black<00:00:23.340> ops<00:00:23.490> missions

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
more up to par of black ops missions

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.910 
more up to par of black ops missions
because<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.449> guys<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.750> know<00:00:24.900> back<00:00:25.619> back

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
because if you guys don't know back back

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.070 
because if you guys don't know back back
before<00:00:26.340> black<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.910> before<00:00:27.300> let's<00:00:27.900> think

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
before black out before let's think

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589 
before black out before let's think
modern<00:00:28.260> warfare<00:00:28.470> 2<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:29.250> world<00:00:29.670> at<00:00:29.789> war<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.449> way

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
modern warfare 2 or world at war the way

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.659 
modern warfare 2 or world at war the way
that<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.779> mean<00:00:30.990> Machinima's<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.489> would

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
that you mean Machinima's was you would

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.720 
that you mean Machinima's was you would
go<00:00:32.940> into<00:00:33.059> her<00:00:33.210> hardcore<00:00:33.989> mode<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:35.430> he<00:00:35.520> like

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
go into her hardcore mode and he like

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.560 
go into her hardcore mode and he like
hold<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:37.040> stunner<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.670> throwing<00:00:39.239> knife<00:00:39.270> or

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
hold a stunner a throwing knife or

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.119 
hold a stunner a throwing knife or
something<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.410> way<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.739> cleared<00:00:40.980> your

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
something this way it cleared your

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.760 
something this way it cleared your
screen<00:00:41.430> entirely<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.300> you'd<00:00:42.420> film<00:00:42.809> with

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
screen entirely and then you'd film with

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.160 
screen entirely and then you'd film with
your<00:00:44.370> regular<00:00:44.969> screen<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:46.140> your

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
your regular screen you just have your

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.010 
your regular screen you just have your
person<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.160> pretty<00:00:47.579> much<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> camera<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.480> just

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
person be pretty much a camera and just

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.139 
person be pretty much a camera and just
record<00:00:49.410> everything<00:00:49.800> when<00:00:50.640> whenever<00:00:51.000> they

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
record everything when whenever they

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.240 
record everything when whenever they
introduce<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.750> black<00:00:52.050> ops<00:00:52.320> however<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.100> got

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
introduce the black ops however it got

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.100 
introduce the black ops however it got
so<00:00:53.640> much<00:00:54.000> easier<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> could

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so much easier because you could

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.020 
so much easier because you could
actually<00:00:55.260> still<00:00:55.590> act<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.190> these<00:00:56.550> things<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
actually still act in these things you

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.299 
actually still act in these things you
wouldn't<00:00:57.329> need<00:00:57.629> an<00:00:57.989> extra<00:00:58.260> person<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.859> film<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
wouldn't need an extra person to film it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.139 
wouldn't need an extra person to film it
uh<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.809> could<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.609> just<00:01:02.609> do

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
uh and you could you know just do

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.329 
uh and you could you know just do
everything<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:04.049> game<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.470> go<00:01:04.769> back<00:01:04.949> into<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
everything in a game and go back into it

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.679 
everything in a game and go back into it
in<00:01:05.430> theater<00:01:05.790> mode<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> from<00:01:06.510> all

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
in theater mode and get it from all

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.820 
in theater mode and get it from all
different<00:01:06.869> angles<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> lot<00:01:07.799> easier

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
different angles and it was a lot easier

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.340 
different angles and it was a lot easier
to<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:09.000> stuff<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.720> you're<00:01:09.840> editing<00:01:10.200> it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
to do stuff like if you're editing it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.500 
to do stuff like if you're editing it
and<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.860> realize<00:01:11.130> oh<00:01:11.280> hold<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.880> need<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and you realize oh hold up I need you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.070 
and you realize oh hold up I need you
know<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.900> reaction<00:01:13.890> shot<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.390> Joe<00:01:15.390> Schmo<00:01:15.750> over

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
know a reaction shot of Joe Schmo over

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
know a reaction shot of Joe Schmo over
here<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:17.220> could<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.430> go<00:01:17.610> into<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> game<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
here you could just go into the game and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.910 
here you could just go into the game and
record<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.290> reaction<00:01:19.590> shot<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:21.710> was<00:01:22.710> in

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
record one reaction shot which was in

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.760 
record one reaction shot which was in
that<00:01:23.040> game<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.939> initially<00:01:24.420> did<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.560> said

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that game that you initially did I said

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
that game that you initially did I said
that<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.189> backwards<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.270> was<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> lot

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that really backwards but it was a lot

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.170 
that really backwards but it was a lot
easier<00:01:27.770> mono<00:01:28.770> 43<00:01:29.189> comes<00:01:29.400> around<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
easier mono 43 comes around and the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.300 
easier mono 43 comes around and the
problem<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.110> modern<00:01:31.380> warfare<00:01:31.500> 3<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:32.070> there's

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
problem with modern warfare 3 is there's

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.060 
problem with modern warfare 3 is there's
no<00:01:32.520> button<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.479> bring<00:01:33.720> down<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.320> names<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
no button to bring down the names that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.210 
no button to bring down the names that
that<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.150> above<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.990> game<00:01:37.259> so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that are you know above you in game so

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.990 
that are you know above you in game so
it<00:01:38.460> makes<00:01:38.700> machinima<00:01:39.240> extremely<00:01:39.960> difficult

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
it makes machinima extremely difficult

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.550 
it makes machinima extremely difficult
if<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:42.810> don't<00:01:43.170> want<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> name

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
if you you know don't want the name

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.380 
if you you know don't want the name
there<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> made<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> couple<00:01:44.610> machine<00:01:44.909> most<00:01:45.119> with

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
there I made a couple machine most with

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.020 
there I made a couple machine most with
the<00:01:45.540> name<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.229> because<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:47.369> it

the name up there just because I it it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.469 
the name up there just because I it it
hasn't<00:01:48.570> been<00:01:49.310> needed<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.579> take<00:01:50.700> them<00:01:50.850> down<00:01:50.880> but

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
hasn't been needed to take them down but

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.050 
hasn't been needed to take them down but

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.110 
name just kind of fades out and
disappears<00:02:33.020> now<00:02:34.020> that's<00:02:34.230> one<00:02:34.500> way<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.710> do<00:02:34.920> it

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120

in<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.450> vault<00:03:46.400> or<00:03:47.400> save<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.910> or<00:03:48.060> have<00:03:48.180> your

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
in the vault or save it or have your

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.030

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
friend save it to the vault while he's

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.170 
friend save it to the vault while he's
in<00:03:50.190> spectating<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.019> it<00:03:52.019> works<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:53.250> bit<00:03:54.150> better

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
in spectating and it works a bit better

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.410 
in spectating and it works a bit better
I<00:03:54.660> mean<00:03:55.140> it's<00:03:55.320> more<00:03:55.769> work<00:03:55.980> than<00:03:56.160> black<00:03:56.400> ops<00:03:56.700> but

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
I mean it's more work than black ops but

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.900 
I mean it's more work than black ops but
uh<00:03:58.040> but<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.160> know<00:03:59.280> if<00:03:59.519> you're<00:03:59.730> really

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
uh but you know if you're really

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.699 
uh but you know if you're really
invested<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.870> want<00:04:01.350> all<00:04:01.590> those

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
invested in it and you want all those

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.400 
invested in it and you want all those
memes<00:04:01.920> gone<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:03.060> can't<00:04:03.330> find<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.930> place<00:04:04.170> to

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.039 
memes gone and you can't find a place to
go<00:04:04.620> inside<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.209> this<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:06.360> probably<00:04:06.630> your<00:04:06.750> next

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
best thing I've yet to find one word

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.729 
best thing I've yet to find one word
that<00:04:09.120> lecture<00:04:09.570> fireworks<00:04:10.170> one<00:04:10.470> hundred

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
that lecture fireworks one hundred

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.289 
that lecture fireworks one hundred
percent<00:04:10.769> of<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.100> time<00:04:11.280> we're<00:04:11.640> like<00:04:11.790> no<00:04:12.150> matter

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
percent of the time we're like no matter

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.850 
percent of the time we're like no matter
what<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.630> do<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.140> can<00:04:13.290> not<00:04:13.410> get<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.620> names

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
what you do you can not get the names

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.130 
what you do you can not get the names
back<00:04:14.280> up<00:04:14.489> there<00:04:14.730> but<00:04:15.979> this<00:04:16.979> is<00:04:17.100> close<00:04:17.280> enough

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
back up there but this is close enough

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.229 
back up there but this is close enough
hopefully<00:04:19.140> they<00:04:19.530> will<00:04:19.739> figure<00:04:20.130> out<00:04:20.459> some<00:04:21.060> way

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
hopefully they will figure out some way

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.690 
hopefully they will figure out some way

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.029 
to just hit a button it in black ops 2
it<00:04:23.910> better<00:04:24.120> be<00:04:24.270> be<00:04:24.900> fixed<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.380> mean<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.740> they<00:04:25.890> had

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
it better be be fixed I mean if they had

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.470 
it better be be fixed I mean if they had
in<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.220> original<00:04:26.370> black<00:04:26.700> op<00:04:26.910> I<00:04:27.060> high<00:04:27.240> Lee

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
that they won't have black ops 2 so look

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.910 
that they won't have black ops 2 so look
