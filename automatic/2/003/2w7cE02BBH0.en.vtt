00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
these are my tomato plants so a lot of

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.910 
these are my tomato plants so a lot of
them<00:05:55.310> will<00:05:55.460> be<00:05:55.580> okay<00:05:55.910> except<00:05:56.690> for<00:05:56.960> that<00:05:57.860> one

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
them will be okay except for that one

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.500 
them will be okay except for that one
and<00:05:59.230> there's<00:06:00.230> a<00:06:00.290> few<00:06:00.560> other<00:06:00.590> that<00:06:00.920> are<00:06:00.950> just

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
and there's a few other that are just

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.830 
and there's a few other that are just
pretty<00:06:02.510> destroyed<00:06:05.560> so<00:06:06.560> this<00:06:06.740> is<00:06:06.950> you<00:06:07.190> know

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
pretty destroyed so this is you know

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.730 
pretty destroyed so this is you know
almost<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:09.020> typical<00:06:09.500> thing<00:06:09.740> so<00:06:10.690> a<00:06:11.690> lot<00:06:12.530> of<00:06:12.560> these

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
almost a typical thing so a lot of these

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.010 
almost a typical thing so a lot of these
look<00:06:13.160> pretty<00:06:13.190> bad<00:06:13.730> but<00:06:14.150> I<00:06:14.210> think<00:06:14.540> they<00:06:14.720> will

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
look pretty bad but I think they will

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.110 
look pretty bad but I think they will
recover<00:06:16.330> and<00:06:18.190> we'll<00:06:19.190> see<00:06:19.370> I<00:06:19.580> mean<00:06:19.820> there's<00:06:20.030> a

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
recover and we'll see I mean there's a

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.490 
recover and we'll see I mean there's a
probably<00:06:20.960> lost<00:06:21.850> at<00:06:22.850> least<00:06:23.030> half<00:06:23.870> a<00:06:24.020> dozen<00:06:24.050> to<00:06:24.470> a

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
probably lost at least half a dozen to a

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.670 
probably lost at least half a dozen to a
dozen<00:06:24.590> tomato<00:06:25.130> plants<00:06:25.550> but<00:06:25.820> I<00:06:26.060> do<00:06:26.960> have<00:06:27.290> a<00:06:27.350> half

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
dozen tomato plants but I do have a half

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.230 
dozen tomato plants but I do have a half
a<00:06:27.830> dozen<00:06:27.980> to<00:06:28.280> a<00:06:28.310> dozen<00:06:28.370> tomato<00:06:28.940> plants<00:06:29.440> sitting

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850 
plants the other garden looks a little

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.610 
plants the other garden looks a little
bit<00:07:14.060> better<00:07:14.270> shape<00:07:14.750> with<00:07:15.050> the<00:07:15.080> one<00:07:15.410> that<00:07:15.560> I

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:15.620 
bit better shape with the one that I

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.740 
bit better shape with the one that I
have<00:07:15.710> all<00:07:15.830> my<00:07:15.860> squash<00:07:16.250> and<00:07:16.430> peppers<00:07:16.729> in<00:07:16.850> they

have all my squash and peppers in they

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.870 
have all my squash and peppers in they

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.800 
tattered but I think they're going to
pull<00:07:22.639> through<00:07:22.850> after<00:07:23.120> they<00:07:23.330> get<00:07:23.479> a<00:07:23.540> little<00:07:23.630> bit

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:23.810 
pull through after they get a little bit

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:29.680 
pull through after they get a little bit
