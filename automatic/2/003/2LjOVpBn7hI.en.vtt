you<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.729> swatch<00:02:06.270> maybe

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
you can see here on the swatch maybe

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.260 
you can see here on the swatch maybe
it's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.530> little<00:02:07.710> bit<00:02:07.979> more<00:02:08.129> similar<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.819> Moxie

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
it's a little bit more similar to Moxie

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.809 
it's a little bit more similar to Moxie
but<00:02:09.300> not<00:02:09.660> exactly<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.590> same<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.489> that's<00:02:11.670> why<00:02:11.790> I

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
but not exactly the same so that's why I

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.110 
but not exactly the same so that's why I
said<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.270> mix

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
said if you mix

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.539 
said if you mix
cherry-picking<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.650> don't<00:02:14.950> blink<00:02:15.250> pink

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
cherry-picking and don't blink pink

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.550 
cherry-picking and don't blink pink
together<00:02:15.849> then<00:02:16.180> maybe<00:02:16.450> they<00:02:16.720> might<00:02:16.959> appear

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
together then maybe they might appear

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.039 
together then maybe they might appear
exactly<00:02:18.040> like<00:02:18.580> moxie<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.810> thing<00:02:19.989> about

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
exactly like moxie and the thing about

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.809 
exactly like moxie and the thing about
these<00:02:20.409> lipsticks<00:02:20.890> are<00:02:21.129> they<00:02:21.370> are<00:02:21.549> matte

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
these lipsticks are they are matte

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.399 
these lipsticks are they are matte
finish<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.390> they<00:02:22.510> have<00:02:22.690> some<00:02:22.989> kind<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.290> a

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
finish but they have some kind of a

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.740 
finish but they have some kind of a
sheen<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.709> them<00:02:23.950> not<00:02:24.310> completely<00:02:24.879> mad<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.510> I

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
sheen to them not completely mad so I

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.869 
sheen to them not completely mad so I
think<00:02:26.049> that's<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.500> good<00:02:26.620> thing<00:02:26.860> because<00:02:27.069> when

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
think that's a good thing because when

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.640 
think that's a good thing because when
these<00:02:28.150> lipsticks<00:02:28.540> are<00:02:28.720> super<00:02:29.110> super<00:02:29.230> drying
