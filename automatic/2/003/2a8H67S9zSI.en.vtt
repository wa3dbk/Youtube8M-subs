00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello yes it's me again rolf and you 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.429
 those of the scooters do not know anymore 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.269
 you do not have to run the same way 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.240
 ran 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.210
 rather take a look and risk 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.830
 Not for your dear people me 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.789
 I am well again 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.380
 and this time I want to explain something 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.050
 and above all, happy, short and sweet 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.330
 the ido wrote me and also 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.359
 many other people meinolf sprinkle me 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.679
 and so advises is very important that 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 werthmann understand what happens 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.360
 ever in lollar and the movie did 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.120
 I show up as simplified times 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.410
 Just do it with it just like that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.940
 have a clear and what is going on there 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.000
 so I once constructed to model me 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.730
 of course this simplifies this is the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.370
 combo is the spark plug that is the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.809
 Cylinder of them in there because I have 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.090
 the thing is not about canadians and each other 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.109
 The injection nozzle was called somewhere 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.170
 your side 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.010
 so now happens the following when I 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.810
 start strict here pure gasoline mixture 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.200
 then usually it is important 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.210
 the spark has ignited this 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.060
 whole story there is one 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.520
 explosion so happens the following 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.210
 Pistons 60 by the explosion in 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 movement goes up then goes again 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.110
 down and then the same happens 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.689
 history ignite inject again 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.000
 movement and so does our scooter 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.610
 next to it movement, that's why it's important 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.740
 that we always spark sparks and the game 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.210
 if possible 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.860
 I agree, I also wrote 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.979
 you have to change a little bit 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.149
 Turn the adjusting screw so that a small 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.460
 Declaration of times I do not want here 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.810
 however, scientific lectures hold 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.189
 It is quite good if you can do that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.439
 little bit of understanding this whole story 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.509
 then you just have the view and 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.490
 then you're gonna get the one against war 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.100
 or is it just a matter of 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.840
 next time we use the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.310
 scooter sends if I used more 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.900
 or I have to buy one more 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.030
 do not expect a bit 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.740
 the shots will be nice too 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.740
 day zero until then yours
