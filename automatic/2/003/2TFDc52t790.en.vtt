it really relies a lot on micro and kind
of<00:03:13.930> creativity<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.500> how<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.650> use<00:03:14.830> it<00:03:15.010> but

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370

I<00:04:52.730> got<00:04:53.000> nothing<00:04:53.390> I<00:04:53.420> mean<00:04:53.630> each<00:04:54.110> team<00:04:54.380> could<00:04:54.560> go

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
I got nothing I mean each team could go

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.650 
I got nothing I mean each team could go
to<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.920> NSL<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.880> more<00:04:56.000> viewers<00:04:56.270> than<00:04:56.390> me<00:04:56.510> but

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
to the NSL and more viewers than me but

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.720 
to the NSL and more viewers than me but
that's<00:04:56.900> not<00:04:57.020> really<00:04:57.380> if<00:04:57.860> I<00:04:58.070> can<00:04:58.220> work<00:04:58.400> out<00:04:58.520> the

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
that's not really if I can work out the

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.190 
that's not really if I can work out the
smaller<00:04:59.030> kinks<00:04:59.390> I<00:04:59.480> have<00:04:59.630> in<00:04:59.780> this<00:04:59.870> game<00:05:00.050> I

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
smaller kinks I have in this game I

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.900 
smaller kinks I have in this game I
think<00:05:00.230> that<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.530> could<00:05:00.740> compete<00:05:01.010> on<00:05:01.250> on<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.520> level

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
think that I could compete on on a level

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.880 
think that I could compete on on a level
equal<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.570> any<00:05:02.870> of<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.110> other<00:05:03.230> root<00:05:03.470> guys<00:05:03.680> I

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
equal to any of the other root guys I

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.170 
equal to any of the other root guys I
already<00:05:04.190> know<00:05:04.460> right<00:05:04.640> now<00:05:04.760> that<00:05:04.790> I'm<00:05:04.940> Way

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
already know right now that I'm Way

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.490 
already know right now that I'm Way
better<00:05:05.390> than<00:05:05.630> most<00:05:05.780> people<00:05:06.140> give<00:05:06.260> me<00:05:06.350> credit

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
better than most people give me credit

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.950 
better than most people give me credit
for<00:05:06.650> just<00:05:07.040> I<00:05:07.250> mean<00:05:07.490> admittedly<00:05:08.390> so<00:05:08.720> just

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
for just I mean admittedly so just

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.540 
for just I mean admittedly so just
because<00:05:09.170> people<00:05:09.200> know<00:05:10.010> that<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.220> think<00:05:10.430> people

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
because people know that I think people

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.060 
because people know that I think people
give<00:05:10.760> you<00:05:10.850> crow<00:05:11.060> no<00:05:11.570> no<00:05:12.080> no<00:05:12.260> no<00:05:12.410> nobody<00:05:12.950> thinks

give you crow no no no no nobody thinks
that<00:05:13.220> I'm<00:05:13.340> good<00:05:13.460> at<00:05:13.520> this<00:05:13.640> game<00:05:13.730> or<00:05:14.060> at<00:05:14.210> least

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
that I'm good at this game or at least

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.120 
that I'm good at this game or at least
somebody<00:05:14.840> able<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.200> watch<00:05:15.320> my<00:05:15.500> stream<00:05:15.710> do<00:05:15.950> but

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
somebody able to watch my stream do but

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.290 
somebody able to watch my stream do but
most<00:05:16.280> people<00:05:16.520> think<00:05:16.580> that<00:05:16.700> I'm<00:05:16.820> only<00:05:17.060> famous

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
most people think that I'm only famous

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.480 
most people think that I'm only famous
because<00:05:17.420> of<00:05:17.960> my<00:05:18.440> rage<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:18.920> blah<00:05:19.010> blah<00:05:19.040> blah<00:05:19.310> I

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
because of my rage and blah blah blah I

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.460 
because of my rage and blah blah blah I
don't<00:05:19.820> get<00:05:19.910> very<00:05:20.060> much<00:05:20.180> good<00:05:20.360> at<00:05:20.480> all

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
don't get very much good at all

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.020 
don't get very much good at all
so<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:21.740> think<00:05:21.860> that<00:05:22.130> if<00:05:22.220> I<00:05:22.310> do<00:05:22.370> show<00:05:22.670> up<00:05:22.760> at<00:05:22.910> the

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
so I think that if I do show up at the

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.550 
so I think that if I do show up at the
NASL<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:23.720> can<00:05:23.900> make<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.050> good<00:05:24.230> standing<00:05:24.500> I

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
NASL and I can make a good standing I

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.780 
NASL and I can make a good standing I
think<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.740> lot<00:05:24.920> of<00:05:24.950> people<00:05:25.250> would<00:05:25.340> be<00:05:25.430> surprised

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
think a lot of people would be surprised

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.770 
think a lot of people would be surprised
that's<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.840> cat's<00:05:27.140> for<00:05:27.350> believing<00:05:27.680> in<00:05:27.770> Steve

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
that's the cat's for believing in Steve

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.450 
that's the cat's for believing in Steve
he<00:05:29.780> said<00:05:29.960> about<00:05:30.170> you<00:05:30.380> so<00:05:30.890> I<00:05:30.920> mean<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:31.130> know<00:05:31.190> a<00:05:31.280> lot

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
he said about you so I mean I know a lot

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.590 
he said about you so I mean I know a lot
of<00:05:31.490> people<00:05:31.700> don't<00:05:31.820> give<00:05:31.910> me<00:05:32.000> very<00:05:32.090> much<00:05:32.240> credit

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
of people don't give me very much credit

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.180 
of people don't give me very much credit
but<00:05:32.690> yeah<00:05:33.230> I<00:05:33.440> think<00:05:33.590> I'm<00:05:33.800> a<00:05:33.860> much<00:05:34.010> better

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
but yeah I think I'm a much better

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.500 
but yeah I think I'm a much better
player<00:05:34.490> than<00:05:34.520> most<00:05:34.880> people<00:05:35.150> give<00:05:35.270> me<00:05:35.360> credit

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
player than most people give me credit

player than most people give me credit
for<00:05:35.690> and<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:35.990> think<00:05:36.170> being<00:05:36.320> in<00:05:36.410> a<00:05:36.500> league<00:05:36.650> like

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
for and I think being in a league like

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.930 
for and I think being in a league like
this<00:05:36.980> would<00:05:37.130> give<00:05:37.220> me<00:05:37.280> an<00:05:37.370> opportunity<00:05:37.610> to

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
this would give me an opportunity to

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.910 
this would give me an opportunity to
demonstrate<00:05:38.180> that<00:05:38.600> talent

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.830 

I<00:05:45.380> wanna<00:05:46.380> be<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:47.340> very<00:05:47.370> best
