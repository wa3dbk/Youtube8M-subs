who<00:00:00.359> long<00:00:00.599> tea<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.740> semi<00:00:02.190> oxidized<00:00:02.760> tea<00:00:03.179> this

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
who long tea is semi oxidized tea this

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.470 
who long tea is semi oxidized tea this
means<00:00:04.440> that<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:05.250> leaf<00:00:05.640> has<00:00:05.850> been<00:00:06.000> oxidized

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
means that the leaf has been oxidized

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.390 
means that the leaf has been oxidized
anywhere<00:00:06.930> between<00:00:07.080> fifteen<00:00:07.710> percent<00:00:08.010> up<00:00:08.280> to

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
anywhere between fifteen percent up to

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.700 
anywhere between fifteen percent up to
about<00:00:08.580> eighty<00:00:08.880> eighty-five<00:00:09.420> percent<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.620> you

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
about eighty eighty-five percent so you

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.520 
about eighty eighty-five percent so you
get<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> wide<00:00:11.370> variety<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:12.240> flavors<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
get a wide variety of flavors the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.550 
get a wide variety of flavors the
processing<00:00:14.219> technique<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.170> they<00:00:16.289> pick

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
processing technique is that they pick

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.230 
processing technique is that they pick
the<00:00:17.220> leaves<00:00:17.430> when<00:00:17.640> they're<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.000> bit

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the leaves when they're a little bit

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.210 
the leaves when they're a little bit
larger<00:00:18.420> sometimes<00:00:19.289> two<00:00:19.619> sometimes<00:00:19.650> three

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
larger sometimes two sometimes three

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.640 
larger sometimes two sometimes three
leaves<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.119> then<00:00:21.689> they<00:00:21.810> wither<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.260> under<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
leaves and then they wither it under the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.689 
leaves and then they wither it under the
Sun<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.910> they<00:00:24.359> roll<00:00:25.289> or<00:00:25.740> shake<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.519> leaf

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
Sun and then they roll or shake the leaf

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.330 
Sun and then they roll or shake the leaf
what<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.449> does<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.720> starts<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.529> bruise<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
what that does that starts to bruise the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.999 
what that does that starts to bruise the
edge<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> leaf<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:31.260> releases<00:00:31.590> some

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
edge of the leaf and that releases some

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.190 
edge of the leaf and that releases some
of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.309> essential<00:00:32.910> oils<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> tea<00:00:33.780> which

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
of the essential oils of the tea which

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.880 
of the essential oils of the tea which
react<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> air<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.309> start<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.880> oxidize

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
react with the air and start to oxidize

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.889 
react with the air and start to oxidize
once<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> perfect<00:00:38.730> level<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.120> oxidation<00:00:39.780> has

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
once the perfect level of oxidation has

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:40.520 
once the perfect level of oxidation has
been<00:00:40.079> reached

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
been reached

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.610 
been reached
they<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.219> pan<00:00:41.579> fry<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.090> leaf<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.050> stop<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
they then pan fry the leaf to stop the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
they then pan fry the leaf to stop the
oxidation<00:00:44.160> process<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.879> then<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.780> leaf<00:00:45.930> goes

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
oxidation process and then the leaf goes

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840 
oxidation process and then the leaf goes
through<00:00:46.440> many<00:00:46.739> different<00:00:46.980> processes<00:00:47.700> of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
through many different processes of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
through many different processes of
rolling<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.690> drying<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.550> you<00:00:50.550> get<00:00:51.170> either<00:00:52.170> a

rolling and drying and you get either a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.389 
rolling and drying and you get either a
ball<00:00:53.340> rolled<00:00:53.699> along<00:00:54.210> which<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.289> along<00:00:56.129> leaves

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
ball rolled along which are along leaves

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.630

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
is a light too long and this here is a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.710 
is a light too long and this here is a
