00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.930 

I<00:03:09.410> thought<00:03:10.040> he<00:03:10.160> could<00:03:10.310> have<00:03:10.430> played<00:03:10.520> that<00:03:10.640> in

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
doing it's taken too many churches

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.630 
doing it's taken too many churches
letting<00:03:14.840> defenders<00:03:15.290> go<00:03:15.440> in<00:03:15.590> there<00:03:15.830> as<00:03:16.310> we<00:03:16.460> see

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
letting defenders go in there as we see

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.600 
letting defenders go in there as we see
it<00:03:16.730> play<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.030> in<00:03:17.210> look<00:03:17.900> at<00:03:18.020> this<00:03:18.140> 40s<00:03:18.650> he's

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
it play it in look at this 40s he's

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.130 
it play it in look at this 40s he's
played<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.940> min<00:03:20.180> he's<00:03:20.330> on<00:03:20.480> say<00:03:20.780> there's<00:03:21.050> no

doubt<00:03:21.380> about<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.830> he's<00:03:22.250> rounded<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.760> gawker

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
doubt about that he's rounded the gawker

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.550 
doubt about that he's rounded the gawker
I<00:03:23.090> think<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.450> should<00:03:23.570> have<00:03:23.690> gone<00:03:23.810> there<00:03:23.870> but

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
I think it should have gone there but

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.560 
I think it should have gone there but
he's<00:03:24.680> kept<00:03:24.920> his<00:03:25.070> head<00:03:25.190> in<00:03:25.370> vitamin<00:03:25.760> oh<00:03:25.910> that's

he's kept his head in vitamin oh that's

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.570 
he's kept his head in vitamin oh that's
so<00:03:26.810> my<00:03:26.960> angle<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.230> put<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:27.650> from<00:03:27.890> well<00:03:28.370> done

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580
