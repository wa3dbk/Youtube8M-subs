 normal fume cupboard sup prepares to 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.340
 aggregation 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.869
 but at the same time it is a center 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.910
 of higher education where 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.770

 who prepares for the future 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.959
 so it's a living school and even 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.759
 avant-garde since for example the 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:45.720
 astronomical radio center of the ansÃ©s 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.819
 under his authority in this seminar 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.979
 where the hoax has always functioned 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:53.069
 of counterweight reigns an extraordinary 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.200
 freedom of mind of all hoaxes has 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.239
 written sir georges pompidou one can 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.810
 wonder if the most successful is not 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.000
 the very existence of the school 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.399
 these former students on guard anyway 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.130
 imperishable memories these are the 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.670
 hours spent in the turne where everyone 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.120
 looks at his work under a lamp 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.370
 individual and raise the head only 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.230
 to talk with his neighbor who is in 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.040
 same time his friend and to exchange 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.830
 ideas with him maybe it's also the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.130
 rooftop walks from where one 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.340
 discover an incomparable view on paris 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.040
 and on the pantheon 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.709
 it may also be the daydreams 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.560
 edge of the Eastern basin or the normal 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.319
 stared at the image 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.459
 overturned school that fades into 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:49.340
 the vase is perhaps also the pot or 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.500
 the most lively conversations 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.480
 lose in the crash and turn of 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.190
 the dishes 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.660
 it may still be when we go 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.780
 to walk in paris with a friend 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.349
 to continue a discussion that will not 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.349
 never end
