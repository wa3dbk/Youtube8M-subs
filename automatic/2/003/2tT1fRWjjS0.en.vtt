00:00:00.456 --> 00:00:04.110
 When they hit our house, it took us a roof, 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.637
 my child is eight years old and terribly frightened, that's clear. 

00:00:07.637 --> 00:00:10.506
 It shook the house, but thank God it stood still. 

00:00:10.506 --> 00:00:14.539
 We went to Pervozvanovka, here 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:21.609
 and just opposite the place where we lived, our boys, our boys - as I call them, the base. 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.166
 And somehow it happened that they learned that I was a doctor, once they needed help ... 

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:30.996
 She decided to exchange her civilian clothes for camouflage and military boots, 

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:34.870
 she recalls the first time she saw firing and shrapnel injuries and provided help. 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.775
 Of course, even in many months, it's not possible to get used to it all, 

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:41.262
 but someone has to treat, heal and risk life for the front. 

00:00:41.262 --> 00:00:46.931
 He says he's here like everyone else to protect his child, home, and country. 

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:54.523
 They don't understand us, people think we're all bandits, Russian-speaking ... 

00:00:54.523 --> 00:00:57.380
 For example, I speak well Ukrainian. 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.775
 To tell you the truth, I don't really know why he hates us so much. 

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:05.848
 You know, one feels as if their hatred for us is getting through them through breast milk. 

00:01:05.848 --> 00:01:10.778
 We don't tell our children how bad they are and what they're all about. 

00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:17.199
 And they tell us about our children what we are terrorists, bandits, everything possible. 

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:20.743
 They simply hate us and I still don't understand why? 

00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:22.824
 For what? What have we done to them? 

00:01:22.824 --> 00:01:27.948
 We did not come to their land, we do not bomb their land, they bomb us. 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.673
 It's hard to believe, but I worked as a deputy director at high school. 

00:01:34.673 --> 00:01:37.515
 As people often say, life is divided into "into" and "then". 

00:01:37.515 --> 00:01:40.079
 At the beginning of the war in the south-east of Natal, she entered into a frenzy. 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.416
 Now the cabinet is on the staff and wearing a submachine gun instead of a purse, has learned it quickly. 

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:48.197
 Men try not to let their women on the front line, although women want to. 

00:01:48.197 --> 00:01:55.357
 Some have taken arms, some work as nurses in hospitals. 

00:01:55.357 --> 00:02:03.326
 Our girls who bring us food or work as cookbooks aren't heroines, say? 

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:08.703
 Buckwheat soup and potatoes. 

00:02:08.703 --> 00:02:10.835
 She calls herself a "pollinating cook". 

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:12.849
 Nickname LubaÅˆa, everyone has a nickname here. 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.724
 From the first to the last day she was in Slavyanka, 

00:02:14.724 --> 00:02:17.679
 everyone has a story in this war, usually about the whole family. 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.181
 He has both sons in the feast. 

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:25.380
 Everything started by going to the checkpoint to feed one of them, and then stay and start cooking for everyone. 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.875
 They covered our windows to keep us broken. 

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:39.093
 We had to cook because sometimes the bombing didn't stop. 

00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:47.568
 It's horrible, terrible ... to experience and see it all. 

00:02:47.568 --> 00:02:52.424
 The most frightening moments were not when the mines were about to fall, but when one of their sons got out of the window. 

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:55.970
 She wasn't in touch with him, pushing bad thoughts out of her head and praying. 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.643
 He knows that the hardest thing to do is to be a mother in the war and wait for the phone from the front line and listen: "Everything's fine, Mom". 

00:03:04.911 --> 00:03:09.681
 Here we are hiding from mortar shelling. 

00:03:11.262 --> 00:03:16.217
 There is a good view from here. Quite often this is my position. 

00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:19.493
 Anna worked as a cook at the beginning, then became a mortar. 

00:03:19.493 --> 00:03:22.438
 At Lugano Station, they had been at the front for almost three months. 

00:03:22.438 --> 00:03:26.474
 From these trenches one sees everything differently, the previous life is like a dream. 

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:29.244
 She worked in the plastic window factory. 

00:03:29.244 --> 00:03:34.594
 He recalls how she went to Kiev in the winter, to attend meetings in Mariinsky against the so-called Euro Majdan, 

00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:36.775
 after the coup, she returned to Lugansk. 

00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:42.541
 She couldn't imagine that she would be a war, and now she remembered the date she decided to enter the fencing: June 2. 

00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:45.905
 By the last moment I believed that they wouldn't shoot the civilians, 

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:53.162
 but my beliefs faded after an air strike on June 2 at the Lugano office building. 

00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:03.455
 You know, when I collected pieces of people in a blanket, I was in shock. 

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:06.753
 Now, as the war has come to a peaceful city, everyone can remember each other. 

00:04:06.753 --> 00:04:09.422
 A grenade also exploded in the maternity yard. 

00:04:09.422 --> 00:04:14.556
 But no matter what, doctors and nurses did not leave, on the contrary, some moved here. 

00:04:14.556 --> 00:04:17.377
 They worked without shifts, day and night, all together. 

00:04:17.377 --> 00:04:23.654
 We worked without electricity, but we had candles and flashlights, we fixed it 

00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:27.691
 and we nursed, infused, injected and gave birth to children. 

00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:31.709
 From the rooms of the woman they moved to the corridors, there was safer. 

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:35.388
 The medical staff doesn't talk about their bravery, they just say it was their duty. 

00:04:35.388 --> 00:04:39.327
 War is war, but future mothers need help and care, regardless of shelling. 

00:04:39.327 --> 00:04:46.542
 For pregnant women, even for the very healthy ones, this was a fortress, 

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:54.482
 in which it was possible to heat up, eat, work a generator, 

00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:59.163
 We ran it twice a week for operations, so it was more or less similar to civilization. 

00:04:59.163 --> 00:05:02.612
 Doctors remember how they tried to serve hot food even under these conditions. 

00:05:02.612 --> 00:05:06.274
 They cooked on fire in front of the maternity hospital, in the military kitchen. 

00:05:06.274 --> 00:05:11.394
 During the war period, 184 children were brought under the sounds of shots in the maternity hospital. 

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:15.907
 And the cry of the newborn brought what was missing in this war: hope. 

00:05:15.907 --> 00:05:19.971
 Of course everything will be good. How else? 

00:05:19.971 --> 00:05:23.037
 Light must always come after dark. 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.981
 Everything from the beginning, everything is good. 

00:05:28.206 --> 00:05:34.836
 We sat here for the whole war, didn't go anywhere, I gave birth, thank God, it's not horror. 

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:37.897
 Life goes on, children continue to be born.
