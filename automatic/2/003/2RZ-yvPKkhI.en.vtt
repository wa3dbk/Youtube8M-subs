00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
actually a few of us were going for

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.110 
actually a few of us were going for
nukes<00:05:35.930> and<00:05:36.110> you<00:05:37.070> know<00:05:37.159> i<00:05:37.190> just<00:05:37.250> happen<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.000> get

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
nukes and you know i just happen to get

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.029 
nukes and you know i just happen to get
it<00:05:38.240> first<00:05:38.419> i<00:05:38.780> was<00:05:39.199> actually<00:05:39.349> right<00:05:39.770> here<00:05:39.800> gonna

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
it first i was actually right here gonna

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.790 
it first i was actually right here gonna
try<00:05:40.280> for<00:05:40.340> odd<00:05:41.120> dual<00:05:41.509> nukes<00:05:41.810> I<00:05:42.110> told<00:05:42.500> him<00:05:42.620> let

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
try for odd dual nukes I told him let

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.110 
try for odd dual nukes I told him let
them<00:05:42.949> plant<00:05:43.250> one<00:05:43.400> let<00:05:43.580> them<00:05:43.759> plant<00:05:44.000> one

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
them plant one let them plant one

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.420 
them plant one let them plant one
because<00:05:44.419> I<00:05:44.599> figured<00:05:44.900> if<00:05:45.710> they<00:05:45.949> didn't<00:05:46.219> they

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
because I figured if they didn't they

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.249 
because I figured if they didn't they
were<00:05:46.490> shooting<00:05:46.820> down<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.180> ac-130<00:05:47.750> but<00:05:48.050> i

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
were shooting down the ac-130 but i

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.740 
were shooting down the ac-130 but i
thought<00:05:48.830> i<00:05:48.889> could<00:05:49.159> probably<00:05:49.370> get<00:05:49.669> it<00:05:49.750> again

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
thought i could probably get it again

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.120 
thought i could probably get it again
another<00:05:50.960> nuke<00:05:51.229> and<00:05:51.409> i've<00:05:51.469> never<00:05:51.590> gotten<00:05:51.830> two

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
another nuke and i've never gotten two

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.709 
another nuke and i've never gotten two
