00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.490 
stuff
it's<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:38.910> awesome<00:00:39.059> ok<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.410> I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it's like really awesome ok so what do I

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.810 
it's like really awesome ok so what do I
use<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:40.980> use<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.370> summer<00:00:41.610> hair

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
use this for use this summer hair

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.959 
use this for use this summer hair
obviously<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.710> use<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.700> oil

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.360 
obviously I use it it's not oil
treatment<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.629> guess<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.289> could<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> deep

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
treatment so I guess you could do a deep

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.790 
treatment so I guess you could do a deep
pot<00:00:47.700> oil<00:00:47.969> treatment<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.770> but<00:00:49.770> I

the<00:01:30.689> ends<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.619> braided<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.220> or

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the ends and then I braided up or

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.880 
the ends and then I braided up or
whatever<00:01:32.520> usually<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.750> braid<00:01:33.960> right<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
whatever usually it's a braid right and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950

then it will dry by the next morning and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.530 
then it will dry by the next morning and
it<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.409> seals<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> hair<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.479> hair

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it really seals the hair so your hair

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.420 
it really seals the hair so your hair
speeds<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:40.470> stretch<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> longer<00:01:41.400> period

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
speeds more stretch for a longer period

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.929 
speeds more stretch for a longer period
of<00:01:41.670> time

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
of time

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.780 
of time
