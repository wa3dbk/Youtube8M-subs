this<00:01:53.000> thing<00:01:53.210> together<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:55.009> then<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:55.550> noticed

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
this thing together and then I noticed

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.440 
this thing together and then I noticed
this<00:01:56.360> hazel<00:01:59.590> was<00:02:00.590> dropped<00:02:01.160> by<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.700> tree<00:02:02.240> that

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
this hazel was dropped by a tree that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.440 
this hazel was dropped by a tree that
had<00:02:02.600> fallen<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:03.289> small<00:02:03.740> tree<00:02:04.039> but<00:02:04.280> it's<00:02:05.270> still

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
had fallen a small tree but it's still

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.990 
had fallen a small tree but it's still
it<00:02:05.600> kind<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.440> knocked<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.800> over<00:02:06.890> when<00:02:07.220> when

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
it kind of knocked it over when when

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.030 
it kind of knocked it over when when
that<00:02:08.179> thing<00:02:08.209> fell<00:02:08.690> over<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.440> gave<00:02:09.649> me<00:02:09.679> an

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
that thing fell over so that gave me an

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:19.640 
that thing fell over so that gave me an
idea

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:31.650 

just<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.040> thought

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660
