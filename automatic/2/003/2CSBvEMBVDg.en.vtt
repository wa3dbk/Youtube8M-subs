00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello to all here today I'm going 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.460
 show you how to make a candle 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.890
 with a tangerine 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:14.849
 first of all we will need a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:22.470
 knife a tangerine a lighter and 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:24.840
 the oil the first step is going to be from 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:33.859
 cutting and mandarin to recover 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.859
 this part with the stem like this 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.850
 once we cut it off 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:57.510
 have to remove the skin without broken mast 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:59.610
 to get the candle base after 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:08.270
 take off the skin of the tangerine 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:12.170
 we have to get this with the rod 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.580
 that we are going to put on a plate 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.479
 then we will redo the same 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:24.840
 operation with this part of the 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:27.140
 tangerine to make the top of the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.140
 candle 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.430
 like this by making a little hole here 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.000
 how is that 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.450
 once we made our 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.020
 little troop is we have our 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.750
 tangerine skin 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.040
 we will have to put the oil in the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:30.280
 skin by soaking the stem that is 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:30.280
 find here like this 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:46.180
 once we have but the oil there 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.900
 will have to take the lighter he stayed 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.370
 long enough 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.370
 if you want the mandarin to catch fire 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.599
 it can be quite long 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:50.860
 once our wick caught on fire we 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:57.460
 can put the top of the candle and 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:58.990
 this is our candle is clear and you 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.150
 just have it burn thank you 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.960

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.960
