00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.890
 June 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.510
 how many of you have lived through the age 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.070
 golden of the arena fps we talk about a 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.410
 time where it doesn't zoom in it goes from the viewfinder 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.300
 where we always moved, running like 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.950
 damn you shot yourself missiles under the 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.660
 feet to jump higher and 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.670
 only the reflexes and the skill dominated 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.470
 it was a time in which those who played video played 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.270
 he saw the world in slow motion one 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.830
 once he left home and years ago 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.050
 they chose by crushing numbers from 1 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.700
 at zero and every game cabbage was 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.140
 exhilarating as being shot in 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.450
 space with a missile without 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.160
 the explosive landing naturally then 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.170
 the years went by shooters 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.850
 they pulled the brake a little on yes 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.340
 the facts are more precise the weapons are 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.809
 made two and in general almost all 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.540
 they abandoned that whole structure 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.340
 speed out of tune and barrels that much 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.440
 they had made the fps genre magical 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.420
 competitive now with reflexes 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.399
 rusted and a little bruised a 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.410
 nice team in named riggi quid 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.080
 sent us a strike vector code 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.430
 screams eyes in flames and missiles 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.430
 show we're back 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.789
 indeed said so strike back tor 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.679
 it might seem like an unreal emulator 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.569
 tournament and quake arena is not 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.159
 guys we are facing a title where 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.689
 you fight on board ships 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.579
 space travel at speed 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.319
 supersonic there are no weapons that 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.119
 appear in predefined map areas 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.560
 and in general we tend to fight with 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.719
 a third person view 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.000
 yet more than many others this title 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.590
 is a pure game arena 2 one of those 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.899
 where you have to use the map at best 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.899
 to triumph and go ahead to skin shot 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.670
 and aim has no force of perks burdened the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.530
 because it is easy to say 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.060
 the title boasts a brilliant gameplay that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.310
 merges controls similar to those of one 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.840
 space shooter to fps systems 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.159
 old style 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.810
 our vector a ship 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.209
 customizable with various weapons e 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.640
 components can speed up to do 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.230
 spectacular turns avoid blows with a 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.420
 sudden bar and roll and ati bar 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.430
 selectable skills no weapon or 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.290
 power grows with the level is nothing 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.090
 active is unlocked by advancing the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.310
 balancing is already set and the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.989
 death tools already well defined 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.060
 you go from simple missiles to give me a 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.700
 search even passing by cannons of 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.560
 precision and powerful machine guns 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.000
 only two but equipped weapons 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.680
 they are sufficient and progress normally 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.690
 it's worth using a couple of them 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.170
 type to reinforce a specific style 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.120
 of play 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.829
 the fact is that the viewfinder moves into 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.230
 partially independent of the 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.090
 carrycot controlled by keyboard and 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.590
 that both you and the written opponents 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.810
 net like loose chips among the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.739
 complex map structures this 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.109
 results in gameplay 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.880
 frighteningly frantic where to hit yourself 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.500
 it is not at all easy that you tend to 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.090
 take advantage of the combined covers 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.769
 acrobatic and incredible numbers 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.299
 the control is facilitated by the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.220
 possibility of transforming one's own 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.380
 back between instantly in a form 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.630
 secondary static a kind of mode 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.340
 fluctuating that I am here suddenly 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.049
 ship preventing it from crashing into 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.660
 a wall that allows you to aim at 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.459
 bang of even 360 degrees 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.500
 many very many players initially 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.760
 a club will not understand us especially 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.739
 those used to shooter more 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.720
 accessible after a while however it takes 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.519
 confident with the controls and it doesn't happen 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.810
 rarely performing in maneuvers that 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.209
 they would make an experienced rider look pale 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.280
 of swing hicks see such gameplay 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.169
 pure pristine and bad the day 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.790
 today is a rarity and things are done 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.650
 even more exciting when you know 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.659
 risk in the equation a bar of the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.430
 life points that do not regenerate but go 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.799
 recharged with care scattered around 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.000
 turbo platform locations 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.370
 which speed up the action even more 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.500
 a first person view that renders 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.359
 the experience even more exaggerated and the 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.760
 loss of kills in the event of a crash 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.920
 against a wall strike lector is not a 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.540
 game for beginners but hold on and 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.220
 you will fall in love with his 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.319
 gameplay after some ships exploded e 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.489
 frustrating moments 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.379
 unfortunately this old playability 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.209
 style all to enjoyment and adrenaline 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.579
 it is not supported by a quantity 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.500
 worthy of content is the title rage suite 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.750
 it's just competitive not tutorial 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.819
 skimpy and very few ways removed 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.230
 deathmatch all against all and at teams 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.150
 and domination mod 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.099
 the only relatively original and the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.320
 bounty hunter mode where the kills 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.150
 allow you to earn money and win 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.770
 whoever receives a certain amount but is lost 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.669
 all if you crashed you are killed 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.320
 too many times 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.509
 little stuff though developers 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.610
 have promised continuous updates e 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.259
 completely free technically the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.000
 Finally the game is defended well 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.560
 framerate and remains stable even on 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.660
 non-superlative configurations 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.550
 despite the speed evektor have 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.490
 personality some crashes and bugs 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.620
 we have seen it, but they are short- sighted 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.930
 the title rage quid we adored 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.240
 if you miss the old fps arena 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.070
 full speed and skill strike vector of 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.780
 capture the soul and will not leave it anymore 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.699
 go holding it with the same one 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.159
 badness of his aerial shootings 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.260
 it's not a game for everyone it's hard to 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.330
 mastering can seem confusing 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.800
 and a little content at the moment but 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.690
 in front of such gameplay not 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.729
 we can really not reward it 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.690
 unload it have the engines and split 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.690
 all worth it
