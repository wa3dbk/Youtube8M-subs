00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.500
 good morning princesses and princesses 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.449
 welcome to coffee with low coffee cent and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.449
 I'm an imbecile 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.100
 I'm an asshole I spent a month and I walk 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.230
 the international day of the sweet potato and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.050
 it turns out that it coincides with carnival 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.210
 then the fact of making normal life 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.280
 with a blanket robe and sow the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.739
 bewilderment in citizenship does not have 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.660
 fucking sense because in carnival sales 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.520
 with a blanket blanket and no one misses him 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.050
 because next door there's a guy dressed in 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.789
 I had TV and you with your blanket 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.739
 more discreet at the same time elegant and with 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.710
 a comfort how good I had contario 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.359
 that you do not know carnival in carnival 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.610
 you can celebrate the day of the robe 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.890
 blanket and I find out today that it's carnival 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.330
 the 9th day can not be compatible 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.920
 idea was to get into the everyday life of a 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.450
 society abducted by abulia a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.960
 subversive element like the blanket blanket 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.729
 in order to criticize something that and that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.410
 the guards are covered and it can not be the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.960
 day 9 that changing it goes against the 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.909
 spirit of the event itself no no no no is 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.399
 strange no no no 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.469
 it occurred to me to do it on 19 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.969
 february but good if any problem of 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.649
 festive character 1 chew to be 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.119
 take place on the 19th please 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.009
 making it known either by twitter or 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.469
 by facebook or comment on that video 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.390
 wherever it is doing the day's entrance 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.549
 19 it seems quite ideal to me that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.780
 it seems that it takes a lot of trouble and 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.609
 everything you have from now on 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.560
 I know I already know if it's that sometimes the 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.020
 fate turns against one and is 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.460
 what's up I'm a fucking mess if it's 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.460
 which are the ones that are 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.460
 do not 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.130
 you are silly boy you are silly and in 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.490
 you have to know your house because here 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.310
 we are tired of knowing what you are 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.790
 you do not want to hit me 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.330
 you are silly boy you are silly not 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:20.530
 you understand if you want to understand the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.180
 follow that so much of laurent you are foolish and 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.910
 that you will know that you left living 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:33.130
 nonsense that I presume resulting 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:36.840
 I had forgotten SantamarÃ­a and see if 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.840
 this is a man full 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:45.070
 so much perez and although sometimes you look like 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 until well it is necessary that you forget your 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.000
 hobbies are you so relevant 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.709
 stop yourself from such foolishness that you do not presume 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.560
 to be so cool when it was 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.480
 I would promote and help me adviser man 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.720
 thorough 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.230
 in as much many people of our friend and 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.370
 although sometimes sports is fine is 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:32.330
 I need you to forget your love you're all 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.130

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.510
 you will see 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:42.110
 silly and that you're going to play dumb and 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.400

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.400
