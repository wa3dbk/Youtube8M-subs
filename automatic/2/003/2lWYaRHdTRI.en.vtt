all<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.409> way<00:01:41.530> around<00:01:41.679> it<00:01:42.179> how<00:01:43.179> big<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.450> your

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
all the way around it how big is your

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.480 
all the way around it how big is your
please<00:01:45.579> there's<00:01:45.969> my<00:01:46.240> part<00:01:46.569> so<00:01:47.409> could<00:01:48.249> you<00:01:48.280> be

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.410 

approximate<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:54.680> if<00:01:55.040> you're<00:01:55.340> beyond<00:01:55.730> she's

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
approximate so if you're beyond she's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
approximate so if you're beyond she's
saying<00:01:56.630> their<00:01:56.960> force<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.310> that's<00:01:58.520> in<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.730> run

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
saying their force and that's in a run

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.060 
saying their force and that's in a run
saved<00:02:00.440> out<00:02:00.680> beyond<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.670> forklift<00:02:02.240> area<00:02:03.070> you

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
saved out beyond the forklift area you

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.870 
saved out beyond the forklift area you
say<00:02:04.280> more<00:02:04.580> out<00:02:04.790> here<00:02:05.000> quieter<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.580> if<00:02:07.730> you're

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
say more out here quieter so if you're

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.960 
say more out here quieter so if you're
staying<00:02:08.149> for<00:02:08.270> foot<00:02:08.750> there<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.649> more<00:02:10.399> but<00:02:10.670> here

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
staying for foot there and more but here

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.600 
staying for foot there and more but here
if<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:12.020> put<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.470> yes<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:13.010> hear<00:02:13.280> you're<00:02:13.490> going

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
if you put that yes I hear you're going

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.380 
if you put that yes I hear you're going
to<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:13.820> wide<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.330> car<00:02:15.070> ok<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:17.150> that's

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
to be wide of the car ok so that's

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.570 
to be wide of the car ok so that's
taking<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:18.020> that's<00:02:18.440> costing<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.130> time<00:02:19.160> and

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
taking you that's costing you time and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.840 
taking you that's costing you time and
every<00:02:19.790> barrel<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.540> you're<00:02:20.870> running<00:02:21.050> further

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
every barrel but you're running further

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.990 
every barrel but you're running further
right<00:02:23.290> you're<00:02:24.290> running<00:02:24.650> for<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.010> there

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
right you're running for the there

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.990 
right you're running for the there
really<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.930> magic<00:02:27.470> distance<00:02:28.100> around<00:02:28.370> that

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
really is a magic distance around that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.990 
really is a magic distance around that
barrel<00:02:29.420> okay<00:02:30.050> in<00:02:32.770> three<00:02:33.770> four-foot<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
barrel okay in three four-foot the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.410 
barrel okay in three four-foot the
reason<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.959> small<00:02:36.830> horse<00:02:37.250> can<00:02:37.580> maybe<00:02:37.760> do<00:02:38.090> free

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
reason a small horse can maybe do free

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.780 
reason a small horse can maybe do free
but<00:02:38.690> an<00:02:38.810> Air<00:02:39.020> Force<00:02:39.050> needs<00:02:39.739> about<00:02:40.130> four<00:02:40.489> but

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
but an Air Force needs about four but

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.729 
but an Air Force needs about four but
you<00:02:41.330> start<00:02:41.630> getting<00:02:41.780> up<00:02:42.020> here<00:02:42.230> about<00:02:42.470> five

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
you start getting up here about five

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.170 
you start getting up here about five
foot<00:02:43.070> now<00:02:43.670> your<00:02:43.970> foot<00:02:44.300> past<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.900> everywhere

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
foot now your foot past it everywhere

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.830 
foot now your foot past it everywhere
okay<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:47.840> out<00:02:48.170> here<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.650> get<00:02:48.770> that<00:02:48.980> hit

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
okay this out here to get that hit

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.780 
okay this out here to get that hit
too<00:02:50.560> far<00:02:50.879> so<00:02:51.879> there<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.090> kind<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.629> a<00:02:53.459> really<00:02:54.459> a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
too far so there is kind of a really a

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.270 
too far so there is kind of a really a
magic<00:02:55.300> number<00:02:55.450> there<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.410> where<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:57.010> horse

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
magic number there of where that horse

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.160 
magic number there of where that horse
needs<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.819> run<00:02:58.000> going<00:02:58.420> into<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:58.720> barrel<00:02:58.989> so

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
needs to run going into the barrel so

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.770 
needs to run going into the barrel so
