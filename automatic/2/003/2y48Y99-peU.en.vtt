trays made out of cnc'd aluminum and I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.710 
trays made out of cnc'd aluminum and I
will<00:01:05.070> say<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.760> went<00:01:05.939> together<00:01:06.210> perfectly

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
will say that it went together perfectly

everything fit exactly as it should all

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100 
everything fit exactly as it should all
I<00:01:11.250> did<00:01:11.490> was<00:01:11.700> put<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> piece<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.479> velcro<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
I did was put a piece of velcro on the

I did was put a piece of velcro on the
back<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.950> monitor<00:01:14.850> attachment<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.340> it's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
back of the monitor attachment and it's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
back of the monitor attachment and it's
very<00:01:18.000> straightforward<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.840> attach<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
very straightforward now to attach the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.980 
very straightforward now to attach the
lipo<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.759> use<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.240> power<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.630> receiver

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
lipo that I use to power the receiver

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.289 
lipo that I use to power the receiver
and<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> monitor<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.950> well<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> receiver

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and the monitor as well as the receiver

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.370 
and the monitor as well as the receiver
itself<00:01:26.090> if<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.360> take<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> look<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> monitor

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
itself if you take a look at the monitor

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
itself if you take a look at the monitor
bracket<00:01:28.979> you'll<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.520> there's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
bracket you'll see that there's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.219 
bracket you'll see that there's
pre-drilled<00:01:30.750> holes<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:32.040> are<00:01:33.229> industry

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
pre-drilled holes that are industry

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.230 
pre-drilled holes that are industry
standard<00:01:34.680> spacing<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.549> many<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.150> these

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
standard spacing for many of these

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.929 
standard spacing for many of these
monitors<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.520> case<00:01:38.729> I'm<00:01:38.909> just

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
monitors so that in my case I'm just

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.300 
monitors so that in my case I'm just
using<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.420> little<00:01:39.450> seven<00:01:39.990> inch<00:01:40.110> monitor<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
using a little seven inch monitor and it

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.370 
using a little seven inch monitor and it
lined<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:41.820> two<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> holes<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.659> some

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
lined up with two of the holes and some

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.990 
lined up with two of the holes and some
of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> other<00:01:44.040> holes<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.759> will

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
of the other holes that you see will

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.170 
of the other holes that you see will
line<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.659> larger<00:01:46.320> monitors<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.820> makes

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
line up with larger monitors so it makes

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.080 
line up with larger monitors so it makes
for<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.420> very<00:01:48.479> secure<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.200> easy<00:01:49.320> attachment
