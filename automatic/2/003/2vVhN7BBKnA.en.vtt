00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.639
 after the controversy over the withdrawal of 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.740
 crosses in public buildings 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.900
 a new religious imbroglio will arrive at 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.330
 the hands of justice is that the prefecture of 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.180
 florianÃ³polis decided to come with a 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.430
 against the law that obliges schools to 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.660
 keep copies of the Bible in their 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.939
 libraries 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.340
 The allegation is that the law 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.890
 principle of the state's secular state 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.350
 lay person is one who does not have a creed 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.559
 nor does it allow religion to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.500
 conduct or subjugate the lay state is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.230
 neutral but not very religious 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.020
 on the contrary our constitution to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.960
 which defines the state as a layperson does not 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.760
 it only gives freedom of worship as 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.670
 shall ensure the provision of 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.760
 in prisons and schools 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.460
 establishes religious and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.370
 criminalizes any respect to the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.110
 beliefs and their sacred symbols and to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.380
 sacramentar as the state 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.409
 Brazilian is not anti-religious. 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.280
 federal constitution was enacted 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:17.970
 quotes under the protection of god made the quotation marks 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 and god with a capital d there I ask 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.210
 How can a bible in a library? 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.470
 to hurt the laity of the Brazilian state 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.110
 for Christians 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.750
 It's holy scripture for the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.700
 The Bible is just a book 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.579
 hanging in an instant like 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.670
 thousands of other books read who wants 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.860
 No one is obligated but it is unthinkable that 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.470
 a library that takes pride in any 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.590
 place of the planet does not even have a 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.560
 copy of the most read book 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.869
 world's best- selling 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.840
 country such as Brazil colonized by 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.500
 Catholics where more than 90% of the population 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.070
 if it is considered Christian to take students 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.259
 the option and I said option to read the bible 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.799
 in a library becomes a 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.640
 disrespect in addition to an attack on 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.090
 right to information 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.680
 is a hunt for sacred symbols 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.590
 particularly Christians, why not 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.840
 we begin by crushing the image of Christ 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.510
 redeemer than to demolish the huge 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.270
 statue so that it does not stain the state 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.590
 and the names of states as 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.800
 sao paulo holy spirit Santa Catarina 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.140
 valley we will rename them too 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.110
 laws to meet the demand of 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.300
 shopkeepers to further promote 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.959
 religious intolerance 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.959
 But religious intolerance is a crime.
