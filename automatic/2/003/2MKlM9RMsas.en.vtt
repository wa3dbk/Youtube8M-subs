00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.040
 There are some pointers to the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.020
 coming content to the witcher 3 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.760
 First of all, right outside the door 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.130
 stands and that is so they all have 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.080
 namely want nasty sheets finishing 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.850
 moves that will be the fifteenth free 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.559
 dlc and should still this week 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.170
 the developers of 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.360
 cd project red so declared on twitter 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.710
 then comes again a dlc in 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.110
 last week of julia and that's it 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.360
 sixteenth and last free dlc and 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.430
 That's why it should be especially great 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.170
 and then it goes on with the 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.940
 content that cost money again 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.430
 the two major extensions heart of 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.190
 stone &amp; blood and wine and too hard tone 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.440
 there is an interesting info namely 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.000
 a commercial on steam there you can 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.860
 namely to buy the extension pass and in 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.049
 This advertising graphic is a figure too 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.490
 the witcher fans already know each other 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.530
 and with whom he will give his reunion 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.479
 namely, shani we know from the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.049
 witcher 2 you have then only from her 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.030
 read 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.640
 and even with three main game just from her 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.500
 heard and now in the first real stone 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.060
 will probably meet again and gerat 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.799
 because they play a major role because 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.020
 gerald wirth into no man's land behind 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.539
 oxenfort travel and there at the academy 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.619
 is to look at the heart reside yes 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.289
 of stone should be according to current planning 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.369
 appear in october and in expert 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.520
 fits together with the second 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.990
 extension costs the thing 25 euro the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.280
 But it should also be worth according to developers 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.479
 there are many many hours 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.479
 playtime brings 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.869
 he is missing 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.300
 in an announcement that actually 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.880
 Nobody was that surprised anymore 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.350
 Developer slightly mad studios 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.310
 announced that the wii u version of 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.960
 project cars done is the whole thing 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.700
 it first as an interview with the website 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.140
 nintendo live and then again in 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.900
 a press release from the publisher 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.490
 to hear bandai namco is explained 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.200
 that you simply could not make it 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.600
 with the low computing power of the eu 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.340
 the vision of broadcast the the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.630
 Developers had to implement 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.820
 then a much smaller or 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.170
 can do ugly game around that 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.300
 to get started on this console 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.489
 But nobody wants that afterwards 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.930
 this version is definitely dead at 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.670
 That's why you put slightly mad studios 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.160
 big hopes in the next nintendo 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.810
 platform nx and hopes that the more 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.440
 hardware power has it there too 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.440
 podcast or podcast 2 can run on it 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.010
 Knights of the Old Republican 2 gets 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.630
 a patch yes you have that right 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.280
 understood I did not say the old 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.230
 republic gets a patch but that 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.420
 over ten years old knights of the old 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.250
 republic 2 has another update 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.540
 get that is just so on steam 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.730
 appeared and brings a lot 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.380
 Innovations including 37 steam 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.480
 achievements and support for 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.240
 widescreen resolutions in four and even 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.110
 5k so you are happy about your downsampling 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.400
 friends 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.260
 There is also support for everyone 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.900
 popular controller types of pc and 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.820
 console and a new power powers 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.810
 graphic effects the one on or 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.850
 can turn off 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.770
 interesting is also that the patch team 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.500
 worked together with the mod team 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.510
 the restore content mod and this mod 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.950
 Turns off some content on the free 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.060
 Time reasons back then from the main game 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.890
 have flown out 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.900
 you can do that with the new patch 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.420
 smoothly just play like that 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.400
 why this patch and this update 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.410
 just now it so it seems completely 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.239
 unclear but probably it is in the year 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.980
 not exactly the new star movie 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.660
 is one of the best star wars 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.489
 roleplaying again on forward 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.500
 to bring currently there is the game at 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.239
