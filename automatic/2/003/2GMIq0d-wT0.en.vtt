00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
be like shoveling coal into a tree it's

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.459 
be like shoveling coal into a tree it's
full-time<00:01:56.430> job<00:01:56.789> almost<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.750> think<00:01:58.079> I'm

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
full-time job almost I think I'm

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.440 
full-time job almost I think I'm
probably<00:01:58.890> more<00:01:59.280> shift<00:01:59.609> than<00:01:59.850> anything<00:02:00.119> else

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
probably more shift than anything else

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.440 
probably more shift than anything else
and<00:02:00.810> almost<00:02:01.619> food<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.070> demand<00:02:02.460> lots<00:02:03.329> of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and almost food on demand lots of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.389 
and almost food on demand lots of
protein<00:02:03.780> lots<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.439> protein<00:02:04.859> but<00:02:05.100> then<00:02:05.250> again

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
protein lots of protein but then again

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.669 
protein lots of protein but then again
at<00:02:06.030> least<00:02:06.359> he's<00:02:06.630> not<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:07.049> hungry<00:02:07.229> he's<00:02:07.500> not

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
at least he's not going hungry he's not

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.190 
at least he's not going hungry he's not
he<00:02:08.009> does<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.670> balanced<00:02:09.090> diet<00:02:09.210> yeah<00:02:10.050> he

he does have a balanced diet yeah he

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.700 
he does have a balanced diet yeah he
perhaps<00:02:10.440> doesn't<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:11.010> that<00:02:11.760> many<00:02:12.090> carbs<00:02:12.710> but

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
perhaps doesn't have that many carbs but

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.460 
perhaps doesn't have that many carbs but
then<00:02:13.920> there's<00:02:14.160> always<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.460> protein<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.090> he's

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
then there's always the protein so he's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.200 
then there's always the protein so he's
he's<00:02:15.650> never<00:02:15.860> hungry<00:02:16.220> yeah<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:16.940> don't<00:02:17.030> miss
