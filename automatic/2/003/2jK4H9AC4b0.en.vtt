00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.789
 I guys mercer a quasi today 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.939
 the years we finally find ourselves 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.830
 renew so on this video I'm going 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.650
 introduce you to a mode that can be done 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.769
 on playstation3 jailbreak and for those 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.010
 who have a normal playstation 3 or for 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.140
 those who are the xbox 360 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.469
 this video is not for you 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.020
 friends and so so here let's go back to topics 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.719
 so this mode is to make disappear 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.820
 the pacific ocean are on strike so 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.870
 basically all the saints to cover on the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.789
 map of gta 5 thanks to this mode there is 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.530
 would be over 200 years old you are going to me 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.149
 to say that more science sa will be a little 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.430
 con but frankly it remains to be seen 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.890
 it's a mode that's really good 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.830
 realized anyway you can see by 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.070
 sharks with a full that I have 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.410
 borrowed an English so here it shows 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.259
 really everything could take year 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.869
 some cock are a little guy for for 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.450
 go on be a motorcycle all that 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.090
 you want you can leave on 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.580
 this is already as you see it 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.790
 so I admit it's not very good 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.950
 not really where in any case it can 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.980
 give you an image of what you 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.560
 wait if you make a little tutorial 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.270
 so already to start 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.920
 I will try to see this video at 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.240
 community channels so I do not know 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.520
 still for now 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.740
 we will see simply I will see 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.930
 simply and so for this mode 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.770
 already been able to start I put it all in the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.049
 description ie 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:05.020
 the tutorial page how he shows you 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.680
 how to make tutorials more detail 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.220
 so there is also 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.830
 to download the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.810
 the world so everything will be time the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.770
 description here we are so for 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.740
 start the mode gt gt to 5 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.480
 but already it is no more schengen 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.190
 a war I think for those who 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.160
 do not know these people who does 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.910
 grinds ps3 I think I do not know if 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.360
 Facebook 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.970
 in any case there are two modes that I saw 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.170
 because the stones and makes them excuse 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.440
 I'm a budget train it's a 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.970
 little morning there and so there is already this 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.600
 mode is another mode that I you 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.100
 will present this on another video that 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.640
 we will say who is twice more 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.020
 interesting that it's good so here it is 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.750
 allows to remove as I had you 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.150
 says the mother of his address is so there 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.860
 the peculiarity q that I like 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.110
 of course this world if we can do it in 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.430
 single player mode and a multiplayer mode 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.860
 so there frankly if you and with 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.240
 friends on the online frankly you 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.510
 can do this mode simply 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.850
 it's really very 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.150
 well done nice I 'm on both 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.100
 modes 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.800
 so you can then walk there 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.690
 a little who like you live or any 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.640
 dressed in white of course where a 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.190
 helicopter forward what you want 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.320
 so now we are going to pass but rather 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.870
 have already you will download the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.150
 file that is safe 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.720
 on his twitter and then once 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.720
 this discharge is little extracted on 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.040
 files on winrar once 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.700
 you 're going to find a file 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.910
 named as have so it's on the second 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.070
 post and so with this file 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.880
 you will replace this file with the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.850
 file of the day so so there just in 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.880
 doing that you have a mode on your 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.590
 ps3 and after tomorrow it's true I have everything 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.170
 simply and you enjoy the world 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.570
 so what's stressed is it's not necessary 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.630
 forget to always keep the files 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.890
 origin could interfere with the game for ps3 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.490
 never 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.490
 parenthesis like that so 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.280
 on the description genius also the site 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.209

 France 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.830

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.560
 that's all the way even if he does not have 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.360
 including 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.550
 did that mean by resort to 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.990
 tutoring all about the a10 rub shoulders with me 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.560
