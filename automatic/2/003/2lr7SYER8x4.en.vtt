dissimilar to boot into a CD you'd have

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.140 
dissimilar to boot into a CD you'd have
to<00:01:31.740> change<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.130> boot<00:01:32.280> order<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> pro<00:01:32.939> in

to change the boot order in the pro in

their BIOS to boot to CD and actually

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.550 
their BIOS to boot to CD and actually

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
will your boot into con boot and then it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.929 
will your boot into con boot and then it
would<00:01:37.680> actually<00:01:37.979> get<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> password<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.759> yes

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
would actually get the password for yes

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.910 
would actually get the password for yes
and<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.270> let<00:01:40.049> me<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.290> shut<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.619> down<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and it's so let me just shut this down a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.510 
and it's so let me just shut this down a
sec<00:01:41.360> because<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.630> need<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.810> change<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.520> boot

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
order to boot to this ISO image I'm just

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.700 
order to boot to this ISO image I'm just
going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> shut<00:01:48.090> down<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:49.170> come<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.500> here

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
going to shut down and then come in here

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.760 
going to shut down and then come in here
and<00:01:50.149> then<00:01:51.149> change<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.689> boot<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.380> con

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and then change it to boot to this con

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.370 
and then change it to boot to this con
boot<00:01:53.009> as<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:53.610> here<00:01:53.880> boot<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.630> CD

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380

so<00:02:00.000> all<00:02:00.149> I've<00:02:00.299> done<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.810> boot<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.380> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so all I've done is just boot into that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.310 
so all I've done is just boot into that
ISO<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.299> you'll<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.630> page<00:02:03.750> come<00:02:04.170> up

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
ISO and you'll get this page come up

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.230 
ISO and you'll get this page come up
pushing<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> keyboard

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.490 

you'll<00:02:09.240> get<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.600> sort<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.869> stuff<00:02:10.080> coming<00:02:10.410> up

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you'll get this sort of stuff coming up

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.270 
you'll get this sort of stuff coming up
let<00:02:11.070> it<00:02:11.100> do<00:02:11.340> its<00:02:11.490> thing

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
let it do its thing

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.010 
let it do its thing
don't<00:02:14.280> touch<00:02:14.520> nothing<00:02:14.550> he'll<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
don't touch nothing he'll get to the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.170 
don't touch nothing he'll get to the
next<00:02:16.200> stage<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.550> will<00:02:20.670> load<00:02:20.820> up<00:02:20.850> this

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
next stage and it will load up this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.720 
next stage and it will load up this
stuff<00:02:21.450> like<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.740> won't<00:02:22.950> see<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.250> boxes

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
stuff like so you won't see this boxes

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.570 
stuff like so you won't see this boxes
because<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.300> virtual<00:02:24.660> machine<00:02:25.250> we<00:02:26.250> let<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
because it's a virtual machine we let it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.090 
because it's a virtual machine we let it
load<00:02:26.760> up<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.900> once<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> password

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
load up and once we get to the password

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.370 
load up and once we get to the password
stage<00:02:32.520> we<00:02:33.390> just<00:02:33.420> push<00:02:33.780> enter<00:02:34.020> on<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.140> keyboard

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
stage we just push enter on a keyboard

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.840 
stage we just push enter on a keyboard
and<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.950> should<00:02:35.130> let<00:02:35.310> us<00:02:35.400> straight<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
and it should let us straight on the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.670 
and it should let us straight on the
machine<00:02:36.180> without<00:02:36.510> even<00:02:36.900> such<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.260> put<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
machine without even such it put in the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.350 
machine without even such it put in the
password<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.390> how<00:02:39.390> easy<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.810> that

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
password in how easy is that

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.980 
password in how easy is that
so<00:02:42.360> we're<00:02:43.020> needed<00:02:43.320> out

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.710 

and<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:49.920> going<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.130> be<00:02:50.280> really<00:02:50.610> handy<00:02:50.820> if

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
and this is going to be really handy if

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.210 
and this is going to be really handy if
you<00:02:51.930> don't<00:02:52.170> want<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.650> can<00:02:52.770> actually<00:02:52.890> hide

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
you don't want it you can actually hide

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.950 
you don't want it you can actually hide
your<00:02:53.460> tracks<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.820> let<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.150> know<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.810> you've

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
your tracks to let you know that you've

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.630 
your tracks to let you know that you've
not<00:02:55.110> even<00:02:55.260> logged<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:55.980> here<00:02:56.220> we<00:02:56.310> got<00:02:56.490> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
not even logged in so here we got the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.730 
not even logged in so here we got the
actual<00:02:56.910> login<00:02:57.390> screen<00:02:57.690> again<00:02:58.050> therefore<00:02:58.590> just

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
actual login screen again therefore just

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.320 
actual login screen again therefore just
pushing<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.160> on<00:02:59.280> my<00:02:59.400> keyboard<00:02:59.820> here<00:02:59.880> if<00:03:00.150> not

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
pushing it on my keyboard here if not

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.350 
pushing it on my keyboard here if not
typed<00:03:00.600> nothing<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:01.640> we<00:03:02.640> should<00:03:02.670> actually<00:03:03.150> just

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
typed nothing in we should actually just

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.860 
typed nothing in we should actually just
log<00:03:03.720> straight<00:03:03.960> onto<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.380> desktop<00:03:05.780> there<00:03:06.780> you
