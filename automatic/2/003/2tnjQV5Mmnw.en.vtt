applications and then we're going to
make<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.750> folder<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.559> by<00:00:46.890> holding<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.430> icon

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
make a folder just by holding the icon

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.540 
make a folder just by holding the icon
over<00:00:48.239> another<00:00:48.510> icon<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.250> see<00:00:50.520> right

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
over another icon so you can see right

over another icon so you can see right
here<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.940> we've<00:00:51.149> created<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.600> folder<00:00:51.750> we're

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
here that we've created a folder we're

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.959 
here that we've created a folder we're
not<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.649> let<00:00:52.829> go<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.219> app<00:00:53.370> we're

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
not going to let go of the app we're

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.549 
not going to let go of the app we're
going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> pull<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.390> back<00:00:54.539> down<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.170> close<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
going to pull it back down to close the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.189 
going to pull it back down to close the
folder<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.100> let<00:00:57.059> go<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.140> that

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.139 
folder and then let go just like that
now<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> voice<00:00:58.920> memos<00:00:59.340> application<00:01:00.000> is

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
now the voice memos application is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.290 
now the voice memos application is
completely<00:01:01.020> gone<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.859> hidden<00:01:02.300> again

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

over<00:01:15.990> an<00:01:16.170> icon<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:17.310> create<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.670> folder<00:01:18.710> right

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
over an icon to create a folder right

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.649 
over an icon to create a folder right
here<00:01:19.740> once<00:01:20.520> we've<00:01:20.670> created<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.210> folder<00:01:21.390> we're

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
here once we've created the folder we're

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.240 
here once we've created the folder we're
going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.840> pull<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> application<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:23.009> back

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
going to pull the application right back

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.630 
going to pull the application right back
out<00:01:23.490> let<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.380> completely<00:01:25.830> gone<00:01:25.860> just

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
out let go and it's completely gone just

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.660 
out let go and it's completely gone just
like<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.420> no<00:01:27.570> more<00:01:27.750> compass<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.350> no<00:01:29.310> more

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
like that so no more compass and no more

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.749 
like that so no more compass and no more
voice<00:01:30.060> memos<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.740> actually<00:01:31.979> pretty<00:01:32.430> simple

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
voice memos so actually pretty simple

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.179 
voice memos so actually pretty simple
