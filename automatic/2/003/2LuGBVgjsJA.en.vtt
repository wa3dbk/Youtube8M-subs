00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.360
 this very moment the new dragon that 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.749
 we have come to bring you today is to the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.749
 eternal good this dragon is supposed to be 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:24.509
 I had to have brought a little more 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.450
 before the channel and it was it was for the reason 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.490
 that did not go up 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.620
 here I explained in the previous video 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.540
 so I'm not going to explain it again 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.540
 again for you to watch the video 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.160
 previous that was without more I'm not mistaken 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.070
 let me see that I never remember the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.070
 name of this dragon 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.720
 we will talk about this same was that already 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.420
 they could see this dragon good what 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.210
 unlocks just yesterday so I did not have to 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.180
 pay no money yes for what I have 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 I want to play but I had to pay 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.300
 runes because I did not unlock it before 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.440
 World Premiere 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.860
 well here is the dragon as you can 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.630
 see has a forest appearance of 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.520
 wood and what this dragon does for 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.360
 those who do not have not seen 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.940
 no video or have nothing on this 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.960
 is what it does is drive the wood if 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.720
 I give here to improve all these 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.729
 things from here to collect wood it 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.200
 multiply and they will get more income 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.330
 to pick them up as you can see without further 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.670
 I do not remember this dragon and they see that 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.460
 it came out normal and it came out in letters 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.509
 yellow and it's because this dragon was 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.030
 driven by this thing here that as 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.830
 I told them they do not use it because it spends and 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.840
 gems but 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.460
 I have enough but you do not use it 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.920
 well that 's one thing that I wanted them 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.869
 show about this dragon 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.240
 here it is in the face as you can see it 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.180
 I do the maximum they can be like 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.659
 so they can see their appearance well 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.660
 back and your foot as you can see it's like 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:14.410
 which link of a cave I do not know if I can 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.410
 see the animation I can not see it 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.000
 like all dragons of this type 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.000
 they add something in the hangar and it's 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.590
 mainly two new types of 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.290

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.300

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.570
