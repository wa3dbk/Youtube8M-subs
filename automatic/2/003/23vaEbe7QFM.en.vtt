we're<00:00:11.160> going<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.429> take<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> look<00:00:11.969> at<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.480> smart

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
we're going to take a look at the smart

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.660 
we're going to take a look at the smart
storage<00:00:13.320> system<00:00:13.740> now<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.429> something

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
storage system now this is something

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.039 
storage system now this is something
that<00:00:14.759> I've<00:00:14.849> recently<00:00:15.059> built<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.780> hermit

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
that I've recently built on the hermit

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.210 
that I've recently built on the hermit
craft<00:00:16.289> server<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.650> what<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.830> allows<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.130> to

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
craft server and what it allows you to

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.099 
craft server and what it allows you to
do<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> store<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> bunch<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.210> items<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.810> chest

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
do is store a bunch of items in a chest

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.779 
do is store a bunch of items in a chest
up<00:00:19.260> at<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> top<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:20.010> then<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.310> backup

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
up at the top but then have backup

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.880 
up at the top but then have backup
storage<00:00:21.090> down<00:00:21.510> underneath<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.590> as<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.769> can

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
storage down underneath so as you can

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.769 
storage down underneath so as you can
see<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.250> chest<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.670> almost<00:00:24.000> full<00:00:24.269> if<00:00:24.660> we

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
see this chest is almost full if we

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.480 
see this chest is almost full if we
chuck<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.170> bunch<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.529> items<00:00:25.920> into<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.279> top

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
chuck a bunch of items into this top

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.920 
chuck a bunch of items into this top
hopper<00:00:26.699> here<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.599> they<00:00:27.720> float

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
hopper here you will see that they float

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
hopper here you will see that they float
through<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> chest<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.710> actually<00:00:29.310> down<00:00:29.519> into

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
through the chest and actually down into

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.339 
through the chest and actually down into
all<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.210> these<00:00:30.390> chests<00:00:30.779> down<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> bottom

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
all of these chests down on the bottom

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.500 
all of these chests down on the bottom
so<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.070> backup<00:00:32.309> storage<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.360> use

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
so you can have backup storage for use

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.040 
so you can have backup storage for use
in<00:00:33.750> farms<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.230> things<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.660> want<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> get

any random items they can be anything
that<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.270> want<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> want<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> place<00:01:12.960> all

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that you want but you want to place all

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.440 
that you want but you want to place all
of<00:01:13.260> those<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.710> full<00:01:14.189> nine<00:01:14.700> full<00:01:15.090> stacks

running straight into this comparator

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.140 
running straight into this comparator
and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.250> will<00:01:20.400> compare<00:01:20.759> signal

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and then they will compare signal

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.640 
and then they will compare signal
strengths<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.659> give<00:01:21.810> an<00:01:21.900> output<00:01:22.080> depending

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
strengths and give an output depending

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.170 
strengths and give an output depending
