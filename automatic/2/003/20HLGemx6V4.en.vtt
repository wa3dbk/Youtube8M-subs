00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.440 
hi guys so today we were playing with
the<00:00:19.980> X<00:00:20.280> 47<00:00:21.150> rail<00:00:21.900> made<00:00:22.439> by<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.770> TDI<00:00:23.400> arms<00:00:24.060> out

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
the X 47 rail made by the TDI arms out

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.830 
the X 47 rail made by the TDI arms out
of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.930> Israel<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.880> I<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.360> tell<00:00:27.540> you<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
of the Israel and I have to tell you the

time quite impressed with that rail it

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.380 
time quite impressed with that rail it
is<00:00:30.360> a<00:00:30.390> standard<00:00:31.050> quad<00:00:31.560> rail<00:00:31.920> as<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.180> see

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
is a standard quad rail as you can see

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.299 
is a standard quad rail as you can see
you<00:00:33.480> got<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.199> top<00:00:34.440> right<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you got it right on the top right on the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.510 
you got it right on the top right on the
side<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.879> bottom<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> other<00:00:36.930> side

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
side at the bottom and on the other side

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.119 
side at the bottom and on the other side
but<00:00:38.520> then<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.330> this<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> wonderful

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
but then you have this a wonderful

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.880 
but then you have this a wonderful
attachment<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:41.760> goes<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.620> dust

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
attachment which goes over the dust

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.030 
attachment which goes over the dust
cover<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.699> allows<00:00:45.330> you<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.900> mount<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.470> optic

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
cover and allows you to mount the optic

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.610 
cover and allows you to mount the optic
on<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> don't<00:00:48.750> want<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.230> optic

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
on it if you don't want to have an optic

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040 
on it if you don't want to have an optic
you<00:00:49.649> still<00:00:50.130> can<00:00:50.280> use<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.610> Ironsides<00:00:51.300> there<00:00:51.899> is

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you still can use the Ironsides there is

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
you still can use the Ironsides there is
a<00:00:52.079> clearance<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.950> there<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.520> clear

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
a clearance in it there is a clear

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.450 
a clearance in it there is a clear
channel<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.200> use<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.590> idle<00:00:55.920> side<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
channel and you can use the idle side so

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.209 
channel and you can use the idle side so
for<00:00:56.700> targeting<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.590> want<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.860> put<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
for targeting but if you want to put the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.000 
for targeting but if you want to put the
optic<00:00:59.579> as<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:00.540> even<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> longer

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
optic as you can see even that a longer

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.820 
optic as you can see even that a longer
yo<00:01:02.250> tech<00:01:02.550> sits<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.450> it<00:01:03.600> without<00:01:03.780> any<00:01:04.229> problems

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
yo tech sits on it without any problems

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.940 
yo tech sits on it without any problems
and<00:01:05.190> it's<00:01:05.759> it's<00:01:06.090> very<00:01:06.360> accurate<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.740> did

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and it's it's very accurate so we did

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.279 
and it's it's very accurate so we did
some<00:01:08.550> stress<00:01:09.030> testing<00:01:09.570> because<00:01:09.840> first<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.259> was

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
some stress testing because first I was

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.160 
some stress testing because first I was
afraid<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.070> maybe<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.789> dovetail<00:01:12.450> pole<00:01:12.899> is

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
afraid that maybe that dovetail pole is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.650 
afraid that maybe that dovetail pole is
not<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> hold<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.250> well<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.420> what

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
not going to hold up very well so what

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.559 
not going to hold up very well so what
you<00:01:15.810> did<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.560> did<00:01:17.190> push<00:01:17.399> ups<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.789> it<00:01:17.940> so

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:18.569 
you did with it I did push ups on it so

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.449 
you did with it I did push ups on it so
basically<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.289> happened<00:01:19.709> was<00:01:19.740> guys<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> make

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
basically what happened was guys to make

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.449 
basically what happened was guys to make
it<00:01:20.640> clear<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.479> use<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.110> report<00:01:22.920> did<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> push

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:23.459 
it clear we use the report did the push

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.180 
it clear we use the report did the push
ups<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.000> optic<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.319> put<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.830> much<00:01:26.130> pressure

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
ups on the optic to put as much pressure

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.050 
ups on the optic to put as much pressure
as<00:01:27.030> possible<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.500> dovetail<00:01:29.160> and<00:01:29.429> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
as possible on that dovetail and to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.240 
as possible on that dovetail and to
basically<00:01:30.509> see<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.470> going<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.039> back

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
basically see if it's going to go back

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.600 
basically see if it's going to go back
to<00:01:32.280> zero<00:01:32.849> or<00:01:33.090> not<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.160> it<00:01:35.160> worked<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:35.550> very

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
to zero or not and it worked out very

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.139 
to zero or not and it worked out very
well<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.420> mean<00:01:36.780> every<00:01:37.110> time<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.679> a<00:01:37.709> hit<00:01:38.149> so

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
well I mean every time that was a hit so

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.520 
well I mean every time that was a hit so
it's<00:01:39.179> not<00:01:40.459> prone<00:01:41.459> to<00:01:41.490> any<00:01:42.179> damages<00:01:42.959> when<00:01:43.229> when

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
it's not prone to any damages when when

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.990 
it's not prone to any damages when when
you<00:01:43.709> you<00:01:43.890> know<00:01:43.920> even<00:01:44.310> putting<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.819> lot<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you you know even putting a lot of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120 
you you know even putting a lot of
pressure<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.289> happen<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.770> few

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
pressure and this can happen in the few

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.880 
pressure and this can happen in the few
oh<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.819> did<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> push<00:01:48.300> ups<00:01:48.539> on<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.349> you<00:01:49.860> can

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
oh we did the push ups on it but you can

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.130 
oh we did the push ups on it but you can
drop<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.550> weapon<00:01:50.940> or<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.179> can<00:01:51.780> bang<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
drop the weapon or you can bang the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.440 
drop the weapon or you can bang the
weapon<00:01:52.440> against<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> tree<00:01:53.160> or<00:01:53.280> something<00:01:53.880> so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
weapon against the tree or something so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.180 
weapon against the tree or something so
it's<00:01:54.780> good<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.050> know<00:01:55.349> that<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.709> is<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> saw

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
it's good to know that this is a saw

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.990 
it's good to know that this is a saw
detail<00:01:56.550> mounting<00:01:57.060> system<00:01:57.569> so<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.789> say

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
detail mounting system so I would say

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.870 
detail mounting system so I would say
that<00:02:00.209> it<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.420> very<00:02:01.050> well<00:02:01.380> another<00:02:02.190> interesting

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that it is very well another interesting

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.790 
that it is very well another interesting
factor<00:02:03.300> is<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.899> how<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.289> rail<00:02:04.560> is

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
factor is this is how this rail is

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.550 
factor is this is how this rail is
attaching<00:02:05.459> to<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.330> receiver<00:02:06.750> there<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.319> like

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
attaching to the receiver there is like

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.279 
attaching to the receiver there is like
a<00:02:07.590> screw<00:02:08.190> which<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.580> clamp<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:09.420> screw<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
a screw which is clamp on screw and

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.250 
a screw which is clamp on screw and
you're<00:02:10.709> tightening<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.030> basically<00:02:12.750> this

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you're tightening it and basically this

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.830 
you're tightening it and basically this
gives<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.980> side<00:02:14.370> mounting<00:02:15.030> point<00:02:15.330> right<00:02:15.810> up

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
gives the side mounting point right up

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.550 
gives the side mounting point right up
here<00:02:16.349> then<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.430> course<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.360> cleanses<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.349> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
here then of course it cleanses to the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.119 
here then of course it cleanses to the
front<00:02:20.550> or<00:02:20.970> handguards<00:02:21.540> bracket<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:22.620> then<00:02:22.890> at

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
front or handguards bracket but then at

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.280 
front or handguards bracket but then at
the<00:02:23.430> bottom<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.209> or<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.719> got<00:02:24.900> another

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the bottom of it or you got another

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.020 
the bottom of it or you got another
screw<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.579> a<00:02:26.610> tension<00:02:27.239> screw

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
screw this is like a tension screw

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.870 
screw this is like a tension screw
which<00:02:28.200> helps<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.260> clamp<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.310> our<00:02:30.640> lower

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
which helps to clamp this our lower

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.870 
which helps to clamp this our lower
portion<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.569> rail<00:02:31.840> even<00:02:32.470> more<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.580> to

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
portion of the rail even more to the to

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.330 
portion of the rail even more to the to
the<00:02:34.000> rifle<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.810> works<00:02:35.050> very<00:02:35.290> well<00:02:35.620> Paul

really<00:03:03.100> really<00:03:03.489> nice<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.870> only<00:03:05.080> thing<00:03:05.500> which

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
really really nice the only thing which

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.690 
really really nice the only thing which
I'm<00:03:06.459> fighting<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:08.019> probably<00:03:08.830> some<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.670> you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
I'm fighting and probably some of you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.449 
I'm fighting and probably some of you
will<00:03:09.970> be<00:03:10.120> probably<00:03:10.390> upset<00:03:11.080> about<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.739> with

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
will be probably upset about it is with

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.420 
will be probably upset about it is with
the<00:03:12.730> dovetail<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.630> only<00:03:13.930> negative<00:03:14.440> is<00:03:14.650> or<00:03:15.069> you

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
the dovetail the only negative is or you

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.570 
the dovetail the only negative is or you
cannot<00:03:15.910> feel<00:03:16.450> strip<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.500> rifle<00:03:17.950> right<00:03:18.100> now<00:03:18.310> I

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
cannot feel strip the rifle right now I

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.759 
cannot feel strip the rifle right now I
mean<00:03:19.390> if<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.810> will<00:03:19.930> try<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.200> open<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:21.100> cover

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
mean if you will try to open that cover

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.699 
mean if you will try to open that cover
right<00:03:23.769> now<00:03:23.800> and<00:03:24.640> see<00:03:25.450> what's<00:03:25.630> happening<00:03:26.080> you

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
right now and see what's happening you

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.699 
right now and see what's happening you
know<00:03:26.830> it's<00:03:27.010> very<00:03:27.069> hard<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:28.180> pull<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.600> up<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:29.440> it

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
know it's very hard to pull it up so it

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.340 
know it's very hard to pull it up so it
is<00:03:29.920> what<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.630> basically<00:03:31.630> when<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.989> got<00:03:32.170> it

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
is what it is basically when you got it

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.130 
is what it is basically when you got it
mounted<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.310> way<00:03:33.610> I<00:03:33.880> have<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.690> be<00:03:34.840> aware<00:03:35.079> that

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
mounted that way I have to be aware that

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.810 
mounted that way I have to be aware that
you're<00:03:35.500> going<00:03:35.739> have<00:03:35.920> probably<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.549> problem

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
you're going have probably a problem

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.030 
you're going have probably a problem
with<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.690> field<00:03:37.900> stripping<00:03:38.410> curve<00:03:38.709> there

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
with the field stripping curve there

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.440 
with the field stripping curve there
life<00:03:39.190> or<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.549> may<00:03:39.700> have<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:39.940> problem<00:03:40.209> with

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
life or you may have a problem with

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.060 
life or you may have a problem with
field<00:03:40.630> stripping<00:03:40.989> life<00:03:41.230> that's<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.829> only

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
field stripping life that's the only

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.580 
field stripping life that's the only
negative<00:03:42.269> I'm<00:03:43.269> finding<00:03:43.780> with<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:44.140> with<00:03:44.440> the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
negative I'm finding with it with the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.979 
negative I'm finding with it with the
dry<00:03:44.769> other<00:03:45.070> than<00:03:45.370> this<00:03:45.579> it<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:46.209> extremely<00:03:46.420> well

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
dry other than this it is extremely well

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.920 
dry other than this it is extremely well
designed<00:03:47.260> product<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.130> I<00:03:48.790> know<00:03:49.090> that<00:03:49.630> for

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
designed product and I know that for

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.890 
designed product and I know that for
sure<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:51.190> Israeli<00:03:51.850> or<00:03:52.120> Defense<00:03:52.510> Forces

sure that the Israeli or Defense Forces

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.830 
sure that the Israeli or Defense Forces
are<00:03:53.230> using<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.130> in<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.700> field<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:55.720> is

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
are using this in the field so it is

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.009 
are using this in the field so it is
about<00:03:56.079> improving<00:03:56.620> rail<00:03:56.970> that's<00:03:57.970> probably<00:03:58.900> you

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
about improving rail that's probably you

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.890 
about improving rail that's probably you
know<00:03:59.170> all<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.560> have<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.920> know<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:01.840> know

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
that the TDI are ships that the rail to

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.229 
that the TDI are ships that the rail to
Russia<00:04:05.530> as<00:04:05.890> well<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.519> lot<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.790> Russian

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
Russia as well and a lot of Russian

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.780 
Russia as well and a lot of Russian
Spetsnaz<00:04:07.989> operators<00:04:08.680> they're<00:04:09.280> using<00:04:09.640> that

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
Spetsnaz operators they're using that

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.590 
Spetsnaz operators they're using that
rail<00:04:10.060> in<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.630> field<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.280> fully<00:04:12.700> but

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
rail in the field so it is a fully but

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.830 
rail in the field so it is a fully but
improving<00:04:14.200> system<00:04:15.100> into<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:15.880> very<00:04:16.150> well<00:04:16.390> design

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
improving system into a very well design

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.699 
improving system into a very well design
one<00:04:17.769> more<00:04:17.979> thing<00:04:18.280> uh<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:19.450> what's<00:04:20.169> your<00:04:20.380> take<00:04:20.560> on

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
one more thing uh I what's your take on

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.340 
one more thing uh I what's your take on
the<00:04:20.859> weight<00:04:21.039> of<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.459> Paul<00:04:21.700> hey<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:23.050> didn't

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
the weight of it Paul hey it didn't

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.740 
the weight of it Paul hey it didn't
really<00:04:23.530> seem<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:24.729> know<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:25.120> have<00:04:25.630> the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
really seem that you know I have the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.630 
really seem that you know I have the
chaos<00:04:26.050> rail<00:04:26.289> on<00:04:26.440> my<00:04:26.560> rifle<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.340> doesn't

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
chaos rail on my rifle and it doesn't

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.310 
chaos rail on my rifle and it doesn't
weigh<00:04:27.729> a<00:04:27.760> whole<00:04:27.970> lot<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.870> would<00:04:29.050> say<00:04:29.200> this

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
weigh a whole lot and I would say this

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.010 
weigh a whole lot and I would say this
is<00:04:29.470> pretty<00:04:29.650> close<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.250> same

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
is pretty close to the same

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.020 
is pretty close to the same
holding<00:04:32.259> this<00:04:32.379> rifle<00:04:32.620> in<00:04:32.889> mine<00:04:33.430> comparatively

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
holding this rifle in mine comparatively

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.700 
holding this rifle in mine comparatively
they're<00:04:34.419> about<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.900> same<00:04:35.110> weight<00:04:35.319> so<00:04:35.560> it

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
they're about the same weight so it

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.710 
they're about the same weight so it
wasn't<00:04:36.009> a<00:04:36.069> whole<00:04:36.250> lot<00:04:36.280> of<00:04:36.580> change<00:04:36.819> to<00:04:37.060> me<00:04:37.210> yeah

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
wasn't a whole lot of change to me yeah

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.950 
wasn't a whole lot of change to me yeah
you<00:04:38.349> know<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:39.190> will<00:04:39.370> feel<00:04:39.639> it<00:04:39.759> for<00:04:40.419> sure<00:04:40.659> it's

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
you know you will feel it for sure it's

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.050 
you know you will feel it for sure it's
more<00:04:41.229> than<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.500> standard<00:04:42.129> hand<00:04:42.340> guards<00:04:42.639> on<00:04:42.819> a

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
more than the standard hand guards on a

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.119 
more than the standard hand guards on a
rifle<00:04:43.479> but<00:04:44.110> it's<00:04:44.289> not<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.620> bad

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
rifle but it's not that bad

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.580 
rifle but it's not that bad
I<00:04:45.159> mean<00:04:45.490> they<00:04:45.639> did<00:04:45.819> a<00:04:45.849> lot<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.240> good<00:04:47.020> job<00:04:47.349> you

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
I mean they did a lot of good job you

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.350 
I mean they did a lot of good job you
know<00:04:47.620> using<00:04:47.949> these<00:04:48.250> slots<00:04:48.639> and<00:04:48.940> everything

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
know using these slots and everything

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.409 
know using these slots and everything
not<00:04:49.539> just<00:04:49.569> for<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.110> cooling<00:04:50.530> but<00:04:51.039> also<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:52.090> get

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
not just for the cooling but also to get

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.969 
not just for the cooling but also to get
rid<00:04:52.479> of<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.900> weight<00:04:53.080> basically<00:04:53.590> that's<00:04:53.860> what

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
rid of the weight basically that's what

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.010 
rid of the weight basically that's what
they<00:04:54.159> did<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:54.610> they<00:04:54.970> accomplished<00:04:55.479> this<00:04:55.690> all

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
they did and they accomplished this all

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.670 
they did and they accomplished this all
perfectly<00:04:56.759> we<00:04:57.759> couldn't<00:04:58.150> do<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.629> heat<00:04:59.379> test

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
perfectly we couldn't do the heat test

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.469 
perfectly we couldn't do the heat test
our<00:04:59.949> standard<00:05:00.490> nightly<00:05:00.789> rounds<00:05:00.909> heat<00:05:01.210> test

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
our standard nightly rounds heat test

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.899 
our standard nightly rounds heat test
today<00:05:01.659> that's<00:05:02.319> just<00:05:02.470> because<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:03.159> MO<00:05:03.520> become

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
today that's just because the MO become

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.059 
today that's just because the MO become
very<00:05:04.360> very<00:05:04.569> scarce<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.319> we<00:05:05.560> had<00:05:05.680> it<00:05:05.860> on<00:05:05.979> the

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
very very scarce and we had it on the

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.409 
very very scarce and we had it on the
545<00:05:06.880> by<00:05:06.909> 39<00:05:07.710> but<00:05:08.710> at<00:05:09.130> some<00:05:09.400> point<00:05:09.759> we<00:05:10.120> will<00:05:10.270> do

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
545 by 39 but at some point we will do

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.589 
545 by 39 but at some point we will do
the<00:05:10.569> heat<00:05:10.780> test<00:05:11.020> on<00:05:11.620> that<00:05:11.830> rail<00:05:12.099> so<00:05:13.000> far<00:05:13.300> so

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
the heat test on that rail so far so

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.420 
the heat test on that rail so far so
good<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:13.960> would<00:05:14.110> say<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.560> first<00:05:14.830> impressions

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430
