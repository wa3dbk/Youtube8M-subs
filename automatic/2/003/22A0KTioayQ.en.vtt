00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.329
 there he is at level 12 at a more 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.160
 or less life of them 650 remembering that 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.120
 You always have to discount 110 because I 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.850
 I have the bonuses are 150 is mania 11 level 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.619
 a somewhat low life hockey for the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.080
 What level has he stayed in English? 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.680
 which has a lower level and life is 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.900
 bigger than that, so it's one with our 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.590
 people of all a life more or less ok 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.610

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.880
 low 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.450
 Okay, it's not so, it's more or less. 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.060

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.170
 Bad well keep him armor right. 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.900

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.850
 good rock improvements on the part 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.829
 to share snake venom in 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.450
 numbers close to the part trained 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.479
 share an allied cobra that will 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.820
 attack to delay close friends 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.250

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.170
 square insurance year to carry one 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.630
 Snake throws loose to take a 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.909
 snake bouncing off enemies 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.759
 and collect items by the way 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.070
 And then you choose or you better be 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.469
 hence you hold the square and loose 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.509

 You 're because it 's the one in the triangle. 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.690
 I preferred it because because it 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.430
 already become quite confident 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.590

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.360
 gun cover judas and left a 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.870
 I sing and she shoots the enemies. 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.060
 this helps a lot is allied consumption 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.670
 And then when you or the right 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.970
 enemies poisoned them is left here 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.040
 ok of explosions the cidasc dignifies the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.410
 enemies 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.210
 ok then there you choose you see that 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.680
 Do you prefer if you prefer the snake? 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.960
 or held the square here creating snakes 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.780
 to get a new skin that increases 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.510
 certain critics and absorbs damages absorb 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.190
 dana makes the skin and if it falls and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.820
 come back after a short time 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.110
 that's it then that's what makes the skin 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:02.410
 his 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:08.200

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:16.120
 purple face I never saw but beauty is life 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:18.010
 on the underside of the ball to give a 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.550
 quick blow with the syrup on enemies 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.500
 close to the ball part to take a 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.760
 projectile design that sings of bone 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.630
 safe x to jump and hit the ground 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.520
 causing damage and non-Corinthian enemies 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.470
 the good part to take three big 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.500
 projects of bones at once 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.430
 Okay, you decide so much the mockery that 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.730
 You hold the ball to prepare the ball. 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.010
 bandar release to propel itself to 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.860
 front causing enemy damage on the way 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.860
 that you jump forward with all your might 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.840
 and here you hold ball but invest 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.510
 play forwards you bring a mega 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.760
 bone snake from the ground so here you 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.480
 It brings several snakes and below the 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.310
 that on the bottom you invoke several 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.660
 tombstones also when you do the derby 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.480
 Here you get a new skin and it increases 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.700
 speed and absorb damage absorb 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.410
 damage to the skin if it is lost and wanted back 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:26.880
 after a short time all 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.650
 Selective quick throws also that the game 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.800
 if you hold you snake too 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.250
