00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.120
 thickness as we see this is the box says 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.400
 huawei ascend p 6 and it's a very box 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.680
 pretty white 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.810
 It has a different texture than the one 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.180
 we get used to the different 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.219
 smartphones feels flat feels 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.219
 very beautiful here we look at the logo 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.370

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.559
 back nothing and here on the side 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.739
 we have a small strap that is going to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.140
 allow to take out the device we are going to 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.249
 take it out and the first thing you see there 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.309
 is the huawei do p6 in the version of 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.050
 black there are several colors but it is very 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.550
 pretty the design of this box in a 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.170
 different way of packing the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.389
 smartphones and as we see there first 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.400
 is the huawei 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:07.860
 of six let's look at what else has the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.250
 box first we found very well 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.270
 packed 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.880
 for sure he will come 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.210
 usb cable with you can see there 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.429
 white long enough to 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.950
 connect it to the computer or load the 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.979
 smartphone and with you can see there 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.439
 it looks good quality here we have the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.890
 charger in colombia 'bank and the version 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:37.420
 normal charger and something else that brings 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.920
 this the hearing aids that are going to be white 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.709
 they will also have a very good 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.729
 quality as you can see there are 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:49.119
 hearing aids 3.5 mm and that 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.929
 They look a bit like the iPhone 5 but 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.700
 they are really good and also 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.600
 long enough to be able 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.659
 hear everything very well 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.790
 ok now we go with the manuals the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.520
 typical manuals also come in a 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.670
 very well organized box that if we 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.289
 like a lot of huawei organizes very well 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.080
 your packaging and as you can see 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.920
 there's the start guide 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.290
 It is good to give a law to each of 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.240
 these manuals before using the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.970
 team and something very interesting that is coming 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.220
 it's a factory case we're going to uncover 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.950
 the and as you can see there is a 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.110
 Silicone sheath 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.410
 elastic very well its edges look very 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:41.540
 either entirely made of plastic 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:44.600
 silicone and that will surely give you a 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.430
 extra protection to this team as 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.080
 you can see there fits very well 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.420
 then they will not have absolutely 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.920
 no problem and it's a very good thing 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.400
 then as you can see this what 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.810
 who brings the box the smartphone 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.670

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.799

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.890
