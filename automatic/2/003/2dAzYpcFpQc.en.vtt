practice arena you can turn them on and
off<00:01:12.320> with<00:01:12.680> l2<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.760> can<00:01:13.970> move<00:01:14.150> this<00:01:14.360> aiming

off with l2 you can move this aiming
help<00:01:14.960> with<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.320> left<00:01:15.530> stick<00:01:15.830> you<00:01:16.220> can<00:01:16.280> see

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
help with the left stick you can see

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.580 
help with the left stick you can see
some<00:01:16.880> examples<00:01:17.390> for<00:01:17.510> that<00:01:17.570> in<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.140> background

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
some examples for that in the background

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.920 
some examples for that in the background
where<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.370> aiming<00:01:19.670> cursor<00:01:20.000> is<00:01:20.150> turned<00:01:20.450> on<00:01:20.690> and

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
where the aiming cursor is turned on and

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.080 
where the aiming cursor is turned on and
this<00:01:21.500> is<00:01:21.560> what<00:01:21.860> our<00:01:22.070> technique<00:01:22.909> for

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
this is what our technique for

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.300 
this is what our technique for
well-placed<00:01:23.510> penalties<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.229> based<00:01:24.530> on<00:01:24.799> it's

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
well-placed penalties is based on it's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.490 
well-placed penalties is based on it's
separated<00:01:25.970> into<00:01:26.060> three<00:01:26.570> parts<00:01:26.810> which<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:27.350> will

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
separated into three parts which I will

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.830 
separated into three parts which I will
explain<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.070> now<00:01:28.190> first<00:01:29.150> it's<00:01:29.390> important

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
explain to you now first it's important

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.570 
explain to you now first it's important
that<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.320> hit<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.650> composer<00:01:31.070> bar<00:01:31.340> which<00:01:31.549> is

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
that you hit the composer bar which is

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.760 
that you hit the composer bar which is
on<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.090> bottom<00:01:32.360> left<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.690> your<00:01:32.840> screen<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.440> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
the shoot button when the white marker

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.210 
the shoot button when the white marker
which<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.630> moving<00:01:38.960> right<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.230> left<00:01:39.620> is<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:40.190> the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
which is moving right and left is in the

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.820 
which is moving right and left is in the
green<00:01:40.610> area<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.660> better<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:42.050> hit<00:01:42.230> it<00:01:42.350> the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
green area the better you hit it the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.540 
green area the better you hit it the
more<00:01:43.370> accurate<00:01:43.880> is<00:01:44.090> your<00:01:44.330> penalty<00:01:45.250> second<00:01:46.250> you

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
more accurate is your penalty second you

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.940 
more accurate is your penalty second you
power<00:01:46.820> up<00:01:47.060> your<00:01:47.270> shot<00:01:47.480> the<00:01:48.260> longer<00:01:48.650> you<00:01:48.770> hold

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
power up your shot the longer you hold

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.890 
power up your shot the longer you hold
the<00:01:49.160> shooting<00:01:49.550> button<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.330> more<00:01:50.540> powerful

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
the shooting button the more powerful

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.770 
the shooting button the more powerful
your<00:01:51.320> penalty<00:01:51.770> will<00:01:51.950> be<00:01:52.100> but<00:01:52.760> also<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.600> less

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
your penalty will be but also the less

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.580 
your penalty will be but also the less
accurate<00:01:54.080> it<00:01:54.620> will<00:01:54.830> be<00:01:54.980> so<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.730> would<00:01:56.150> recommend

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
accurate it will be so I would recommend

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.890 
accurate it will be so I would recommend
50%<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.070> maximum<00:01:58.220> power<00:01:58.550> because<00:01:59.510> then

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
50% of the maximum power because then

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.440 
50% of the maximum power because then
your<00:02:00.470> penalty<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:01.190> balanced<00:02:01.730> between<00:02:01.880> power

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
your penalty is balanced between power

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.010 
your penalty is balanced between power
and<00:02:02.600> accurateness<00:02:04.240> third<00:02:05.240> of<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.810> most

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
and accurateness third of the most

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.740 
and accurateness third of the most
important<00:02:06.530> thing<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:07.310> aiming<00:02:07.670> when<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.629> have

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
important thing the aiming when you have

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.229 
important thing the aiming when you have
powered<00:02:09.050> up<00:02:09.289> your<00:02:09.500> shot<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:10.280> release<00:02:10.879> the

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
powered up your shot you release the

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.270 
powered up your shot you release the
shooting<00:02:11.629> button<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.140> right<00:02:12.470> after<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:12.860> you

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
shooting button and right after that you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.280 
shooting button and right after that you
should<00:02:13.489> start<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.970> aim<00:02:14.150> in<00:02:14.420> one<00:02:14.659> corner<00:02:14.959> with

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
should start to aim in one corner with

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.530 
should start to aim in one corner with
the<00:02:15.409> left<00:02:15.620> stick<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.640> should<00:02:16.849> make<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.300> very

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
the left stick you should make a very

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.449 
the left stick you should make a very
short<00:02:17.870> pause<00:02:18.140> between<00:02:18.440> releasing<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
short pause between releasing the

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.729 
short pause between releasing the
shooting<00:02:19.879> button<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.360> starting<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.319> aim<00:02:21.500> with

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
shooting button and starting to aim with

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.100 
shooting button and starting to aim with
the<00:02:21.860> left<00:02:22.069> stick<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.690> hear<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
the left stick it's like you hear the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.199 
the left stick it's like you hear the
click<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.980> shooting<00:02:25.489> button<00:02:25.819> after<00:02:26.030> you

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
click of the shooting button after you

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.479 
click of the shooting button after you
released<00:02:26.659> it<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.080> then<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.890> start<00:02:28.129> to<00:02:28.310> aim

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
released it and then you start to aim

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.990 
released it and then you start to aim
you<00:02:29.180> can<00:02:29.390> see<00:02:29.599> it<00:02:29.659> in<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:30.050> example<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:31.000> power

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
you can see it in this example I power

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.869 
you can see it in this example I power
up<00:02:32.209> my<00:02:32.360> shot<00:02:32.629> then<00:02:33.409> I<00:02:33.709> release<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.430> shooting

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
up my shot then I release the shooting

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.910 
up my shot then I release the shooting
button<00:02:35.209> then<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.720> start<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.230> aim<00:02:36.409> with<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.709> left

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
button then I start to aim with the left

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.530 
button then I start to aim with the left
stick<00:02:37.129> in<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.430> top<00:02:37.670> right<00:02:37.909> corner<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.450> then

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
stick in the top right corner and then

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.979 
stick in the top right corner and then
the<00:02:39.319> penalty<00:02:39.739> goes<00:02:39.920> perfectly<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.780> good

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
the penalty goes perfectly in the good

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.020 
the penalty goes perfectly in the good
thing<00:02:42.230> about<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.769> technique<00:02:43.189> is<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.639> you

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
thing about this technique is that you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.660 
thing about this technique is that you
don't<00:02:44.240> have<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.600> release<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.260> left<00:02:45.470> stick<00:02:45.800> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
don't have to release the left stick the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.850 
don't have to release the left stick the
aiming<00:02:47.030> cursor<00:02:47.240> will<00:02:47.510> stop<00:02:47.810> by<00:02:47.959> itself<00:02:48.350> when

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
aiming cursor will stop by itself when

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.340 
aiming cursor will stop by itself when
you<00:02:48.890> player<00:02:49.310> take<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.000> shot<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.420> if<00:02:51.170> your

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
you player take the shot and if your

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.500 
you player take the shot and if your
timing<00:02:51.560> rolls<00:02:51.980> right<00:02:52.280> then<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.209> aiming

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
timing rolls right then the aiming

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.360 
timing rolls right then the aiming
curves<00:02:53.720> are<00:02:53.900> at<00:02:53.990> this<00:02:54.230> moment<00:02:54.709> is<00:02:54.890> right<00:02:55.190> in

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
curves are at this moment is right in

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.160 
curves are at this moment is right in
one<00:02:55.520> corner<00:02:55.880> here<00:02:56.690> are<00:02:56.810> two<00:02:56.959> more<00:02:57.110> examples

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
one corner here are two more examples

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.710 
one corner here are two more examples
where<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.010> process<00:02:58.520> is<00:02:58.550> shot<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.209> real<00:02:59.390> time

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
where the process is shot in real time

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.650 
where the process is shot in real time
you<00:03:00.470> power<00:03:00.800> up<00:03:01.040> release<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.180> shoot<00:03:02.420> button

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
you power up release the shoot button

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.710 
you power up release the shoot button
start<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.319> aim<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.800> score<00:03:04.489> if<00:03:04.760> your<00:03:05.000> penalties

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
start to aim and score if your penalties

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.900 
start to aim and score if your penalties
are<00:03:06.020> always<00:03:06.440> going<00:03:06.650> wide<00:03:07.010> like<00:03:07.520> in<00:03:07.700> this

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
are always going wide like in this

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.840 
are always going wide like in this
examples<00:03:08.569> then<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.830> should<00:03:10.010> start<00:03:10.310> aiming<00:03:10.730> a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
examples then you should start aiming a

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.990 
examples then you should start aiming a
little<00:03:11.120> bit<00:03:11.239> later<00:03:11.569> if<00:03:12.530> your<00:03:12.830> penalty<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.640> not

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
little bit later if your penalty is not

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.420 
little bit later if your penalty is not
well-placed<00:03:14.510> enough<00:03:14.870> like<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.470> one<00:03:15.709> then

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
well-placed enough like this one then

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.040 
well-placed enough like this one then
you<00:03:16.580> should<00:03:16.610> start<00:03:17.060> aiming<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.630> little<00:03:17.930> bit

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
you should start aiming a little bit

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.800 
you should start aiming a little bit
earlier<00:03:18.790> now<00:03:19.790> I<00:03:19.850> want<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.180> show<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:20.480> some

earlier now I want to show you some

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.590 
earlier now I want to show you some
variations<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:21.590> penalty<00:03:22.070> kicks<00:03:22.310> at<00:03:22.820> first<00:03:23.360> we

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
variations of penalty kicks at first we

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.990 
variations of penalty kicks at first we
have<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.959> Pinet<00:03:24.350> shot<00:03:24.620> for<00:03:25.220> this<00:03:25.400> one<00:03:25.670> you

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
have the Pinet shot for this one you

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.390 
have the Pinet shot for this one you
hold<00:03:26.239> r1<00:03:26.930> while<00:03:27.350> you<00:03:27.560> are<00:03:27.650> taking<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.190> shot

hold r1 while you are taking the shot
the<00:03:29.209> financial<00:03:29.720> art<00:03:29.810> is<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.019> little<00:03:30.380> bit<00:03:30.530> more

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
the financial art is a little bit more

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.550 
the financial art is a little bit more
accurate<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.850> aiming<00:03:32.330> cursor<00:03:33.050> is<00:03:33.230> smaller

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
accurate the aiming cursor is smaller

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.580 
accurate the aiming cursor is smaller
but<00:03:34.430> on<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.730> other<00:03:34.880> hand<00:03:35.180> it's<00:03:35.540> less<00:03:35.930> powerful

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
but on the other hand it's less powerful

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.890 
but on the other hand it's less powerful
and<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:37.310> goalkeeper<00:03:37.819> can<00:03:38.060> better<00:03:38.300> save<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:38.780> if

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
and the goalkeeper can better save it if

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.650 
and the goalkeeper can better save it if
he<00:03:39.110> is<00:03:39.140> in<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.590> right<00:03:39.769> corner<00:03:40.130> at<00:03:40.819> next<00:03:41.540> we

he is in the right corner at next we

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.780 
he is in the right corner at next we
have<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.050> LOB<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.830> can<00:03:43.040> pull<00:03:43.250> them<00:03:43.340> off<00:03:43.580> by

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
have the LOB you can pull them off by

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.880 
have the LOB you can pull them off by
