Chinese<00:00:32.759> steamed<00:00:33.360> egg<00:00:34.040> with<00:00:35.040> our<00:00:35.309> new<00:00:35.670> kitchen

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
Chinese steamed egg with our new kitchen

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.580 
Chinese steamed egg with our new kitchen
where<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:36.690> could<00:00:36.870> sing<00:00:37.079> ours

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
where they could sing ours

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.119 
where they could sing ours
stink<00:00:37.890> less<00:00:38.160> fake<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.719> first<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.890> put

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
stink less fake of it so first we put

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.490 
stink less fake of it so first we put
our<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.430> egg<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.239> bowl<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.989> add<00:00:43.379> about

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
four ounce of water and we start beating

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.040 
four ounce of water and we start beating
after<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.200> while<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.160> salt

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
after the while we can put in a salt

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.790 
after the while we can put in a salt
sprinkle<00:00:52.050> some<00:00:52.260> sauce

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
sprinkle some sauce

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560 
sprinkle some sauce
so<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.160> egg<00:00:53.399> will<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.789> some<00:00:54.000> taste<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
so this egg will have some taste to it

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.729 
so this egg will have some taste to it
and<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.590> start<00:00:55.890> beating<00:00:56.250> until<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:58.289> mixture

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and we start beating until the mixture

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.139 
and we start beating until the mixture
is<00:00:59.070> homogeneous<00:01:01.340> if<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.550> really<00:01:02.760> want<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> add

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
is homogeneous if you really want to add

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
is homogeneous if you really want to add
flavor<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.870> maybe<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.769> could<00:01:04.979> put<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> tiny

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
flavor to it maybe you could put a tiny

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.570 
flavor to it maybe you could put a tiny
bit<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.909> sesame<00:01:06.330> oil<00:01:08.990> now<00:01:09.990> we're<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> put

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
bit of sesame oil now we're going to put

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.740 
bit of sesame oil now we're going to put
into<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.970> oven<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:13.939> close<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.240> door<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> this

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
into the oven and close the door so this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.730 
into the oven and close the door so this
way<00:01:18.930> we're<00:01:19.110> gonna<00:01:19.170> start<00:01:19.590> baking<00:01:20.000> or<00:01:21.000> steamy

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
way we're gonna start baking or steamy

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.870 
way we're gonna start baking or steamy
actually<00:01:22.740> today<00:01:22.979> we're<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> find<00:01:23.670> out

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
actually today we're going to find out

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.200 
actually today we're going to find out
the<00:01:24.150> steaming<00:01:24.540> function<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.100> oven<00:01:26.340> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the steaming function of this oven to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.890 
the steaming function of this oven to
see<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.049> compared<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.950> real

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
see if it's compared with the real

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.440 
see if it's compared with the real
steamy<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> pot<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.829> top<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> stove<00:01:33.119> so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
steamy in the pot on top of the stove so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.660 
steamy in the pot on top of the stove so
we<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.630> press<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.810> button<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
we are going to press this button and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.350 
we are going to press this button and
turn<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.840> toast<00:01:41.060> convection<00:01:42.060> bake

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
turn this is the toast convection bake

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.170 
turn this is the toast convection bake
bake<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.380> steam<00:01:43.670> boil<00:01:46.070> steam<00:01:47.070> boil<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
bake and steam boil steam boil and the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.880 
bake and steam boil steam boil and the
steam<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.810> we're<00:01:48.960> gonna<00:01:49.049> want<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.590> steam

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
steam so we're gonna want to just steam

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.389 
steam so we're gonna want to just steam
it<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.640> press<00:01:50.909> ok<00:01:51.799> then<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> next<00:01:53.250> thing

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
it so we press ok then the next thing

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.069 
it so we press ok then the next thing
we're<00:01:53.549> gonna<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:58.159> set<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.189> the

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
we're gonna do is to set up the

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.420 
we're gonna do is to set up the
temperature<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:02.189> we're<00:02:02.310> gonna

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
temperature we want I think we're gonna

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.309 
temperature we want I think we're gonna
do<00:02:03.649> from<00:02:04.649> 100<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.310> 210<00:02:06.270> maybe<00:02:07.020> next<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.439> 200<00:02:08.069> and

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
do from 100 to 210 maybe next to 200 and

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.220 
do from 100 to 210 maybe next to 200 and

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
out when you steam the egg for about

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.220 
out when you steam the egg for about
thirty<00:06:49.700> minutes<00:06:49.790> and<00:06:50.240> that's<00:06:50.630> how<00:06:50.810> much<00:06:50.930> water

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
thirty minutes and that's how much water
