00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.620
 if you had to draw a line that 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.129
 Mark the difference between a cookie 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.440
 legitimate and one of modern production that 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.330
 line that would mark the anc or the one of jim 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.550
 manley in imports clearly is the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.490
 cookie more strongly built than 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.590
 I know is properly a tool 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.380
 of heavy work to the point of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.740
 say that it is image imports guarantees it 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.129
 like a Jimmy and the reason is because 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.030
 has an average thickness on the spine 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.929
 inch what does its construction 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.609
 exceptionally strong as he had 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.929
 mentioned before you take them decimal in 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:47.010
 imports are all manufactured by hand 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.749
 frosted also by hand with 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.909
 hand tools what is 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.530
 absolutely unusual and how can 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.649
 realize this has a double 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.129
 frosted concave on the face plus the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.659
 frosted edge that is with effect I 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.579
 I had kept away from this guy 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.549
 of cookies mainly because of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.610
 the scales are made of horn 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.950
 buffalo what at first was not my 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.560
 preference but seeing it more closely 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.960
 the finishes that provide more 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.729
 They are excellent for a knife made to 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.369
 hand as you can realize the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.259
 construction is of full tang and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.680
 like other cookies from jean alain imports 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.509
 the thickness decreases as 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.450
 all cookies arrive at the heel 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.399
 gmail in imports have differences in 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.439
 its construction but a parameter 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.409
 approximate to define it is the long 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.259
 total in this case are 18 inches what 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.149
 that gives about 12 useful inches of sheet 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.829
 the weight of the tool as they can 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.690
 realize it's around two o'clock and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.119
 half a pound what makes it a 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.130
 excellent shredder by nature but 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.890
 for this same reason it is quite difficult 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.750
 to maneuver like machete this is the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.810
 sleeve of the tail as expected 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.259
 it is also in leather quite well made 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.630
 with a wooden soul like the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.409
 other you meet final in imports is 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.989
 made in 5160 forged steel but 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.110
 It is also reused steel because 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.610
 q is the only ports lenin climate that is 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.500
 guaranteed to be used as a bar 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.720
 possibly it is the tool of 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.290
 most versatile survival of all 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.290
 that we have tried
