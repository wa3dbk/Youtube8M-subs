00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:11.129 
at the Bauer reactors 6000 goalie stick

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.400 
at the Bauer reactors 6000 goalie stick
there's<00:00:11.910> me<00:00:12.059> at<00:00:12.209> top-of-the-line<00:00:12.719> composite

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
there's me at top-of-the-line composite

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.350 
there's me at top-of-the-line composite

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
stick out of Bauer's lineup in that

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.689 
stick out of Bauer's lineup in that
react<00:00:15.809> line<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.950> have<00:00:17.189> a<00:00:17.220> lot<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.460> those

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.500 
latest and greatest technologies in this
one<00:00:19.680> starting<00:00:20.670> out<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> shaft<00:00:21.269> here

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
one starting out on the shaft here

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.730 
one starting out on the shaft here
they're<00:00:21.689> gonna<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.960> using<00:00:22.109> double<00:00:22.529> concave

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
they're gonna be using double concave

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.950 
they're gonna be using double concave
shaft<00:00:23.279> walls<00:00:23.519> as<00:00:23.820> well<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.480> those<00:00:24.630> rounded

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
shaft walls as well as those rounded

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.269 
shaft walls as well as those rounded
corners<00:00:25.349> so<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.619> gonna<00:00:25.740> give<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.009> that<00:00:26.099> nice

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
corners so it's gonna give you that nice

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.880 
corners so it's gonna give you that nice
comfortable<00:00:26.820> fit<00:00:27.060> right<00:00:27.269> there<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> hand

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
comfortable fit right there in the hand

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.439 
comfortable fit right there in the hand
not<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.160> gonna<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.400> too<00:00:29.609> bulky<00:00:29.849> there<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
not really gonna be too bulky there and

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.840 
not really gonna be too bulky there and
then<00:00:31.019> also<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.099> guys<00:00:32.220> are<00:00:32.430> familiar<00:00:32.580> with

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
then also if you guys are familiar with

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.780 
then also if you guys are familiar with
the<00:00:33.090> old<00:00:33.290> reflex<00:00:34.290> line<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.220> can<00:00:35.370> see<00:00:35.580> they're

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the old reflex line you can see they're

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.360 
the old reflex line you can see they're
using<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.450> same<00:00:36.690> kind<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.050> grip<00:00:37.770> system<00:00:38.220> on

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
using that same kind of grip system on

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.530 
using that same kind of grip system on
here<00:00:38.580> so<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.880> that<00:00:39.030> grip<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
here so you have that grip on the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600 
here so you have that grip on the
backside<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.260> shaft<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:41.010> well<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.400> down

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
backside of the shaft as well as down

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.820 
backside of the shaft as well as down
into<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.150> shoulder<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.900> the<00:00:42.990> stick<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.740> it's

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
into the shoulder of the stick so it's

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.140 
into the shoulder of the stick so it's
gonna<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:44.010> great<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.310> those<00:00:44.400> goalies<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:45.000> to

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
gonna be great for those goalies like to

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.490 
gonna be great for those goalies like to
play<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.480> puck<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.720> little<00:00:45.960> bit<00:00:46.050> more<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.380> get

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
play the puck a little bit more you get

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.990 
play the puck a little bit more you get
a<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:46.800> bit<00:00:46.920> better<00:00:47.070> control<00:00:47.310> to<00:00:47.760> stick

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
a little bit better control to stick

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
a little bit better control to stick
there<00:00:48.240> now<00:00:49.020> taking<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> look<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> paddle

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
there now taking a look at the paddle

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.320 
there now taking a look at the paddle
here<00:00:50.310> they're<00:00:50.490> gonna<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.670> using<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.120> pretty

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
here they're gonna be using a pretty

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.000 
here they're gonna be using a pretty
unique<00:00:51.600> system<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.230> inside<00:00:52.410> called<00:00:52.920> their

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
unique system on the inside called their

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
unique system on the inside called their
air<00:00:53.220> channel<00:00:53.610> construction<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.870> gonna

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
air channel construction so it's gonna

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
air channel construction so it's gonna
help<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> keep<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.740> inside<00:00:56.580> of<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:56.760> stick

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
help to keep the inside of the stick

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
help to keep the inside of the stick
really<00:00:57.240> nice<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.690> lightweight<00:00:58.310> overall<00:00:59.310> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
really nice and lightweight overall the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.000 
really nice and lightweight overall the
stick<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.820> incredibly<00:01:00.540> light<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.650> going

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
stick is incredibly light and then going

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
stick is incredibly light and then going
on<00:01:02.130> to<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> materials<00:01:03.630> here<00:01:03.900> they're<00:01:04.049> gonna

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
on to the materials here they're gonna

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.380 
on to the materials here they're gonna
be<00:01:04.290> using<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.559> combination<00:01:05.090> like<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
be using a combination like all the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.429 
be using a combination like all the
other<00:01:06.539> sticks<00:01:06.869> they're<00:01:07.020> gonna<00:01:07.109> be<00:01:07.259> having

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
other sticks they're gonna be having

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.980 
other sticks they're gonna be having
that<00:01:07.679> carbon<00:01:08.189> wrap<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.609> there<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.539> you<00:01:09.840> can

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that carbon wrap on there but as you can

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.660 
that carbon wrap on there but as you can
see<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.380> pretty<00:01:10.500> noticeable<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.460> their

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
see it's pretty noticeable to have their

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.090 
see it's pretty noticeable to have their
integrity<00:01:12.149> our<00:01:12.929> technology<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.649> well<00:01:13.829> so

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
integrity our technology as well so

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.520 
integrity our technology as well so
again<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.909> another<00:01:15.210> wrap<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.079> outside

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
again just another wrap on the outside

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.899 
again just another wrap on the outside
there<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.219> gonna<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.520> nice<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
there but this is gonna be nice and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.819 
there but this is gonna be nice and
light<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:18.659> also<00:01:19.229> gonna<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> little<00:01:19.619> bit

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
light and also gonna be a little bit

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.919 
light and also gonna be a little bit
stronger<00:01:20.189> than<00:01:20.340> those<00:01:20.579> carbons<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.270> give<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.810> a

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
stronger than those carbons so give it a

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.929 
stronger than those carbons so give it a
little<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.289> extra<00:01:22.439> durability<00:01:23.009> while<00:01:23.670> still

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
little bit extra durability while still

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.120 
little bit extra durability while still
being<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.179> super<00:01:24.840> light<00:01:25.049> stick<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.829> paddle

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
being a super light stick on the paddle

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.069 
being a super light stick on the paddle
they're<00:01:26.310> using<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.729> flat<00:01:27.119> face<00:01:27.390> geometry

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
they're using that flat face geometry

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.139 
they're using that flat face geometry
again<00:01:28.289> so<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.219> is<00:01:29.280> gonna<00:01:29.399> help<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.999> keep

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
again so this is gonna help to just keep

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.749 
again so this is gonna help to just keep
that<00:01:30.590> keep<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> rebounds<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.490> out<00:01:32.609> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
that keep the rebounds going out and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.160 
that keep the rebounds going out and
right<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.030> front<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:33.899> it's<00:01:34.049> also

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
right in front of you but it's also

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
paddle they're gonna be using a low
