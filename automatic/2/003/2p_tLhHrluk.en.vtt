00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 today someone's life is tedious 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.390
 designed good tips to study that 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.099
 you will really serve much the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.440
 time to study concentrate on 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.719
 all those things and nothing with our with 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.280
 the good video and the first one that the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.839
 life of those who for example to all 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.910
 commanders of oral presentations in 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.550
 front of the whole class to answer 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.420
 about integral teacher or something 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.689
 but I am those people who have the gift 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.910
 so to speak of being able to read something I'm going to 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.980
 easily know this by me 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.170
 always what he did was grab a 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.250
 paper and like to cut it into pieces 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.620
 little ones 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.860
 I started squared sizes and write 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.809
 about what was going to deal with the subject this 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.539
 it's because I played the end of the day that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.910
 course and how they had serious crimes 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.740
 allowing pocket and all day 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.690
 of the memorized number 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.210
 that boat that I'm going to give you is that 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.340
 when I study I'm not in the place 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.770
 where everything is messy does not have 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.960
 a lot of rain always like I'll have 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.060
 desks in your room you in all 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.170
 ordered treated in space months 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.210
 working to trace that sector as much 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.000
 ordered that there be no clothes on 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.310
 many things because it will not help much 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.080
 that this seventh be decentered that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.350
 I'm going to say that the moment they go 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.990
 to study appears the dad of his cell 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.850
 or have airplane mode because if you do not 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.310
 have concentrated too much that they were going to 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.050
 get notifications will sound the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.880
 internal phones the friends are 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.229
 they ask anything is going to be 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880
 too concentrated and you're going to 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.729
 dismissed the first cases it's going to 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.760
 be touch your phone and start playing 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.380
 or talk to your friends and that really 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.850
 it's not so good because you 're 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.790
 deconcentrated at the precise moment 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 when you are going to study to give a phone 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.110
 you no longer study what I'm going to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.070
 put it in aircraft mode 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.040
 and I want to say is that when they are 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.110
 studying as reviewing the government or 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.090
 study as they always have in 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.770
 what are your goals for example 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.780
 mine are this year will reach the third 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.550
 superior which means being among the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.679
 25 first in your promotion 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.230
 I write on a paper or make a list of 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.470
 We propose proposal with what you want to do 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.540
 this 2015 and write for example this 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.180
 different senior year of life get your 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.670
 superior with which you want your goal to be 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.350
 every day read them because you're going to 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.570
 remind him that what they are doing is 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.390
 it shows to study without the 20 like that you 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.100
 you are going to say this year you can get everything 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.110
 in his period study person I do not 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.270
 the rookies arrive my goals that I have 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.400
 proposed at the beginning of the year is how 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.640
 what 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.040
 as you remember the fifth you want 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.620
 to carry is the one that when studying 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.840
 what they send you from a task does not stop 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.360
 the 129 has to do such a task a 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.720
 itinerary or something like that you have to 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.750
 have an agenda like this an agenda 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.290
 where you go out not in the sea that all 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.840
 days then thing to write for example 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.760
 for Thursday May 28 I have homework 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.400
 of exercise where he writes is there 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.980
 then like every day you have 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.290
 the one of writing other people's event that I have 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.230
 every day detail cost me a hundred space 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.440
 in bloom and the day I do not know tomorrow on Monday 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.680
 from April 20, new tasks of these 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.079
 bird your notebook and look there I have so in 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.970
 mathematics of English spelling and 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.280
 then like that every time I make a 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.340
 task to put a check lying down to 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.150
 do and lurking and so the sixth that you 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.730
 I'll teach 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.040
 for example not all people 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.579
 we understand the moment when 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.220
 teaching math they do it 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.159
 some people but we believe people 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.370
 no fear I do not understand something people 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.829
 of internal logarithms grab and the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.040
 exercise that you do not understand exactly 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.200
 but I do not understand and today I see that then 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.790
 a grassi encierro with a circle in red 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.260
 is the teacher could not you like that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.060
 explain to you 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.890
 the exercise is hiding your house already 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.200
 you have all the axes that you did not understand 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.420
 in the class later with tutorials in 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.400
 youtube where they will teach you how to 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.900
 on the subject that I want to explain step to 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.690
 step but when it comes to your dad 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.700
 autonomous can teach you and also you 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.120
 does a lot very well at the end of the year when 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.680
 you take the annual or quarterly exam 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.389
 you will know what buildings really do not 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.470
 you understood from the outside to return them to 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.630
 to practice 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.640
 What I want to teach you is that 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.040
 example now the teachers already have 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.290
 the habit of when he explains and 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.910
 they explain explains explained by example 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.560
 in a whole class they explain about the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:42.640
 theory the paper exactly because my 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.440
 friend who can not write notes but in 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.380
 one to see 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.980
 in today's class like if you do not take 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.980
 notes 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.650
 some papers or things like that I what 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.600
 I do is take notes in a separate blog 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.600
 and power of not missions 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.440
 on that day that when you get to your house 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.120
 can you copy it better so that in 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:19.050
 this case with ideas or things like 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:19.050
 teacher in the work class 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.590
 his clients would be very much this channel 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.060
 that will not be double layer and nobody 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.759
 Consider the issue subscribers 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.020
 I have it to thank you in 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.880
 various games that I receive from 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.460
 comments that put me on twitter that 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.919
 they write to me with instagram and it teaches 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.289
 many reactions imagine how happy 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:42.520
 what does all this style youtube and 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:44.560
 it does not make me happier and also in 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.560
 social networks that I'm like luciana 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.199
 underscore and you on twitter and list me 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.389
 I'm like that with that name and well we 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.169
 we see in dominated with a new video the 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.169
 I really like the chat 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.960
 Y
