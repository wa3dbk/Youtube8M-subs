no<00:00:43.350> luck<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.590> far<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:44.219> cycle<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> key<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
no luck so far just cycle the key a

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
no luck so far just cycle the key a
couple<00:00:46.530> times<00:00:46.820> cycle<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:51.270> back<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:53.000> back

yeah we're going to put a little gas

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.620 
yeah we're going to put a little gas
down<00:02:36.490> in<00:02:36.700> there<00:02:36.850> that's<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.120> best<00:02:37.330> we<00:02:37.510> could

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
down in there that's the best we could

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.050 
down in there that's the best we could
figure<00:02:37.840> out<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:41.830> since<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.310> mass<00:02:42.490> air<00:02:42.760> flows

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
figure out but since the mass air flows

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.540 
figure out but since the mass air flows
down<00:02:43.360> there<00:02:43.690> once<00:02:44.560> we<00:02:44.650> get<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.890> gas<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.370> there

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
down there once we get the gas in there

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
gonna do got that mass airflow

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:01.250 
gonna do got that mass airflow
sensor<00:02:53.890> hooked<00:02:54.520> up<00:02:55.740> okay<00:02:56.740> that'll<00:02:57.010> it<00:03:00.090> okay

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
