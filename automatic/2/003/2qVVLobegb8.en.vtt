of people have been wondering how these
two<00:00:37.590> sneakers<00:00:38.340> compare<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.969> already<00:00:39.450> did<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
two sneakers compare I already did a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.569 
two sneakers compare I already did a
comparison<00:00:40.350> between<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.800> row<00:00:41.010> she<00:00:41.070> runs<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
comparison between the row she runs and

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.150 
comparison between the row she runs and
these<00:00:42.120> ones<00:00:42.420> right<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.899> CX<00:00:43.170> fluxes<00:00:43.680> but

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
these ones right here the CX fluxes but

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.979 
these ones right here the CX fluxes but
it<00:00:44.250> wasn't<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> very<00:00:44.730> fair<00:00:45.059> comparison<00:00:45.660> because

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it wasn't a very fair comparison because

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.900 
it wasn't a very fair comparison because
these<00:00:46.469> two<00:00:46.800> sneakers<00:00:47.460> are<00:00:47.610> kind<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> in

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
these two sneakers are kind of in

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.420 
these two sneakers are kind of in
different<00:00:48.210> categories<00:00:48.379> this<00:00:49.379> sneaker<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.129> mean

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
different categories this sneaker I mean

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.470 
different categories this sneaker I mean
there's<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> lot<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> similarities<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
there's a lot of similarities that I

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
there's a lot of similarities that I
that<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.719> gave<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.050> video<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.559> there's<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that I gave in the video and there's a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.160 
that I gave in the video and there's a
lot<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.480> things<00:00:54.480> about<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> sneakers<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
lot of things about the sneakers that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.080 
lot of things about the sneakers that
are<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.829> similar<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.550> first<00:00:56.789> thing<00:00:56.969> is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
are not similar the first thing is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.479 
are not similar the first thing is
obviously<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.750> upper<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.010> fact<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.370> you

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
obviously the upper the fact that you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.010 
obviously the upper the fact that you
can<00:00:59.670> put<00:00:59.910> different<00:01:00.030> prints<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> uppers

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
can put different prints on the uppers

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.319 
can put different prints on the uppers
the<00:01:02.010> roshi<00:01:02.190> run<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.609> also<00:01:02.760> has<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.180> same

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the roshi run it also has that same

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.780 
the roshi run it also has that same
capability<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> has<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.729> whole<00:01:05.729> bunch

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
capability because it has a whole bunch

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.100 
capability because it has a whole bunch
of<00:01:06.150> different<00:01:06.240> materials<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:06.960> make

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
of different materials that they make

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.020 
of different materials that they make
that<00:01:07.140> row<00:01:07.350> she<00:01:07.409> runs<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.820> same

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that row she runs with they do the same

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.730 
that row she runs with they do the same
for<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> ZX<00:01:09.540> fluxes<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.409> see<00:01:10.560> here

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
for the ZX fluxes as you can see here

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.649 
for the ZX fluxes as you can see here
printed<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.549> then<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> weave

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
printed and then you have like a weave

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.010 
printed and then you have like a weave
material<00:01:13.200> over<00:01:13.740> top<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.020> element

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
material over top of this one so element

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
material over top of this one so element
in<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.680> regard<00:01:17.189> doesn't<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:18.060> have

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
in that regard doesn't do that they have

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.690 
in that regard doesn't do that they have
one<00:01:18.600> kind<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.960> upper<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> sneaker<00:01:20.220> they

collection<00:04:39.750> now<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.259> do<00:04:40.560> plan<00:04:40.860> on<00:04:40.919> doing<00:04:41.759> a

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
collection now I do plan on doing a

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.610 
collection now I do plan on doing a
comparative<00:04:42.270> test<00:04:42.659> between<00:04:42.840> these<00:04:43.169> and<00:04:43.439> the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
comparative test between these and the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.279 
comparative test between these and the
ADEA<00:04:43.830> boost<00:04:44.129> because<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:45.000> boost<00:04:45.240> also<00:04:45.840> has<00:04:46.020> a

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
ADEA boost because the boost also has a

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.429 
ADEA boost because the boost also has a
responsive<00:04:47.599> look<00:04:48.599> to<00:04:48.810> them<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.110> that's<00:04:49.259> what

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
responsive look to them and that's what

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.619 
responsive look to them and that's what
their<00:04:49.710> whole<00:04:49.860> thing<00:04:50.039> is<00:04:50.159> about<00:04:50.610> so<00:04:50.939> I<00:04:51.150> will<00:04:51.509> do

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
their whole thing is about so I will do

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.990 
their whole thing is about so I will do
a<00:04:51.659> comparison<00:04:52.139> between<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.409> lunar<00:04:52.770> fly<00:04:53.759> nets

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
a comparison between the lunar fly nets

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.020 
a comparison between the lunar fly nets
and<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.330> boost<00:04:54.539> the<00:04:54.810> high-end<00:04:55.110> model<00:04:56.030> but

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
and the boost the high-end model but

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.059 
and the boost the high-end model but
just<00:04:57.539> a<00:04:57.629> comparative<00:04:58.259> look<00:04:58.409> at<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.620> planet

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
just a comparative look at the planet

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.980 
just a comparative look at the planet
versus<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.270> mean<00:05:00.360> this<00:05:00.479> looks<00:05:00.689> like<00:05:00.810> it's

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
versus this I mean this looks like it's

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.950 
versus this I mean this looks like it's
almost<00:05:01.139> a<00:05:01.319> fly<00:05:01.529> knit<00:05:01.710> material<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.779> the<00:05:03.779> fly

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
almost a fly knit material and the fly

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.670 
almost a fly knit material and the fly
net<00:05:04.169> itself

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
net itself

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.890 
net itself
so<00:05:04.949> which<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:05.639> more<00:05:05.789> durable<00:05:06.090> this<00:05:06.479> one<00:05:06.719> is

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
so which is more durable this one is

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.119 
so which is more durable this one is
obviously<00:05:07.229> probably<00:05:07.409> more<00:05:07.680> durable<00:05:08.009> it's

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
obviously probably more durable it's

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.230 
obviously probably more durable it's
also<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.340> lot<00:05:08.490> more<00:05:08.699> expensive

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
also a lot more expensive

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.140 
also a lot more expensive
I<00:05:09.389> believe<00:05:10.139> those<00:05:10.289> ones<00:05:10.469> are<00:05:10.590> 185<00:05:11.250> these<00:05:11.939> ones

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
I believe those ones are 185 these ones

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.510 
I believe those ones are 185 these ones
for<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.389> price<00:05:12.599> though<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:12.990> have<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.229> say

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
for the price though I have to say

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.070 
for the price though I have to say
amazing<00:05:14.520> purchase<00:05:14.699> $40<00:05:15.659> on<00:05:15.810> sale<00:05:16.050> even<00:05:16.319> $70

it's<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.139> great<00:05:19.319> price<00:05:19.889> point<00:05:20.219> and<00:05:20.340> the

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
it's a great price point and the

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.189 
it's a great price point and the
downside<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.330> they<00:05:21.449> don't<00:05:21.599> have<00:05:21.779> a<00:05:21.810> ton<00:05:22.169> of

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
downside is they don't have a ton of

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.589 
downside is they don't have a ton of
different<00:05:22.529> models<00:05:23.099> of<00:05:23.310> these<00:05:23.939> or<00:05:24.330> they<00:05:24.509> don't

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
different models of these or they don't

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.269 
different models of these or they don't
have<00:05:24.779> a<00:05:24.840> bunch<00:05:25.469> of<00:05:25.560> different<00:05:25.680> colorways<00:05:26.129> they

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:26.279 
have a bunch of different colorways they

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.760 
have a bunch of different colorways they
have<00:05:26.400> a<00:05:26.430> handful<00:05:26.789> that<00:05:26.849> I've<00:05:27.060> seen<00:05:27.300> so<00:05:27.509> far

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
my opinion one way or the other the

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.079 
my opinion one way or the other the
russia<00:05:52.589> runs<00:05:52.860> aren't<00:05:53.339> like<00:05:53.460> that<00:05:53.490> much<00:05:53.909> more

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:54.089 
russia runs aren't like that much more

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.050 
russia runs aren't like that much more
comfortable<00:05:54.330> than<00:05:55.430> than<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.520> elements<00:05:56.909> so

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
comfortable than than the elements so

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.990 
comfortable than than the elements so
that's<00:05:57.270> kind<00:05:57.629> of<00:05:57.659> the<00:05:57.750> way<00:05:57.839> it<00:05:57.930> is<00:05:58.020> for<00:05:58.229> that

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
that's kind of the way it is for that

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.459 
that's kind of the way it is for that
other<00:06:00.000> comparisons<00:06:00.629> I<00:06:00.689> don't<00:06:00.870> know<00:06:00.930> I<00:06:01.229> mean

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
other comparisons I don't know I mean

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:05.029 
other comparisons I don't know I mean
they're<00:06:02.400> just<00:06:02.639> they're<00:06:03.509> just<00:06:03.539> similar<00:06:04.439> weight

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
they're just they're just similar weight

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.309 
they're just they're just similar weight
they're<00:06:05.370> both<00:06:05.729> very<00:06:05.939> light<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:07.050> I<00:06:07.110> think

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 
they're both very light and I think

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.559 
they're both very light and I think
that's<00:06:07.469> a<00:06:07.680> huge<00:06:07.949> plus<00:06:08.819> and<00:06:09.180> you<00:06:09.240> can<00:06:09.360> see<00:06:09.479> the

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
that's a huge plus and you can see the

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.179 
that's a huge plus and you can see the
bottoms<00:06:09.900> of<00:06:10.050> the<00:06:10.469> shoes<00:06:10.500> these<00:06:10.889> ones<00:06:11.099> I've

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:11.189 
bottoms of the shoes these ones I've

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:13.429 
bottoms of the shoes these ones I've
worn<00:06:11.400> again<00:06:11.610> quite<00:06:11.789> a<00:06:11.819> bit<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:12.719> I<00:06:12.779> do<00:06:12.839> like<00:06:13.110> how

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439 
worn again quite a bit and I do like how

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.399 
worn again quite a bit and I do like how
it<00:06:13.620> has<00:06:13.650> like<00:06:13.979> the<00:06:14.099> segmented<00:06:14.669> or<00:06:15.150> the

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.409 
it has like the segmented or the

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.420 
it has like the segmented or the
different<00:06:16.409> segments<00:06:16.740> kind<00:06:16.889> of<00:06:16.949> like<00:06:17.039> a<00:06:17.069> Nike

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
different segments kind of like a Nike
