fairly decent you can serve well return

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.880 
fairly decent you can serve well return
well<00:01:27.369> in<00:01:27.700> for<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.240> next<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.600> have<00:01:28.720> good<00:01:29.500> second

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
well in for the next we have good second

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.990 
well in for the next we have good second
shots<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.399> I<00:01:31.060> think<00:01:31.390> also<00:01:31.689> we<00:01:32.439> play<00:01:32.860> good<00:01:33.729> in

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
shots and I think also we play good in

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.600 
shots and I think also we play good in
every<00:01:34.299> surface<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.960> that's<00:01:35.439> that<00:01:36.159> helps<00:01:36.490> a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
every surface and that's that helps a

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.940 
every surface and that's that helps a
life<00:01:36.789> that<00:01:37.719> we<00:01:37.990> can<00:01:38.170> be<00:01:38.289> consistent

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
life that we can be consistent

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.160 
life that we can be consistent
throughout<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.340> whole<00:01:39.640> year<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:40.060> think<00:01:40.810> that

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
throughout the whole year I think that

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.880 
throughout the whole year I think that
adds<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.770> our<00:01:42.729> game<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:43.330> being<00:01:43.569> able<00:01:44.530> to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
adds to our game and being able to

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.010 
adds to our game and being able to
compete<00:01:45.250> well<00:01:45.520> everywhere<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.569> every<00:01:46.810> surface

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
compete well everywhere in every surface

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.649 
compete well everywhere in every surface
I<00:01:47.409> think<00:01:47.619> it's<00:01:47.740> our<00:01:47.860> biggest<00:01:48.159> fan<00:01:48.509> coming<00:01:49.509> into

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
I think it's our biggest fan coming into

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.480 
I think it's our biggest fan coming into

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
already so far then is probably not that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.570

and who do you think could be the
contenders<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.840> battle<00:02:35.140> for<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.350> number

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
contenders in the battle for the number

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.340 
contenders in the battle for the number
one<00:02:35.770> spot<00:02:35.800> issue<00:02:36.360> well<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.390> think<00:02:37.690> definitely

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
one spot issue well I think definitely

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.810 
one spot issue well I think definitely
the<00:02:38.650> brains<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.430> way<00:02:39.550> they<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:39.790> been

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
the brains is the way they have been

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.250 
the brains is the way they have been
playing<00:02:39.940> they're<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:40.840> far<00:02:41.020> ahead<00:02:41.080> of

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
playing they're so far ahead of

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.320 
playing they're so far ahead of
everybody<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:42.070> right<00:02:42.850> now<00:02:43.000> we<00:02:43.060> are<00:02:43.210> all

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
everybody that right now we are all

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.690 
everybody that right now we are all
fighting<00:02:43.540> for<00:02:43.690> number<00:02:44.020> two<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.670> far

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
fighting for number two so so far

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.060 
fighting for number two so so far
there's<00:02:46.090> no<00:02:46.180> competition<00:02:46.480> for<00:02:46.810> number<00:02:47.170> one<00:02:47.320> I

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
there's no competition for number one I

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.950 
there's no competition for number one I
think<00:02:49.060> it's<00:02:49.180> going<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.360> be<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.510> very<00:02:49.660> strong

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
think it's going to be a very strong

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.040 
think it's going to be a very strong
year<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.440> lot<00:02:50.770> of<00:02:50.950> strong<00:02:51.190> teams<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.690> think

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
year a lot of strong teams and I think

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.500 
year a lot of strong teams and I think
we<00:02:53.170> all<00:02:53.200> gotta<00:02:53.560> aim<00:02:54.100> for<00:02:54.430> this<00:02:54.610> number<00:02:55.300> once

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
we all gotta aim for this number once

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.820 
we all gotta aim for this number once
but<00:02:55.780> they've<00:02:55.990> been<00:02:56.200> dominating<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.840> last<00:02:59.050> 23

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
but they've been dominating the last 23

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.140 
but they've been dominating the last 23
years<00:02:59.860> with<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.840> very<00:03:01.860> big<00:03:02.860> advantage<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:04.060> I

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
years with a very big advantage and I

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.970 
years with a very big advantage and I
think<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.600> mean<00:03:04.810> everything<00:03:05.110> gotta<00:03:05.530> fight<00:03:05.800> for

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
think I mean everything gotta fight for

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.040 
think I mean everything gotta fight for
that<00:03:06.100> second<00:03:06.430> spot<00:03:06.460> and<00:03:06.880> maybe<00:03:07.030> get<00:03:07.540> closer<00:03:07.810> to

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
that second spot and maybe get closer to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.080 
that second spot and maybe get closer to
that
