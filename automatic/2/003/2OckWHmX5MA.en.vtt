a<00:04:20.900> little<00:04:20.930> bit<00:04:21.229> over<00:04:21.590> infinity<00:04:22.280> war<00:04:22.490> just

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
a little bit over infinity war just

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.950 
a little bit over infinity war just
because<00:04:22.729> they've<00:04:23.060> done<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:23.330> in<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:23.419> past<00:04:23.479> and

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960
