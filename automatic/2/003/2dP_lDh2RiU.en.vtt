last night I think it's the day after
that's<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> hardest<00:00:31.410> part<00:00:31.590> day<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
that's the hardest part day and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.979 
that's the hardest part day and
reflecting<00:00:32.430> back<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> night<00:00:33.270> before<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
having very little sleep and spending

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.690 
having very little sleep and spending
the<00:00:36.870> whole<00:00:36.989> day<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.230> media<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.070> press<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
look back on last night's program where

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.290 
look back on last night's program where
do<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.700> could<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:47.940> improved

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
do you think you could have improved

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000 
do you think you could have improved
what<00:00:48.719> could<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.079> done<00:00:49.200> better<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:49.649> what

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
what could you have done better or what

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
what could you have done better or what
would<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.340> done<00:00:50.399> differently<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
would you have done differently as you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
would you have done differently as you
look<00:00:51.899> back<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.289> well<00:00:53.160> hindsight<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.789> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
look back on it well hindsight is all is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.680 
look back on it well hindsight is all is
20/20<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.399> jump<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.969> had

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
20/20 and there was one jump that I had

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.200 
20/20 and there was one jump that I had
a<00:00:57.719> slip<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.739> stepped<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.460> very<00:00:59.910> quickly

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
a slip and I stepped out of very quickly

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.029 
a slip and I stepped out of very quickly
and<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:01.079> that's<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.590> cost<00:01:01.829> me

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and I think that's really what cost me

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.280 
and I think that's really what cost me
there's<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.399> 1/10<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.149> mark<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> was

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
there's a 1/10 of a mark that I was

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.630 
there's a 1/10 of a mark that I was
missing<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> technical<00:01:05.129> merit<00:01:05.339> from<00:01:05.430> one

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
missing in the technical merit from one

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.969 
missing in the technical merit from one
judge<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.600> cost<00:01:07.140> me<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> gold<00:01:07.560> medal<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
judge that cost me the gold medal so it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.289 
judge that cost me the gold medal so it
was<00:01:08.070> very<00:01:08.220> very<00:01:08.460> close<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:08.939> what<00:01:09.150> made

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
was very very close and that's what made

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
was very very close and that's what made
it<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.450> hard<00:01:09.689> afterwards<00:01:10.229> was<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.130> so

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it so hard afterwards was that it was so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.630 
it so hard afterwards was that it was so
close

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
close

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.280 
close
it<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.180> point<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.630> from<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.049> judge

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
it was just point one from one judge

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
it was just point one from one judge

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
that moment at that moment that was when

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.010 
that moment at that moment that was when
Brian<00:01:59.369> Boitano<00:01:59.549> was<00:01:59.909> skating<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.570> and

Brian Boitano was skating at you and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.980 
Brian Boitano was skating at you and
it's<00:02:01.469> usually<00:02:02.070> two<00:02:02.790> skaters<00:02:03.149> before<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.600> skate

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990

it's usually two skaters before I skate
I<00:02:04.229> will<00:02:04.710> walk<00:02:04.979> through<00:02:05.009> my<00:02:05.369> program<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.090> I

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
I will walk through my program and I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.749 
I will walk through my program and I
will<00:02:07.290> visualize<00:02:07.799> my<00:02:08.039> program<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.700> I'll

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
will visualize my program and I'll

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
will visualize my program and I'll
visualize<00:02:09.179> every<00:02:09.479> step<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> I'll<00:02:10.259> feel<00:02:10.590> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
visualize every step and I'll feel it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.650 
visualize every step and I'll feel it
and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.530 
and
that<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:14.280> one<00:02:14.700> reason<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:15.360> to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
that the one reason for that is just to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.720 
that the one reason for that is just to
kill<00:02:15.720> time<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.830> keep<00:02:16.980> my<00:02:17.100> mind<00:02:17.280> occupied

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
kill time and to keep my mind occupied

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.640 
kill time and to keep my mind occupied
so<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.660> I'm<00:02:18.750> not<00:02:18.780> wandering<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.410> I'm<00:02:19.500> not

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
so that I'm not wandering and I'm not

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.640 
so that I'm not wandering and I'm not
seeking<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.730> anything<00:02:21.000> negative<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.650> also

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
seeking of anything negative and also

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.840 
seeking of anything negative and also
just<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.860> get<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.100> touch<00:02:23.250> with<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.490> program

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
just to get in touch with the program

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.790 
just to get in touch with the program
and<00:02:24.030> then<00:02:24.840> when<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.260> finished<00:02:25.620> with<00:02:25.680> my

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
and then when I finished with my

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.380 
and then when I finished with my
walkthrough<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.520> was<00:02:26.640> almost<00:02:26.880> time<00:02:27.060> for<00:02:27.120> me<00:02:27.300> to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
walkthrough it was almost time for me to

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.660 
walkthrough it was almost time for me to
skate<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:28.440> didn't<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.890> wait<00:02:29.040> those

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
skate and I didn't have to wait those

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.730 
skate and I didn't have to wait those
the<00:02:30.510> ten<00:02:30.720> minutes<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.140> seemed<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.560> 10

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
the ten minutes that seemed like 10

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.710 
the ten minutes that seemed like 10
hours<00:02:31.890> sometimes<00:02:32.460> waiting<00:02:33.270> must<00:02:33.570> be

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
hours sometimes waiting must be

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.240 
hours sometimes waiting must be
unbearable<00:02:34.140> you're<00:02:34.680> absolutely<00:02:34.890> right<00:02:35.160> would
