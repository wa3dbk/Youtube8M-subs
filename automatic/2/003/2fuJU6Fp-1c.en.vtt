 Daring the next question again 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.920
 Andréia Beltrane Who you are inspired by 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.869
 to make videos on youtube and already 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.759

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.049
 Brazilian as you would a rag 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.350

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.600
 I always liked Tanya and I saw 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.960

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.119
 pretty girl, but I loved and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.740
 they inspire me to actually schendel themselves 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.689
 inspired me to make videos on 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.710
 youtube before a channel that was already 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.490

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.840

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.630
 I was very much to see yes it was a 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.850
 very shameful thing today he 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.020
 I was inspired by the next question 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.020
 from julia 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.329
 hyacinth with being big sister 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.000
 You brothers are very different like that. 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.180
 the beginning was much more different neither me nor 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.119
 I knew I was far higher sfm 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.700
 I copied things like this on myself 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.490
 I would buy a toy. She wants to copy me. 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.950
 in the toy 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.960
 but nowadays there is no such 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.940
 age difference we have almost 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.160
 same time until she gives me idea 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.930
 video gives ideas to her people is normal to 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.250
 people are from ants the next question 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.600
 of maysa vieira kiss are you think of 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.420
 living abroad 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.310
 I really wanted to be honest like that 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.040
 I like Brazil travels in time like this. 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.890
 I'm going to miss my food. 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.380
 family of the people in general 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.680
 Brazilian but I always wanted to 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.590
 to do an exchange and I did not want to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.540
 So he goes to Europe or 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.880
 to a more different place then I 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.100
 I think of living out of the country but maybe 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.680
 not so through my life but through 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.150
 some years for a vt experience of 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.280
 life and everything else 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.990
 now the question of andré belletti eu 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.300
 For example if I had in Paris I would 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.370
 the street was very busy and 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.760
 others thought I would make a me 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.070
 raise would continue on the o2 and pretend 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.370
 I was passed out 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:19.140
 so if I had a kitten around I would 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.140
 wanted to call physical attention marie 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.900
 stand up and went rolling is now the next 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.920
 Question is Ana Gabriela you are very 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.870
 Dreamer 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.150
 Do you have any blood that you would like to 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.550
 to carry out our work I have many 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.800
 dreams you have no way to account and 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.240
 My, but the dream that I want is so much. 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.310
 carried out at the moment is the 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.350
 for the turkey that I really wanted to do 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.100
 This is what it is, if I go one day. 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.920
 I'm going to make a weeping world question is 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.020
 very cool that from the millena the injunction and 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.480
 monize than your friends in the 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.160
 college think about your channel you 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.030
 already makes money from it 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.970
 kisses kisses milena and she owns 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.730
 itf fan club and so on 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.620
 she is not good as they have discovered 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.940
 about my channel is none of this ever 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.620
 I said that my mother had a channel and 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.690
 I think they only paid attention to me. 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.570
 because at the time there was no channel 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.030
 flowed with the videos only had some love 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.500
 so nothing any more time I ever 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.780
 I told this story to me I was 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.610
 in bathroom 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.010
 I listened to my friends getting into default 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.270
 It was but I just kept quiet for some 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.700
 screen risk ratio 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.520
 Look, people, look. This is where I started to listen. 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.580
 an individual voice from the beginning family 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.200
 he operates is my voice I was quiet 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.510
 inside the bathroom do not know what only 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.790
 shame the star left kind I already 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.160
 I knew people were aware of my channel. 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.260
 that hearing what he said he released him 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.610
 this information in the attack group that 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.900
 I was not included in that 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.450
 apparently my college has 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.270
 several groups that did not include 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.190
 But, okay, I got caught up in the class of laughter. 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.800
 board of directors had already fished 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.890
 that this small channel but so I do not 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.660
 I know what you think of my channel. 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.550
 They must find it funny that I'm a 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.870
 crazy but how are you? 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.610
 I'm going to continue with my channel. 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.390
 regardless of what they think 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.040
 Now the question duda duda kisses 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.950
 tips you would give to a person who 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.290
 He started the channel now wants to keep it but 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.600
 ashamed I identified a lot with 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.639
 this question because it was well in the 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.560
 It is obvious from the beginning that if you 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.570
 channel now you will be ashamed but it is 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.640
 one thing you will lose natural 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.310
 so my tip if you have a channel 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.930
 are you making videos that you will have 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.470
 too embarrassed at first if anyone 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.270
 find out what type makes a vlog a video 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.039
 Just as friends called my friend to 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.810
 make a video with you and you will 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.729
 making the wave run your camaro goes 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.410
 growing from you will you will feel 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.800
 more comfortable you will lose your 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.770
 shame is a well-respected question from the 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.410
 beautiful worship beautiful kisses 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.419
 Do you think that got readers fast 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.550
 when ideb started her channel today 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.620
 that the channel it grew fast too 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.200
 When I started mine I was already told 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.030
 so I also grew up fast because 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.100
 is with steph on her channel and then 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.010
 I came to my own you consider yourself a person 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.140
 active or sedentary I am a person 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.479
 completely sedentary you have some 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.820
 addiction 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:20.039
 I think it has no vice not 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.289
 to be alone on an island and could only 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:26.010
 to take three things from a person whom 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:31.020
 you would take I would take my future 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:33.720
