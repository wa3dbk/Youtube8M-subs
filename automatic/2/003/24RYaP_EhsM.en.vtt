00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.540
 Today, we will explore an art typically related to the world of video games 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.540
 of yesteryear. 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.820
 An art that will put your patience to the test: I want to talk about 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.110
 pixel art. 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.180
 If it has a particular paw, it remains quite close to drawing and painting. 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.449
 Your knowledge of the principles of design, color, light but also 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.700
 all forms apply to this medium. 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.990
 The process of creating a character or any other scene will remain the same as in 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.180
 painting: We start with a sketch, or a block-in. 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.690
 Shadows and light are added. 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.660
 Then we fine-tune everything through manual retouching or using 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.660
 compositing. 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.920
 Pixel art does have some peculiarities. 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 As we work with these small squares that make up our screens, 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.610
 Pixels, some constraints arise for us. 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.570
 How to draw curves with squares? This is the first issue of this art. 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.040
 Another difficulty lies in the weak definition of a work made in pixel 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 art. 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.620
 How to create the illusion of volume on a tiny canvas? 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.000
 Having a good mastery of outlines and nuances of color is essential to become 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.240
 a good pixel artist. 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.189
 And a great patience! There are, however, some useful techniques that will 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.290
 to facilitate our discovery of this universe. 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.680
 They are the ones we will cover in this video. 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.950
 Number 1: Outlines. 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.170
 Drawing a clean silhouette is difficult in pixel art. 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.979
 In particular, it is not easy to keep an overall view of what you are drawing then 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.119
 that we put our little squares one by one. 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.909
 That's why I advise you to always keep a copy of your work view 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.429
 in real size. 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.100
 Thus, even zooming, you can keep an eye on the final result. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.009
 Most drawing programs have a browser that can fulfill this role. 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.799
 Some tools can also duplicate the active document. 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.700
 To get clean contours, and create the illusion of curves, we will have to 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.250
 use patterns, almost even routines. 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.419
 We advance 2 pixels to the right, then one up, we repeat this, then 

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:00.189
 one to the right, one to the top, etc. 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.729
 By reusing these motifs through our creation, we bring to it a unity 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.829
 in form matters. 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.150
 This is, if you remember, one of our fundamental principles of design 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.780
 : the principle of repetition. 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.150
 There is no mathematical formula that will cover all your needs 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.239
 of drawing patterns. 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.030
 So, you will have to experiment and practice pixel art to find the schemas that 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.920
 will suit your creations. 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.629
 Number 2: The alpha lock. 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.349
 Once one has established his basic forms, as in painting, one can use 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.250
 alpha lock. 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.909
 Aseprite proposes a painting mode that affects only the existing contents of the layers. 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.180
 In Photoshop, as we saw in one of the first videos, it is possible 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.909
 to freeze the alpha channel of a layer with the / key. 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.730
 Another way to do this is to use the magic wand tool. 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.140
 We select a color or a range of colors, and we can paint 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.370
 inside the selection. 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.650
 Number 3: The anti aliasing. 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.959
 When we practice pixel art, the contours we draw are crenelated. 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.540
 In order to refine the rendering of our final sprites, we can use transition colors. 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.349
 They are applied to a few carefully selected pixels to emulate an antialiasing effect. 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.439
 This technique is used when the transition between 2 color zones is steep. 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.780
 For my part, I prefer to work on the darkest color of the 2. 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.900
 As you can see, apply this technique to the lightest color tends 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.930
 to blur and weigh down the transition zone, unlike in the other case. 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.170
 There is a very simple way to apply this technique: just place a pixel 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.219
 transition at the end of each of the small lines of pixels that form a silhouette 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:42.219
 given. 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.750
 Number 4: Use the filters. 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.950
 Pixel art takes a lot of time. 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.109
 The custom is that everything is done by hand. 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.920
 As in painting, there is indeed no secret for the finishes: these 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.499
 are based on manual work. 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:01.049
 Nevertheless, it is possible to use filters and even any other 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.689
 tools to save time. 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:07.490
 Aseprite has 2 types of interesting filters: one creates an outline around a shape 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.490
 existing. 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.099
 This is handy to come around our character after finishing it. 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.909
 This allows you to quickly add a style effect. 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.060
 The sharpness filter allows you to generate lighter colors or more 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.180
 shaded at the edges of our color areas. 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.500
 It is an effective tool to accentuate the separation between two colors and to make 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.680
 take out the edges. 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.669
 This filter combines well with the selection tools. 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.550
 Number 5: Tint the shadows. 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.940
 When I attack a new graphic element for the game, I design illuminated by a 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.069
 White light. 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.900
 In other words, I use local colors to achieve the block-in of the subject. 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.960
 Once the pixel art is finished or even finished, it is always possible for me to unify the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.570
 shadows by tinting blue, purple, orange ... thanks to the gradient mapping. 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.240
 In Photoshop, the gradient mapping is accessible as an adjustment layer. 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.050
 Just add one, open the layer options and make sure that 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.449
 the effect only affects the shadows of the underlying layers. 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.589
 This allows to globally affect the color of the shadows of a painting. 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.930
 Number 6: some general tips for 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.930
 finish. 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.039
 It is always difficult to be well aware of one's mistakes when drawing. 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.580
 We saw that it was interesting to always keep a full size view 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.580
 his pixel art. 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.169
 But that's not all ! There are other tips to help us better see our 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.169
 errors. 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.470
 In order to understand how our colors work in a general context, 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.620
 you can change the color of the background from time to time. 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.930
 This helps to change the relationship between the colors of our character and the hue 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.930
 of the canvas. 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.830
 Thus, some defects in relations between the colors are brought to light. 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.910
 It also affects our perception of the silhouette of what we are drawing. 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.759
 Another essential trick for any artist is symmetry. 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.490
 A reversal of the image allows us to immediately see if we did not draw 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.539
 right or if parts of our creation are distorted. 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.430
 It's a stupid trick, but very effective. 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.220
 That's it for this workshop. 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.840
 The IndieMag contest was a good opportunity for us to explore a little bit 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.520
 the world of pixel art, an art that requires a little patience, a lot of patience ... 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.400
 but above all: patience. 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.169
 We will come back to this in the future, as pixel art is very interesting 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.539
 when you do not have access to a particular graphics tablet. 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.910
 It allows us to draw just with a mouse. 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.990
 With that, I leave you to your creations and tell you very soon!
