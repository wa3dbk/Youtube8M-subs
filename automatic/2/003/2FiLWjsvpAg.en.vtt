00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.840
 hi all friends today with you again 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.590
 I am Vladimir and today I will tell you about 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.660
 how to clean windows phone 8 smartphone from 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.620
 any unnecessary garbage and clean 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.800
 other section 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.040
 because somehow miraculously here 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.180
 after a week of using the smartphone 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.730
 after i 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.199
 Well, not that I spend cleaning but I look 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.110
 what applications need to be updated 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.330
 what can I put new I come across 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.350
 so that somewhere memory flies away 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.210
 just nowhere 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.949
 it seems I am in the course of nothing 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.299
 put there maybe something mail 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.440
 rocked and that memory is running away and 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.699
 why I shot this video because 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.190
 many suffer from this affliction 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.979
 just watch the forum w3bsit3-dns.com 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.799
 Well, in general, see the request in Google 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.260
 in fact everything is solved very simply 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.720
 Well all windows 80 such feature 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.229
 that it fills the partition very much 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.689
 other 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.490
 she has a system ceiling in 3 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.799
 gigabyte is just a little theory 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.200
 if anyone is interested in more than 3 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.670
 gigabytes another section is not clogged 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.100
 maybe if he gets to that state 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.380
 then the system will start in emergency mode 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.270
 completely clean all all all unnecessary 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.160
 that's what would clean it up 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.690
 let's do the stands you just 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.270
 I will show how much I have at the moment 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.760
 free memory is needed in order to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.740
 show you how much action will be 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.740
 time that method which I will show you 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.420
 we donâ€™t care how much 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.210
 occupy the program system 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.990
 we are worried about following this freely 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.110
 moment 494 megabytes let's write this 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.390
 figure in the head 450 megawatts a little bit 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.790
 round up and now we go to the section 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.159
 where did you take a screenshot I just 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.750
 I want to show how much memory was 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.790
 free before i started shooting 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.950
 this 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.209
 video release see was free 140 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.930
 megabyte that is it really 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.049
 today may be 15-20 minutes before shooting 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.810
 This video clip was available chair 40 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.409
 megabyte camera should focus and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.430
 after cleaning in some miraculous way 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:29.590
 memory became free 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.549
 328 megabytes that is, it turns out somewhere 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.010
 300 50 megabytes hung dead weight 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.030
 Moreover, these 350 megabytes are not 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.269
 other section 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.909
 but this is just that I do not know the unknown to me 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.329
 the amount of memory that somewhere was floating in 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.400
 system in principle the author of this 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.269
 applications he himself is with this 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.730
 came across and found this application on xd 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.730
 developer's later our thread by four 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.900
 this application is really 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.810
 positioned as the only 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.659
 working the kliner on 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.829
 operating system about windows phone 8 and let's 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.180
 look looks about 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.659
 in the following way 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.419
 the memory that clears I don't know the money 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.400
 or brush and here are the programs 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.959
 call release memory link to 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.700
 it will be as always in the description under this 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.189
 video so it works 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.439
 a little bit of theory that is to remove 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.269
 temporary files and delete files which 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.489
 are in the section another system need 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.980
 bring yourself to exhaustion that is to say 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.250
 critical state we see that 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.669
 post-treatment free 494 megabytes and 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.609
 The current state of 494 megabytes is due to 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:42.220
 So that I spent cleaning so here is how 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.379
 this program works it creates on 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.599
 your internal memory blend files then 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.819
 there is no file before 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:54.069
 Information about, let's we now 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:56.889
 let's see see start and get clogged 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.400
 memory empty files ie blink 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.349
 files 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.129
 let's wait some more time 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.379
 went cleaning the blank file it's just 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.540
 empty file without any extension at all 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.739
 saying which is created but as 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.699
 can you say garbage and what is 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.260
 the advantage here is this program you 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.539
 now see her again 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.250
 will not make too much space here 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.349
 naturally neglect this method not 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.250
 it is worth but also to repeat it regularly too 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:26.860
 they do not recommend it because 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.449
 really you will feel the cleaning up 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.289
 cleaning result only after 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.030
 maybe week 5 4 days here it is 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.139
 really free up a decent amount 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.819
 format and so dreams 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.319
 everything several times the 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.360
 one and a half will be freed 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:42.789
 megabyte or amount of data is not at all 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.560
 will change and after she 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.499
 fill the system with this blend file 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.569
 With release files, you need to click clean 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:53.620
 sir to carry out the removal that is the removal 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:54.849
 all the garbage and get windows phone 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.009
 8 the system itself 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.319
 clear not only the files created here 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.830
 This is the program but also clean the section 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.889
 other 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.499
 clean the partition temporarily and here's how 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.610
 would of him born system bring in 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:09.849
 normal condition 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.310
 let's wait some more time 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.560
 the process is not the fastest but very 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.360
 effective and not only showed you 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.699
 I'll show you a screenshot 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.409
 proper video clip and then you 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.930
 make sure that I do not deceive you 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.879
 what i always say i value reputation 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.599
 channel and my own reputation i 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:30.550
 not deceiving anyone let's see 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:33.520
 current state 0 bytes 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.249
 but a megabyte of free memory is still waiting 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.949
 a couple of seconds until the system takes and then 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:41.889
 there is a message that the phone is small 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:45.669
 places we close it and see was 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.919
 493 megabytes of free purification now 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.979
 somehow we have 605 megabytes 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.810
 temporary files that we delete are waiting 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:57.099
 some time yet to happen 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.589
 removal and now 605 is available to me 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.870
 megabytes of memory that is, let's give us 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:03.430
 go through the settings section, I'll show you 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.909
 what is really free now 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.219
 605 megabytes of memory and this is not a hoax 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.899
 not some varnish it's really easy 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:13.689
 system cleaned temporary 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:18.270
 and cleaned some of the files which 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.270
 is in the other section and so 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.180
 wait i accidentally went in my 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:31.119
 updates go to the memory check section 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:33.639
 and 600 free hope the camera 

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:36.539
 will just focus on that 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.330
 key shot taking this video here 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.999
 Well, 605 megabytes, that is, I believe that 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.749
 computer will be clear 605 megabytes and 

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:49.719
 It was before 450, that is, again, somehow 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:51.099
 miraculously I cleared the memory and 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:54.610
 cleaned the other section 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:56.860
 that is, 591 megabytes I do not remember 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.369
 show you how much the whole section is different 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:03.039
 before but he was about 696 700 

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:05.289
 megabyte so that's great that's all 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.569
 section is temporary and clean 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.909
 so you can free 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:12.520
 order but saw i was free 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:17.800
 150 megabytes and after two cleansing at me 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:20.740
 it became free 490 and now generally 605 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.830
 megabyte let me clean up a little 500 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.919
 no cleared about 450 500 megabytes 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.769
 memory which in my opinion very well and 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:32.289
 very critical and in terms of modern 

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:35.259
 when the application could 10 for 150 megabits and 

00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:36.819
 this is not even a game just an application with 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:38.339
 you were Vladimir subscribe to 

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:41.019
 channel comment 

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:43.419
 it will only be more interesting in general 

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:45.789
 tell your friends now on the channel 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:48.459
 there will be videos dedicated portioned 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:52.469
 windows phone 8 systems are moving forward 

00:07:48.459 --> 00:07:52.469
 we are evolving for now and see you soon
