 hello sweets hello guys and here I am 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.500
 with a new video for my column 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.170
 cared hands then a very video 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.860
 particular because I will show you how 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.230
 repair my broken broken 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.890
 then I don't want to make gestures but me 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.230
 the nail of the middle finger broke 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.870
 so this tutorial will show you 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.210
 as lory parade 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.550
 I tell you right away that I have this method 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.100
 seen around the web 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.799
 curiosity really intrigued because 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.229
 a very peculiar strange method 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:51.530
 same time to repair nails 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:54.739
 however curious I wanted to try it 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.890
 and to be honest it is a method 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.409
 effective a truly effective method 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.769
 so today I thought of sharing it 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.729
 with you I send you a big kiss vi 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.030
 I leave the tutorial 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.689
 hello repairing broken nails will serve us 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.780
 a nail glue the scissors one 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.580
 sachet dates and tweezers when yes 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.560
 it's broken I practically wore this 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.930
 green glaze now I'll show you from 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.760
 close to breaking 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.760
 here is how it broke 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.090
 once opened the bag of 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.659
 detail a small part I divide it into 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.320
 two and then another small cutout 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.710
 part about as big as the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.090
 breaking my fingernail now seeks to 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.970
 place the nail very gently and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.970
 then I apply a glue kitchen 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.610
 now with the tweezer it lifts the piece of 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.280
 paper and the adage in the broken part 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.820
 of the nail and I make it stick very 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.820
 gently 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.390
 once the thing is dry 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.209
 perfection and therefore the waiting time 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.690
 about 5 10 minutes here for safety 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.750
 or easy under the nail bed with the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.989
 buffer of course always with movements 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.989
 delicates 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.080
 once matted long now 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.730
 we put some oil for le 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.379
 cuticles to show the result 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.090
 the final 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:47.120
 so once opacified I don't open up 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.680
 the buffer the break you see is gone 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.140
 I hope with all my heart to be there 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.370
 useful as always in a commentary 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.250
 tell me yours 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.500
 in short, let me know what you think 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.700
 I send you a big kiss and see you at 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.819
 next video 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.819
