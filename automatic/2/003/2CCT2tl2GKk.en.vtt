00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.930
 presenting 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.770
 with the release of this game, we stopped 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.060
 the torment of the expedition is a race so much 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.670
 similar projects to the floor 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.670
 how uneasy 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.730
 goals and training gave background long teased 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.880
 we are the same roller one now 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.580
 everything fell into place 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.120
 so before us the medal game is true 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.790
 to find severe frosts as they say 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.090
 species the original name is now it 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.100
 fashionable and with a serial number were listed with 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.060
 clean slate even multiplayer 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.960
 were going 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.750
 if developers have questions 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.350
 finally she left earlier competitors 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.630
 need to kill 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.260
 confess honestly 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
 such a detail 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.960
 first-order operatives rain 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.330
 as everyone knows from the rollers the main character 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.670
 fans it it does not exist their exploits 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.350
 unrecognized metrograd they are not 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.940
 get well except in an envelope like black 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.670
 salaries 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 square come up this joke would be better 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.939
 warmed for the shelves fox 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.610
 I remember the user Taylor 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.340
 said the game was created 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.540
 collaboration with third 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.440
 operatives and that already means something 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.960
 indeed heroes can silently open 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.250
 squeaky doors and direct the Soviet 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.320
 tanks surprises from the sky at least 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.780
 special forces did not serve what 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.780
 ever losing sight of 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.239
 another virtue of honor touching 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.049
 long life saver 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.329
 american military 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:16.999
 like the authorities spice 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.999
 comfortable cabinets donate 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.169
 potential fiber payers 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.059
 the chef can promptly give the order 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.619
 shoot at their authors do it 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.129
 more artistically for example they drop off 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.099
 soldier recall this is not the first reading 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.099
 almost ready to commit lynching 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.059
 but our favorite roles show how early 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.339
 morning bank operatives rejoice with 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.049
 from all sides innocently could shepherds Kiev 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.119
 quietly invented by this enemy 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.119
 democracy and the public's favorite 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.669
 the Taliban, in turn, also behave 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.929
 extremely suspicious guerrilla war 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.229
 comes down to what the terrorists are releasing 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.329
 to the street and every five seconds for turkey 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.449
 team open 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.249
 let's say there is no place in Khimki 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:15.040
 turn around but in the mountains 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.790
 neither do they feel masters 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.309
 provisions 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:20.839
 can go out at very clear levels just 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.149
 nowhere to hide here and turns 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:24.150
 Afghanistan 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.229
 big through 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.289
 from which all women were withdrawn 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:29.889
 you have no remorse 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.889
 inflated Kiev 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.359
 m undoubtedly the tape was invented 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.019
 exciting story in a shootout 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.180
 at the destroyed airfield in pursuit of 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.169
 truck ambush in the night city 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.539
 sabotage raids in the camp of the enemy 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.419
 nothing like 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.609
 experienced fighters and the whole game will be 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.219
 chase exactly this feeling of deja vu 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.049
 instead of surprise and delight 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.519
 rather we were amused by the inscription products 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.939
 growing support when you pull up 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.889
 upward caring cooperative 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.179
 our adventures are over 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:11.569
 really unexpected like tobacco 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.269
 stuck by helicopter 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.269
 stopped a couple of times 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.720
 good reason to go to network 4 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.320
 All the more, that its company did times on 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.610
 your brand jump so how 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.230
 fund rule honored with this honor 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.470
 so revaluation for one game 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.730
 multiplayer looks much more alive than companies and 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.509
 not only because there are live links 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.819
 however typical for fresh games 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.930
 imbalance is noticeable from the first 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.900
 seconds 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.080
 at first we are still happy 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.139
 firmware 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.909
 and then connect to the server avoid 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.490
 no card get a present 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.490
 from the word sniper 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.789
 however and without it the network game at first 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.229
 looks like a stripped down version of pet 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.259
 Comp 1 2 Titus Technology cards smaller 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.400
 several classes here in indian kamensk 

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:21.319
 set 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.889
 but this is quite enough especially 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.500
 after playing the single player campaign
