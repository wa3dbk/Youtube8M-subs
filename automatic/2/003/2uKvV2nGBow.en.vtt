00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
one thing I didn't like about the phone

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.870 
one thing I didn't like about the phone
is<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:04.330> mini<00:05:04.870> keyboard<00:05:05.229> here<00:05:05.860> so<00:05:06.370> it's<00:05:06.729> not

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
is the mini keyboard here so it's not

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.629 
is the mini keyboard here so it's not
your<00:05:07.060> usual<00:05:07.530> Android<00:05:08.530> keyboard<00:05:09.160> it's<00:05:09.370> kind<00:05:09.580> of

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
your usual Android keyboard it's kind of

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.050 
your usual Android keyboard it's kind of
a<00:05:09.820> ZTE<00:05:10.650> proprietary<00:05:11.650> one<00:05:11.919> so<00:05:12.910> I<00:05:12.940> would

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
a ZTE proprietary one so I would

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.719 
a ZTE proprietary one so I would
recommend<00:05:13.330> replacing<00:05:13.960> this<00:05:14.350> because<00:05:14.860> it's

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
recommend replacing this because it's

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.890 
recommend replacing this because it's
just<00:05:16.090> not<00:05:16.300> as<00:05:16.630> quick<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:17.680> respond<00:05:18.100> as<00:05:18.810> some<00:05:19.810> of
