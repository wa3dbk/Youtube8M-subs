 hello friends how are we on this occasion 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.380
 is I bring a small video about the 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.930
 rumors that have been hovering about 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.349
 of water and now they tell us that it could 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:30.050
 apple being presenting two smart watch 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:33.530
 2 and watch two smart watches but 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.710
 one in sport version and one in version 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.580
 more classic good I tell you quickly 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.339
 On the one hand we have the iwatch sport that 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.489
 apparently he could have a sphere 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:50.030
 rectangular and the strap could be of 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.729
 rubber very similar to the nike and full band 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.799
 in order to increase your resistance and 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.589
 that is not so fragile must be taken in 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:01:00.559
 account that apple has hired all the 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.049
 design team of the nike urban ok 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.180
 you have to be very aware of that and 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.930
 that this rumor can not be ruled out 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.450
 also this variant of smart wide apple 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.299
 could integrate a compass besides 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.520
 a series of sensors capable of 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.780
 the control blood pressure 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.510
 heart rate 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.270
 body temperature the temperature 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.390
 environmental the barometric pressure and the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.940
 oxygen level in the blood that is ok 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.869
 that this watch would be great for 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.860
 athletes and they also tell us that this 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.729
 Watch model has already been tested by 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.210

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.979

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.320
 you already have it in your hands that has already 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.770
 tested and they are working with apple 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:56.119
 to present this design in autumn 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.149
 September October the same day as 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.000

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.880
 we have the classic design for calling it 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.509
 somehow it's just another 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.450
 could be a model with 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.620
 circular sphere and a steel strap 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.840
 stainless 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.630
 so apple wants to launch a model 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.970
 classic for those users of all 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.150
 life for the moment we do not know if 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.000
 apple with this classic design 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.060
 of the same sensors that could have 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.060
 the sports version all the rumors 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.299
 indicate that it will not be so that the design 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.150
 classic will not have all these sensors 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.939
 there is talk about the possibility that 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.650
 Both models have a touch screen 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:48.829
