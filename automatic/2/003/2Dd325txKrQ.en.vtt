first part is you come over to varrick's

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
first part is you come over to varrick's
various<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.310> yo<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.390> gots<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.780> get<00:02:15.900> the

various like yo you gots to get the
Elder<00:02:16.170> cipher<00:02:16.710> man<00:02:16.890> it's<00:02:17.520> like<00:02:17.640> cool<00:02:17.880> dude<00:02:18.150> so

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
Elder cipher man it's like cool dude so

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.720 
Elder cipher man it's like cool dude so
to<00:02:18.660> get<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.110> Elder<00:02:19.230> cipher<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.980> need<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.430> go

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
to get the Elder cipher you need to go

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.680 
to get the Elder cipher you need to go
to<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:21.030> chest<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.870> 34<00:02:22.440> or<00:02:22.560> 35<00:02:22.800> variant<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
to a chest in the 34 or 35 variant of a

to a chest in the 34 or 35 variant of a
prison<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.680> elders<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.070> believe<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.550> 34<00:02:27.000> 35

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
prison of elders I believe it is 34 35

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.990 
prison of elders I believe it is 34 35
and<00:02:27.750> open<00:02:28.200> up<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:29.010> chest<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.580> got<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.850> out<00:02:29.910> of

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
and open up that chest I got it out of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.330 
and open up that chest I got it out of
35<00:02:30.420> my<00:02:30.720> people<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.110> my<00:02:31.200> chat<00:02:31.470> said<00:02:31.770> 34<00:02:32.220> I'm

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
35 my people in my chat said 34 I'm

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.100 
35 my people in my chat said 34 I'm
pretty<00:02:32.550> sure<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.850> can<00:02:33.000> use<00:02:33.180> maybe<00:02:33.810> any

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
pretty sure you can use maybe any

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.170 
pretty sure you can use maybe any
variant<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:34.800> just<00:02:35.310> for<00:02:35.460> safekeeping<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.030> would

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
variant but just for safekeeping I would

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.390 
variant but just for safekeeping I would
do<00:02:36.270> like<00:02:36.420> 34<00:02:36.900> 35<00:02:37.260> though<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.620> might<00:02:37.710> be<00:02:37.770> 32<00:02:38.250> as

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
do like 34 35 though it might be 32 as

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.190 
do like 34 35 though it might be 32 as
well<00:02:38.520> man<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.940> information<00:02:39.480> sucks<00:02:39.750> anyways

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
well man this information sucks anyways

well man this information sucks anyways
so<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.860> need<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.190> go<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.610> chest<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.480> need<00:02:42.570> to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
so you need to go to a chest and need to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.500 
so you need to go to a chest and need to
open<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.020> up<00:02:43.140> inside<00:02:43.560> prison<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.010> elders<00:02:44.130> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
open it up inside prison of elders and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.360 
open it up inside prison of elders and
it<00:02:45.510> will<00:02:45.720> open<00:02:45.900> up<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.350> give<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.980> elder

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
it will open up and give you the elder

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.730 
it will open up and give you the elder
cipher<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.000> then<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.300> will<00:02:48.480> go<00:02:48.660> over<00:02:48.900> to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
cipher and then you will go over to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.650 
cipher and then you will go over to
varrick's<00:02:50.220> again<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.970> will<00:02:51.090> turn<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.540> in

think the best combination we figured

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.150 
think the best combination we figured
out<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:23.940> doing<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.450> was<00:03:24.870> uh<00:03:25.170> for<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:25.950> week

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160

in particular 3 level 32 s and then a 28

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.030 
in particular 3 level 32 s and then a 28
will<00:03:30.360> complete<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.080> part<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.830> elder

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
will complete that part of the elder

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
cipher doing the 34 will get you a lot

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.350 
cipher doing the 34 will get you a lot
of<00:03:34.860> points<00:03:35.130> as<00:03:35.220> well<00:03:35.250> maybe<00:03:35.670> doing<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.090> twice

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
of points as well maybe doing it twice

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.140 
of points as well maybe doing it twice
this<00:03:36.690> week<00:03:36.930> will<00:03:37.230> yield<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.799> via<00:03:38.640> thousand

points you need I know that killing
skolas<00:03:41.250> himself<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:41.970> worth<00:03:42.209> 500<00:03:43.049> points<00:03:43.080> so

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070
