00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
think of this one is creative mode as

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.340 
think of this one is creative mode as
you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.820> if<00:00:44.879> i<00:00:44.969> press<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.450> never<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
you can see if i press that one never a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.639 
you can see if i press that one never a
hold<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.680> blocks<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.850> an<00:00:48.030> alpha<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> sit

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
hold of blocks it is an alpha as a sit

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.430 
hold of blocks it is an alpha as a sit
at<00:00:49.739> start<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.160> Sri<00:00:50.309> later<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:51.870> hole<00:00:52.289> down

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
at start of Sri later and a hole down

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.910 
at start of Sri later and a hole down
there<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.789> cuts<00:00:54.120> down<00:00:54.300> trees

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
there as you can see it cuts down trees

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.400 
there as you can see it cuts down trees

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.340 
get here there's not that many blocks so
it's<00:02:21.490> not<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.670> easy<00:02:21.940> build<00:02:22.330> have<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.200> are

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
it's not that easy build have you are

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.790 
it's not that easy build have you are
invincible<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.910> it's<00:02:25.060> my<00:02:25.180> back<00:02:25.420> room<00:02:25.800> pull

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
invincible so it's my back room pull

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.320 
invincible so it's my back room pull
that's<00:02:27.160> what<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.370> didn't<00:02:27.700> still<00:02:28.000> water<00:02:32.280> and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
that's what I didn't still water and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.110 
that's what I didn't still water and
probably<00:02:34.330> your<00:02:34.660> tripod<00:02:35.110> for<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.330 

this<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:41.810> like<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.170> screwed<00:02:42.680> up<00:02:42.769> down<00:02:43.010> that's

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
this is like I screwed up down that's

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.009 
this is like I screwed up down that's
why<00:02:43.489> they<00:02:43.610> look<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:43.790> weird<00:02:45.280> if<00:02:46.280> they<00:02:46.580> have

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
why they look so weird if they have

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.360 
why they look so weird if they have
things<00:02:48.019> that's<00:02:48.440> where<00:02:48.620> my<00:02:49.870> what's<00:02:50.870> quarters

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
things that's where my what's quarters

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.830

fountains<00:02:52.370> going<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.640> be<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.510> what<00:02:53.690> we're

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
fountains going to be and what we're

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.220 
fountains going to be and what we're
going<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.019> fix<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.319> up<00:02:54.940> if<00:02:55.940> i<00:02:56.150> press<00:02:56.659> forwards

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
going to fix that up if i press forwards

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.830 
going to fix that up if i press forwards
I<00:02:57.500> can<00:02:58.040> jump<00:02:58.250> like<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.459> but<00:02:58.909> if<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.090> just<00:02:59.659> walk

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
I can jump like that but if I just walk

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.080 
I can jump like that but if I just walk
forwards<00:03:00.230> into<00:03:00.349> a<00:03:00.470> block<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:01.760> will<00:03:01.879> jump

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
forwards into a block it will jump

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.649 
forwards into a block it will jump
automatically<00:03:02.720> unless<00:03:03.349> of<00:03:03.769> course<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:05.060> like

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
automatically unless of course it's like

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:12.119 
automatically unless of course it's like
at<00:03:06.590> least<00:03:06.769> you<00:03:07.159> can't<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.640> doesn't<00:03:07.760> do<00:03:08.120> it
