00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.140
 with friends inside the club so good 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.910
 that you have another mod package 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.550
 this time I bring you 5 that I hope they 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.110
 like it and good if I hear my voice a little 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.450
 more different than normal has been 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.030
 listening to dry weird is because I'm not 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.070
 sick I 've already been with the week and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.260
 Well, those who have followed me from almost 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.119
 the first subscriber will remember that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.039
 When I get sick, I get sick almost by 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.230
 one month but good is another subject 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.869
 I just wanted to clarify that 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.480
 and well you know, we're going to use the 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.680
 blog of the pro 1 points 2.3 that 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.510
 I leave the description of the video for 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.260
 install the bikes these by 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.239
 android in version 0.7 points 2 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.160
 the mods are the description of the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.170
 video come compressed in a single 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.969
 file points and decompress it and 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.409
 will all modes 5 they 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.329
 I will leave and that I will teach them to 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.609
 continuation 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.039
 how did he speak good to start 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.390
 let's open the blog launcher pro and you 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.280
 we're going to give in the option above in the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.320
 new small key to install the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.019
 who do not know position install we go to 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.879
 pach mod in game and from there to 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.649
 install it we are going to roles and import 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.920
 there where it says import we're going to 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.270
 select and we will look for the mods in 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.789
 the folder that we had saved or 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.409
 decompressed already know do not decompress 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.860
 the modes if they look for the place the 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.960
 select and install themselves and ready 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.060
 now let's see the elephas frames is 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.460
 fast fire or it burns faster 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.310
 the things for that is that mode is a 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.110
 simple way that of franz schubert is the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.420
 of that is to fly the mode 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.950
 survival of freak crafting with 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.810
 this one you can get anything without 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.530
 have materials only characters and ready 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.390
 the inventor and save is for when 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.979
 die do not lose your things you only lose 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.750
 armor but in other things everything that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.740
 have in the inventory and the night 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.740
 mission is for 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.080
 to see in the night you do not just see 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.750
 all clear the night alone on the sky 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.850
 It is dark but everything looks so clear 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.770
 good to play play and we're going to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.090
 demonstrate so that they see that they work 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.039
 all modes 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.780
 good the first way, as they see everything 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.090
 it looks clear but the sky is dark 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.619
 that is the one in the vision that practically 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.560
 time as if it were day but the sky 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.780
 dark in the distance can observe good 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.040
 there the other motel in fly in climb normal 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.319
 which is right now I'm flying in mode 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.390
 survival and the other way is that of 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.709
 the flames that as you will see right now 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.769
 tree is going to burn faster than 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.620
 normal or the other motorcycles the flames 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.150
 fast flame or rapid fire that makes 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.250
 all fires burn faster 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.670
 although the flame lasts less lasts us 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.170
 let's say the flame process is 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.819
 a little faster 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.489
 the other way is the free crafting that 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.019
 it is this that practically everything 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.450
 you want to sing you can pose without 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.920
 have nothing you have nothing and only enter 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.950
 if you press them and start character 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.639
 everything you want swords 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.389
 Gold diamond and iron armor all 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.060
 whatever you want 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:58.950
 and the last mode that is that of inventor and 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.389
 6 as you see right now I'm going to commit suicide and 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.579
 I will not lose my things, notice that 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.599
 I have some things down there and not the 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.150
 I'm going to lose I'm not going to kill myself 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.590
 right now and you will see my stuff them 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.889
 I'm going to keep having, I'm not going to 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.840
 lose and for that is the inventor mod 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.299
 and if you do not lose anything what you have in the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.980
 inventory inventory if you have a 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.110
 armor if you're going to lose it 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.269
 so good more than anything stays in your 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.950
 place but if they take off or they auto 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.330
 they keep the armor and well that would be 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.319
 everything if they like the seeds are the 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.970
 I leave the description of the video of the 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.580
 same seed that I passed earlier 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.019
 I also liked the map a lot, you know 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.120
 they put it there where it decides at the time of 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.459
 create a map and you will start in this 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.720
 map so it would pretty much be all 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.879
 friends, I hope you liked the video 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.310

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.970
 and well I'll have a little video next 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.120
 where I'm going to ask for a little help 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.549
 I hope if I can help 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.950
 that point and I never ask for anything but 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.780
 but well I hope that in that video yes I 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.250
 understand or explain me well what 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.930
 things I'm going to ask you, it's not nothing 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.459

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.950

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.359
