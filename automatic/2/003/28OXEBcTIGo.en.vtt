books it was something a concept that
James<00:01:41.400> Cameron<00:01:41.700> pretty<00:01:42.090> much<00:01:42.210> came<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.540> with

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
James Cameron pretty much came up with

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.069 
James Cameron pretty much came up with
himself<00:01:43.549> and<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.570> read<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.840> script

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
himself and if you just read the script

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.440 
himself and if you just read the script
and<00:01:46.500> watch<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.220> first<00:01:47.520> spider-man<00:01:47.880> movie<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and watch the first spider-man movie a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870 
and watch the first spider-man movie a
lot<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.290> pretty<00:01:49.439> much<00:01:49.530> ripped<00:01:49.799> off<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.610> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
lot of it is pretty much ripped off so I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.080 
lot of it is pretty much ripped off so I
mean<00:01:51.149> obviously<00:01:51.920> it's<00:01:52.920> no<00:01:53.369> surprise<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.790> he

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
mean obviously it's no surprise that he

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.670 
mean obviously it's no surprise that he
would<00:01:54.210> make<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.540> sloppy<00:01:54.840> second<00:01:55.320> comment

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
would make the sloppy second comment

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.410 
would make the sloppy second comment
when<00:01:55.890> someone<00:01:56.280> asked<00:01:56.549> him<00:01:56.610> if<00:01:56.729> Sony<00:01:56.939> asked<00:01:57.299> him

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
when someone asked him if Sony asked him

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.090 
when someone asked him if Sony asked him
to<00:01:57.869> direct<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.259> spider-man<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.829> know<00:01:58.950> it's
