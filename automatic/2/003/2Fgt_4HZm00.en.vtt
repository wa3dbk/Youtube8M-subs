00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
you guys saw straight was a year ago so

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.500 
you guys saw straight was a year ago so
I'll<00:03:30.370> try<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.849> put<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.769> comparison<00:03:32.769> shot<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
I'll try to put a comparison shot of the

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.659 
I'll try to put a comparison shot of the
length<00:03:34.780> if<00:03:35.079> I<00:03:35.290> can<00:03:35.590> but<00:03:35.829> I<00:03:35.889> don't<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.400> from

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
length if I can but I don't like it from

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.199 
length if I can but I don't like it from
that<00:03:37.000> much<00:03:37.299> it's<00:03:37.719> gotten<00:03:38.169> like<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.849> shorter

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
that much it's gotten like the shorter

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.000 
that much it's gotten like the shorter
hair<00:03:40.359> is<00:03:40.480> catching<00:03:40.900> up<00:03:41.049> with<00:03:41.109> longer<00:03:41.680> hair<00:03:41.709> so

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
hair is catching up with longer hair so

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.740 
hair is catching up with longer hair so
it<00:03:42.129> looks<00:03:42.599> bigger<00:03:43.599> or<00:03:44.079> I<00:03:44.639> don't<00:03:45.639> know<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.540> I

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
it looks bigger or I don't know so I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.720 
it looks bigger or I don't know so I
don't<00:03:46.989> think<00:03:47.139> I<00:03:47.200> gained<00:03:47.439> that<00:03:47.769> much<00:03:47.829> room<00:03:48.430> I

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
don't think I gained that much room I

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.280 
don't think I gained that much room I
could<00:03:49.299> be<00:03:49.419> wrong<00:03:49.569> because<00:03:49.689> sometimes<00:03:50.109> you
