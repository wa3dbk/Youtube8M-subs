 division of the loss of the red army 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.049
 it seems extremely difficult because 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.289
 bad record keeping and not complete

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.289
 me that during this time the total loss

 Soviet troops only in divisions 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.079

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.089
 on the third of July, when he hurriedly wrote down 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.429
 diary 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:43.089
 no exaggeration 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.049
 say that the campaign against Russia 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:46.839
 won 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.049
 within 14 days 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.099
 however the front officer describes 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.099
 happening a few and 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.829
 I feel that we have entered 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.519
 to the defeated side which we experienced 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.439
 To France 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.819
 instead of this resistance 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.909
 constant resistance how 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:03.719
 would be hopeless
