for<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.530> other<00:02:53.620> team<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.730> bunch<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.270> that's

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
for the other team in a bunch and that's

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.810 
for the other team in a bunch and that's
how<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:56.290> can<00:02:56.410> end<00:02:56.590> up<00:02:56.710> losing<00:02:57.100> by<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.280> lot<00:02:57.550> or

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
how you can end up losing by a lot or

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.220 
how you can end up losing by a lot or
losing<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.330> lead<00:02:58.480> or<00:02:58.780> things<00:02:59.020> like<00:02:59.110> that

losing the lead or things like that

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.360 
losing the lead or things like that
really<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.860> going<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.040> come<00:03:00.190> down<00:03:00.310> to

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
really is going to come down to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.630 
really is going to come down to
turnovers<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.300> bad<00:03:01.870> shots<00:03:02.290> because<00:03:03.280> if<00:03:03.520> you

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
turnovers and bad shots because if you

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.550 
turnovers and bad shots because if you
shoot<00:03:03.850> uncontested<00:03:04.480> shots<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.200> consistent

shoot uncontested shots on a consistent

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.340 
shoot uncontested shots on a consistent
basis<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.820> things<00:03:07.330> like<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.570> you're<00:03:08.020> really

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
basis and things like that you're really

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.020 
basis and things like that you're really
going<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.530> have<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.710> lot<00:03:09.070> better<00:03:09.310> chance<00:03:09.490> of

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
going to have a lot better chance of

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.230 
going to have a lot better chance of
getting<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.630> ball<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.930> go<00:03:11.050> into<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> hoop<00:03:12.240> 2k

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
getting the ball to go into the hoop 2k

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.690 
getting the ball to go into the hoop 2k
really<00:03:13.690> works<00:03:13.900> on<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.170> contested<00:03:15.070> shot<00:03:15.280> basis

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
really works on a contested shot basis

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.080 
really works on a contested shot basis
if<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.570> get<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.750> contested<00:03:17.350> animation<00:03:18.280> most

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
if you get a contested animation most

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.730 
if you get a contested animation most
likely<00:03:19.480> you're<00:03:19.600> going<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.810> miss<00:03:20.020> unless<00:03:20.440> of

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
likely you're going to miss unless of

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.990 
likely you're going to miss unless of
course<00:03:20.770> you<00:03:21.160> have<00:03:21.280> one<00:03:21.460> of<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.640> superstars

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
course you have one of the superstars

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.330 
course you have one of the superstars
that<00:03:22.870> doesn't<00:03:23.170> mean<00:03:23.260> it's<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.500> good<00:03:23.650> shot<00:03:24.040> with

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
that doesn't mean it's a good shot with

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.890 
that doesn't mean it's a good shot with
the<00:03:24.490> superstars<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.120> mean<00:03:25.270> there's<00:03:25.420> plenty<00:03:25.810> of

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
the superstars I mean there's plenty of

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.960 
the superstars I mean there's plenty of
times<00:03:26.140> guys<00:03:26.860> are<00:03:27.130> going<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.490> lane<00:03:27.670> with

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
times guys are going the lane with

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.390 
times guys are going the lane with
Jordan<00:03:28.450> or<00:03:28.570> LeBron<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:29.170> it'll<00:03:29.410> be<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.590> hag<00:03:29.950> shot

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
Jordan or LeBron and it'll be a hag shot

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.730
