00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.990 
because that's what film does camera
plus<00:02:04.040> you're<00:02:04.220> asking<00:02:04.550> me<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:07.190> film<00:02:07.700> something

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
plus you're asking me to film something

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.410 
plus you're asking me to film something
that<00:02:08.270> is<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> very<00:02:08.810> very<00:02:09.020> very<00:02:09.530> much<00:02:09.680> a<00:02:09.740> female

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
that is a very very very much a female

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.790 
that is a very very very much a female
statement<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.660> I<00:02:12.200> think<00:02:12.590> there<00:02:12.710> will

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
statement and I think there will

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.590 
statement and I think there will
probably<00:02:12.980> be<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.310> bit<00:02:13.460> of<00:02:13.580> flack<00:02:14.030> about<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.480> as

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
probably be a bit of flack about that as

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.490 
probably be a bit of flack about that as
well

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
well

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.350 
well
and<00:02:16.160> there<00:02:16.340> may<00:02:16.460> well<00:02:16.490> be<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:17.300> one<00:02:17.630> hours<00:02:17.930> time

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
and there may well be in one hours time

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.740 
and there may well be in one hours time
but<00:02:20.360> we<00:02:21.110> agree<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.860> proceed<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.790> I'm<00:02:23.570> one<00:02:23.690> of

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
but we agree to proceed and I'm one of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.150 
but we agree to proceed and I'm one of
the<00:02:23.810> things<00:02:23.930> she<00:02:24.080> said<00:02:24.110> I'm<00:02:24.500> nervous<00:02:24.800> already

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
the things she said I'm nervous already

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.710 
the things she said I'm nervous already
about<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.670> fact<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.210> will<00:02:26.390> take<00:02:26.540> this

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
about the fact that you will take this

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.880 
about the fact that you will take this
away<00:02:26.990> from<00:02:27.050> me<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.910> won't<00:02:29.260> but<00:02:30.260> there<00:02:30.380> is<00:02:30.500> you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
away from me I won't but there is you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.560 
away from me I won't but there is you
know<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.430> technical<00:02:31.700> process<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.270> making<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
know the technical process of making a

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.710 
know the technical process of making a
film<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:33.490> specific<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.120> will<00:02:35.330> be<00:02:35.510> with

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
film is specific so but you will be with

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.190 
film is specific so but you will be with
me<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.550> as<00:02:37.550> your<00:02:37.730> choreography<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:39.050> will

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
me and as your choreography and you will

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.440 
me and as your choreography and you will
be<00:02:39.380> part<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:39.830> process<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.000> said<00:02:41.209> you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
be part of that process and I said you

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.360 
be part of that process and I said you
need<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.750> learn<00:02:41.900> how<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.080> use<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.290> camera<00:02:42.560> so

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
need to learn how to use a camera so

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.760 
need to learn how to use a camera so
don't<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:44.090> ask<00:02:44.330> people<00:02:44.630> like<00:02:44.870> me<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.200> do<00:02:45.620> this

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
don't you ask people like me to do this

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.480 
don't you ask people like me to do this
stuff<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:46.340> know

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
stuff you know

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.980 
stuff you know
and<00:02:47.000> interestingly<00:02:47.240> more<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:47.900> more

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
and interestingly more and more

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.110 
and interestingly more and more
choreographers<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.740> think<00:02:48.950> are<00:02:49.130> bringing<00:02:49.970> a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
choreographers I think are bringing a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.240 
choreographers I think are bringing a
camera<00:02:50.570> into<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:51.020> into<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.860> process

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
camera into the into the process

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.100 
camera into the into the process
choreography<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.090> know<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.450> William

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
choreography I know that William

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.650 
choreography I know that William
Forsythe<00:02:54.610> certainly<00:02:55.610> did<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.510> know

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
Forsythe certainly did that you know

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.510 
Forsythe certainly did that you know
continues<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.470> do<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.100> think<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.400> a

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
continues to do that and I think it's a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.699 
continues to do that and I think it's a
it's<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.989> totally<00:03:00.410> appropriate

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
it's it's a totally appropriate

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.490 
it's it's a totally appropriate
contemporary<00:03:01.520> tool<00:03:01.730> for<00:03:02.330> for<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.380> new

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
contemporary tool for for the new

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.300 
contemporary tool for for the new
choreography<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:05.170> well<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.440> will<00:03:06.860> be<00:03:06.890> lots<00:03:07.160> to

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
choreography so well and will be lots to

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.440 
choreography so well and will be lots to
talk<00:03:07.459> about<00:03:07.550> afterwards<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:10.269> quarter<00:03:11.269> net

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
talk about afterwards so quarter net

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.350 
talk about afterwards so quarter net
which<00:03:11.870> by<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.110> way<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.350> sort<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.970> it's<00:03:13.970> like<00:03:14.330> a

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
which by the way is sort of it's like a

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.210 
which by the way is sort of it's like a
cutlet<00:03:14.840> it's<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:15.110> kind<00:03:15.560> of<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.680> piece<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:16.040> meat

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
cutlet it's a kind of a piece of meat

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.060 
cutlet it's a kind of a piece of meat
you<00:03:16.519> know<00:03:16.670> it's<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.230> it's<00:03:18.230> quite<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.410> complex<00:03:18.830> I

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
you know it's a it's quite a complex I

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.190 
you know it's a it's quite a complex I
think<00:03:19.100> Flemish<00:03:19.640> pun<00:03:19.910> which<00:03:20.180> again<00:03:20.450> Janine<00:03:21.080> you

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
think Flemish pun which again Janine you

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.420 
think Flemish pun which again Janine you
might<00:03:21.350> have<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.590> explain<00:03:21.709> later<00:03:22.040> on<00:03:22.280> but<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:24.430> say

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
might have to explain later on but I say

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.810 
might have to explain later on but I say
this<00:03:25.580> was<00:03:25.700> really<00:03:25.940> gonna<00:03:26.090> enjoy
