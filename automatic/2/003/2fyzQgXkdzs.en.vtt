the video description so why would you
want<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.750> add<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> keyframe<00:00:22.260> well<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.920> will

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
want to add a keyframe well it will

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.210 
want to add a keyframe well it will
allow<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:24.710> options<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.859> settings

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.560 
allow you to have options and settings
up<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.970> your<00:00:27.300> video<00:00:27.630> clips<00:00:27.930> change<00:00:28.650> as<00:00:29.570> time

up on your video clips change as time

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.630 
up on your video clips change as time
goes<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> video<00:00:32.009> clip<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.489> have

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
goes on to the video clip so you have

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.549 
goes on to the video clip so you have
one<00:00:32.880> setting<00:00:33.239> at<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> beginning<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.960> then

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
one setting at the beginning and then

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.740 
one setting at the beginning and then
you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.130> change<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.329> exposure

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you can change some of the exposure

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.709 
you can change some of the exposure
settings<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.390> towards<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
settings at the as you get towards the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.470 
settings at the as you get towards the
end<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> video<00:00:40.200> clip<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.760> program

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
end of the video clip and the program

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.030 
end of the video clip and the program
will<00:00:42.629> automatically<00:00:43.079> fade<00:00:43.469> between<00:00:43.680> those

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
will automatically fade between those

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.290 
will automatically fade between those
two<00:00:44.219> settings<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.820> between<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> will

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
two settings in between it will

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.420 
two settings in between it will
interpolate<00:00:45.690> all<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> data<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.469> needs<00:00:46.500> so

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
interpolate all the data it needs so

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.310 
interpolate all the data it needs so
that<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.879> transition<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.870> smooth<00:00:50.719> sadly<00:00:51.719> we

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
that that transition is smooth sadly we

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.220 
that that transition is smooth sadly we
can't<00:00:52.890> keyframe<00:00:53.850> video<00:00:54.539> speed<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.050> that's

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
can't keyframe video speed and that's

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470 
can't keyframe video speed and that's
something<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.550> wish

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
something that I really really wish

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.279 
something that I really really wish
GoPro<00:00:58.260> would<00:00:58.770> include<00:00:59.699> as<00:01:00.000> part<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:01.079> their

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
GoPro would include as part of their

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.810 
GoPro would include as part of their
GoPro<00:01:01.649> Studios<00:01:02.010> because<00:01:02.190> being<00:01:02.579> able<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
GoPro Studios because being able to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.660 
GoPro Studios because being able to
control<00:01:03.420> speed<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.170> speed<00:01:04.949> ramp<00:01:05.220> throughout

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
control speed and speed ramp throughout

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.920 
control speed and speed ramp throughout
the<00:01:06.680> playback<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.920> video<00:01:08.130> clip<00:01:08.400> would<00:01:08.670> be

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
the playback of a video clip would be

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.060 
the playback of a video clip would be
absolutely<00:01:09.930> amazing<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
absolutely amazing so I really like to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.609 
absolutely amazing so I really like to
see<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.189> implemented<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.090> right<00:01:12.990> now<00:01:13.170> we're

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
see that implemented but right now we're

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.499 
see that implemented but right now we're
stuck<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.720> keyframing<00:01:15.720> image<00:01:16.320> controls<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
stuck with keyframing image controls and

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
stuck with keyframing image controls and
white<00:01:18.509> balance<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.340> well<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:22.250> framing<00:01:23.250> control

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
white balance as well as framing control

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.149 
white balance as well as framing control
so<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.060> key<00:01:24.630> from<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.830> not

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so we can key from all this but just not

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.789 
so we can key from all this but just not
the<00:01:26.640> playback<00:01:26.970> speed<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:28.140> I'm<00:01:28.320> sure<00:01:28.619> you're

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the playback speed so I'm sure you're

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.870 
the playback speed so I'm sure you're
thinking<00:01:28.979> that's<00:01:29.400> great

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
thinking that's great

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.280 
thinking that's great
stop<00:01:30.060> talking<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.630> show<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.200> do

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
stop talking and show you what I can do

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.960 
stop talking and show you what I can do
with<00:01:31.409> keyframe<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.640> could

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
with keyframe so this is what we could

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:41.510 
with keyframe so this is what we could
do<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.299> keyframes<00:01:39.979> now<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
do with keyframes now I know it's a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.740 
do with keyframes now I know it's a
little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.790> extreme<00:01:42.030> example<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.570> looks<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
little bit extreme example it looks a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.319 
little bit extreme example it looks a
little<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:42.960> silly<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.430> get<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> idea

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
little bit silly but you get the idea

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.499 
little bit silly but you get the idea
as<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.990> scrub<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.380> video<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.280> see<00:01:47.640> that

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
as we scrub to the video we can see that

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.499 
as we scrub to the video we can see that
it<00:01:48.750> starts<00:01:49.110> off<00:01:49.409> zoomed<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.790> normal

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
it starts off zoomed out with normal

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.929 
it starts off zoomed out with normal
settings<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> middle<00:01:53.490> here

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
settings and then in the middle here

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.030 
settings and then in the middle here
it's<00:01:54.149> completely<00:01:54.899> desaturated<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.860> it's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
it's completely desaturated and it's

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.030 
it's completely desaturated and it's
zoomed<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.670> black<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.420> white<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.869> then<00:01:58.770> it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
zoomed in black and white and then it

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.880 
zoomed in black and white and then it
zooms<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.969> sharpens<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:01.079> little<00:02:01.380> bit<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
zooms out and sharpens a little bit and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.149 
zooms out and sharpens a little bit and
kind<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.729> takes<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.360> kind<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.469> odd<00:02:04.649> look

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
kind of takes on this kind of odd look

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.139 
kind of takes on this kind of odd look
near<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.850> end<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:08.280> also<00:02:08.520> kind<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.879> moves

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
near the end it also kind of moves

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.119 
near the end it also kind of moves
around<00:02:09.300> inside<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> video<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.440> little<00:02:10.679> bit<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
around inside the video a little bit and

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.970 
around inside the video a little bit and
does<00:02:12.120> some<00:02:12.390> zoom

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
does some zoom

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.940 
does some zoom
and<00:02:13.190> stuff<00:02:13.450> now<00:02:14.450> we're<00:02:14.900> going<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.200> create<00:02:15.680> this

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
and stuff now we're going to create this

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.420 
and stuff now we're going to create this
look

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
look

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.509 
look
so<00:02:16.519> let's<00:02:16.700> first<00:02:17.060> reset<00:02:17.959> all<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.709> settings

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
so let's first reset all of the settings

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.640 
so let's first reset all of the settings
that<00:02:19.670> I've<00:02:19.819> put<00:02:20.060> on<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.299> video<00:02:20.629> clip<00:02:20.959> so<00:02:21.620> that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
that I've put on this video clip so that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.420 
that I've put on this video clip so that
we're<00:02:22.069> back<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.580> just<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:23.060> basic<00:02:23.810> normal<00:02:24.739> clip

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
we're back to just the basic normal clip

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.820 
we're back to just the basic normal clip
alright<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.989> first<00:02:27.349> thing<00:02:27.500> we're<00:02:27.680> going<00:02:27.769> to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
alright the first thing we're going to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.330 
alright the first thing we're going to
do<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.330> turn<00:02:29.330> on<00:02:29.769> keyframe<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:30.799> what<00:02:31.069> this<00:02:31.190> will

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
do is turn on keyframe so what this will

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.059 
do is turn on keyframe so what this will
do<00:02:31.489> is<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:32.269> will<00:02:32.360> save<00:02:32.930> all<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.709> settings

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
do is it will save all of the settings

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.430 
do is it will save all of the settings
we<00:02:34.190> have<00:02:34.370> in<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.519> video<00:02:34.790> right<00:02:35.060> now<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:36.200> that

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
we have in the video right now so that

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.839 
we have in the video right now so that
when<00:02:36.650> we<00:02:36.769> scrub<00:02:37.010> forward<00:02:37.280> we'll<00:02:37.519> be<00:02:37.610> able<00:02:37.700> to

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
when we scrub forward we'll be able to

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.190 
when we scrub forward we'll be able to
shift<00:02:38.239> from<00:02:38.420> these<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.660> something<00:02:38.930> else<00:02:39.079> so

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
shift from these to something else so

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.199 
shift from these to something else so
we're<00:02:39.319> going<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.500> come<00:02:39.650> over<00:02:39.680> here<00:02:40.120> onto<00:02:41.120> the

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
we're going to come over here onto the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.300 
we're going to come over here onto the
right-hand<00:02:41.750> side<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.170> screen<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.680> we're

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
right-hand side of the screen and we're

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.960 
right-hand side of the screen and we're
going<00:02:43.549> to<00:02:43.610> hit<00:02:44.090> add<00:02:44.739> keyframe<00:02:45.739> for<00:02:46.579> each<00:02:46.760> of

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
going to hit add keyframe for each of

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.720 
going to hit add keyframe for each of
the<00:02:47.030> settings<00:02:47.209> we<00:02:47.480> want<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.989> stay<00:02:48.519> like<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.549> is

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
the settings we want to stay like it is

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.170 
the settings we want to stay like it is
right<00:02:50.150> now<00:02:50.209> at<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:51.500> time<00:02:51.640> then<00:02:52.640> we're<00:02:53.030> going

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
right now at this time then we're going

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.789 
right now at this time then we're going
to<00:02:53.269> go<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.810> point<00:02:54.049> in<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.260> video<00:02:54.349> we<00:02:54.590> want

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
to go to the point in the video we want

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.819 
to go to the point in the video we want
to<00:02:54.859> make<00:02:55.190> changes<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.900> we're<00:02:57.349> going<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.500> scrub

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
to make changes so we're going to scrub

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.009 
to make changes so we're going to scrub
forward<00:02:58.129> to<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.489> middle<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.209> video<00:03:02.019> right

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
forward to the middle of the video right

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.319 
forward to the middle of the video right
here<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.500> now<00:03:04.340> we<00:03:04.400> can<00:03:04.790> play<00:03:05.030> with<00:03:05.239> the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
here and now we can play with the

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.330 
here and now we can play with the
settings<00:03:05.359> now<00:03:05.959> we<00:03:06.019> don't<00:03:06.500> have<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.160> add

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
settings now we don't have to add

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.500 
settings now we don't have to add
another<00:03:08.150> another<00:03:09.140> keyframe<00:03:10.239> GoPro<00:03:11.239> Studios

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
another another keyframe GoPro Studios

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.050 
another another keyframe GoPro Studios
will<00:03:11.660> do<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:12.129> automatically<00:03:13.129> for<00:03:13.250> us<00:03:13.730> when

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
will do that automatically for us when

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.030 
will do that automatically for us when
we<00:03:14.180> change<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.510> setting<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:16.310> let's<00:03:16.849> just

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
we change the setting so let's just

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.580 
we change the setting so let's just
desaturate<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.959> maybe<00:03:20.959> we'll<00:03:21.319> just

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
desaturate this and maybe we'll just

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.960 
desaturate this and maybe we'll just
zoom<00:03:21.769> in<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:23.060> then<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.630> looks<00:03:23.870> like<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.260> needs

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
zoom in and then it looks like it needs

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.080 
zoom in and then it looks like it needs
some<00:03:26.139> sharpening<00:03:28.450> maybe<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.569> constant<00:03:30.139> s

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
some sharpening maybe a constant s

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.710 
some sharpening maybe a constant s
contrast<00:03:32.090> boost<00:03:32.419> and<00:03:32.989> then<00:03:33.319> maybe<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.650> little

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
contrast boost and then maybe a little

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.170 
contrast boost and then maybe a little
exposure<00:03:35.720> brightening<00:03:36.290> alright<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:37.280> that's

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
exposure brightening alright so that's

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.720 
exposure brightening alright so that's
been<00:03:38.630> keyframe<00:03:39.260> now<00:03:39.290> for<00:03:39.829> this<00:03:40.010> area<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.549> then

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
been keyframe now for this area and then

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.129 
been keyframe now for this area and then
we'll<00:03:40.940> shove<00:03:41.480> forward<00:03:42.200> some<00:03:42.530> more<00:03:42.919> and<00:03:44.139> then

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
we'll shove forward some more and then

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:52.509 
we'll shove forward some more and then
maybe<00:03:45.380> we'll<00:03:45.709> just<00:03:48.370> there<00:03:50.349> then<00:03:51.349> why<00:03:52.250> don't<00:03:52.459> we

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
maybe we'll just there then why don't we

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.629 
maybe we'll just there then why don't we
zoom<00:03:52.910> back<00:03:52.940> out<00:03:56.319> maybe<00:03:57.319> we<00:03:57.769> will<00:03:58.010> turn<00:03:58.519> the

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
zoom back out maybe we will turn the

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:05.250 
zoom back out maybe we will turn the
contrast<00:03:59.180> up<00:04:00.220> even<00:04:01.220> more<00:04:03.160> drop<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.340> exposure

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
contrast up even more drop the exposure

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.699 
contrast up even more drop the exposure
and<00:04:07.060> then<00:04:08.060> we'll<00:04:08.389> go<00:04:08.599> to<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:09.019> end<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.620> the

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
and then we'll go to the end of the

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:17.620 
and then we'll go to the end of the
video<00:04:11.530> here<00:04:13.389> I'll<00:04:14.389> boost<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.959> exposure<00:04:16.630> drop

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
video here I'll boost the exposure drop

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.039 
video here I'll boost the exposure drop
the<00:04:17.870> contrast<00:04:19.359> bring<00:04:20.359> back<00:04:20.570> in<00:04:20.810> some

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
the contrast bring back in some

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.140 
the contrast bring back in some
saturation

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
saturation

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.040 
saturation
looks<00:04:23.810> normal<00:04:28.330> something<00:04:29.330> like<00:04:29.540> that<00:04:29.780> and

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
looks normal something like that and

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.750 
looks normal something like that and
then<00:04:30.889> we're<00:04:31.010> going<00:04:31.160> back<00:04:31.310> up<00:04:36.310> all<00:04:37.310> right<00:04:37.370> now

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
then we're going back up all right now

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:45.460 
then we're going back up all right now
when<00:04:37.940> we<00:04:38.030> play<00:04:38.180> through<00:04:38.389> our<00:04:38.419> video<00:04:44.290> we<00:04:45.290> can

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
when we play through our video we can

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.780 
when we play through our video we can
see<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:45.740> all<00:04:45.919> those<00:04:46.100> changes<00:04:46.400> we<00:04:46.580> made

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
see that all those changes we made

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.350 
see that all those changes we made
change<00:04:47.419> on<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:48.080> fly<00:04:48.280> well<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.699> video<00:04:49.970> clip<00:04:50.240> is

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
change on the fly well the video clip is
