00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
fit so they'll catch on the side of the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.140 
fit so they'll catch on the side of the
body

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.960 
them all in now you may find that all
the<00:02:14.260> holes<00:02:14.500> will<00:02:14.740> line<00:02:14.770> up<00:02:14.980> now<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.670> got<00:02:15.940> a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
the holes will line up now you got a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.520 
the holes will line up now you got a
couple<00:02:16.210> options<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:16.900> try<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.110> use<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.260> pin

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
couple options you can try to use a pin

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.400 
couple options you can try to use a pin
bar<00:02:17.770> in<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:19.030> pin<00:02:19.240> bar<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.630> did<00:02:19.840> right<00:02:19.990> here

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
bar in a pin bar like I did right here

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.700 
bar in a pin bar like I did right here
just<00:02:21.010> kind<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.310> distorted<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.970> metal<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.710> now

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
just kind of distorted the metal and now

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.390 
just kind of distorted the metal and now
I<00:02:23.740> should<00:02:24.070> be<00:02:24.190> able<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.520> this<00:02:24.640> last<00:02:24.910> one<00:02:25.210> in

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
I should be able to get this last one in

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.680 
I should be able to get this last one in
another<00:02:27.400> method<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.270> do<00:02:28.420> if<00:02:28.540> you're

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
another method you can do if you're

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.490 
another method you can do if you're
close<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:31.150> chase<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.480> tap<00:02:31.870> through<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.320> hole

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
close is to chase a tap through the hole

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.820 
close is to chase a tap through the hole
this<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.070> already<00:02:33.610> tapped<00:02:34.470> but<00:02:35.470> if<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.620> chase

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
this is already tapped but if you chase

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.590 
this is already tapped but if you chase
the<00:02:35.950> tap<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> whole<00:02:36.610> cuts<00:02:36.970> metal<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.570> the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
the tap to the whole cuts metal to the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.020 
the tap to the whole cuts metal to the
frame<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.380> then<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.459> way<00:02:39.610> you'll<00:02:39.850> be<00:02:39.970> able

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
frame and then that way you'll be able

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.470 
frame and then that way you'll be able
to<00:02:40.180> chase<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.570> do<00:02:40.720> with<00:02:40.840> your<00:02:40.990> bolt<00:02:42.300> those<00:02:43.300> are

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
to chase it do with your bolt those are

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.090 
to chase it do with your bolt those are
all<00:02:43.600> put<00:02:43.840> back<00:02:44.020> into<00:02:44.260> place<00:02:44.380> we<00:02:44.830> put<00:02:44.980> the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
something to lock down the threads when

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.890 
something to lock down the threads when
you<00:03:58.920> remove<00:03:59.220> them<00:03:59.340> for<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.239> next<00:04:00.600> step<00:04:00.750> you

isn't two-wheel high and your shifters
in<00:04:04.470> two-wheel<00:04:04.860> high<00:04:05.069> one<00:04:05.310> way<00:04:05.459> you're<00:04:05.730> gonna

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
in two-wheel high one way you're gonna

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.750 
in two-wheel high one way you're gonna
be<00:04:06.000> able<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.150> find<00:04:06.360> out<00:04:06.569> is<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.519> this<00:04:08.519> one

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
be able to find out is that this one

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.590 
be able to find out is that this one
goes<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:09.090> front<00:04:09.360> drive<00:04:09.630> shaft<00:04:09.660> spins<00:04:10.440> freely

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
goes to front drive shaft spins freely

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.670 
goes to front drive shaft spins freely
that<00:04:12.600> one<00:04:12.840> there<00:04:13.050> is<00:04:13.080> locked<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:14.790> now<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.680> gotta

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
that one there is locked so now I gotta

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.729 
that one there is locked so now I gotta
feed<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.040> cable<00:04:17.400> through<00:04:17.430> inside<00:04:18.239> here<00:04:18.780> put

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
feed the cable through inside here put

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.530 
feed the cable through inside here put
about<00:04:19.950> halfway<00:04:20.250> in<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.609> threads<00:04:20.910> again<00:04:21.060> and

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
about halfway in the threads again and

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.020 
about halfway in the threads again and
then<00:04:21.780> we<00:04:21.900> get<00:04:22.049> twist<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.100> clevis<00:04:23.400> on<00:04:23.729> till<00:04:23.970> it

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
then we get twist the clevis on till it

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.120 
then we get twist the clevis on till it
lines<00:04:24.180> up<00:04:24.360> with<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:24.540> hole<00:04:24.900> so<00:04:25.169> I<00:04:25.770> got<00:04:25.979> my

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
lines up with that hole so I got my

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.520 
lines up with that hole so I got my
clevis<00:04:26.760> screwed<00:04:27.270> on<00:04:27.450> all<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.840> way<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.290> I

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
clevis screwed on all the way and I

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.529 
clevis screwed on all the way and I
can't<00:04:28.860> reach<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.340> hole<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.790> I'm<00:04:29.880> bummed<00:04:30.330> out

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
can't reach the hole and I'm bummed out

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.000 
can't reach the hole and I'm bummed out
so<00:04:30.900> now<00:04:31.020> I'm<00:04:31.200> gonna<00:04:31.320> have<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.530> do<00:04:31.680> they<00:04:31.860> have<00:04:31.890> a
