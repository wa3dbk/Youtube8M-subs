00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hey and welcome to otto.de today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.500
 It's about the topic of how long can a 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.500
 puppy gassi go 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.460
 We were two weeks ago or three 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.210
 weeks as their one shot on video 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.550
 we were on the woman on it 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.740
 addressed our small video should 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.050
 only five minutes guests go thereupon 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.050
 Amon intensely we are busy 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.940
 have a bit with our 418 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.010
 talked about at all 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.590
 Find out how long can the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.239
 want to move small in the age 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.640
 All dogs play a lot 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.200
 move a lot and explore and explore 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.890
 that's why we have more intense 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.719
 bit with the topic 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.610
 apart and our veterinarian 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.210
 said that it is not a thing 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.530
 about 30 minutes depending on the intensity and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.270
 we just want to have a look 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.250
 little bit talk to you about it always 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.710
 such an era the bald opinion about it 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.300
 but in the end I am very much and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.739
 very often with her for a very long time 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.330
 gone out as the one more puppy 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.900
 has been and it seems it has not 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.920
 hurt 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.260
 we are simply trying times as a 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.510
 mean to find or it is up to 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.659
 we decide because every dog ​​that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.009
 individual if now someone has yes 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.119
 only raging then he has to be natural 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.590
 also slow down a bit 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.400
 but we'll take a look now 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.409
 what what what the statistics say look 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.770
 or science says and in addition 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.680
 means one month of life per month 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.780
 Puppies five minutes gas the walking time or 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.490
 Runtime it was for our video 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.710
 now the only become mean 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.009
 poorly forgotten are babies are 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.899
 no people babies are dog babies 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.299
 ligaments joints tendons musculature is 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.610
 not as pronounced as now 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.630
 with a grown dog because of that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.250
 You should be a bit too 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.340
 Be careful I am always the one 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.920
 opinion load he world must do so 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.540
 get to know everything in a new way with 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.270
 of course you and if the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.270
 is now when it considering 15 mins 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.580
 I would be gassi three times a day 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.290
 I would have to go the little one 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.510
 Of course I have to show the environment 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.640
 Do not show everything at once now though 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.810
 all a walk in the forest around 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.280
 Show what in the woods so everything going on makes 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.720
 15 minutes too few that many people 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.700
 then have the problem 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.100
 hey I 'm only 15 minutes now 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.490
 my dog ​​out but at home turns 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.220
 then totally by your dog must 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.270
 Playing normal is a world best 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.950
 child life is still the life of little beings 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.560
 a total of many customers would like to be for that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.990
 everything rediscovers everything new and he 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.510
 So I want to see everything and the important thing 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.620
 it is simply that you know well 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.690
 now is too much 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.260
 I bring my dog ​​a bit now 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.510
 I calm him down and I show 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.090
 him that it is also quiet so rather 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.130
 must not be permanently overstopped nonstop 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.870
 if I go gassi with him now 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.220
 he has so many impressions and he comes 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.660
 at home and still has this 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.440
 Impressions and would like somehow 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.440
 to process 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.540
 he needs a rest period at home with it 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.880
 he can sleep on average 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.930
 sleeping puppies what did we read 17 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.340
 hours a day 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.519
 they really need that time around 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.350
 to process everything I think 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.420
 if the world too little for itself 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.280
 Yes, how is she supposed to move? 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.480
 muscular how are they supposed to 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.910
 train and properly shape bands 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.530
 if the dog does not move many 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.269
 were also the mistake that make it the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.220
 gentle dog but want him 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.330
 is properly socialized and 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.489
 accordingly in the puppy school 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.560
 what happens then but it in the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.050
 puppy school for an hour that goes 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.980
 somehow there is such an hour 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.850
 Of course it will not be an hour now 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.650
 long raged but still you have one 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.900
 long walk and that's what 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.430
 what I can not tolerate 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.860
 if i say alright same school then 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.239
 the dogs romp just when 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.430
 you have quite a lot of other puppies 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.480
 then they want to do that and 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.360
 if the under-week barely 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.340
 move 15 minutes a day 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.250
 There's another start playing one 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.110
 bright for hours then the injured 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.330
 and because then the muscles bender 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.330
 bones and longing for this strain 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:22.330
 can not hold when you realize that 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.180
 a dog is still active 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.889
 you have to correct him dogboxing 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.569
 just in the dog box purely natural 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.099
 do not just imprison like that now 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.539
 you just have to get the dog 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.159
 get used to it then there looks okay 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.620
 That's when I'm in the kennel 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:37.180
 It's all about going in and then 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.189
 the dog calms down and he can 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.840
 also good sleep and the impression 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.310
 accordingly process at 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.039
 we do not have this problem for you 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.469
 it used so that the long the 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.909
 played outside because of this too 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.889
 arrived home then he still has 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:53.849
 want to continue playing why happened 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.889
 Of course, the dog is always up 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.449
 100 and then suddenly he should 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.349
 then always soothing distracted why 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:05.740
 and there it is your task the dog too 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:08.349
 to make it clear that he is calming down 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.300
 needs and that can take a bit 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.129
 So the wish will be difficult 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.509
 He will then think that you are the one 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.379
 were playmates and that he 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.060
 wants to play 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.789
 you just have to point it out 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.469
 you can be and stay consistent 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.150
 that the dog wanted to find him 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.360
 Platz made him look forward to his 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.990
 lies down and pauses that he does too 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.830
 but it does not happen if you just do it 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.300
 Yes, just take a nap and sleep 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.500
 certainly it brings nothing if you 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.000
 then try the dog even further 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.409
 let out and then try 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.719
 somehow to go out again or something 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.729
 it will do what you want and in 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.740
 this moment you should as 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.539
 Dog owners bear the responsibility 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.400
 and also the obligation that the dog 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.990
 can sometimes put to rest, he was 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.729
 It does not understand that is constantly on 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.699
 axis and since you have to rebuke him was 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.349
 our friend 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.250
 It takes a while for her to finish 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.289
 you have to think of this 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.319
 rausbringen do not have so much fear 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.900
 Welp is not fragile 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:07.150
 at least not as fragile as 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.610
 he thinks best the best proof is that 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.520
 Here's what she went through 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.650
 healthy never had any problems 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.779
 with the hip or with the elbow 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.240
 had or what I know what he 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:20.280
 not hurt either and the stable 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.570
 by 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.340
 you just say that was hold 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.820
 Fist rule in the back of the head always thinks 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:29.370
 get your world to a level 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.290
 rages until it simply falls over 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.389
 do not know their own limits yet 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.070
 it is up to you that you have your limits 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.050
 get to know you have to reach your limits 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.419
 you must know your dog you know 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.820
 You need to know how his energy level is 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.740
 Too little is too healthy for me 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.720
 mediocre in the sense we wish you 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.370
 Have fun with the next gassi and 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.260
 see you soon up in 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.610
 ask the angle below in the 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.650
 write in comments to what you have 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.960
 so many experiences with worlds 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.250
 First of all, you badly happened 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.020
 that maybe the puppy fell over 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.490
 because he does not recognize his limitations 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.580
 or just leave us in the 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.490
 comments know what modest as soon 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:08.010
 leave and yes in this sense are us 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.190
 next video again at night until good 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.190
 then 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.320
 meter 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.830
 tired now 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.580
 hmm 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.580
 tired 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.490

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.190
 maybe yes again yes yes
