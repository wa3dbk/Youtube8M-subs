no<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.450> reason<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.750> like<00:04:34.930> this<00:04:35.050> armor<00:04:35.410> is<00:04:35.560> not

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
no the reason I like this armor is not

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.469 
no the reason I like this armor is not
because<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.070> like<00:04:36.310> looking<00:04:36.610> at<00:04:36.700> half-naked<00:04:37.150> men

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479

because I like looking at half-naked men
as<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:37.960> may<00:04:38.110> put<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.380> law<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.950> can<00:04:39.520> prove<00:04:39.700> that

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
as you may put the law I can prove that

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.219 
as you may put the law I can prove that
and<00:04:40.240> why<00:04:40.479> would<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.750> want<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:40.990> look<00:04:41.110> at

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
and why would I want to look at

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.600 
and why would I want to look at
half-naked<00:04:41.620> men<00:04:41.950> when<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.250> have<00:04:42.430> naked

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
pictures of your mom no the reason I

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.560 
pictures of your mom no the reason I
like<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:45.280> is<00:04:45.460> because<00:04:45.520> I'm<00:04:45.970> imagining<00:04:46.180> the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
like it is because I'm imagining the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.390 
like it is because I'm imagining the
average<00:04:46.870> temperature<00:04:47.380> of<00:04:47.440> Skyrim<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:47.950> about<00:04:48.130> 5

this way not only a book insight in the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.690 
this way not only a book insight in the
sense<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:52.930> heavy<00:04:53.650> armor<00:04:53.890> only<00:04:54.190> restricts

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
sense that heavy armor only restricts

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.190 
sense that heavy armor only restricts
movement<00:04:54.820> or<00:04:55.120> indeed<00:04:55.720> there's<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.050> well

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
movement or indeed there's a well

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.600 
movement or indeed there's a well
trained<00:04:56.500> that<00:04:56.590> they<00:04:56.650> don't<00:04:56.890> need<00:04:57.040> heavy<00:04:57.280> armor

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
trained that they don't need heavy armor

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.370 
trained that they don't need heavy armor
but<00:04:58.060> in<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.240> cold<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.570> Skyrim<00:04:58.960> they're<00:04:59.200> able

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
but in the cold of Skyrim they're able

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.960 
but in the cold of Skyrim they're able
to<00:04:59.530> keep<00:04:59.740> resolute<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.370> strong<00:05:00.700> and<00:05:00.910> that

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
to keep resolute and strong and that

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.969 
to keep resolute and strong and that
contrast<00:05:01.960> really<00:05:02.110> alters<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.560> story<00:05:02.770> for<00:05:02.950> me

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
contrast really alters the story for me

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.670 
contrast really alters the story for me
in<00:05:03.510> that<00:05:04.510> not<00:05:04.780> only<00:05:04.840> are<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.260> rebels<00:05:05.560> up

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680
