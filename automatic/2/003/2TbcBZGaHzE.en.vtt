00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
experimental I've got it turned on and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.160 
experimental I've got it turned on and
it<00:00:59.460> seems<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> work<00:00:59.789> just<00:00:59.910> fine<00:01:00.270> let's<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
it seems to work just fine let's have a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.380 
it seems to work just fine let's have a
quick<00:01:01.320> look<00:01:01.350> at<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.460> put<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
quick look at it so you just put the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.800 
quick look at it so you just put the
lock<00:01:03.539> button<00:01:03.750> locks<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.830> plays<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.040> sound

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
lock button locks and it plays the sound

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.240 
lock button locks and it plays the sound
hit<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> button<00:01:07.110> again<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.770> opens<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.159> up

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
hit the button again and it opens it up

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.850 
hit the button again and it opens it up
again<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.590> I've<00:01:10.830> got

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860

set to TV too but i think it's it's
almost<00:01:14.040> exactly<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.850> android<00:01:15.210> one

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
almost exactly like the android one

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.200 
almost exactly like the android one
which<00:01:16.470> i<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.100> i<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.729> look<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:18.030> it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
which i really like i have to look at it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.660 
which i really like i have to look at it
is

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
is

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.320 
is
it<00:01:19.000> looks<00:01:19.450> really<00:01:19.810> cool<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.700> if<00:01:21.759> we<00:01:21.820> go<00:01:22.030> here<00:01:22.299> we

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
it looks really cool so if we go here we

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.649 
it looks really cool so if we go here we
can<00:01:22.570> try<00:01:22.810> out<00:01:22.840> different<00:01:23.170> ones<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.509> home

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.350 
babe tiles
it's<00:01:37.740> pretty<00:01:37.980> cool<00:01:40.430> now<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.580> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.790> see<00:01:41.850> here

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it's pretty cool now as you can see here

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.090 
it's pretty cool now as you can see here
even<00:01:42.720> though<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> had<00:01:43.110> two<00:01:43.320> different<00:01:43.530> set<00:01:44.010> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
even though I had two different set it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.140 
even though I had two different set it
to<00:01:44.370> different<00:01:44.550> options<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:46.430> Android<00:01:47.430> TV<00:01:47.850> tube

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
to different options the Android TV tube

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.350 
to different options the Android TV tube
one<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.630> still<00:01:48.960> coming<00:01:49.200> up<00:01:49.470> whenever<00:01:50.190> I<00:01:50.700> hit

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
one was still coming up whenever I hit

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.850 
one was still coming up whenever I hit
the<00:01:51.540> power<00:01:51.720> button<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.140> get<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.620> lock

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the power button to get to the lock

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.800 
the power button to get to the lock
screen<00:01:53.070> now<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.150> that's<00:01:54.300> why<00:01:54.510> this<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
screen now I think that's why this is

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
screen now I think that's why this is
under<00:01:55.170> experimental<00:01:55.530> because<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.400> isn't

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
under experimental because it isn't

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.900 
under experimental because it isn't
working<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.180> all<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.570> them<00:01:57.750> or<00:01:57.900> something

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
working with all of them or something

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.090 
working with all of them or something
but<00:01:59.910> I'm<00:02:00.060> yeah<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.870> really<00:02:01.680> guess<00:02:01.830> that's<00:02:02.010> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
but I'm yeah I really guess that's it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.740 
but I'm yeah I really guess that's it
for<00:02:02.160> this<00:02:02.400> video<00:02:02.550> it's<00:02:02.940> a<00:02:03.000> really<00:02:03.360> quick<00:02:03.570> look

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
for this video it's a really quick look

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.550 
for this video it's a really quick look
at<00:02:03.870> sleep<00:02:04.110> facts<00:02:04.470> now<00:02:05.400> I'm<00:02:05.810> reason<00:02:06.810> why<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.050> use

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
at sleep facts now I'm reason why I use

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.980 
at sleep facts now I'm reason why I use
safari<00:02:07.980> download<00:02:08.280> enabler<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.240> get<00:02:09.720> sleep

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
safari download enabler to get sleep

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.620 
safari download enabler to get sleep

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
affects the dog dad file was because

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.850 
affects the dog dad file was because
whenever<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.930> tried<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.290> get<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.500> cydia

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
whenever I tried to get the cydia

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.120 
whenever I tried to get the cydia
version<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:16.020> wouldn't<00:02:16.380> work<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.920> it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
version it just it wouldn't work like it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.920 
version it just it wouldn't work like it
would<00:02:17.220> work<00:02:17.250> after<00:02:17.760> two<00:02:17.940> or<00:02:17.970> three<00:02:18.120> tries<00:02:18.690> of

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
would work after two or three tries of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.750 
would work after two or three tries of
locking<00:02:19.320> my<00:02:19.440> ipod<00:02:19.830> screen<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.400> then<00:02:20.490> after

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
locking my ipod screen and then after

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.880 
locking my ipod screen and then after
that<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.000> would<00:02:21.120> just<00:02:21.240> stop<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.440> found<00:02:22.680> that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
that it would just stop but I found that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.410 
that it would just stop but I found that
having<00:02:23.070> manually<00:02:23.550> installed<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> deb<00:02:24.120> file

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
having manually installed the deb file

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.300 
having manually installed the deb file
using<00:02:24.840> ifile<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.530> downloading<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.040> using

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
using ifile and downloading it using

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.180 
using ifile and downloading it using
safari<00:02:26.730> download<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.360> blur<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:28.200> actually

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
safari download and a blur it actually

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.210 
safari download and a blur it actually
worked<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.900> yeah<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.290> guess<00:02:31.350> that's<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:32.070> a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
worked so yeah I guess that's it just a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.400 
worked so yeah I guess that's it just a
really<00:02:32.760> quick<00:02:32.940> look<00:02:33.240> at<00:02:33.420> our<00:02:33.450> sleep<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.170> facts
