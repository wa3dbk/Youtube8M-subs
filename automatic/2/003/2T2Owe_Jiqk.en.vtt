00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.620
 Hi, I'm Alejandra Coghlan and you're in my 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.900
 house that is your house this time 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.840
 let's make some memories to me in what 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.250
 staff are loved for 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.800
 I christen and they are from fabric sunflowers 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.009
 pylon statuette with center 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.009
 chocolate on this base that is very 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:30.109
 pretty fiberglass and has this 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:32.419
 metal souvenir and then come on it 's something 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.879
 very simple as a memory we are going to give 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.180
 these marshmallow sunflowers with 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:41.000
 cookie and I think it's something that can 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.700
 like it a lot then let's see how 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.210
 we are going to do it 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.210
 first of all I want to share 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.970
 that we're re using a little bit of 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.910
 bald we had out there from other 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.120
 crafts what it is that what 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.280
 We iron not believe you leave it 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.400
 all wrinkled look how you look here 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.190
 all crumpled and nothing else you spend the 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.010
 Planchita and it looks super good is 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.400
 important to learn to recycle 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.430
 materials that you use because then nothing in 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.230
 This life does not give anything away because you have to 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.960
 take care of this planet 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:25.180
 perfect the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:29.720
 let's cut our hair in the shape of 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.540
 petals and we did it in three tones in a 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.840
 light yellow a yellow a little 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.140
 darker as well as yolk 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.970
 orange to make this combination 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.909
 after what what we are going to do is 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.060
 start with a circle with a circle of 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.050
 cardboard you're going to put a little bit of 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.050
 cold sylicon 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.970
 then you put around your 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:03.300
 cardboard of your circle the petals and 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.300
 you play with them you put one and one 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.870
 as you will see we put about three or four 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.870
 about four or five layers 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.000
 four layers and this is with the purpose 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.690
 to give a lot of play to the flower after 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.520
 we are going to wrap in a piece of paper of these 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.710
 PVC are that warming 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.360
 with the gun and stretch breathable 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.360
 the chocolates 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.030
 to form the center of the table and nothing 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.190
 more you are going to do the mo lotito 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.560
 and you're going to close it that well with 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.200
 diurex to then pass the gun 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.200
 hot us around here we already have 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.540
 one ready and finished then as 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.870
 you'll see with the hot silicone we're going to 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.870
 paste 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.340
 and here I have the wooden stick 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.440
 fruity since this time is not natural and 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.440
 we are going to put it on the back 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.760
 and as you will see here we put a 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.500
 organza ribbon with a bow tie here and 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.240
 we have the organza ribbon that goes to 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.370
 be as well as as if it were the leaves and 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.820
