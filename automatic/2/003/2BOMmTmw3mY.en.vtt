00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.280
 very good to all that you are today 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:06.740
 talk and good I bring the explanation of 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.620
 how to do the munt strategy of the 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.480
 answer a single good window first 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.969
 everything you have to come from the land of 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.910
 one where they have to remove the 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.490
 pipes and it would be pretty good 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.970
 titan make many points are about 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.550
 almost 15,000 points with 10,000 see that 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.090
 enough is enough to open the whole map 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.419
 leaving 1 in round 1 go to the box and 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.880
 then look for the ray itself in the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.340
 round 1 arrives to look for the ray in 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.290
 the box in own round 1 when 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.180
 come to the moon you can go back to 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.700
 no man's land with the weapon that you have 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.220
 on wye or whatever make more points 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.860
 coach and go back to the moon and still 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.110
 We would continue in round 1 and we would return to 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.780
 the box and we would draw the beam then 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.090
 once we get the lightning we come 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.910
 to this restaurant room zam osa 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.190
 shoot like crazy as crazy now to 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.559
 the roof area but without stopping though 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.630
 do not come zombies we have to shoot 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.119
 all the time to the roof 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.070
 There will come a time that if in the round 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.560
 next to start have not come the 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.630
 roof is that it is already complete and in this 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.869
 case we would only come by one 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.850
 window already and it would be a perfect respawn 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.500
 first of all tell you that in just this 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.090
 It is much more difficult because of course 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.280
 you can have to shoot all the time 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.439
 to the roof and they also have those of the 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.360
 window and you have to be shot 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.819
 although they do not sell zombies in fact all 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.679
 hang on the roof so it's almost a little 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.470
 of apparent lass as you can thus who 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.540
 it's just harder to do 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.150
 in cooperative is the truth is 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.130
 thrown but this although it seems a cheto 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.370
 It is not so cheater because the excavator 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.790
 I stepped on every ship, say 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.650
 to be seen and about a round 50 out there 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.710
 what about the excavator and the truth is that 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.480
 is a search and if any Comfortable 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.880
 you can only go back to the 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.040
 principle by this bolt a the 11-m green 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.470
 what is the name of the in text and 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.080
 you will have to open and in this case 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.690
 main so nothing this has been all 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.600
 I recommend carrying titanium or speed 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.250
 tail and double shot to shoot 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.820
 better with lightning and all that and that we 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.010
 affect on the roof look at this has been 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.060
 everything and if you have more doubts tell me the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.160
 comments 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.160
 a greeting and until the next goodbye
