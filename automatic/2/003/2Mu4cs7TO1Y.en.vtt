00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
die pad on or else this will not work

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.300 
die pad on or else this will not work
okay<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.239> now<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.510> that's<00:03:09.750> saved<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.980> should

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
look like this like that and when you

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.190 
look like this like that and when you
start<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.760> i'll<00:03:17.760> show<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:18.750> then<00:03:18.780> you're

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
star for now and it will generate a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.690 
star for now and it will generate a
world<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:31.709> don't<00:03:32.250> really<00:03:32.400> need<00:03:32.520> it
