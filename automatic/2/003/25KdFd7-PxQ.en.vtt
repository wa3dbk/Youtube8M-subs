00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
field but yeah they're absolutely doing

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.469

it's<00:01:52.380> crazy<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> transfer

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it's crazy and I think the transfer

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.179 
it's crazy and I think the transfer
markets<00:01:54.840> down<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.259> moment<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.040> going

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
markets down at the moment this is going

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
markets down at the moment this is going
to<00:01:56.250> change<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.729> transfer<00:01:57.090> market<00:01:57.240> forever

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
to change the transfer market forever

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
to change the transfer market forever
it'll<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.409> back<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.159> web<00:01:59.280> app<00:01:59.430> isn't
