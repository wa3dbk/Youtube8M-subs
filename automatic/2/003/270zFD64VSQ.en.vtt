Toby and first and foremost Toby himself

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.100 
Toby and first and foremost Toby himself
is<00:00:44.040> using<00:00:44.340> his<00:00:44.430> old<00:00:44.700> mask<00:00:45.090> but<00:00:45.719> he's<00:00:45.840> actually

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
is using his old mask but he's actually

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.229

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
his sights around all over the place and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.039 
his sights around all over the place and
I<00:01:23.880> couldn't<00:01:24.090> tell<00:01:24.270> who<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.479> fighting<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
I couldn't tell who was fighting it

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.179 
I couldn't tell who was fighting it
first<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.409> i<00:01:25.439> watch<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> trailer<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.979> couple

more<00:01:26.340> times<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.790> paused<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.360> believe

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
more times and I paused it and believe

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.080 
more times and I paused it and believe
it<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.680> hidan<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> actually<00:01:29.790> fighting

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090

it or not hidan is actually fighting
against<00:01:30.540> ten<00:01:30.780> ten<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> at<00:01:32.280> first<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.610> was<00:01:32.729> just

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
against ten ten and at first I was just

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.130 
against ten ten and at first I was just
kind<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.360> has<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
kind of like this has got to be one of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.050 
kind of like this has got to be one of
the<00:01:34.259> weirdest<00:01:34.680> matchups<00:01:35.159> ever<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:35.790> ten

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the weirdest matchups ever because ten

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.249 
the weirdest matchups ever because ten

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
ten who's a character who honestly

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.140 
ten who's a character who honestly
doesn't<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> do<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.130> much<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
doesn't get to do that much and then you

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
doesn't get to do that much and then you
got<00:01:39.270> hidden<00:01:39.479> who's<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.170> batshit<00:01:40.710> crazy

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
got hidden who's this is batshit crazy

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.800 
got hidden who's this is batshit crazy
Akatsuki<00:01:41.790> member<00:01:42.060> who's<00:01:42.210> killed<00:01:42.450> some<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
Akatsuki member who's killed some of the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.999 
Akatsuki member who's killed some of the
most<00:01:42.930> important<00:01:43.320> characters<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> series

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
most important characters in the series

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.730 
most important characters in the series
and<00:01:44.689> but<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.290> fitting<00:01:46.560> because

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and but it is kind of fitting because

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
and but it is kind of fitting because
since<00:01:47.280> he<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> weapon<00:01:47.790> user<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.180> guess<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.509> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
since he is a weapon user I guess it is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
since he is a weapon user I guess it is
you<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.229> making<00:01:49.680> sense<00:01:49.979> he<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.189> fighting

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you know making sense he is fighting

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.490 
you know making sense he is fighting
against<00:01:50.790> ten<00:01:50.939> ten<00:01:51.180> however<00:01:51.990> I've<00:01:52.140> heard<00:01:52.380> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
against ten ten however I've heard that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.870 
against ten ten however I've heard that
actually<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.040> film<00:01:53.250> tens<00:01:53.490> hand<00:01:53.670> can't

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
actually in this film tens hand can't

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.359 
actually in this film tens hand can't
use<00:01:54.180> any<00:01:54.420> weapons<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> be

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
use any weapons so this is going to be

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.830 
use any weapons so this is going to be
an<00:01:56.460> interesting<00:01:56.759> battle<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.509> say<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> least

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
see that she's actually getting up in

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.500 
see that she's actually getting up in
naruto's<00:02:45.340> grill<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> little<00:02:45.940> bit<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.329> looks

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
naruto's grill a little bit it looks

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.420 
naruto's grill a little bit it looks
like<00:02:46.660> he's<00:02:46.900> just<00:02:47.380> really<00:02:47.530> pissed<00:02:47.890> off<00:02:48.099> at<00:02:48.340> him

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
like he's just really pissed off at him

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.339 
like he's just really pissed off at him
again<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.299> is<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.569> a<00:02:49.690> complete<00:02:50.079> you<00:02:50.230> know

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
again this is just a complete you know

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.020 
again this is just a complete you know
180<00:02:50.829> for<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.190> character<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:51.849> just

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
180 for the character and it's just

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.270 
180 for the character and it's just
completely<00:02:52.150> different<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.890> again<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:54.040> think

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
completely different and again I think

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.500 
completely different and again I think
that's<00:02:54.400> going<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:54.640> be<00:02:54.700> interesting<00:02:54.849> to<00:02:55.209> see

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
that's going to be interesting to see

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.660 
that's going to be interesting to see
the<00:02:56.349> biggest<00:02:56.620> part<00:02:56.890> of<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.129> trailer<00:02:57.400> for<00:02:57.549> me

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
the biggest part of the trailer for me

designs you know they all look familiar

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.589 
designs you know they all look familiar
and<00:03:39.549> everything<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.060> they<00:03:40.150> still<00:03:40.329> look<00:03:40.450> nice

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
but it doesn't look like it's taking it

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.050 
but it doesn't look like it's taking it
to<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.269> movie<00:03:43.630> quality<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.440> much<00:03:44.919> but<00:03:45.639> again
