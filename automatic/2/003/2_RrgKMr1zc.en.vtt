00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 what is the change of the

 Federal law on radio and television 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.820
 Today, all households usually pay 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.490
 and do an operational 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.099
 radio and or tv have one 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.590
 reception fee a fee 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.630
 is a sum of money to pay regularly 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.040
 need to in this case, for example 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.910
 to listen to the radio or to watch TV 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.700
 what would change 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.590
 at one year to this template will 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.870
 a general tax for radio and 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.610
 television is introduced so that the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.690
 previous reception fee replaced 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.850
 there are exceptions for example 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.370
 people living in a retirement home or 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.600
 live or for a student dorm 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.829
 company up to a specific one 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.989
 size persons the whole question and 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.970
 have to abstain from television during the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.989
 none for the next five years 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.110
 pay general tax 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.880
 these are the arguments of the proponents 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.250
 thanks to devices like cell phones or tablets 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.570
 everybody can watch TV 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.340
 and listening to the radio 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.470
 that's why it needs a general 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.609
 royalty for radio and television 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.350
 adapted in today's reality 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:17.090
 thanks to the general tax for radio 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.069
 and most need to watch TV 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.069
 households pay less each year 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.859
 What are the opponents' arguments too? 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.439
 households that do not listen to radio or 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.670
 Television must have this general charge 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.049
 pay for radio and television 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.119
 it is very likely that the 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.130
 households for the general levy for 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.270
 radio and watch TV in the next 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.270
 years have to pay more 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.390
 do you want that federal law over 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.609
 radio and television is then accepted 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.969
 Do you agree that you refused ? 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:58.750
 becomes 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:02:00.909
 then you're annoying that 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.219
 his girlfriend will not vote now 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.079
 one of a thousand easy load pickers 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.569
 and motivate them to the Swiss 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.569
 to participate in the elections on 18 october
