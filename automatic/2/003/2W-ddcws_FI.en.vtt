00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.470
 19 meters of high technology and simplicity 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.939
 this apparent contradiction expresses 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.800
 fully the characteristics 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.480
 of the hanse 630 it is in fact a 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.759
 boat that presents sophisticated solutions 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.319
 technology and ideas at the same time 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.319
 very solid and easy to carry 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.540
 extremely accurate from the point of view 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.220
 aesthetic the project favors a 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.440
 Almost important displacement 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.630
 twenty-four tons to insure 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.260
 a soft step on the wave and navigations 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.260
 comfortable and safe 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.630
 sandwich construction 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.430
 epoxy with vacuum system that 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:03.670
 guarantees a decrease in weight 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:05.140
 unit strength and rigidity the system 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.030
 vacuum now represents one 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.800
 high quality construction standard e 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.800
 it also prevents osmosis rices 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.130
 the hull at the height of the rubbish yes 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.950
 folds into a flange that constitutes 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.170
 the hawk this beautiful solution 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.830
 aesthetically it helps to stiffen 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.830
 structure 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.240
 the aluminum tree of the flower at 30 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.450
 meters supports a sail area 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.400
 total of 215 square meters while one 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.440
 ballast of 9 tons and a draft 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:05.409
 of about three meters allow a 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.670
 excellent righting moment the

 electrically windable 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.140
 on the other hand we note the lack of a 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.330
 trust for the beautiful nanda scole

 stop for wind are dimensioned 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:09.030
 generously 4 electric winches are needed 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:13.650
 all the maneuvers the instrumentation 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.900
 electronics is rich and very complete 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.409

 openable 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.170
 we tried 630 anxiety in two 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.160
 days with different wind conditions 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.530
 the impression confirms the good qualities

 bursts a tendency to orgy well 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.320
 contained the boat penalized with airs 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.060
 read from the important displacement 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.300
 offers its best when you exceed i 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.890
 10 knots of real wind then it is enjoyed 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.660
