into<00:00:23.040> the<00:00:24.040> house<00:00:24.250> after<00:00:25.230> seeing<00:00:26.230> me<00:00:26.440> off<00:00:26.619> at

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
into the house after seeing me off at

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.769 
into the house after seeing me off at
the<00:00:26.950> station<00:00:27.160> she<00:00:28.000> looked<00:00:28.210> up<00:00:28.360> at<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:28.630> clock

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.080 
the station she looked up at the clock
that<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.230> clock<00:00:29.470> had<00:00:29.650> stopped<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:33.090> she

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
that the clock had stopped and she

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.710 
that the clock had stopped and she
thought<00:00:34.360> that<00:00:34.420> was<00:00:34.840> an<00:00:35.020> omen<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:37.450> clock

thought that was an omen that the clock

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.860 
thought that was an omen that the clock
said<00:00:38.020> you're<00:00:38.650> going<00:00:38.860> to<00:00:39.040> be<00:00:39.160> killed<00:00:39.430> when<00:00:39.870> the
