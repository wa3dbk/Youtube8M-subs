00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
randomly i order random packs and then

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.090 
randomly i order random packs and then
you<00:00:22.230> know<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> don't<00:00:22.680> even<00:00:22.769> know<00:00:22.920> what<00:00:22.980> I'm

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
so that will give us four videos of my

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.110 
so that will give us four videos of my
math<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.320> correct<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.370> randomly<00:00:35.790> I'm<00:00:36.000> just
