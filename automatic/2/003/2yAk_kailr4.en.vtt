00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.360
 hello to all youtube friends we are here 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:21.970
 with and michele mascolo who has just 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.009
 made top 32 the Italian nationals is a 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.699
 bit of bitterness you have a lot 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.199
 embittered 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.650
 what you played is like arrived in 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.710
 Switzerland 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.440
 and then later in the cross the face with 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.899
 8 11 maybe the first round is now 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.340
 slipper from some or tied one 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.340
 because the third from men were placed 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.470
 and the first I had seen after the second 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.860
 but urges which 300 of Adam came 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.860
 he says evening then I say to my list 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.710
 the unicorn 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.269
 the briano 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.640
 after the roll 2 he tightens two clauses ei 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.229
 two viruses were enough or each 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.300
 so much if I never felt the need 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.340
 of the piece also because the cuts and recycles 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.100
 I always preferred to play armor 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.580
 because I thought I could find so many shadows 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.630
 indeed it did is now granted 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.880
 and giant hawk vanni is basically a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.100
 unicorn 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.530
 a party what not to do from 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.119
 wall street is a 3,000 among cariaci throws 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.890
 down check in or so I don't need to 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.170
 make me even one if they stay 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.170
 therefore triscele briona is enormous 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 after the usual 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.720
 plotting between the flower ledges 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.600
 the problem 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.630
 the gene 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.469
 and triple March 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.850
 I preferred to play the tram instead of 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.890
 theiler because against the shah board 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.780
 frankly to me to be seeing on 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.220
 mathematician comes vomit does not suck 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.259
 and instead with this at least we play the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.670
 part and seraph as they play the 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.950
 mister is less likely to pass 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.110
 first typhoon so I prefer pertini 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.450
 mirrors are huge says too carryovers 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.180
 unfortunately not even one I unfortunately have 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.989
 found four in the cross 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:28.140
 tracing a last turn e 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.140
 after that i found join together 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.470
 as 69 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.349
 a 20 apparently dark look me 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.739
 I looked but I managed to get there 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.739
 always out 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.830
 but in this way preparation is reflected 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.550
 2 route I preferred to play the two e 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.319
 put the third box in mind of this 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.390
 since so many games do not miss you 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.500
 as mistake decay so in the end can 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.790
 be yellow then 26 Jun 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.690
 okay other force protection for you 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.930
 clifford beaks 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.810
 vanity so mistake route stretches 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.810
 it looks like the geckos and asked yes 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.700
 then 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.980
 the game extras 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.440
 12 this usual 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.440
 then a mere wolf 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.560
 one hundred 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:45.910
 the anti- shocks par excellence 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.990
 he had fled to them I didn't want to say what 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.990
 yes enough siena 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.780
 then b side 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.720
 warnings 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.880

 tomorrow the fire two hands of ice 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.920
 giant controlled in these three 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.599
 without this I would never have won 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.870
 against some strike since you 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.910
 they play us at liszt 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.889
