00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.460
 we have rational and irrational numbers 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.260
 i 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.329
 then since in the other groups 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.989
 these two mejía another group malmstrom this classification in one is that we are 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:16.929
 the real numbers 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.929
 real gioconda 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.800
 it's an erre with a line 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.050
 and what are the real numbers the real numbers 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.869
 that rational component estella rational 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.240
 they are all the numbers that we handle 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.470
 as usual 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.190
 taking this table we know that the rationals are divided integers and 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.650
 fractions and the whole are divided into a natural numbers that also 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.930
 I called them positive integers 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.500
 negative integers that is a sect with a negative and being that way is with those 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.170
 three preclassified inés a countermolder whole numbers is he and if 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.720
 they ask me to classify the numbers that are here and that having the 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.530
 classification that real numbers exist 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.780
 and that if I have a positive number I know it's an integer here 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.370
 it looks like that he puts that his natural number or also supports Marquis a 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.680
 positive whole does not matter no 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.950
 this classification then a negative integer 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.110
 it is a sect the n-1 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.080
 x the number pi I know that the number pi that its number and is rational because in 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.840
 your decimal sequence is never going to end 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.590
 it's going to be infinite 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.420
 and also in its representation that exists 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.490
 a period of your numbers will always follow 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 and it will not have a specific order so its number 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.910
 and the rational 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.650
 here is a fraction so the fraction then proposes fractioned 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.590
 number 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.090
 rational 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.090
 but basically propose fractional or less rational 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.140
 here I have point 25 and point 25 is a plus it comes out of a fraction 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.290
 just as we are act 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.980
 belongs 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.570
 to the classification of the rational to full room fraction 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.130
 here the root usually the majority in the roots 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.489
 that are not exact they are called control they get in numbers and you just walk 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.969
 most not all 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.419
 and here I have a number the number is very similar to 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.729
 is a number and the rational because in its sequence 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:26.029
 it's infinite that's never going to end 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.839
 i do not have to be a period so it cost when you find the value of 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:33.829
 this number that two points 71 and less follows you rate you realize that you will never 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.689
 Finish that number in its decimal representation 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.789
 and here we have that there is a period 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:39.469
 zero point
