00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
you know how sometimes an idea pops into

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.070 
you know how sometimes an idea pops into
your<00:00:05.819> head<00:00:07.309> out<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.370> nowhere<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.389> really<00:00:09.809> good

your head out of nowhere a really good
idea<00:00:10.559> just<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.070> Kennedy<00:00:14.750> I'm<00:00:15.770> just<00:00:16.770> curious

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
idea just to Kennedy I'm just curious

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.779 
idea just to Kennedy I'm just curious
how<00:00:19.890> does<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:21.000> brain<00:00:21.830> generate<00:00:22.830> ideas<00:00:25.789> how

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
how does the brain generate ideas how

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.179 
how does the brain generate ideas how
quickly<00:00:28.039> and<00:00:29.039> does<00:00:29.699> an<00:00:29.939> idea<00:00:30.449> become<00:00:31.189> formed

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
quickly and does an idea become formed

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.970 
quickly and does an idea become formed
fully<00:00:32.669> formed<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:34.850> nothing<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.980> an

fully formed go from nothing to be an

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
fully formed go from nothing to be an
intellectual<00:00:38.809> entity<00:00:40.460> sort<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
intellectual entity sort of in in the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.549 
intellectual entity sort of in in the
brain<00:00:43.460> why<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.520> they<00:00:44.879> occur<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.899> knew<00:00:46.140> why

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
brain why do they occur is they knew why

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.850 
brain why do they occur is they knew why
do<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:46.980> seem<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.539> generate<00:00:48.539> from<00:00:48.860> nothing

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
do they seem to generate from nothing

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.410 
do they seem to generate from nothing
how<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:53.390> how<00:00:54.710> how<00:00:55.710> long<00:00:56.070> does<00:00:56.760> does

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
how do we do it how how long does does

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
how do we do it how how long does does
it<00:00:57.660> take<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:59.300> to<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.660> ideas<00:01:01.289> where<00:01:01.770> they

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it take to to have ideas where they

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.840 
it take to to have ideas where they
start<00:01:03.049> one<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> chemicals<00:01:05.129> used<00:01:05.869> in<00:01:07.850> the

start one of the chemicals used in the

start one of the chemicals used in the
formation<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.290> call<00:01:10.560> ideas<00:01:12.200> how<00:01:13.200> did

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
formation of what we call ideas how did

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.340 
formation of what we call ideas how did
I<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> our<00:01:14.159> brain<00:01:14.700> those<00:01:15.630> kinds<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
I get to our brain those kinds of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.120 
I get to our brain those kinds of
questions<00:01:17.659> are<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.960> ones<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.560> thinking

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
questions are the ones I'm thinking

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.050 
questions are the ones I'm thinking
about<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.909> moment<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:22.110> generates<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
about at the moment what generates the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.190 
about at the moment what generates the
creative<00:01:24.060> part<00:01:25.009> of<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:27.150> brain<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.479> causes

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
creative part of the brain that causes

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.100 
creative part of the brain that causes
of<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.070> dream<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.840> ideas<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.799> come<00:01:32.520> up

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
of to dream and have ideas that come up

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.569 
of to dream and have ideas that come up
come<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:35.420> things<00:01:36.860> conceptualized<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.700 

things<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.759> no<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.240> else<00:01:42.600> has<00:01:42.960> thought<00:01:43.439> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
things that no one else has thought of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
things that no one else has thought of
before<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:46.369> genuine<00:01:47.780> discoveries

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
before you know genuine discoveries

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.460 
before you know genuine discoveries
where<00:01:49.290> they<00:01:49.560> come<00:01:49.860> from<00:01:53.090> how<00:01:54.090> how<00:01:54.899> does<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
where they come from how how does the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.520 
where they come from how how does the
brain<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.479> ever<00:01:57.840> wondered<00:01:58.049> about

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
brain do it have you ever wondered about

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.160 
brain do it have you ever wondered about
where<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.310> ideas<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.479> come<00:02:00.840> from

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
where the ideas you have come from

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.630 
where the ideas you have come from
that's<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.909> I'm<00:02:02.960> trying<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.369> get<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that's all I'm trying to get to the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.089 
that's all I'm trying to get to the
bottom<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.520> tell

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
bottom of that here if you can tell

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.020 
bottom of that here if you can tell
point<00:02:11.099> me<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.550> someone<00:02:12.000> else<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.420> can

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
point me to someone else we can

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.130 
point me to someone else we can
that<00:02:15.030> would<00:02:15.209> be<00:02:15.390> very<00:02:15.569> much<00:02:15.689> appreciated

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140
