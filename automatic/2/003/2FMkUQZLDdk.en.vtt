quick and even these are showing that
there's<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.600> max<00:00:48.840> minor<00:00:49.410> activity<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.309> on

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
there's so max minor activity going on

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.700 
there's so max minor activity going on
somewhere<00:00:52.520> all<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.050> this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
somewhere all right now we do have this

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.319 
somewhere all right now we do have this
one<00:00:55.949> buoy<00:00:56.160> still<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.609> the<00:00:56.699> vet<00:00:56.850> mode<00:00:57.030> over<00:00:57.210> here

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
one buoy still in the vet mode over here

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.590 
one buoy still in the vet mode over here
showing<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:58.379> almost<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.129> two<00:00:59.309> meter<00:00:59.520> swing

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.690

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
flies folks now take a look at the

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.430 
flies folks now take a look at the
earthquakes<00:01:28.800> real<00:01:29.039> quick<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:31.080> know<00:01:31.200> there's

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
earthquakes real quick you know there's

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.130 
earthquakes real quick you know there's
been<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.649> lot<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.920> activity<00:01:32.490> since<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.420> seven

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
been a lot of activity since that seven

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.229 
been a lot of activity since that seven
pointer<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.800> that's<00:01:35.069> 6.1<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> reported<00:01:36.149> on

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:36.239 
pointer and that's 6.1 I reported on

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.949 
pointer and that's 6.1 I reported on
earlier<00:01:36.390> we're<00:01:37.319> going<00:01:37.349> to<00:01:37.470> scotia<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:38.959> but

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
earlier we're going to scotia see but

island<00:01:57.959> region<00:01:59.300> see<00:02:00.300> here<00:02:00.450> we're<00:02:00.569> at<00:02:00.599> a<00:02:00.660> 5.7

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
island region see here we're at a 5.7

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.869 
island region see here we're at a 5.7
5.6<00:02:02.369> mid-atlantic<00:02:02.970> ridge<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:07.580> we<00:02:08.580> do<00:02:08.729> have

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
5.6 mid-atlantic ridge and we do have

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.420 
5.6 mid-atlantic ridge and we do have
5.2<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.440> south<00:02:11.160> atlantic<00:02:11.580> ocean<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.860> there's

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
5.2 here south atlantic ocean so there's

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.400 
5.2 here south atlantic ocean so there's
a<00:02:14.520> lot<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.730> activity<00:02:15.360> folks<00:02:15.600> like<00:02:15.870> three<00:02:16.110> pages

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
a lot of activity folks like three pages

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.170 
a lot of activity folks like three pages
just<00:02:17.340> for<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> seven

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
just for the seven

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.979 
just for the seven
me<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:19.590> earthquakes<00:02:23.239> all<00:02:24.239> right<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:24.719> going

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
me of earthquakes all right now going

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.039 
me of earthquakes all right now going
over<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.469> RSO<00:02:25.920> II<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:28.609> click<00:02:29.609> on<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:30.629> thing

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
over to the RSO II I click on this thing

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.580 
over to the RSO II I click on this thing
right<00:02:31.260> here<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:33.090> says<00:02:33.299> sorry<00:02:33.629> we<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.409> no
