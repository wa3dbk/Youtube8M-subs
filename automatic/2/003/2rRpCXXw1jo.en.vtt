00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.059
 hello here his beautiful gauthier 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.410
 intervener the specialist in 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.170
 behavior when the games presented 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.390
 here the l6 of four corners in English 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.090
 then the principle and by sense of having a 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.160
 control over the size of the animal here 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.779
 to avoid having a dog that pulls 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.029
 on the leash it's simply 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.800
 like with horses since 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.140
 at home are powerful we are controlled 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.450
 with the head and with the muzzle one has to 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.700
 result in minimally our next to 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.810
 stay close to zero because he can get 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.520
 throw at the end of the leash 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.260
 and then he can break the vertebrae 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.490
 cervical it's not a small 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
 correction like the choke collar 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.030
 like the one we knew before 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.790

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.870
 well our dog going from the ray and into 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.670
 more than that we are going out a few 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.070

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.110

 to teach our dog appreciated the 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.140
 wearing the veil nor on his nose because 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.460
 it's not necessarily because we 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.929
 we want to tell him that the ubs is the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.020

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.770

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.350
 remove with his part and that's because
