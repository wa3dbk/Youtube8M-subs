00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
around you at jacks on your side against

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.639 
around you at jacks on your side against
atrox<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.840> maybe<00:01:07.079> tell<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.409> bit

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
atrox you maybe tell them a little bit

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.170 
atrox you maybe tell them a little bit
about<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.100> matchup<00:01:08.310> itself<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
about the matchup itself and what you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.050 
about the matchup itself and what you
felt<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.570> into<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.899> game<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.820> yeah<00:01:11.820> so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
felt going into the game with it yeah so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.920 
felt going into the game with it yeah so
I<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.570> Jack's<00:01:12.960> beats<00:01:13.229> atrix<00:01:13.909> but<00:01:14.909> when<00:01:15.750> we

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
I think Jack's beats atrix but when we

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.270 
I think Jack's beats atrix but when we
played<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.320> rock<00:01:16.469> at<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> first<00:01:16.920> time<00:01:17.100> they

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
played was rock at the first time they

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
played was rock at the first time they
played<00:01:17.520> actually<00:01:17.640> Jackson<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.570> played<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
played actually Jackson we played a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.469 
played actually Jackson we played a
drugs<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.500> don't<00:01:20.430> think<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.240> such<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
drugs but I don't think it was such a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.529 
drugs but I don't think it was such a
popular<00:01:21.719> matchup<00:01:22.469> like<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:24.329> had<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
popular matchup like then so we had that

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.090 
popular matchup like then so we had that
part<00:01:24.750> because<00:01:25.079> freddy<00:01:25.500> played<00:01:25.530> at<00:01:25.799> off<00:01:25.920> at

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
part because freddy played at off at

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370 
part because freddy played at off at
rocks<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.149> knew<00:01:27.600> how<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> matchup<00:01:28.170> went

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
rocks so we knew how the matchup went

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.990 
rocks so we knew how the matchup went
and<00:01:28.619> sax<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.189> probably<00:01:29.520> never<00:01:29.640> played<00:01:29.880> with

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and sax is probably never played with

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.990 
and sax is probably never played with
Erics<00:01:30.469> so<00:01:31.469> this<00:01:31.680> time<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.520> matchup<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.939> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
Erics so this time the the matchup is a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.029 
Erics so this time the the matchup is a
lot<00:01:33.149> more<00:01:33.270> trained<00:01:33.659> by<00:01:33.810> both<00:01:33.960> players<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.859> this

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
lot more trained by both players so this

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.490 
lot more trained by both players so this
time<00:01:35.159> Jack<00:01:35.399> speeds<00:01:35.670> aatrox<00:01:36.240> because<00:01:36.659> that's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
time Jack speeds aatrox because that's

if your mid lane is pushing in and your

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.190 
if your mid lane is pushing in and your
bottle<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.200> pushing<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:11.090> like<00:02:12.090> okay<00:02:12.959> let<00:02:13.110> me

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
say different like

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710 
say different like
all<00:02:14.010> three<00:02:14.310> lanes<00:02:14.430> are<00:02:14.610> pushing<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.180> Jax

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
all three lanes are pushing in and Jax

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.760 
all three lanes are pushing in and Jax
is<00:02:15.870> like<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.140> only<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.440> who<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.650> really

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
is like the only one who can really

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.440 
is like the only one who can really
snowball<00:02:17.220> like<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.640> vehicle<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.120> not<00:02:18.150> kind<00:02:18.330> of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
snowball like see vehicle is not kind of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.240 
snowball like see vehicle is not kind of
snow<00:02:18.600> but<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.930> Wayne<00:02:19.140> does<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.830> Jax<00:02:20.069> was

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
snow but like I Wayne does like Jax was

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.190 
snow but like I Wayne does like Jax was
the<00:02:20.340> one<00:02:20.459> who<00:02:20.550> snow<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.090> know<00:02:21.240> that

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
the one who snow but so you know that

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.080 
the one who snow but so you know that
the<00:02:22.770> wukong<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.250> probably<00:02:23.490> gonna<00:02:23.640> gank<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the wukong is probably gonna gank the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.150 
the wukong is probably gonna gank the
lane<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.900> snowball<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.319> most<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:26.040> we

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
lane that can snowball the most so we

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.740 
lane that can snowball the most so we
knew<00:02:26.280> he<00:02:26.430> was<00:02:26.459> probably<00:02:26.790> top<00:02:27.330> all<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.510> time

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
knew he was probably top all the time

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.770 
knew he was probably top all the time
because<00:02:27.990> bottom<00:02:28.680> severe<00:02:29.280> care<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:30.090> really

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
because bottom severe care is really

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.870 
because bottom severe care is really
hard<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.020> kid<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.620> they've<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> speed<00:02:32.670> boost

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
hard to kid like they've a speed boost

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.970 
hard to kid like they've a speed boost
to<00:02:33.120> speed<00:02:33.390> boost<00:02:33.600> actually<00:02:33.990> there<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.380> shield

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
to speed boost actually there for shield

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.040 
to speed boost actually there for shield
and<00:02:35.220> they<00:02:35.430> have<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.730> kale<00:02:35.940> ultimate<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.600> it's

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
and they have the kale ultimate so it's

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.990 
and they have the kale ultimate so it's
really<00:02:37.200> okay<00:02:37.560> Lulu<00:02:38.010> meters<00:02:38.459> where<00:02:38.610> were<00:02:38.790> six

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
really okay Lulu meters where were six

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.990 
really okay Lulu meters where were six
you<00:02:39.780> have<00:02:39.900> no<00:02:40.020> potential<00:02:40.760> looking<00:02:41.760> about<00:02:41.880> the

problem<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.200> only<00:03:13.380> time<00:03:13.620> was<00:03:14.310> when<00:03:14.550> we

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
problem the only time was when we

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.460 
problem the only time was when we
realized<00:03:15.209> we<00:03:15.510> can<00:03:15.660> really<00:03:15.810> Dyson<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.350> we

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
realized we can really Dyson like we

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.140 
realized we can really Dyson like we
normally<00:03:16.590> do<00:03:16.920> normally<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.700> play<00:03:17.850> like<00:03:17.970> any

think we all work really well together
if<00:04:02.340> one<00:04:02.640> thinks<00:04:03.019> something<00:04:04.019> doesn't<00:04:04.290> work<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
if one thinks something doesn't work the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.770 
if one thinks something doesn't work the
other<00:04:04.650> people<00:04:05.340> or<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:06.269> one<00:04:06.450> who<00:04:06.480> plays<00:04:06.750> a

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.030 
champion that doesn't work like you can
see<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.630> reason<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.019> just<00:04:10.170> doesn't<00:04:10.530> go<00:04:10.739> stub

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
see the reason you just doesn't go stub

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.530 
see the reason you just doesn't go stub
on<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.370> like<00:04:11.519> says<00:04:11.850> now<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.030> want<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.329> play<00:04:12.450> this

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
I think it shows do you feel that you

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.440 
I think it shows do you feel that you
have<00:04:17.010> some<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.370> your<00:04:17.489> pressure<00:04:17.760> alleviated

weeks ago you're going i have to pick

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.430 
weeks ago you're going i have to pick
the<00:04:21.180> champion<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.720> can<00:04:21.900> carry<00:04:22.109> with<00:04:22.320> the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
the champion that I can carry with the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.880 
the champion that I can carry with the
most<00:04:22.650> has<00:04:23.039> it<00:04:23.220> change<00:04:23.640> in<00:04:23.789> your<00:04:23.910> mind<00:04:24.150> um<00:04:24.900> we

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
most has it change in your mind um we

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.530 
most has it change in your mind um we
still<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.310> kind<00:04:26.849> of<00:04:26.970> ad

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
still a kind of ad

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.570 
still a kind of ad
but<00:04:28.290> we<00:04:28.500> adapt<00:04:28.920> to<00:04:29.040> different<00:04:29.070> playstyles

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
but we adapt to different playstyles

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.730 
but we adapt to different playstyles
like<00:04:30.000> this<00:04:30.180> game<00:04:30.390> I<00:04:30.630> don't<00:04:31.080> think<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:31.350> was<00:04:31.500> I

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
like this game I don't think I was I

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.380 
like this game I don't think I was I
mean<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.310> did<00:04:32.460> my<00:04:32.610> job<00:04:32.640> but<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:32.970> wasn't<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.360> one

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
mean I did my job but I wasn't the one

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.480 
mean I did my job but I wasn't the one
who<00:04:33.570> carried<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:33.990> was<00:04:34.170> mother<00:04:34.410> jacks<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.460> I

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
who carried it was mother jacks so I

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.160 
who carried it was mother jacks so I
think<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.210> shows<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.450> we<00:04:36.660> can<00:04:36.960> play

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
think it shows that we can play

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.540 
think it shows that we can play
different<00:04:37.320> sites<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.160> know<00:04:38.430> that's

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
different sites and we know that's

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.360 
different sites and we know that's
predictable<00:04:39.000> where<00:04:39.300> before<00:04:40.050> okay<00:04:40.890> Ken<00:04:41.220> he's

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
predictable where before okay Ken he's
