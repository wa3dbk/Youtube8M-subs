think it really won't take too much time
to<00:00:24.180> do<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> however<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.369> mean<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.730> course

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
to do it however the I mean of course

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.509 
to do it however the I mean of course
this<00:00:27.029> kind<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.300> looks<00:00:27.449> unnatural<00:00:27.920> I<00:00:28.920> mean<00:00:29.070> it's

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
this kind of looks unnatural I mean it's

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.669 
this kind of looks unnatural I mean it's
not<00:00:29.580> really<00:00:29.970> common<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:31.050> there's<00:00:31.230> random

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
not really common that there's random

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.670 
not really common that there's random
lava<00:00:32.189> coming<00:00:32.640> out<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.480> village<00:00:34.170> over<00:00:34.440> here

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
so you can put it somewhere where it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.139 
so you can put it somewhere where it
looks<00:00:36.840> more<00:00:37.050> natural<00:00:37.489> maybe<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.640> guys<00:00:38.760> fine

make a base Sophia base right here so

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.069 
make a base Sophia base right here so
we'll<00:01:34.049> dig<00:01:34.259> out<00:01:34.490> make<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.820> right<00:01:35.970> here

here I'm gonna sign below that one
blocks<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.600> Block<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:15.959> between<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.770> with

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
blocks on the Block in between and with

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.830 
blocks on the Block in between and with
that<00:02:16.890> block<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.310> between<00:02:17.670> once<00:02:18.600> throw<00:02:18.750> a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
that block in between once throw a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
it's going to be right in this block and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.449 
it's going to be right in this block and
it<00:03:00.840> looks<00:03:01.050> like<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.380> lava<00:03:01.650> i<00:03:01.860> can<00:03:02.160> i'll
