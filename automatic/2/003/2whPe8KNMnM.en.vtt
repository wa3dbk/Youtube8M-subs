00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.259
 oh yes sorry you're here for the video you 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.500
 while helicopter on bf 4 me 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.500
 Let's go 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.550
 so to start you go 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.050
 directly in the test center or 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.610
 training center if you prefer 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.190
 and there you will directly change the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.060
 reconnaissance helicopter class 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.220
 personally I recommend this 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.440
 configuration namely the barrels of 25 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.510
 mm that do a lot of damage on 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.800
 infantry the infrared emission for 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.570
 get rid of helicopters 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.770
 enemies including jammers cme 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.360
 which will give you enough time to 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.180
 go hide yourself if you are ugly 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.920
 and the stealth coating that will you 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.510
 to save time 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.090
 before being blocked by a helicopter 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.530
 and a particular half pass this step there 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.690
 you just spawn in the helicopter 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.880
 recognition and there is no 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.619
 secret you have to train what counts 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.030
 it's maneuverability and precision 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.979
 keep in mind that the vertical view 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.720
 is inverted although configurable in 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.340
 the options of the game you have to know how to be 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.630
 versatile and thus adapt to 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.220
 various situations as I tell you 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.990
 shows in the exercises here present 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.729
 ground infantry attack in the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.990
 buildings or various hiding places 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.399
 do not forget the attacks on 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.930
 land or sea vehicles well 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.000
 obviously as well as vehicles 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.399
 airplanes that you often pose problem 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.600
 during multiplayer games this is the 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.490
 moment to put into practice your 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.650
 training directly on the field 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.540
 in multiplayer so the first thing to 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.790
 to do when you're flying it's 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.560
 get rid of the chopper immediately 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.479
 and a half to be quiet for you 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.920
 to occupy the infantry attempted to 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.180
 surprise from behind and wait 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.400
 that he first sent these lures 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.950
 infrared or cme before sending your 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.260
 own pool ended the next with 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.760
 the 25 mm barrel if necessary knowing 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.600
 that two missiles are not enough to 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.600
 destroy a helicopter 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.820
 good in the ideal is to be with one or 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.320
 two friends of your squad in 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.970
 the helicopter who will have taken good care of 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.290
 choose the engineer class with the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.270
 blowtorch obviously for you 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.710
 repair in case of damage if you are 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.390
 alone then I invite you to test the 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.460
 famous system d ie change of 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.930
 place and do it yourself in full flight 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.280
 to then leave quietly 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.780
 attention it's sometimes at risk a 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.370
 time that is worth their scramble at the heart are 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.720
 active and you will be unprotected 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.830
 against guided missiles put during 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.750
 about 20 seconds 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.980
 you have to run away from your opponents 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.630
 hiding behind the buildings on 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.150
 sneaking between these for 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.800
 avoid the long and night this 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.650
 technique can also be applied for 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.150
 surprise your opponents that's it 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.040
 you just have to do real things 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.060
 killings on the infantry for you 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.560
 to do the hand I recommend you 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.010
 maps flooded areas and go to 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.570
 dawn 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.489
 I hope this tutorial can help you 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.540
 and as my grandmother used to say in 1822 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.190
 it is by forging that one becomes 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.610
 baker I would tell you a next 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.610
 kisses
