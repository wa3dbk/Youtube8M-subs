instructions and the large contents of
the<00:00:40.039> box<00:00:40.250> here<00:00:40.609> so<00:00:40.789> here's<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:41.839> heatsink<00:00:42.199> and

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
the box here so here's the heatsink and

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.020 
the box here so here's the heatsink and
fan<00:00:45.010> comes<00:00:46.010> with<00:00:46.190> thermal<00:00:46.489> paste<00:00:46.670> already

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030

heatsink and fan on there and lock it

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:54.520 
heatsink and fan on there and lock it
down<00:00:53.269> and<00:00:53.629> you're<00:00:53.749> good<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:53.899> go<00:00:53.960> if<00:00:54.409> you're

down and you're good to go if you're

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.759 
down and you're good to go if you're
gonna<00:00:54.649> use<00:00:54.829> an<00:00:54.949> aftermarket<00:00:55.780> CPU<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:56.929> fan<00:00:57.170> not

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
gonna use an aftermarket CPU and fan not

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.309 
gonna use an aftermarket CPU and fan not
all<00:00:58.039> aftermarkets<00:01:00.519> CPU<00:01:01.749> coolers<00:01:02.749> come<00:01:03.050> with

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
all aftermarkets CPU coolers come with

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.259 
all aftermarkets CPU coolers come with
thermal<00:01:04.129> paste<00:01:04.280> apply<00:01:04.550> clip<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:04.909> you<00:01:05.000> may<00:01:05.150> have

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
thermal paste apply clip so you may have

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.270 
thermal paste apply clip so you may have
to<00:01:05.390> buy<00:01:05.510> a<00:01:05.540> thermal<00:01:05.840> paste<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:07.100> get<00:01:07.250> a

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
to buy a thermal paste to get a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.960 
to buy a thermal paste to get a
comparison<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:09.250> this<00:01:10.250> one<00:01:10.490> here<00:01:10.820> is<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:12.970> stock

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
comparison of this one here is a stock

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.310 
comparison of this one here is a stock
phenom<00:01:15.940> heatsink<00:01:16.940> and<00:01:17.030> fan<00:01:17.120> so<00:01:17.840> you<00:01:18.020> can<00:01:18.170> see

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
phenom heatsink and fan so you can see

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.569 
phenom heatsink and fan so you can see
the<00:01:18.440> difference<00:01:18.830> here

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.999 

of<00:01:24.880> course<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.329> Phenom<00:01:25.840> one<00:01:26.109> is<00:01:26.259> fairly<00:01:26.679> heavy

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
of course the Phenom one is fairly heavy

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.630 
of course the Phenom one is fairly heavy
and<00:01:27.549> these<00:01:27.700> are<00:01:27.939> really<00:01:28.450> light<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
and these are really light the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.029 
and these are really light the
efficiency<00:01:31.179> of<00:01:31.450> these<00:01:31.750> have<00:01:32.229> been<00:01:32.439> decent<00:01:32.649> I

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
efficiency of these have been decent I

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.160 
efficiency of these have been decent I
haven't<00:01:33.399> really<00:01:33.640> seen<00:01:33.880> too<00:01:34.329> much<00:01:34.539> improvement

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
haven't really seen too much improvement

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.219 
haven't really seen too much improvement
between<00:01:35.289> the<00:01:35.590> two<00:01:36.149> these<00:01:37.149> chips<00:01:37.479> are<00:01:37.689> fairly

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
between the two these chips are fairly

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.429 
between the two these chips are fairly
cool<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:39.450> you're<00:01:40.450> not<00:01:40.600> really<00:01:40.810> worried<00:01:41.259> about

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
cool so you're not really worried about

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.719 
cool so you're not really worried about
if<00:01:41.710> of<00:01:42.310> course<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:43.390> you're<00:01:43.600> using<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:44.729> cool

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
if of course if you're using the cool

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.760 
if of course if you're using the cool
and<00:01:45.880> quiet<00:01:46.090> feature<00:01:47.079> that<00:01:47.319> comes<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.679> the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
and quiet feature that comes in the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.179 
and quiet feature that comes in the
board's<00:01:49.020> you're<00:01:50.020> gonna<00:01:50.140> be<00:01:50.350> using<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.860> lot<00:01:51.009> less

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
board's you're gonna be using a lot less

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.249 
board's you're gonna be using a lot less
power<00:01:51.429> and<00:01:51.850> they're<00:01:52.149> not<00:01:52.270> they<00:01:52.869> don't<00:01:53.049> run

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
power and they're not they don't run

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.630 
power and they're not they don't run
real<00:01:53.439> warm<00:01:53.709> so<00:01:54.270> bear<00:01:55.270> that<00:01:55.299> in<00:01:55.509> mind
