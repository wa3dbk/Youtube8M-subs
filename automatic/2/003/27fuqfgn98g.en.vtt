them<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.719> know<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:04.049> them<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.680> flow<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
them as you know about them they flow a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.010 
them as you know about them they flow a
ton<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.369> air<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:06.060> bring<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.630> air<00:01:06.810> into

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
ton of air they bring a lot of air into

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.810 
ton of air they bring a lot of air into
the<00:01:07.200> motor<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.650> you're<00:01:08.010> allowed<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> lot

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the motor so you're allowed to get a lot

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880 
the motor so you're allowed to get a lot
of<00:01:08.850> air<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.689> thus<00:01:10.229> increasing<00:01:10.799> your

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
of air out in it thus increasing your

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460 
of air out in it thus increasing your
horsepower<00:01:11.450> inside<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.689> they<00:01:12.900> actually<00:01:13.290> use

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
horsepower inside this they actually use

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.010 
horsepower inside this they actually use
a<00:01:13.500> noob<00:01:13.770> entry<00:01:14.220> system<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.689> actually

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
a noob entry system that is actually

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.450 
a noob entry system that is actually
mounted<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.470> inside<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> cover<00:01:17.189> and

mounted to the inside of the cover and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.760 
mounted to the inside of the cover and
it<00:01:17.790> really<00:01:18.060> snorkels<00:01:18.689> down<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> real<00:01:19.500> flying

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it really snorkels down to a real flying

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.410 
it really snorkels down to a real flying
point<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.310> that's<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.180> this

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
point what that's going to do is as this

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
point what that's going to do is as this
air<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.840> coming<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.009> where<00:01:23.130> you're

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
air is coming in this is where you're

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.770 
air is coming in this is where you're
going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> increase<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:24.330> horsepower

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
going to increase your your horsepower

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.630 
going to increase your your horsepower
the<00:01:25.350> air<00:01:25.470> comes<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> passes<00:01:26.340> through<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the air comes in passes through the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.429 
the air comes in passes through the
element<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> element<00:01:27.210> does<00:01:27.689> its<00:01:27.900> job<00:01:28.140> gets

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
element the element does its job gets

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.870 
element the element does its job gets
all<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> debris<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.009> lets<00:01:29.400> all<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> air

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
all the debris out lets all that air

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880 
all the debris out lets all that air
through<00:01:30.240> well<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.049> cone<00:01:31.350> feature<00:01:31.650> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
through well now this cone feature is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.140 
through well now this cone feature is
actually<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.400> take<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.000> air

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
actually going to take all of the air

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.330 
actually going to take all of the air
and<00:01:33.450> really<00:01:33.930> tighten<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.500> increase
