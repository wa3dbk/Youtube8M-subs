thing<00:00:26.279> I'm<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.760> drain<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> oil

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
thing I'm going to do this drain the oil

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.810 
thing I'm going to do this drain the oil
out<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.800> turned<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.130> its<00:00:29.279> side<00:00:29.310> during

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
out of it just turned on its side during

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.639 
out of it just turned on its side during
into<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.349> an<00:00:31.349> approved<00:00:31.800> bucket<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:33.469> think<00:00:34.469> she

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
into a an approved bucket I think she

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.450 
into a an approved bucket I think she
pretty<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> new<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.640> there

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
pretty with a new one on there

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.240 
pretty with a new one on there
yessiree

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250

but<00:00:41.270> basically<00:00:42.500> we're<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.890> zip<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
but basically we're going to zip this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.869 
but basically we're going to zip this
stump<00:00:45.000> off<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.280> we'll<00:00:47.280> take<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> look<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
stump off and we'll take a look at the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.779 
stump off and we'll take a look at the
crank<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.360> we'll<00:00:48.450> take<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> look<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> Sun

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
crank and we'll take a look at the Sun

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.430 
crank and we'll take a look at the Sun
so<00:00:50.789> bear<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.030> me<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.570> we'll<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so bear with me and we'll see what it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
so bear with me and we'll see what it
looks<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.250> minute<00:00:53.629> let's<00:00:54.629> go

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
looks like there just a minute let's go

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.010 
looks like there just a minute let's go
ahead<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.230> start<00:00:55.710> removing<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> Sun<00:00:56.550> bolts

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
ahead and start removing the Sun bolts

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:32.289 
ahead and start removing the Sun bolts
there<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.079> 12<00:00:58.350> millimeters

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:02:12.250 

now<00:02:08.860> there's<00:02:09.860> those<00:02:10.759> are<00:02:11.030> deep<00:02:11.540> grooves<00:02:12.049> in

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
now there's those are deep grooves in

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.380 
now there's those are deep grooves in
that<00:02:12.440> crankshaft<00:02:13.250> up<00:02:13.730> there<00:02:15.970> I'm<00:02:16.970> gonna<00:02:17.120> stop

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
that crankshaft up there I'm gonna stop

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.170 
that crankshaft up there I'm gonna stop
right<00:02:17.569> here<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.310> kind<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.579> let<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.030> look

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
right here and kind of just let you look

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.289 
right here and kind of just let you look
at<00:02:20.329> this<00:02:20.540> frame<00:02:21.319> right<00:02:21.560> quick<00:02:21.769> it's<00:02:22.670> if<00:02:23.060> you

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
at this frame right quick it's if you

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.300 
at this frame right quick it's if you
look<00:02:23.540> at<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.840> discoloration<00:02:24.530> right<00:02:25.069> above

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
look at the discoloration right above

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.539 
look at the discoloration right above
the<00:02:25.489> crank<00:02:25.790> gear<00:02:26.650> that's<00:02:27.650> where<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.370> heat

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
the crank gear that's where the heat

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.850 
the crank gear that's where the heat
transfer<00:02:29.060> goes<00:02:29.090> whenever<00:02:30.019> you<00:02:30.260> start<00:02:30.530> rubbing

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
transfer goes whenever you start rubbing

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.550 
transfer goes whenever you start rubbing
from<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.370> crankshaft<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.569> sump<00:02:32.959> without

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
from the crankshaft to the sump without

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.879 
from the crankshaft to the sump without
any<00:02:33.709> oil<00:02:33.799> so<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:35.239> discoloration<00:02:36.079> should<00:02:36.709> not

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:36.889 
any oil so this discoloration should not

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.729 
any oil so this discoloration should not
be<00:02:37.040> there<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:38.780> due<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.200> lack<00:02:39.530> of

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
be there and it's due to a lack of

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:53.410 
be there and it's due to a lack of
lubrication<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:51.350> whenever<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:52.180> gets<00:02:53.180> run

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
lubrication so whenever that gets run

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.280 
lubrication so whenever that gets run
low<00:02:53.600> on<00:02:53.630> oil

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
low on oil

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.069 
low on oil
that's<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.220> very<00:02:55.459> first<00:02:55.760> part<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.420> gets<00:02:56.900> the

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
that's the very first part that gets the

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.970 
that's the very first part that gets the
hottest<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:59.720> will<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.440> wear<00:03:00.709> that

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
hottest and it will just wear that

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.920 
hottest and it will just wear that
sucker<00:03:01.340> out<00:03:01.370> like<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.060> said<00:03:02.090> in<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.599> video

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
sucker out like I said in the video

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.030 
sucker out like I said in the video
before<00:03:03.400> or<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.579> last<00:03:04.760> video<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.829> you<00:03:06.829> could

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
before or my last video it you could

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.120 
before or my last video it you could
also<00:03:07.220> wear<00:03:07.549> these<00:03:07.700> out<00:03:07.970> by<00:03:08.150> using<00:03:08.630> an

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
also wear these out by using an

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.550 
also wear these out by using an
unbalanced<00:03:10.130> blade<00:03:10.400> or<00:03:11.019> possibly<00:03:12.019> bearing<00:03:12.440> to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
unbalanced blade or possibly bearing to

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.110 
unbalanced blade or possibly bearing to
go<00:03:12.650> out<00:03:12.799> because<00:03:13.340> there's<00:03:13.609> a<00:03:13.700> bearing<00:03:13.970> that

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
go out because there's a bearing that

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.150 
go out because there's a bearing that
rides<00:03:14.359> here<00:03:14.660> or<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.870> roller<00:03:15.530> bearing<00:03:15.950> or<00:03:16.130> a

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
rides here or a roller bearing or a

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.270 
rides here or a roller bearing or a
radial<00:03:17.000> ball<00:03:17.209> bearing<00:03:17.569> here<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.169> here

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
radial ball bearing here and here

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.319 
radial ball bearing here and here
for<00:03:19.880> that<00:03:20.060> for<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.079> clutch<00:03:21.730> but<00:03:22.730> when<00:03:23.209> those

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
for that for the clutch but when those

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.210 
for that for the clutch but when those
bearings<00:03:23.750> go<00:03:23.900> out<00:03:24.079> they<00:03:24.349> can<00:03:24.530> lock<00:03:24.709> up<00:03:25.010> and

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
bearings go out they can lock up and

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.559 
bearings go out they can lock up and
just<00:03:25.970> wreak<00:03:26.180> havoc<00:03:26.540> on<00:03:26.720> this<00:03:27.530> crankshaft<00:03:28.569> but

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
just wreak havoc on this crankshaft but

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.099 
just wreak havoc on this crankshaft but
I<00:03:29.930> know<00:03:30.560> this<00:03:30.829> was<00:03:31.450> simple<00:03:32.450> them<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.840> point

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
I know this was simple them to the point

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.280 
I know this was simple them to the point
but<00:03:33.650> just<00:03:34.340> kind<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.549> give<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.790> an<00:03:34.880> idea<00:03:35.290> what

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
but just kind of give you an idea what

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.890 
but just kind of give you an idea what
would<00:03:36.440> happen<00:03:36.470> if<00:03:36.889> you<00:03:37.010> run<00:03:37.250> in

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
would happen if you run in

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.800 
would happen if you run in
low<00:03:38.260> on<00:03:38.500> oil<00:03:38.849> when<00:03:39.849> I<00:03:39.879> drained<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.360> oil<00:03:40.420> while

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
low on oil when I drained the oil while

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.660 
low on oil when I drained the oil while
ago<00:03:41.049> on<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.290> end<00:03:41.439> of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.590> table

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
ago on the end of the table

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.910 
ago on the end of the table
I<00:03:42.700> didn't<00:03:43.480> drain<00:03:43.659> very<00:03:43.870> much<00:03:44.170> out<00:03:44.379> so<00:03:44.709> and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
I didn't drain very much out so and

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.569
