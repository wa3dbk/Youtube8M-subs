very<00:01:11.020> logical<00:01:11.229> move<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.100> until<00:01:12.909> I<00:01:13.240> play

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
very logical move and until I play

Bishop<00:01:13.930> axis<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.939> i<00:01:15.939> found<00:01:16.390> that<00:01:16.560> he<00:01:17.560> played

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329

Bishop axis and i found that he played
cities<00:01:19.329> and<00:01:19.600> greenish<00:01:20.140> voice<00:01:20.409> is<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:22.570> very

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
cities and greenish voice is not very

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.499 
cities and greenish voice is not very
natural<00:01:23.259> I<00:01:23.439> think<00:01:24.009> I<00:01:24.070> would<00:01:24.280> play<00:01:24.520> 27<00:01:25.359> with

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
natural I think I would play 27 with

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.560 
natural I think I would play 27 with
black<00:01:25.750> but<00:01:26.109> it's<00:01:26.979> okay<00:01:27.219> he<00:01:27.399> has<00:01:27.969> the<00:01:28.149> idea<00:01:28.420> to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
black but it's okay he has the idea to

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.760 
black but it's okay he has the idea to
frost<00:01:29.049> me<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.380> change<00:01:29.560> on<00:01:30.159> g7<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:31.119> think<00:01:31.960> its<00:01:32.469> tip

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
frost me to change on g7 I think its tip

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.999 
frost me to change on g7 I think its tip
should<00:01:33.039> be<00:01:33.420> equally<00:01:34.420> way<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:35.320> say<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:35.649> had<00:01:35.979> a

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
should be equally way and I say I had a

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.219 
should be equally way and I say I had a
solid<00:01:36.280> position<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:37.149> maybe<00:01:37.659> slightly<00:01:37.990> better

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
solid position and maybe slightly better

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.440 
solid position and maybe slightly better
I<00:01:38.560> had<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:38.950> center<00:01:39.340> and

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
I had the center and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.730 
I had the center and
I<00:01:40.530> blackwell<00:01:41.530> III<00:01:41.890> through<00:01:42.250> FB<00:01:42.430> i--<00:01:42.610> h3

queenly<00:01:44.740> seven<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.399> listen<00:01:46.240> looks<00:01:46.689> like<00:01:46.899> very

natural<00:01:47.829> move<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.369> think<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:49.119> should<00:01:49.299> be

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
natural move and I think that should be

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.740 
natural move and I think that should be
should<00:01:50.259> be<00:01:50.289> close<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.770> equality<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.719> here<00:01:52.719> I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
should be close to equality and here I

and<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.840> think<00:02:49.989> he<00:02:50.620> has<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.220> play<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.910> five

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
and so I think he has to play you five

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.280 
and so I think he has to play you five
because<00:02:52.540> if<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.900> XD<00:02:53.290> 5<00:02:53.560> 30<00:02:53.859> takes<00:02:54.190> d5<00:02:54.670> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
because if it XD 5 30 takes d5 and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.720 
because if it XD 5 30 takes d5 and
natalie<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.350> not<00:02:56.560> working<00:02:56.920> because<00:02:57.069> of<00:02:57.459> this

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
natalie is not working because of this

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
natalie is not working because of this
is<00:02:59.010> proof<00:03:00.010> test

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
is proof test

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.810 
is proof test
yes<00:03:02.350> protect<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.100> true<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.460> this<00:03:03.610> is

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
yes protect this is true that this is

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.500 
yes protect this is true that this is
maybe<00:03:04.360> one<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> little<00:03:04.840> piece<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:06.240> yeah<00:03:07.240> i

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
maybe one a little piece of it yeah i

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.900 
maybe one a little piece of it yeah i
think<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.200> one

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.950 

so<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.330> think<00:03:15.690> hip<00:03:16.290> like<00:03:16.560> quite<00:03:17.340> correctly<00:03:17.960> 592

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
so I think hip like quite correctly 592

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.250 
so I think hip like quite correctly 592
and<00:03:19.970> here<00:03:20.970> i<00:03:21.000> think<00:03:21.240> its<00:03:21.510> position<00:03:22.050> of<00:03:22.170> the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
and here i think its position of the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.250 
and here i think its position of the
better<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.740> why<00:03:22.860> because<00:03:23.220> with<00:03:23.790> this<00:03:24.260> pawn

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
better for why because with this pawn

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.400 
better for why because with this pawn
structure<00:03:26.180> black<00:03:27.180> must<00:03:27.450> put<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.810> night<00:03:28.230> on

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
structure black must put it night on

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.310 
structure black must put it night on
this<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.770> but<00:03:29.460> in<00:03:29.970> this<00:03:30.120> case<00:03:30.390> he<00:03:30.660> doesn't<00:03:31.080> have

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
this is but in this case he doesn't have

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.770 
this is but in this case he doesn't have
time<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.680> move<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.160> neither<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:34.550> okay<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.820> if<00:03:36.570> I

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
time to move is neither so okay and if I

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.840 
time to move is neither so okay and if I
can<00:03:36.990> keep<00:03:37.170> my<00:03:37.350> night<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.740> it's<00:03:38.250> better<00:03:38.550> for

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
can keep my night is it's better for

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.570 
can keep my night is it's better for
white<00:03:39.000> because<00:03:39.360> it's<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.500> woman<00:03:40.770> i<00:03:40.860> can<00:03:41.070> create

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
white because it's a woman i can create

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.820 
white because it's a woman i can create
thread<00:03:42.240> on<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:43.010> inside<00:03:44.960> so<00:03:45.960> i<00:03:45.990> think<00:03:46.200> he

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
thread on the inside so i think he

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.980 
thread on the inside so i think he
decided<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.400> trade<00:03:48.150> sorry<00:03:48.420> tried<00:03:48.810> it

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
decided to trade sorry tried it

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.960 
decided to trade sorry tried it
everything<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.770> then<00:03:50.010> we<00:03:50.070> get<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.460> position

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
everything and then we get this position

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.300 
everything and then we get this position
yes<00:03:51.330> i<00:03:51.600> think<00:03:51.630> he<00:03:51.930> traded<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.500> through<00:03:53.130> minor

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
yes i think he traded to through minor

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.990 
yes i think he traded to through minor
pieces<00:03:53.900> it's<00:03:54.900> fine<00:03:55.260> because<00:03:55.650> after<00:03:56.610> this<00:03:56.760> is

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
pieces it's fine because after this is

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.130 
pieces it's fine because after this is
it<00:03:57.330> looks<00:03:57.570> like<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.460> equal<00:04:00.420> eyes<00:04:00.690> because

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
it looks like is that equal eyes because

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.520 
it looks like is that equal eyes because
you<00:04:01.350> know<00:04:01.470> what<00:04:02.010> has<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.960> protectors<00:04:03.960> passport

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
you know what has a protectors passport

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.810 
you know what has a protectors passport
but<00:04:05.540> well<00:04:06.540> let<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> solid<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.530> that's<00:04:08.250> not<00:04:08.520> not

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
but well let a solid and that's not not

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.720 
but well let a solid and that's not not
so<00:04:08.970> many<00:04:09.180> pieces<00:04:09.420> left<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.680> think<00:04:10.800> when<00:04:11.550> was

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
so many pieces left so I think when was

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.190 
so many pieces left so I think when was
the<00:04:11.910> critical<00:04:12.090> mistake<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.620> think<00:04:15.200> okay

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
the critical mistake and I think okay

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.580 
the critical mistake and I think okay
just<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.530> few<00:04:16.560> move<00:04:16.980> later<00:04:17.280> he<00:04:17.640> play<00:04:17.940> in<00:04:18.380> f8<00:04:19.380> I

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
just a few move later he play in f8 I

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.270 
just a few move later he play in f8 I
say<00:04:19.980> this<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.310> first<00:04:20.730> mistake

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.260 

well<00:04:24.280> okay<00:04:24.639> let's<00:04:25.030> say<00:04:25.180> if<00:04:25.330> we<00:04:25.449> trade<00:04:25.780> on<00:04:26.320> rook

would be this position without the
queens<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.449> board<00:04:52.750> would<00:04:53.169> it<00:04:53.350> be<00:04:53.500> a

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
queens and the board would it be a

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.409 
queens and the board would it be a
drawer<00:04:53.919> or<00:04:53.949> would<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.430> have<00:04:54.610> chances<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.090> win

one<00:06:03.370> has<00:06:03.520> to<00:06:03.580> bring<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.389> King<00:06:04.750> to<00:06:05.050> to<00:06:05.530> the

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
one has to bring the King to to the

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.850 
one has to bring the King to to the
green<00:06:05.889> side<00:06:06.180> can<00:06:07.180> everyone<00:06:07.539> to<00:06:07.900> see<00:06:08.289> far<00:06:08.530> okay

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
green side can everyone to see far okay

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.219 
green side can everyone to see far okay
but<00:06:09.130> you<00:06:09.430> know<00:06:09.759> it's<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.270> Queen<00:06:10.660> ending<00:06:10.990> and

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
but you know it's the Queen ending and

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.060 
but you know it's the Queen ending and
there's<00:06:12.070> a<00:06:12.190> lot<00:06:12.370> of<00:06:12.400> chicks<00:06:12.820> on<00:06:13.389> the<00:06:13.449> chance

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
there's a lot of chicks on the chance

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.710 
there's a lot of chicks on the chance
it's<00:06:15.070> not<00:06:15.340> not<00:06:15.550> so<00:06:15.699> simple<00:06:16.050> but<00:06:17.050> I<00:06:17.110> see<00:06:18.630> okay<00:06:19.630> in

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
it's not not so simple but I see okay in

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.110 
it's not not so simple but I see okay in
the<00:06:19.810> game<00:06:20.020> is<00:06:20.229> his<00:06:20.620> main<00:06:20.650> mistake<00:06:21.250> was<00:06:21.280> route

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
the game is his main mistake was route

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.860 
the game is his main mistake was route
35<00:06:22.630> I<00:06:23.250> guess<00:06:24.250> I<00:06:24.550> think<00:06:25.060> because<00:06:25.240> if<00:06:25.539> I<00:06:25.660> was

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
35 I guess I think because if I was

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.010 
35 I guess I think because if I was
doing<00:06:26.229> better<00:06:26.320> move<00:06:28.440> okay<00:06:29.440> if<00:06:30.300> if<00:06:31.300> BTC<00:06:31.810> far<00:06:31.990> i

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
doing better move okay if if BTC far i

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.070 
doing better move okay if if BTC far i
