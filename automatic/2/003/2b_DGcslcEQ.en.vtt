00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.650
 I already have more here but time started 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.870
 with one has several types of pokémon 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.210
 different from think of four days 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.340
 difference because I do not know where I started 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.860

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.379
 Corn got the support 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.520
 the recall he the north already got and I go 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.930
 show how the mechanism works 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 the game you click on the maps and see for 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.739
 where a step here that the guys I 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.890
 I went in another day that was excited 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.400
 even then I'm going to go on a map of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.350
 Fire here, I think this one in the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.570
 state has fallen and if there is still a bit 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.729
 This is my affection you can not 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.610
 see your friends moving 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.150
 But you move around here, you just leave. 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.799
 Clicking here you will walk and here 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.850
 you will appear in your costs because 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.130
 mousy 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.000

 I'm going to get the bug and here it is. 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.509
 basically this one has buying time 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.640
 different here below your items by 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.850
 For example, I'm going to attack as usual. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 that someone played pokémon knows how it is that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.170
 It does this scheme to capture left 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.820
 as weak as possible 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.380
 then you come on the streets because good 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.780

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.710

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.520
