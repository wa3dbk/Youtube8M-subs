 welcome to new intimate channel in 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.719
 dot it today we had the special 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.020

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.789
 well we have the unboxing of the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.150
 a brake that will be available in 13 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.130
 November for PC 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.779
 as you can see in the collector's 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.550
 edition in world of warcraft shows up 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.619
 how to protect the title with the former 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.750
 presents stabilizing has long ago 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 so we have this heavy box in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.910
 cardboard this time casting a gray 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:45.420
 anthracite that presents the title in front 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.870
 on the title page presents the name when 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.239
 giuliana forca soil collector's edition 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 in this way it will be very similar to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.570
 other collector's that can also 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.629
 be lined up like a real e 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.579
 own library and this is the back 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.660
 of our packaging 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.890
 but let's find out what's there 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.960
 inside inside presents 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.310
 immediately our angel's eyes a 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.299
 fantastic classic artbooks of the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.710
 collector's of world of warcraft 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.990
 in this case the book is 160 pages 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.430
 in which they could see all the new ones 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.900
 stations of the new pizza title 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.259
 entertainment 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.390
 so as you can see the title is in 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.860
 English ie in the English language but 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.250
 I do n't think the problem is that much 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.380
 the writings are very few and all 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.450
 is based on the hundred images without 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.049
 pages of illustrations by art designers 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.049
 the title 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.750
 the usual date that atlus kacem 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.610
 programs present in all others 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.980
 when it is like believing then 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.870
 really substantial as on the 160 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.869
 pages the cover also excellent 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.630
 invoice as tag projection 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:13.640
 resistant, perfect aegis, in short, like 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.070
 as usual we now find the mouse pad 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.770
 of world of warcraft also present 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.310
 in other collector's of the same series 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.150
 with a new monster on the cover like 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.500
 warlord but not present 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.080
 in the edition of watch forecast good 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.459
 39 but now we come to the strong stage 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.140
 of the limited 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:39.260
 as you can see here we have the title 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.600
 have a pack inside we would have 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.850
 three types of game but you can well see 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:50.060
 they are even three and who like 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.299
 always so that they can show you 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.670
 because another download it then a guide 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.400

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.600

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.590
