reloading<00:01:01.219> though<00:01:01.370> added<00:01:01.820> some<00:01:02.000> realism<00:01:02.269> even

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
reloading though added some realism even

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:03.999 
reloading though added some realism even
though<00:01:02.809> it<00:01:02.899> was<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.110> opposite<00:01:03.409> of<00:01:03.530> reloading

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
though it was the opposite of reloading

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.800

for<00:01:04.129> real<00:01:04.339> primal<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:04.940> everybody<00:01:05.330> go<00:01:05.600> how'd<00:01:05.780> it

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
for real primal is everybody go how'd it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.510 
for real primal is everybody go how'd it
go<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.320> you'll<00:01:06.440> be<00:01:06.500> shooting<00:01:06.679> at<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.100> thing

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
and then to reload you'd actually shoot

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.719 
and then to reload you'd actually shoot
off<00:01:08.840> screen<00:01:09.320> bring<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:10.310> back

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
on the person yeah automatically it was

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.139 
on the person yeah automatically it was
like<00:01:37.069> you<00:01:37.220> just<00:01:37.250> always<00:01:37.610> knew<00:01:37.849> that<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.090> were

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149

actually<00:01:38.270> gonna<00:01:38.450> hit<00:01:38.690> him<00:01:38.810> because<00:01:39.140> you

00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:39.349 
actually gonna hit him because you

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
actually gonna hit him because you
didn't<00:01:39.500> really<00:01:39.619> you're<00:01:39.800> gonna<00:01:39.890> be<00:01:39.979> drunk<00:01:40.250> and

play that game but I think they always

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.499 
play that game but I think they always
find<00:01:42.800> a<00:01:42.920> way<00:01:42.950> with<00:01:43.250> those<00:01:43.399> games<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.880> like<00:01:44.090> get

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
find a way with those games to like get

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.050 
find a way with those games to like get
you<00:01:44.660> a<00:01:44.899> head<00:01:45.110> shot<00:01:45.380> yeah<00:01:45.679> you<00:01:45.950> spike<00:01:46.310> hahaha

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
sure there's nothing like a g-rated

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.139

actually<00:02:41.850> got<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.180> blood<00:02:42.480> instead<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.110> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
strobe light right yeah it may be a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.400 
strobe light right yeah it may be a
little<00:02:45.240> less<00:02:45.390> realistic<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.170> were<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.320> the
