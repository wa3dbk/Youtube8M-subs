00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.879

 some people put dad to me not 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.090
 I like to put potatoes because it tends to 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.090
 to import 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.180
 and then there are two ways 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.840
 It can 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.940
 pick up the sheet 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.940
 and do 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.220
 a knot this is done with 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.420
 with a 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.530
 pitas that take out the maguey 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.530
 but we are in europe 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.040
 here there are no magicians, there are no 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.260
 wizards 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.019
 then they are made with thread 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.739
 with cotton threads so it does not loose 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.739
 no flavor 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.790
 and it will not be contaminated 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.220
 a knot 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.700
 I remember that the good one goes away 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.700
 to cook 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.660
 it cuts the leaves left over would be 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.990
 very bad presentation 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.560
 not even the size 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.310
 and that is a tamal bogota the 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.310
 santaferinos 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.829
 then this goes on he starts cooking 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:19.090
 bain -marie at least three 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:22.660
 hours it is put in a very large pot with 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.490
 lid and hot water and it's going 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.130
 adding hot water as the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.710
 water dries up 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.690
 at 3 o'clock they retire 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.050
 cool then they can be kept in the 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.650
 refrigerator two or three days or you can 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.670
 Freeze the time you want and 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.770

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.569

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.939
 some water because I

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.030
 a chocolate 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:57.150

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.150
