00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:04.870
 the great head of washington has sent formosa see what you want to buy them- 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.690
 land 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.959
 they are words of war 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:10.050
 many misgivings this detail 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.240
 because we know very well the little lack that makes our friendship 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.299
 We want to consider the offer because we also know very well 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.390
 that if we did not 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.759
 the pale faces take us away in the lands with firearms 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:26.529
 but how can you buy or sell the sky 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.909
 or the heat of the earth 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.489
 this idea is not strange 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.280
 nor the freshness of the air 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.210
 nor the brightness of the water are our 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.050
 how could they be bought 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.150
 you have to know 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.480
 that every piece of this earth 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.550
 sacred to the people 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.090
 the green leaf the sandy beach 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.730
 the fog in the forest 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.720
 the dawn among the trees 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.900
 the unemployed insects 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.140
 they are sacred experiences and memories of my people 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.860
 the white man's dead forget their land when they begin the journey to 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.810
 through the stars 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.800
 our dead instead 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.660
 world that move away from the earth 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.940
 although it is normal 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.720
 we are a part of it 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.610
 and the scented flower the deer the horse and the eagle 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.860
 they are our brothers 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 the steep rocks 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.000
 the humid meadows the heat of the horse's body 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.160
 and the man 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.490
 they all belong to the same family 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.710
 the crystal clear water that runs through the rivers and streams 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.500
 it's not just water 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.780
 it also represents the blood of our ancestors 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.410
 if it is the sell moss 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.070
 you will have to remember that they are sacred 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 and teach it to your children 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.740
 also the rivers are our brothers 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.620
 because they liberate us from being 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.550
 the Tuscans drag 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.000
 they give us fish 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 every ghostly reflection in the clear waters of the lakes 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.550
 account the events and memories of our people 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.260
 the murmur of water 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.550
 it is the voice of the father on my part 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.169
 yes big boss of washington 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.169
 the rivers are our brothers isacio our being 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.179
 They are carriers of our canoes 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.469
 and food of our children 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.759
 if we defend our land 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.459
 you will have to remember and teach your children 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.390
 that the rivers 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.979
 they are our brothers 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.679
 and also yours 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.779
 and therefore 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.429
 they should treat them with the same sweetness 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.479
 what is a weapon about 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:37.019
 of course we know that the white man does not understand our way of being 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.219
 so much gives you a piece of land that another 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:41.999
 because he does not see her as a sister 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.599
 but as an enemy 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.970
 when he has already made it his 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.149
 he despises her and keeps walking 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.559
 leave behind the grave of his parents without caring 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:54.469
 kidnap the lives of their children 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.119
 and he does not care either 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.679
 he does not care about the grave of his ancestors 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.679
 nor the patrimony of their forgotten children 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.370
 his mother treats the earth and his brother the firmament 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.560
 as objects that are bought 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.590
 are exploited 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.739
 and they are sold like sheep 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.729
 as well as colorful beads 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.289
 his appetite devours the earth leaving behind a desert 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.479
 I can not understand it 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.719
 your cities want the eyes of the red-skinned man 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.669
 Maybe it's because we're savages and we can not understand it 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.699
 there is not a single quiet place in the cities of the white man 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:37.929
 no place where you can hear in the spring the unfolding of the leaves 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.969
 or the rumor of the waves and the insect 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.200
 maybe I'm a savage and I do not understand things well 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.450
 the noise of the city 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.719
 it is an insult to the ear 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.429
 and I wonder 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:54.149
 what kind of life does a man have that is not able to hear the scream 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:55.589
 lonely of a heron 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.589
 The nocturnal discussion of the frogs around the raft 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.799
 I am red clean and I can not understand 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.439
 we 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.009
 we prefer the soft whisper of the wind on the surface of a pond like this 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.629
 like the smell of this same wind purified by the rain of half life 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.629
 perfumed with something more technical 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.489
 when the last who red has disappeared from this earth 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.349
 when it is nothing more than a memory its shadow like that of a cloud passing through 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.469
 a meadow 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:30.099
 then it is still river so these forests will be populated by the 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.889
 spirit of my people 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.550
 because we love this country as a child 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.800
 the heartbeat of his mother 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.249
 If I decided to accept your offer 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.719
 I will have to put is a condition 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.169
 that the white man considers the animals of this earth 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.370
 like brothers 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.370
 I am and wild and I do not understand another way of life 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.279
 I have seen thousands of buffaloes being abandoned in the meadows 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.430
 shot dead by the white man from a moving train 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.039
 I am and wild 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.759
 and I understand how a smoking machine can matter more than the 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:08.410
 buffalo 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.410
 we have to kill just to survive 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.930
 that I could be the man if the animals 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.790
 if the animals disappeared 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.830
 man would die in great loneliness 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.969
 everything that happens to animals 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.120
 soon 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.659
 It will also happen to man 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.650
 all things are linked 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.560
 You must teach our children 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.370
 what we have taught ours 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.620
 that the earth is our mother 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.650
 everything that happens to the earth 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.499
 it will happen to the children of the earth 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:44.059
 if men spit on the ground 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:47.419
 they argue themselves 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.949
 we are sure of one thing 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.939
 the earth does not belong to man 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.319
 it is man who belongs to the earth 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.529
 everything is linked like the blood that unites a family 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.650
 man did not weave the web of life 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.559
 it's just a thread 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.369
 what he does with the plot 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:09.599
 he does it himself 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.860
 not even the white man whose god I passed there speaks to that of friend to 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.729
 friend 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.580
 it is exempt from the common destiny 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.129
 after all 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.169
 maybe we are brothers 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.400
 we'll see 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.629
 we know one thing that maybe the white man will discover some day 

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:29.699
 our God 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.110
 the same virus 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.660
 you can think that now he belongs to us the same as you wish 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.099
 our oscar land had 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.599
 but it's not like that 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.029
 he is the god of all men 

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.339
 and his compassion 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:48.339
 it reaches the red skin and the white man equally 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:53.059
 this land has an inestimable value for him 

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:54.419
 and if it is damaged 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.839
 it would provoke the wrath of the creator 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.339
 also white men will become extinct 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.999
 maybe before the other tribes 

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:05.369
 the non-woven man a network of life 

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:07.270
 it's just one of those threads 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.509
 and is tempting misfortune 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:11.589
 if it is to break that network 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:14.719
 everything is linked together like the blood of a family 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:17.499
 if in his narrow physique 

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:18.869
 any night 

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:21.869
 moria and suffocated by your excrement 

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:25.730
 but you will walk towards destruction 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.730
 surrounded by glory and splendor by the power of God 

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.210
 that extracted this earth 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.559
 and that by some special design 

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:35.499
 cossío dominion over her 

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:38.229
 and on the red skin 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:41.229
 that design is a mystery to us 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.330
 we do not understand why the buffaloes are exterminated, the 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.229
 wild horses saturate the secret corners of forests 

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:51.360
 with the encouragement of so many men 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.090
 and the landscape gorges 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.740
 from the lush countable talking hills 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.110
 where is the thick forest 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.259
 missing 

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:05.589
 where will I be latina 

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:07.740
 He disappeared 

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.740
 that's how life ends 

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.749
 and we only have the resource 

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:13.329
 to try to survive
