00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
nice sort of sparse feel to it because

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.560 
nice sort of sparse feel to it because
you<00:03:40.200> know<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.500> main<00:03:40.739> accent<00:03:41.579> is<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.060> bed<00:03:42.239> here

I think that the thing is like these

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.950 
I think that the thing is like these
makeup<00:05:33.460> pouches<00:05:33.670> really<00:05:34.180> fit<00:05:34.390> the<00:05:34.570> feel<00:05:34.720> of<00:05:34.780> a
