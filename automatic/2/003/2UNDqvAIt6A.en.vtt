00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
so now what about yogurt okay why don't

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.809 
so now what about yogurt okay why don't
you<00:00:03.300> just<00:00:03.480> eat<00:00:03.780> some<00:00:04.110> yogurt<00:00:04.400> it<00:00:05.400> has<00:00:05.609> some

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
you just eat some yogurt it has some

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.200 
you just eat some yogurt it has some
good<00:00:05.940> bacteria<00:00:06.210> right<00:00:06.919> now<00:00:07.919> yes<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.490> does<00:00:08.670> but

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
good bacteria right now yes it does but

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.049 
good bacteria right now yes it does but
let's<00:00:09.540> take<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.809> look<00:00:10.080> at<00:00:10.230> why<00:00:10.410> keeper<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.429> still

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
let's take a look at why keeper is still

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.079 
let's take a look at why keeper is still
the<00:00:12.300> king<00:00:12.740> okay<00:00:13.740> first<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.250> all<00:00:14.370> kefir<00:00:15.059> is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
the king okay first of all kefir is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.830 
the king okay first of all kefir is
superior<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.289> yogurt<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.840> yogurt

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
superior to yogurt because yogurt

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.650 
superior to yogurt because yogurt
contains<00:00:20.210> transient<00:00:21.210> less<00:00:22.080> potent

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
contains transient less potent

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.420 
contains transient less potent
microorganisms<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.439> bacteria<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
microorganisms now the bacteria and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.970 
microorganisms now the bacteria and
yogurt<00:00:26.880> will<00:00:27.210> last<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.720> few<00:00:27.930> days<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.710> gut

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
yogurt will last a few days in the gut

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.519 
yogurt will last a few days in the gut
but<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.000> need<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.210> keep<00:00:30.539> replacing<00:00:31.320> them

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
but you need to keep replacing them

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.630 
but you need to keep replacing them
kefir<00:00:32.309> contains<00:00:32.759> more<00:00:33.450> friendly<00:00:34.290> bacteria

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
kefir contains more friendly bacteria

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.049 
kefir contains more friendly bacteria
than<00:00:35.640> regular<00:00:36.030> yogurt<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.110> these<00:00:38.059> strains

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
than regular yogurt and these strains

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270 
than regular yogurt and these strains
there's<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.719> many<00:00:39.870> more<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.559> these<00:00:40.770> guys<00:00:41.070> are

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
there's so many more that these guys are

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.209 
there's so many more that these guys are
actually<00:00:41.600> stronger<00:00:42.600> than<00:00:42.950> just<00:00:43.950> regular

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
actually stronger than just regular

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.090 
actually stronger than just regular
yogurt<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.200> these<00:00:46.200> guys<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.039> much

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
yogurt and these guys are so much

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.670 
yogurt and these guys are so much
stronger<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.450> actually<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:49.170> dig

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
stronger that they can actually just dig

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.600 
stronger that they can actually just dig
in<00:00:49.920> deeper<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.780> get<00:00:51.780> rid<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.020> more<00:00:52.610> bad

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
in deeper and get rid of more bad

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.959 
in deeper and get rid of more bad
bacteria<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.629> repopulate<00:00:55.520> faster<00:00:56.520> than

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
bacteria and repopulate faster than

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.439 
bacteria and repopulate faster than
regular<00:00:57.300> yogurt<00:00:58.039> also<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.250> curd<00:00:59.609> size<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
regular yogurt also the curd size of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.009 
regular yogurt also the curd size of
kefir<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.170> much<00:01:01.530> smaller<00:01:02.039> than<00:01:02.370> yogurt<00:01:03.019> okay

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
kefir is much smaller than yogurt okay

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.770 
kefir is much smaller than yogurt okay
so<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.220> makes<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.729> perfect<00:01:05.970> food<00:01:06.420> for

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
so this just makes it a perfect food for

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.130 
so this just makes it a perfect food for
babies<00:01:07.400> elderly<00:01:08.400> people<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.090> anybody<00:01:09.750> with

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
babies elderly people or anybody with

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.250 
babies elderly people or anybody with
digestive<00:01:11.040> problems<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.869> said<00:01:12.930> don't

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
digestive problems and like I said don't

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.740 
digestive problems and like I said don't
worry<00:01:13.439> if<00:01:13.680> you're<00:01:13.920> lactose<00:01:14.250> intolerant

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
worry if you're lactose intolerant

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.399 
worry if you're lactose intolerant
because<00:01:15.979> these<00:01:17.600> bacteria<00:01:18.600> will<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
because these bacteria will go in and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.219 
because these bacteria will go in and
break<00:01:19.740> everything<00:01:20.340> down<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.479> all<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
the lactose the vitamins minerals

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
the lactose the vitamins minerals
proteins<00:01:27.479> it'll<00:01:28.080> really<00:01:28.340> predigest

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
proteins it'll really predigest

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
proteins it'll really predigest

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
has very little digestion very little

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.069 
has very little digestion very little
work<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.799> do<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.970> try<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.270> break<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.810> stuff

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
work to do to try and break this stuff

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.560 
work to do to try and break this stuff
down<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.680> already<00:01:38.040> broken<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.030> so

that your body can easily use all these

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.249 
that your body can easily use all these
nutrients<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.220> milk<00:01:44.750> now<00:01:45.750> another

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
nutrients that are in milk now another

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
nutrients that are in milk now another
thing<00:01:46.560> about<00:01:46.680> yogurts<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.880> find<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
thing about yogurts that you find in the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.440 
thing about yogurts that you find in the
stores<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.369> most<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.670> them<00:01:50.850> are<00:01:51.149> just

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
stores is that most of them are just

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.170 
stores is that most of them are just
nothing<00:01:51.930> more<00:01:52.140> than<00:01:52.350> fancy<00:01:52.649> deserves<00:01:53.369> because

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
nothing more than fancy deserves because

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.950 
nothing more than fancy deserves because
they<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.810> loaded<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.890> much<00:01:56.130> sugar<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.119> I

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
they are loaded with so much sugar and I

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.190 
they are loaded with so much sugar and I
even<00:01:58.259> wonder<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.310> bacterias<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.719> are<00:02:00.840> in

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
even wonder if the bacterias that are in

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.569 
even wonder if the bacterias that are in
yogurt<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:03.020> really<00:02:04.020> even<00:02:04.500> good<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.280> all

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
yogurt are really even good at all

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.180 
yogurt are really even good at all
because<00:02:06.200> if<00:02:07.200> these<00:02:07.469> things<00:02:07.649> were<00:02:07.829> really

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
because if these things were really

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.480 
because if these things were really
alive<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.000> move

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
alive and move

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.760 
alive and move
around<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.180> fermenting<00:02:10.930> there<00:02:11.590> would<00:02:11.740> be

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
around and fermenting there would be

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.180 
around and fermenting there would be
some<00:02:12.310> type<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.640> movement<00:02:13.540> okay<00:02:14.170> because<00:02:14.800> when

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
some type of movement okay because when

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.230 
some type of movement okay because when
you<00:02:15.340> go<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:15.580> make<00:02:16.290> que<00:02:17.290> fear<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:18.430> cannot<00:02:18.820> put

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
you go to make que fear you cannot put

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.300 
you go to make que fear you cannot put
the<00:02:19.390> lid<00:02:19.570> cannot<00:02:19.960> screw<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.560> lid<00:02:20.740> down<00:02:20.920> tied

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
the lid cannot screw the lid down tied

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.250 
the lid cannot screw the lid down tied
on<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.730> because<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.870> fermentation

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
on it because of the fermentation

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.480 
on it because of the fermentation
process<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.490> co2<00:02:24.910> release<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:27.250> lid

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
process and the co2 release the lid

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.490 
process and the co2 release the lid
would<00:02:27.670> either<00:02:27.940> blow<00:02:28.150> off<00:02:28.360> or<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.840> glass<00:02:29.170> would

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
would either blow off or the glass would

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.100 
would either blow off or the glass would
blow<00:02:29.740> up<00:02:29.980> okay<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.030> there<00:02:31.330> always<00:02:31.510> has<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.900> be

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
blow up okay so there always has to be

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.440 
blow up okay so there always has to be
air<00:02:32.680> circulation<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.700> air<00:02:34.000> can<00:02:34.270> be

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
air circulation so that air can be

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.570 
air circulation so that air can be
released<00:02:34.840> as<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.770> stuff<00:02:36.100> forms<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:38.580> you

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
released as this stuff forms and you

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.200 
released as this stuff forms and you
don't<00:02:39.850> really<00:02:40.180> see<00:02:40.680> yogurt<00:02:41.970> separating<00:02:42.970> like

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
don't really see yogurt separating like

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.710 
don't really see yogurt separating like
this<00:02:43.680> okay<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.490> good<00:02:45.670> separation<00:02:45.970> there

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
this okay it's a good separation there

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.780 
this okay it's a good separation there
and<00:02:48.210> that<00:02:49.210> just<00:02:49.450> does<00:02:49.690> not<00:02:49.720> happen<00:02:49.960> with

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
and that just does not happen with

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.150 
and that just does not happen with
yogurt<00:02:51.790> so<00:02:52.570> when<00:02:52.780> as<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.080> know<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.680> mean<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
yogurt so when as you know I mean the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.820 
yogurt so when as you know I mean the
tops<00:02:54.460> of<00:02:54.730> these<00:02:54.910> yogurts<00:02:55.900> are<00:02:56.140> sealed<00:02:56.560> down

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
tops of these yogurts are sealed down

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.660 
tops of these yogurts are sealed down
shut<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.350> these<00:02:59.350> things<00:02:59.680> sit<00:03:00.010> on<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.310> shelves

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
shut and these things sit on the shelves

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.410 
shut and these things sit on the shelves
for<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.150> pretty<00:03:01.480> long<00:03:01.720> period<00:03:02.020> of<00:03:02.230> time<00:03:02.530> and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
for a pretty long period of time and

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.090 
for a pretty long period of time and
over<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.540> time<00:03:04.600> if<00:03:05.200> there<00:03:05.410> was<00:03:05.590> really

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
over that time if there was really

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.100 
over that time if there was really
things<00:03:06.460> moving<00:03:07.000> around<00:03:07.090> kicking<00:03:07.660> around<00:03:07.750> in

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
things moving around kicking around in

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.960 
things moving around kicking around in
there<00:03:08.320> these<00:03:08.560> things<00:03:08.830> would<00:03:09.100> swell<00:03:09.460> up<00:03:09.490> and

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
there these things would swell up and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.810 
there these things would swell up and
the<00:03:10.330> lids<00:03:10.600> would<00:03:10.840> probably<00:03:11.290> pop<00:03:11.560> off<00:03:11.830> but<00:03:12.610> they

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
the lids would probably pop off but they

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.640 
the lids would probably pop off but they
don't<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:15.250> hmm<00:03:15.940> -<00:03:16.780> something<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.290> think<00:03:17.470> about

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650
