member my best friend Megan she had a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.440 
member my best friend Megan she had a
good<00:01:22.890> session<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> other<00:01:23.310> day<00:01:23.520> I'm<00:01:24.000> gonna<00:01:24.090> see

her<00:01:24.689> dead<00:01:24.990> lifting<00:01:25.460> 120<00:01:26.460> kilos<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.320> he

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
her dead lifting 120 kilos here he

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.600 
her dead lifting 120 kilos here he
doesn't<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.770> much<00:01:28.979> formal<00:01:29.340> strength

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.060 
doesn't really have much formal strength
training<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.650> think<00:01:31.650> she<00:01:31.799> got<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> lot<00:01:32.040> of

training so I think she got a lot of
potential<00:01:32.369> there<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.930> you're<00:01:34.380> gonna<00:01:34.470> see

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
