00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
in January 2008 two groups of trainees

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.300 
in January 2008 two groups of trainees
were<00:00:19.450> put<00:00:19.720> into<00:00:19.869> traumatic<00:00:20.560> stories<00:00:21.070> with

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
were put into traumatic stories with

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.400 
were put into traumatic stories with
what<00:00:21.520> appeared<00:00:21.939> to<00:00:22.000> being<00:00:22.329> real-life<00:00:22.899> wounds

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
what appeared to being real-life wounds

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.170 
what appeared to being real-life wounds
that<00:00:23.829> allowed<00:00:24.160> them<00:00:24.399> to<00:00:24.430> sharpen<00:00:25.000> their

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
that allowed them to sharpen their

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.479 
that allowed them to sharpen their
expertise<00:00:25.750> on<00:00:25.779> assessing<00:00:26.529> bullet<00:00:26.860> entry<00:00:27.220> and

expertise on assessing bullet entry and
exit<00:00:27.880> points

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.459 

the<00:00:36.920> easy<00:00:37.129> to<00:00:37.430> apply<00:00:37.670> wounds<00:00:38.090> were

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
the easy to apply wounds were

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.020 
the easy to apply wounds were
indistinguishable<00:00:39.469> from<00:00:39.530> reality<00:00:40.030> combined

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
indistinguishable from reality combined

indistinguishable from reality combined
with<00:00:41.270> real-life<00:00:41.510> family<00:00:41.989> situations<00:00:42.860> and

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
with real-life family situations and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.340 
with real-life family situations and
behaviors<00:00:43.579> that<00:00:44.030> came<00:00:44.300> together<00:00:44.540> to<00:00:44.809> push<00:00:45.170> the

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
behaviors that came together to push the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.860 
behaviors that came together to push the
envelope<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:46.100> what<00:00:46.129> medical<00:00:46.760> simulation<00:00:47.510> can

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
envelope of what medical simulation can

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.450 
envelope of what medical simulation can
be<00:00:48.519> we're<00:00:49.519> plugged<00:00:49.850> into<00:00:50.030> what<00:00:50.300> appears<00:00:50.629> to<00:00:50.690> be

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
be we're plugged into what appears to be

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.810 
be we're plugged into what appears to be
promising<00:00:56.260> this<00:00:57.260> next<00:00:57.710> generation<00:00:57.949> injury

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
promising this next generation injury

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.939 
promising this next generation injury
creation<00:00:59.479> science<00:00:59.930> combined<00:01:00.620> with<00:01:00.829> the

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
creation science combined with the

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.280 
creation science combined with the
improvisational<00:01:01.879> ability<00:01:02.360> of<00:01:02.540> interactors

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
improvisational ability of interactors

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.320 
improvisational ability of interactors
allowed<00:01:03.979> them<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.250> experience<00:01:04.850> what<00:01:05.030> it's

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
allowed them to experience what it's

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.270 
allowed them to experience what it's
like<00:01:05.420> when<00:01:05.930> everything<00:01:06.530> goes<00:01:06.710> wrong<00:01:06.770> at

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
like when everything goes wrong at

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:42.039 
like when everything goes wrong at
points

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.839 

not<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> fruitful<00:01:43.560> elevator<00:01:44.099> to<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.340> trendiest

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:44.849 
not a fruitful elevator to the trendiest

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:47.660 
not a fruitful elevator to the trendiest
attention<00:01:45.569> and<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.739> it's<00:01:46.890> emotionally<00:01:47.429> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
attention and so it's emotionally the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.370 
attention and so it's emotionally the
situation<00:01:48.179> of<00:01:48.270> trying<00:01:48.539> to<00:01:48.689> adjust<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.259> we

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
situation of trying to adjust to this we

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.469 
situation of trying to adjust to this we
depend<00:01:50.369> there<00:01:50.489> there<00:01:50.880> does<00:01:51.030> come<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.299> time

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
depend there there does come a time

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.089 
depend there there does come a time
later<00:01:51.780> where<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:53.630> discuss<00:01:54.920> recognize<00:01:55.920> that

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
later where we discuss recognize that

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.350 
later where we discuss recognize that
emotional

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
emotional

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.870 
emotional
aspect<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.560> call<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.890> surgeon<00:01:59.100> out<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
aspect we call the surgeon out here and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.190 
aspect we call the surgeon out here and
he's<00:02:00.000> worried<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.540> there<00:02:00.750> might<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.900> some

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
he's worried that there might be some

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.930 
he's worried that there might be some
serious<00:02:01.560> interest<00:02:01.890> based<00:02:02.220> on<00:02:04.550> ER<00:02:05.550> it's

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
serious interest based on ER it's

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.770 
serious interest based on ER it's
exactly<00:02:06.480> what<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.750> said<00:02:06.930> yeah<00:02:08.600> this<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
exactly what you said yeah this is a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:36.350 
exactly what you said yeah this is a
situation<00:02:34.250> -<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.610> their<00:02:35.760> other<00:02:35.940> combat

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
situation - to their other combat

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.660 
situation - to their other combat
medical<00:02:36.750> colleagues<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.470> think<00:02:38.100> it's<00:02:38.430> much

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
medical colleagues I think it's much

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.240 
medical colleagues I think it's much
more<00:02:38.880> interesting<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.930> which<00:02:40.740> only<00:02:40.920> tells

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
more interesting and which only tells

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.690 
more interesting and which only tells
you<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.490> thing

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
you one thing

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.040 
you one thing
or<00:02:41.880> when<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.570> have<00:02:42.660> something<00:02:42.930> that's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
or when you have something that's

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.860 
or when you have something that's
interacting<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.550> that's<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> big<00:02:45.300> thing<00:02:45.330> and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
interacting and that's the big thing and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.450 
interacting and that's the big thing and
this<00:02:46.080> isn't<00:02:46.350> real<00:02:46.500> point<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.220> don't<00:02:47.370> know

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
this isn't real point you don't know

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.400 
this isn't real point you don't know
what<00:02:47.610> is

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
what is

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.990 
what is
I'll<00:02:49.620> tell<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:49.920> my<00:02:50.070> heart<00:02:50.370> rate<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.850> knew

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
I'll tell you my heart rate and I knew

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.850 
I'll tell you my heart rate and I knew
what<00:02:51.150> was<00:02:51.210> happening<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.840> I'm<00:02:52.380> running<00:02:52.770> it

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
what was happening and I'm running it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.560 
what was happening and I'm running it
and<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.310> hear<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.670> lady<00:02:53.850> screaming<00:02:54.360> my

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
and I hear this lady screaming my

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.840 
and I hear this lady screaming my
daughter's<00:02:54.990> been<00:02:55.500> shot<00:02:55.800> she's<00:02:56.130> been<00:02:56.310> shot<00:02:56.550> my

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
daughter's been shot she's been shot my

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.440 
daughter's been shot she's been shot my
heart<00:02:57.030> rate<00:02:57.270> goes<00:02:57.480> up<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:58.050> was<00:02:58.200> great<00:02:59.450> but

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
heart rate goes up it was great but

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.390 
heart rate goes up it was great but
having<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> person<00:03:01.320> screening<00:03:01.680> me<00:03:01.800> that's<00:03:02.250> so

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
having the person screening me that's so

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.370 
having the person screening me that's so
much

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
much

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.780 
much
I<00:03:03.940> think<00:03:05.680> educating<00:03:06.680> her<00:03:06.860> that<00:03:07.550> we<00:03:07.670> had<00:03:07.760> a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
I think educating her that we had a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.210 
I think educating her that we had a
realistic<00:03:08.210> scenario<00:03:08.830> before<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:09.860> would<00:03:10.070> take

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
realistic scenario before I would take

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.040 
realistic scenario before I would take
emergency<00:03:10.670> medicine<00:03:10.940> in<00:03:11.540> situation<00:03:12.020> like

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
emergency medicine in situation like

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:27.660 
emergency medicine in situation like
that<00:03:12.380> it's<00:03:12.740> always<00:03:12.920> responsible<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.760> know

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.730
