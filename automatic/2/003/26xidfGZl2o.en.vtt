00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
see it's low-sodium right so if you're

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.190

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
could probably do this with payers and

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.940 
could probably do this with payers and
kind<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.510> hard<00:03:38.750> hard<00:03:39.740> fleshed<00:03:41.680> fruit<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.920> know
