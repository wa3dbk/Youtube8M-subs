00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 Welcome to sliding pulls 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.630
 today we talk about a monk of theirs 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.219
 I use monopolies to make videos 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.320
 were fundamentally created for the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.710
 photography and served to have a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.779
 fast portable support 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.609
 simple definitely less bulky than 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.529
 a tripod for photography and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.930
 especially to the twenty or more places where 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.550
 you have to move around a lot and the world can 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.090
 serve to fundamentally to avoid the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.059
 micro moves or having an image one 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.920
 stable photography so as to shoot at 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.680
 shutter also low challenges like a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.930
 thirtieth even less and this was the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.969
 its main use what we 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.690
 let's see instead today is the use of 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.059
 mono then applied to the video instead 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.100
 the monopolies can be used at 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.149
 place of shoulder support 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.969
 I know it 's a pretty weird thing 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.050
 of his I explain the reason 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.360
 basically the shoulder support 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.899
 you need to have yours yours 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.969
 reflex above we say follow the gods 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.220
 move the scene but still being 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.650
 stop in place the support will do not 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.020
 are made to follow subjects in 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.119
 movement because that is left to 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.430
 stabilizers and the monoplane 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.950
 mentally can do the exact same 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.840
 thing of a shoulder support with the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.270
 great difference that the weight is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.979
 dumped completely on the ground and not 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.020
 on your shoulders 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.979
 as long as you have to send use a 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.930
 shoulder support with the room is a road 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.880
 the weight is actually not excessive 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.280
 but when you have the need and maybe 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.790
 you have to stay for 8 hours outside to bring 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.119
 weight can also be amplified by 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.189
 any sound cards however cage that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.020
 make everything heavier than human can 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.950
 be the ideal solution for 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.760
 replace a bulky stand yes 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.620
 can try to get an image 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.660
 it is completely still, obviously not 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.310
 a part never the same yield is possible 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.860
 who can have the easel of 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.120
 an incredibly firm image though 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.430
 what you can do is try to 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.580
 keep it as firm as possible that 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.970
 it almost comes close to perfection and then 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.790
 arrange a post usually you'll have to 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.090
 make a 101 percent scaler app 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.680
 therefore going to lose a part 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.750
 imperceptible of images you will have 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.950
 however still image and can serve 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.730
 precisely to avoid taking you with you 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.160
 a tripod or giant we say it is 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.770
 an answer to this need 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.260
 I said the mono can be used 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.380
 as a substitute for support 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.700
 shoulder because the function is that is 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.700
 true that this door shoots to see 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.440
 however, move a little bit more with 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.380
 monopolies you can always do the same 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.390
 with the weight downloaded for you can do it 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.640
 this type of movement is anyway 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.800
 following the scene is not necessary 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.320
 always firm for this I find one 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.750
 very convenient answer I am the monopolies 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.489
 that a shoulder support is now supportive 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.280
 shovel the use almost more it seems to me a 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.620
 lower way if intelligent to use 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.070
 this tool for the said video 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.320
 this the price of these mono can 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.570
 starting from a mere 20 euros so not 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.080
 is that it has special functions must 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.360
 simply reach out to shrink 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.810
 so let's say the price usually 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.209
 is due to the quality of the construct e 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.790
 to stability this in particular does not 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.070
 is sold with the head that the 701 hdv 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.660
 that already reviewed in the last video that 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.570
 it is the same one I can mount on 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.120
 easel is supplied only with this one 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.370
 this part found moro then 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.290
 starting from 20 euros up to those 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.530
 with a price of around 50 euros like 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.510
 this has a monopoly of 100 200 euros 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.760
 the substantial difference between these and 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.260
 those mono pops that cost much more is 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.489
 the fact that they have the possibility of 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.470
 have feet here on the ground that of 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.430
 they are usually extractable and therefore harmless 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.829
 the opportunity to also use them as 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.989
 like easels with obviously the 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.730
 speech that can not read a 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.549
 great country because they are not facts 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.319
 to read it another difference 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.170
 determines the price also the use of 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.969
 these disease and height or those 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.420
 cheaper usually arrive a 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.400
 meter and forty meters 50 we say 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.049
 already one more expensive and can get to 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.090
 one meter eighty and 30 centimeters 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.770
 they can make a difference and they are there 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.289
 even those who arrive more and 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.060
 this can be very useful in this 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.130
 in this way it has already happened to me 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.370
 they would use it up here 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.960
 an 18 mm then an ultra wide angle 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.820
 I completely stretched the mono in 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.169
 style fishing rod attacked him 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.530
 above and raising we say we got one 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.380
 sort of panoramic shot of the scene 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.389
 and it's something that can look cute is 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.650
 detail of course you have to be 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.639
 be careful especially in an 18 that 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.500
 the lens is not too turned towards 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.539
 down because otherwise vi 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.979
 the monopolies themselves will enter the image 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:06.570
 however with a little attention we pay attention 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.430
 you will also be able to get this type 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.940
 of images that the shoulder strap news 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.520
 having said that now you know that the mon 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.440
 can also be used for videos 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.449
 I'm not saying they're substitutes 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.280
 that they are better than the shoulder pad yes 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.949
 treats as usual to understand what it is 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.110
 the right way for the type of video you 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.360
 do is the knowledge that you have this 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.159
 possibility to use the disease instead 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.800
 of the shoulder strap can always come back 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.090
 convenient thanks for watching if video 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.580
 you liked my invitation to put a 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.590
 I like the video if you don't know 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.300
 this channel is about video 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.120
 making and reviews objects so can 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.250
 be useful to subscribe a few too 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.250
 find other such videos including 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.690
 the video in which I reviewed the head on 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.889
 tripod so they are very video 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.320
 similar that if I am interested in the subject 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.659
 I advise you to go and see 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.620
 having said that I finished we see each other at 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.620
 next video hello
