best color model for us to work with and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.990 
best color model for us to work with and
thinking<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.810> HSB<00:01:28.500> model<00:01:28.920> hue<00:01:29.520> which<00:01:29.820> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
thinking is the HSB model hue which is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
thinking is the HSB model hue which is
your<00:01:30.150> different<00:01:30.420> colors<00:01:30.829> saturation<00:01:31.829> which

brightness of your color let's go ahead
and<00:01:41.610> take<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.850> look<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.360> from

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and take a look at that because from

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.639 
and take a look at that because from
that<00:01:42.659> foundation<00:01:43.380> we're<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that foundation we're going to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.730 
that foundation we're going to
understand<00:01:43.920> how<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> look<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:44.579> images<00:01:45.740> when

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
understand how to look at images when

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.960 
understand how to look at images when
we're<00:01:46.860> working<00:01:47.159> with<00:01:47.220> separations<00:01:47.790> for

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
we're working with separations for

going to pull a black which is basically

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.840 
going to pull a black which is basically
my<00:02:10.470> brightness<00:02:10.739> control<00:02:11.280> over<00:02:12.060> my<00:02:12.209> color

now we're going to be going in our post

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.340 
now we're going to be going in our post
steps<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.310> group<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.880> monochromes<00:02:16.600> I'm

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
steps to a group and monochromes I'm

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.840 
steps to a group and monochromes I'm
just<00:02:17.560> going<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.710> put<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.100> click<00:02:18.460> on<00:02:18.580> click

just going to put and click on click

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.840 
just going to put and click on click
steps<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.390> we'll<00:02:19.600> let<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.780> process<00:02:20.850> now

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
steps and we'll let that process now

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.190 
steps and we'll let that process now
once<00:02:22.060> that's<00:02:22.180> finished<00:02:22.390> processing<00:02:22.720> I'll

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
once that's finished processing I'll

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.690 
once that's finished processing I'll
just<00:02:23.350> go<00:02:23.500> ahead<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.740> select<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.640> i'll

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
just go ahead and select this and i'll

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.480 
just go ahead and select this and i'll
hit<00:02:24.880> control<00:02:25.360> C<00:02:25.530> will<00:02:26.530> minimize<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.220> go

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
hit control C will minimize this and go

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.670 
hit control C will minimize this and go
back<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.940> our<00:02:27.970> original<00:02:28.150> document<00:02:29.020> go<00:02:29.530> ahead

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
back to our original document go ahead

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.780 
back to our original document go ahead
and<00:02:29.800> paste<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.190> you'll<00:02:30.370> notice<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.700> goes

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
and paste that and you'll notice it goes

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.310 
and paste that and you'll notice it goes
right<00:02:31.030> in<00:02:31.240> directly<00:02:31.600> where<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.870> came<00:02:32.050> from<00:02:32.110> but

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
right in directly where it came from but

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.200 
right in directly where it came from but
it's<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.710> new<00:02:32.830> document<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.430> if<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:34.090> do<00:02:34.180> a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
it's in a new document so if you do a

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.880 
it's in a new document so if you do a
separation<00:02:34.810> just<00:02:34.990> see<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> blank<00:02:35.350> page<00:02:35.560> 0<00:02:35.710> that

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
separation just see a blank page 0 that

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.230 
separation just see a blank page 0 that
means<00:02:35.950> your<00:02:36.220> separation<00:02:36.580> was<00:02:36.760> off<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.030> page

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
means your separation was off the page

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.180 
means your separation was off the page
and<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.510> can<00:02:37.600> just<00:02:37.750> move<00:02:37.930> out<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.350> find<00:02:38.440> it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
and you can just move out and find it

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.470 
and you can just move out and find it
that<00:02:39.370> way<00:02:39.490> but<00:02:39.550> I<00:02:39.700> want<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.910> bring<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.240> down

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
that way but I want to bring this down

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.330 
that way but I want to bring this down
here<00:02:40.780> I'm<00:02:41.170> going<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.380> duplicate<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.980> again

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
here I'm going to duplicate this again

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.970 
here I'm going to duplicate this again
here<00:02:42.970> i'm<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.780> minimize<00:02:44.230> my<00:02:44.620> simple

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
here i'm going to minimize my simple

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.320 
here i'm going to minimize my simple
steps<00:02:45.190> or<00:02:45.340> after<00:02:45.580> i'm<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:45.880> create<00:02:46.090> a

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
steps or after i'm going to create a

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.180 
steps or after i'm going to create a
background<00:02:46.930> object<00:02:47.680> for<00:02:47.830> this<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.070> we<00:02:48.160> can

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
background object for this so we can

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.400 
background object for this so we can
take<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.460> look<00:02:48.730> at<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.180> detail<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:50.110> we<00:02:50.290> have

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
take a look at this in detail so we have

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.870 
take a look at this in detail so we have
an<00:02:50.500> understanding<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:51.100> what<00:02:51.160> we<00:02:51.550> want<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.790> be

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
an understanding of what we want to be

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.400 
an understanding of what we want to be
thinking<00:02:52.060> about<00:02:52.240> when<00:02:52.840> we're<00:02:52.990> looking<00:02:53.290> at

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
thinking about when we're looking at

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.810 
thinking about when we're looking at
images<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.950> doing<00:02:54.220> colors<00:02:54.550> color

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.830 
separations when in order to back a page
just<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.820> set<00:02:58.060> up<00:02:58.150> there<00:02:58.360> i'll<00:02:58.510> take<00:02:58.540> the

with Hugh the two easiest parts were
pulled

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
pulled

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.070

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
out the black and the white now we can

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.920 
out the black and the white now we can
start<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:29.680> separate<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.760> based<00:04:31.630> on<00:04:31.780> the

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
start to separate this based on the

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.580 
start to separate this based on the
colors<00:04:32.380> or<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.830> blends<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.490> colors<00:04:34.410> now<00:04:35.410> if<00:04:35.500> we

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
colors or the blends of colors now if we

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.740 
colors or the blends of colors now if we
take<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.830> look<00:04:36.160> at<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.520> let's<00:04:37.180> go<00:04:37.330> ahead<00:04:37.540> and

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
take a look at that let's go ahead and

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.159 
take a look at that let's go ahead and
separate<00:04:38.260> let's<00:04:38.889> say<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.490> yellow<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.449> the

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
separate let's say the yellow and the

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.810 
separate let's say the yellow and the
red<00:04:41.199> and<00:04:41.889> we're<00:04:42.070> going<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.250> see<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:42.699> we'll

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
red and we're going to see that we'll

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.430 
red and we're going to see that we'll
get<00:04:42.970> our<00:04:43.090> oranges<00:04:43.570> in<00:04:43.750> that<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.080> that<00:04:44.290> these

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
get our oranges in that and that these

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.379 
get our oranges in that and that these
blends<00:04:44.740> are<00:04:44.860> very<00:04:45.070> important<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.669> being<00:04:46.210> able

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
blends are very important and being able

and<00:06:12.820> we<00:06:12.880> can<00:06:13.000> see<00:06:13.180> our<00:06:13.300> blends<00:06:13.599> here<00:06:13.870> we've<00:06:14.410> got

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
and we can see our blends here we've got

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.260 
and we can see our blends here we've got
two<00:06:14.919> objects<00:06:15.430> i'll<00:06:15.550> go<00:06:15.669> ahead<00:06:15.699> and<00:06:15.910> ungroup

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
two objects i'll go ahead and ungroup

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.290 
two objects i'll go ahead and ungroup
here<00:06:16.539> let's<00:06:17.440> turn<00:06:17.620> on<00:06:17.770> view<00:06:18.090> simulated<00:06:19.090> over

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
here let's turn on view simulated over

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.730 
here let's turn on view simulated over
prints<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:19.750> let's<00:06:19.900> right<00:06:20.080> click<00:06:20.110> this<00:06:20.500> and

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
prints and let's right click this and

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.439 
prints and let's right click this and
make<00:06:21.310> sure<00:06:21.340> you've<00:06:21.580> got<00:06:21.610> over<00:06:21.940> print<00:06:22.150> outline

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
make sure you've got over print outline

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:23.850 
make sure you've got over print outline
turned<00:06:22.720> down<00:06:22.870> and<00:06:23.080> now<00:06:23.199> we<00:06:23.260> can<00:06:23.500> see<00:06:23.710> this

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
turned down and now we can see this

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.390 
turned down and now we can see this
blend<00:06:24.240> going<00:06:25.240> from<00:06:25.599> red<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.380> yellow<00:06:26.410> and<00:06:27.010> this

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
blend going from red to yellow and this

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.100 
blend going from red to yellow and this
would<00:06:27.550> be<00:06:27.580> going<00:06:27.910> down<00:06:28.090> into<00:06:28.539> the<00:06:28.630> magenta

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
would be going down into the magenta

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.560 
would be going down into the magenta
here<00:06:29.260> also<00:06:29.699> now<00:06:30.699> those<00:06:30.880> are<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:31.120> colors<00:06:31.300> we

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
here also now those are the colors we

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.300 
here also now those are the colors we
pulled<00:06:31.840> that's<00:06:32.080> actually<00:06:32.440> two<00:06:32.650> objects<00:06:33.130> group

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
pulled that's actually two objects group

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.850 
pulled that's actually two objects group
of<00:06:33.550> two<00:06:33.699> objects<00:06:34.180> if<00:06:34.360> I<00:06:34.930> ungroup<00:06:35.349> this<00:06:35.560> you<00:06:35.710> can

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
of two objects if I ungroup this you can

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.700 
of two objects if I ungroup this you can
see<00:06:36.190> that<00:06:36.219> if<00:06:36.610> i<00:06:36.729> delete<00:06:37.120> the<00:06:37.810> yellow<00:06:38.320> that

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
see that if i delete the yellow that

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.300 
see that if i delete the yellow that
will<00:06:38.860> have<00:06:39.039> enough

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
will have enough

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.430 
will have enough
fact<00:06:39.520> on<00:06:39.760> my<00:06:40.090> blends<00:06:40.630> go<00:06:40.810> ahead<00:06:40.990> and<00:06:41.080> leap<00:06:41.230> that

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
fact on my blends go ahead and leap that

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.830 
fact on my blends go ahead and leap that
it<00:06:42.010> controls<00:06:42.490> in<00:06:42.760> go<00:06:43.000> back<00:06:43.180> and<00:06:43.390> you<00:06:43.450> see<00:06:43.630> there

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
it controls in go back and you see there

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.930 
it controls in go back and you see there
goes<00:06:43.870> my<00:06:44.230> orange<00:06:44.590> when<00:06:44.680> I<00:06:44.710> remove<00:06:45.070> that<00:06:45.280> so<00:06:45.880> I

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
goes my orange when I remove that so I

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.370 
goes my orange when I remove that so I
pulled<00:06:46.270> the<00:06:46.390> fullness<00:06:46.630> of<00:06:46.750> the<00:06:46.960> red<00:06:47.140> and<00:06:47.320> the

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
pulled the fullness of the red and the

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.860 
pulled the fullness of the red and the
blend<00:06:47.920> of<00:06:48.070> it<00:06:48.160> into<00:06:48.550> the<00:06:48.640> yellow<00:06:48.970> let's<00:06:49.720> go

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
blend of it into the yellow let's go

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.350 
blend of it into the yellow let's go
ahead<00:06:49.960> and<00:06:50.080> copy<00:06:50.380> this<00:06:50.620> will<00:06:50.770> hit<00:06:50.910> ctrl-c<00:06:51.910> and

ahead and copy this will hit ctrl-c and

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.250 
ahead and copy this will hit ctrl-c and
I<00:06:53.290> want<00:06:53.470> to<00:06:53.530> bring<00:06:53.710> this<00:06:53.890> back<00:06:54.220> here<00:06:54.940> to<00:06:55.810> my

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
I want to bring this back here to my

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.930 
I want to bring this back here to my
original<00:06:58.260> which<00:06:59.260> i<00:06:59.500> believe<00:06:59.560> is<00:07:00.190> was<00:07:00.730> that

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 
original which i believe is was that

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.080 
original which i believe is was that
here<00:07:01.360> no<00:07:01.810> got<00:07:02.800> the<00:07:02.920> wrong<00:07:03.070> page<00:07:03.400> here<00:07:03.730> is<00:07:03.880> that

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.090 
here no got the wrong page here is that

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.770 
here no got the wrong page here is that
this<00:07:04.270> page<00:07:04.590> not<00:07:05.590> that<00:07:05.800> page<00:07:06.100> and<00:07:06.600> then<00:07:07.600> there's

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780 
this page not that page and then there's

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.450 
this page not that page and then there's
this<00:07:07.930> page<00:07:08.200> here<00:07:08.590> I<00:07:08.800> actually<00:07:09.040> want<00:07:09.340> to<00:07:09.370> go

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
this page here I actually want to go

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.950 
this page here I actually want to go
ahead<00:07:09.670> and<00:07:09.760> zoom<00:07:09.790> out<00:07:10.030> here<00:07:10.270> this<00:07:10.690> is<00:07:10.840> where

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
ahead and zoom out here this is where

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.930 
ahead and zoom out here this is where
you<00:07:11.080> work<00:07:11.260> ok<00:07:12.070> I'm<00:07:12.220> going<00:07:12.310> to<00:07:12.400> go<00:07:12.460> ahead<00:07:12.490> and

you work ok I'm going to go ahead and

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.530 
you work ok I'm going to go ahead and
paste<00:07:13.240> this<00:07:13.480> in<00:07:13.720> so<00:07:13.900> i'll<00:07:13.990> hit<00:07:14.580> control<00:07:15.580> V<00:07:15.820> and

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:16.540 
paste this in so i'll hit control V and

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.280 
paste this in so i'll hit control V and
we'll<00:07:17.200> look<00:07:17.320> at<00:07:17.470> this<00:07:17.620> side<00:07:18.070> by<00:07:18.310> side<00:07:18.640> here<00:07:19.030> and

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290 
we'll look at this side by side here and

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.200 
we'll look at this side by side here and
we<00:07:20.290> can<00:07:20.440> see<00:07:20.710> what<00:07:21.160> we<00:07:21.310> got<00:07:21.490> when<00:07:21.790> we<00:07:21.850> pulled

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.210 
we can see what we got when we pulled

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.090 
we can see what we got when we pulled
that<00:07:22.360> in<00:07:22.480> here<00:07:22.750> is<00:07:22.960> the<00:07:23.170> blend<00:07:23.470> of<00:07:23.680> the<00:07:23.770> red<00:07:23.980> to

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 
that in here is the blend of the red to

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.240 
that in here is the blend of the red to
the<00:07:24.160> yellow<00:07:24.400> that's<00:07:25.180> making<00:07:25.600> our<00:07:25.750> orange

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
the yellow that's making our orange

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.460 
the yellow that's making our orange
identical<00:07:27.250> to<00:07:27.400> what<00:07:27.550> we<00:07:27.580> have<00:07:27.880> here<00:07:28.360> now<00:07:29.080> then

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
identical to what we have here now then

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.800 
identical to what we have here now then
what<00:07:29.590> we'd<00:07:29.740> have<00:07:29.920> is<00:07:30.280> we<00:07:30.610> bring<00:07:30.940> I'm<00:07:31.570> gonna<00:07:31.720> go

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
what we'd have is we bring I'm gonna go

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.140 
what we'd have is we bring I'm gonna go
ahead<00:07:31.900> and<00:07:31.990> ungroup<00:07:32.440> all<00:07:32.710> here<00:07:33.040> on<00:07:33.220> top<00:07:34.120> of

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150 
ahead and ungroup all here on top of

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.580 
ahead and ungroup all here on top of
this<00:07:34.330> we'd<00:07:34.690> bring<00:07:34.930> back<00:07:35.170> in<00:07:35.440> our<00:07:36.060> black<00:07:37.590> to

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:38.590 
this we'd bring back in our black to

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.190 
this we'd bring back in our black to
control<00:07:39.370> our<00:07:39.520> brightness<00:07:40.000> and<00:07:40.240> our

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:41.200 
control our brightness and our

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.510 
control our brightness and our
saturation<00:07:42.010> of<00:07:42.100> white<00:07:42.430> to<00:07:43.270> control<00:07:43.870> our

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 
saturation of white to control our

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.160 
saturation of white to control our
saturation<00:07:45.520> on<00:07:45.700> top<00:07:46.330> of<00:07:46.510> these<00:07:46.630> colors<00:07:46.900> that

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.170 
saturation on top of these colors that

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.320 
saturation on top of these colors that
we've<00:07:47.350> pulled<00:07:47.680> so<00:07:48.310> that's<00:07:48.520> basically<00:07:48.730> what

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330 
we've pulled so that's basically what

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.790 
we've pulled so that's basically what
we're<00:07:49.480> doing<00:07:49.900> when<00:07:50.140> we're<00:07:50.320> working<00:07:50.710> with
