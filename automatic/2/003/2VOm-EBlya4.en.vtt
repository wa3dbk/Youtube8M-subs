practice<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:25.350> some<00:02:25.560> reason<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.160> just<00:02:26.370> I

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
practice for some reason it's just I

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.680 
practice for some reason it's just I
never<00:02:26.550> could<00:02:26.760> figure<00:02:26.910> out<00:02:27.120> what<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.480> practice

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
never could figure out what to practice

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.000 
never could figure out what to practice
and<00:02:28.140> if<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.350> could<00:02:28.500> figure<00:02:28.650> out<00:02:28.769> what<00:02:28.950> to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
and if I could figure out what to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.040 
and if I could figure out what to
practice<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.610> might<00:02:29.790> practice<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.450> but<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.840> never

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
practice I might practice it but I never

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.550 
practice I might practice it but I never
could<00:02:31.260> figure<00:02:31.440> out<00:02:31.650> what<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.130> practice<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.530> I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
could figure out what to practice so I

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.770
