on<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.040> end<00:01:57.190> of<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.910> baffle<00:01:58.660> pattern

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
on the end of it and the baffle pattern

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.590 
on the end of it and the baffle pattern
is<00:01:59.200> spiral<00:01:59.680> so<00:02:00.550> when<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.090> exhaust<00:02:01.390> goes

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
is spiral so when the exhaust goes

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.690
