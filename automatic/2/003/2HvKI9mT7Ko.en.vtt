it does still stretch the bouquet

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.479 
it does still stretch the bouquet
vertically<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.830> you'll<00:03:13.980> still<00:03:14.220> get<00:03:14.370> the

shaping may not always be perfectly oval
this<00:03:18.930> also<00:03:19.170> happens<00:03:19.709> with<00:03:19.830> real<00:03:20.069> anamorphic

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
this also happens with real anamorphic

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.759 
this also happens with real anamorphic
lens<00:03:20.849> combos<00:03:21.239> as<00:03:21.390> well<00:03:21.599> so<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.590> real

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
lens combos as well so it's a real

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.380 
lens combos as well so it's a real
characteristic<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.459> anamorphic<00:03:24.000> filming

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
characteristic of anamorphic filming

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.839 
characteristic of anamorphic filming
lastly<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> flare<00:03:26.099> streak<00:03:26.430> filter

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
lastly we have a flare streak filter

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.339 
lastly we have a flare streak filter
that<00:03:27.150> doesn't<00:03:27.540> have<00:03:27.630> all<00:03:27.750> these<00:03:27.930> limitations

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
that doesn't have all these limitations

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.710 
that doesn't have all these limitations
and<00:03:28.739> can<00:03:29.010> pretty<00:03:29.220> much<00:03:29.310> work<00:03:29.579> on<00:03:29.760> any<00:03:29.970> SLR<00:03:30.480> lens

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
and can pretty much work on any SLR lens

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.050 
and can pretty much work on any SLR lens
and<00:03:30.930> camera<00:03:31.340> shooting<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.489> this<00:03:32.519> can<00:03:32.940> give

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
and camera shooting like this can give

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.819 
and camera shooting like this can give
