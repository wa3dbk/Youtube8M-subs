 pc 4 to start playing with versions 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.210
 of the beta for xbox one xbox 360 and ps3 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.220
 still waiting for news even if they happen 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.350
 many years since a game was launched 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.989
 It's never too late to cheat 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.360
 We can eliminate this sentence as such 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.479
 you know they have discovered a failure in 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.909
 super mario bros and if they have passed almost 30 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.440
 years of launching the bugs that it has 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.270
 they count per cent but we do not 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.190
 matter is a classic that is now

 Mario Bros, you know what you should 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.370
 know by heart should be 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.730
 compulsory subject 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.710
 is in a museum after passing 15 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.170
 minutes inside a drawer with the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.240
 breathing of an alien in the ear to 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.980
 see who dares to give figures to 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.680
 janabi soleilion can be played like this 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.600
 especially with oculus web hiding 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.880
 where we can waiting for the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.320
 bug that goes to another room 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.510
 we can also go brave with the 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.910
 lighter in hand scare the amorphous sen 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.950
 and it's us who go out for a 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.260
 hatch but in seaga they have it clear 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.720
 with 15 hours we can make the game 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.440
 whole enjoy it and survive for 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.240
 tell it 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.000
 we're going to be above the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.890
 mean in duration the promise that the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.780
 developers of xbox one would count 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.880
 with the resources reserved to kinect and 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.400
 is a reality according to several 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.710
 sources the e3 2014 has served to make 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.480
 all interested see what options 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.210
 they open up in the development of games for 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.550
 the console is without kinect like a 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.560
 imposition is released around a 10 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.780
 percent of process power for 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.000
 the games something the developers 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.460
 you can use if you want is not mandatory 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.250
 as early examples we have the one of 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.320
 destiny that aims at 1080p resolution 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.180
 while from Microsoft they say that 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.640
 there will be commands available throughout 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.860
 moment even in games that dispense 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.770
 of kinect for special tasks this is 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.680
 translate in that we can say xbox record 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.520
 that and the game you're watching will be recorded 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.320
 this in an xbox one has worked this 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.000
 it's the final friends of today's daily fix 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.130
 do not worry that tomorrow we return 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.350
