00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.399
 along these weekends 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.580
 let's take the time to render 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.619
 let's say that a modest tribute to each 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.170
 one of the workers in this state 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:15.029
 again lÃ©on and let's go then 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.100
 the different trades there are 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.560
 There are very modern traditional 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.960
 there are peculiar and there are very important 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.850
 like this study for airplane pilot 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.250
 It seems complicated as 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.560
 overloaded or else operations officer 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.690
 however they are races with many 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.210
 well-paid demands well prepared to 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.350
 someone who is going to dedicate himself to that which is 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.750
 so important 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.399
 the classroom is an airplane and the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.170
 students if you let me the clouds by 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.870
 the window is a pilot school 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.940
 where from 18 you can learn 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.769
 everything related to aviation either 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.300
 fly raiding an aircraft like 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.159
 overcharge or as an operations officer 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.440
 to ensure safety 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.120
 planes and their crew although many 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.649
 they think that the only thing that is difficult is 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.469
 requires to start in high school 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.539
 finished here you learn from the theory 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.430
 which is navigation classes know of 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.890
 meteorology know of systems 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.470
 communication with the control tower and 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.700
 they also really teach us to fly 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.030
 they are fools we have two stages the stage 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.130
 theoretical that is in the classroom and the stage 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.479
 practice is that it's on the plane in the 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.649
 Airport notes perform the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.479
 practices for those who seek to be 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.220
 pilots the first step is the pilot 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.500
 private with a three- month course 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.330
 40 flight hours then one more year for 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.069
 be recorded as a commercial pilot where yes 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.200
 it takes many more hours in the air 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.539
 to do commercial pilot they are urged 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.649
 140 then to really can 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.600
 apply an airline are needed 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.090
 minimum 180 than what the authority asks 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.610
 40 from private and saying 40 and commercial 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.020
 you can be a purser in a course of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.039
 three months you get the knowledge 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.890
 necessary to perform properly 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.180
 the post and to take away the degree that 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.219
 now he has a position in a line 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.689
 commercial she clear that she overloaded 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.430
 it requires more than just kindness 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.079
 to assist the passenger they should know 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.000
 how to act in the face of any contingency 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.359
 in the air for any kind of 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 emergency either a heart attack be this 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.070
 today 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.170
 I teach for any kind of 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.390
 emergency we are trained not everything 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.860
 is to fly in the world of aviation the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.210
 ground staff is important because of 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.460
 this will depend on the safety of the aircraft and 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.200
 his passengers full shoe was the 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.150
 air operations career and today 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.040
 has five years of experience in 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.720
 school but in a practical way how it 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.400
 must act to guarantee the flight 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.530
 perfect more than anything to do the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.820
 load and weight and balance of the plane 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.400
 It means that there is a go 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.830
 balanced and be and do not go to see 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.350
 no detail of any incident or 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.239
 accidents are not simple races 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.190
 a lot of dedication is required and although the 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.989
 cost can be relatively high 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.790
 demand for these professions say the 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.620
 interviewed surpass the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.750
 expectations and converts them into a 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.670
 good investment for the future with
