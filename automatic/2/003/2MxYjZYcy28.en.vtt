00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 Welcome to part 37 of the guide 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.770
 pokemon here and pokemon and 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.880
 we are here now to enter the 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.760
 pokemon league so let's prepare 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.870
 Our team will buy various 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.900
 positions and revive 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 that will be good for us to come true and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.619
 well let's talk to the guys for 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.480
 here and the girls to see if they give us 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.950
 last time in this last center because 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.180
 we have some interesting little thing like 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.860
 some stable or some useful thing but 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 it does not seem that they are not giving anything 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.380
 so well let's go to the store that is 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.270
 the only dependent there is talk 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.340
 with him and we will buy for him do not know me in 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.890
 this case I will buy some and percussion 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.710
 about ten I have seven you can buy a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.140
 three to have ten since this league 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.050
 pokemon of the easiest that I have 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.699
 seen in any four of pokemon not 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.240
 I know your opinion but let me have 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.160
 quite easy enough result go 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.140
 and well we will buy revive until 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.000
 let's have days too for example and already 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.790
 is I think that with this not 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.790
 we need a lot more 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.020
 so nothing what we're going to do is 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.020
 cure our pokemon 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.540
 to our team rather 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.980
 and we are going to enter the pokemon league 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.410
 after him 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.540
 of so much time that I know I was 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.680
 waiting and the truth that you expect some 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.420
 what another surprise that I have done in the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.370
 video editing in these combats and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.040
 others that I 'm going to like a lot about 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.620
 all the final combat against alliance 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.690
 against the champion and you'll see 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.880
 and well let's go through the 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.130
 little puddle here that go fuck 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.430
 because I do not know why he puts in a puddle and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.480
 medium since I have a new boot and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.070
 I have to go through there I have to 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.430
 put your feet on dad and like not 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.790
 fancy 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.220
 and good here we will see two kids 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.040
 that each member of the team will tell us 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.770
 high command employs a type of pokemon 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:07.070
 in this case it 's water the dragon fire and 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.569
 we are not reminded of anything 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.310
 and steel is worth 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.609
 and those are the four types that we 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.930
 they expect from the four high commands of the 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.790
 pokemon league here from pokemon team 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.170
 what with and so we'll go through one of 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.579
 the corridors does not matter if you throw 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.430
 right on the left because you're going to 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.879
 get to the same place and well we will leave 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.049
 here to this room where there will be the 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.170
 four doors where the four will be 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.209
 controls or the four characters of the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.359
 high command here we have one who is 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.370

 high command and the champion if you want 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.010

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.419
 first to the four members of the high 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.799
 command for it will have to prove 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.030
 all your forces but that should be 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.829
 a piece of cake for someone who has been 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.750
