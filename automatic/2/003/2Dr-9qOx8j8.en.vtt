00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.449
 the youtube galley in this video wanted 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.789
 give a tip to you 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.780
 dung is that we can do improvising 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.940
 The same homemade effect to use at home 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.470
 where it is clear, right? 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.600
 what does not have this front because it has 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.470
 here in Brazil or even for shooting the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.979
 target 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.520
 I have this one from cbc that already is 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.530
 own for my cbc booth and 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.440
 Only then how small is it with you? 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.110
 see what you can learn here to close 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.580
 him to transport and he 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.470
 field 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.750
 in case I have this imagine how it is 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.470
 short and firing position or lying 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.929
 anchored on a table in the case really 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.330
 hunting and survival and 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.539
 try to use in a position where you do not 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.259
 I could get you lying down, it's not going to work. 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.740
 for nothing 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.929
 It was where the bush was half-high there. 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:58.280
 it will not be going to be for nothing and this 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:02:01.130
 model here but I'm not showing 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.750
 very detail how to do it even because I 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.270
 I'll have to adjust it I had 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.459
 bought two aluminum rods for 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.390
 make and paint with paint for high 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.150
 temperature 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.880
 but with the passing of the rubbers he 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.310
 It ended up peeling here in time for me. 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.170
 pass did not stick on the aluminum and I go 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.209
 have to retouch it after one more 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.230
 to spray it so it does not get too 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.739
 ugly so 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.690
 I really wanted to have a 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.370
 a small room wood type for these 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.799
 pass the curtain only I did not find 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.859
 in the market here in my city and I 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.079
 to buy up aluminum 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:44.340
 I took the cbf from the old randers channel 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.230
 who is from a British 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.620
 has several entities on hunting and 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.690
 hunting birds and hares am 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.959
 usually is hunting rabbit left 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.760
 dams and he on his channel has a 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.700
 tutorial that I'll leave in the description 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.170
 of the video then the video link that 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.900
 show me how 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.959
 only he did some a little different 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.860
 besides using wooden rods 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.700
 he picked up here where you will be the formal be 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.549
 foot 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.410
 he used only insulation tape in improving the 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.530
 gun I thought it might get 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.310
 slippery at the time the descent goes down 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.129
 the gun and wood 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.629
 rubber excuse in truth and 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:37.650
 I put in enough work to 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.000
 put the guys to help me and went well 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.430
 complicated for him to come with 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.349
 pressure and not slipping and 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.640
 entice rubber rings 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.470
 you can see rubber for us 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.040
 can charge and usually aluminum and 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.040
 light, do not you? 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.519
 paint him again not to stay 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.670
 reducing not only one getting one thing 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:03.750
 stronger ' alive and then if you need to do 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:07.940
 the shot we can use it on 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.940
 kneeling version 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.950
 here I with the rubber and it is very happy 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.880
 you can see that it does not add any 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.550
 ground contact and it does not slide 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.110
 It does not open because it gives spiking to take 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.810
 also in the position placed here in the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.280
 position and also opening 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:38.810
 But he can make a shot. 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.660
 sitting with him then help from that 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.710
 sure that every shot taken with the camera 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.370
 bezel 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.860
 if you shoot the free course it 's bad 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.380
 either take several variations that 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.240
 We have the calendar here. 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.070
 with the result the planet in the front 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.250
 will make a big difference 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.760
 then having both support with this 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:05.180
 favors the accuracy of the title 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:11.420
 in this sense the yield demand useful then 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:17.330
 You can see he gets very firm in 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:18.950
 relationship for prisoner here in rubber is 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.340
 well arrive here at the rubber gun stands 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.280
 well fixed because of this motto here not 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:29.060
 It's easy twisting because it's over 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.130
 adhering on the rubber that sticks to the 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.900
 stuff in the water and really look good 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.880
 firm 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.980
 it was not a tip to make a 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.980
 long distance story with the telescope 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.470
 improvised there that later the choir of 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.330
 raise in the description of the video you go 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:53.840
 to be able to see has how you do it is well 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:57.170
 easy does not have any then stay 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.260
 tip even if standing improvised for use 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.110
 in cabins and rest in sÃ£o bento 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.800
 I hope you have enjoyed what you saw and 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.800
 100% national
