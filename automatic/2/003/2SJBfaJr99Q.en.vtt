right next one tempos and squeezing so
for<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.150> one<00:02:31.360> let's<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.140> show<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.530> real<00:02:32.830> slow

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
for this one let's just show a real slow

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.290 
for this one let's just show a real slow
tempo<00:02:33.640> on<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.940> way<00:02:34.090> down<00:02:34.120> for<00:02:34.720> push-ups<00:02:36.300> so

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
tempo on the way down for push-ups so

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.580 
tempo on the way down for push-ups so
regular<00:02:37.690> push-ups<00:02:38.140> now<00:02:38.200> we're<00:02:38.380> going<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.530> go

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
regular push-ups now we're going to go

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.340 
regular push-ups now we're going to go
five<00:02:38.920> four<00:02:39.820> three<00:02:40.390> two<00:02:41.290> one<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:43.270> then<00:02:43.870> up<00:02:44.110> for

five four three two one and then up for
one<00:02:44.530> now<00:02:45.070> let's<00:02:45.400> do<00:02:45.610> four<00:02:46.300> down<00:02:46.600> three<00:02:46.930> up<00:02:47.620> so

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
one now let's do four down three up so

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.760 
one now let's do four down three up so
with<00:02:48.670> slowing<00:02:49.030> things<00:02:49.210> down<00:02:49.360> really<00:02:50.110> focusing

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
with slowing things down really focusing

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.320 
with slowing things down really focusing
on<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.040> muscle<00:02:51.370> group<00:02:51.490> he's<00:02:51.640> really<00:02:51.910> focusing

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
on the muscle group he's really focusing

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.060 
on the muscle group he's really focusing
on<00:02:52.510> his<00:02:52.630> pecs<00:02:52.960> as<00:02:53.200> he<00:02:53.650> does<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:55.710> you<00:02:56.710> can<00:02:56.890> use

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
on his pecs as he does that you can use

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.820 
on his pecs as he does that you can use
this<00:02:57.280> for<00:02:57.520> almost<00:02:57.730> any<00:02:58.090> exercise<00:02:58.830> we're

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
this for almost any exercise we're

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.620 
this for almost any exercise we're
changing<00:03:00.430> what's<00:03:00.610> called<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:00.970> tempo<00:03:01.450> the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
changing what's called the tempo the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.720 
changing what's called the tempo the

speed of the motion the lowering phase

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.900 
speed of the motion the lowering phase
is<00:03:03.970> known<00:03:04.210> as<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.510> eccentric<00:03:05.230> exercise

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
is known as the eccentric exercise

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.300 
is known as the eccentric exercise
portion<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.630> lifting<00:03:08.380> phase<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:08.890> known

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
portion and the lifting phase is known

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.850 
portion and the lifting phase is known
as<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.550> concentrate<00:03:10.330> your<00:03:11.320> muscle<00:03:11.650> damage

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
as the concentrate your muscle damage

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.920 
as the concentrate your muscle damage
generally<00:03:12.550> comes<00:03:12.790> from<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.390> eccentric

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
generally comes from that eccentric

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.110 
generally comes from that eccentric
lowering<00:03:14.620> phase<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.190> if<00:03:15.490> you<00:03:15.580> do<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.730> slow

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
lowering phase and if you do a slow

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.270 
lowering phase and if you do a slow
eccentric<00:03:16.810> lowering<00:03:17.170> phase<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.710> right<00:03:18.130> now

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
eccentric lowering phase and right now

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.550 
eccentric lowering phase and right now
you're<00:03:18.460> usually<00:03:18.640> doing<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.360> quick<00:03:19.780> one<00:03:19.990> you'll

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
you're usually doing a quick one you'll

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.960 
you're usually doing a quick one you'll
notice<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.980> big<00:03:21.130> difference<00:03:21.190> in<00:03:21.580> your<00:03:21.670> muscle

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
notice a big difference in your muscle

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.720 
notice a big difference in your muscle
soreness<00:03:22.240> so<00:03:22.900> maybe<00:03:23.380> just<00:03:23.620> one<00:03:23.920> or<00:03:24.160> two<00:03:24.220> of

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
soreness so maybe just one or two of

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.790 
soreness so maybe just one or two of
your<00:03:24.820> regular<00:03:25.240> sets<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.990> your<00:03:26.230> next<00:03:26.470> workout

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
your regular sets in your next workout

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.160 
your regular sets in your next workout
should<00:03:27.580> be<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.700> four<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.150> five<00:03:28.360> second<00:03:28.810> lowering

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
should be a four to five second lowering

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.550 
should be a four to five second lowering
phase<00:03:29.410> that's<00:03:29.980> one<00:03:30.810> now<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.870> ramp<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.260> up<00:03:32.380> with

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
phase that's one now to ramp it up with

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.280 
phase that's one now to ramp it up with
dumbbells<00:03:33.070> another<00:03:33.910> way<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.260> take<00:03:35.260> advantage

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
dumbbells another way to take advantage

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.760 
dumbbells another way to take advantage
of<00:03:35.890> this<00:03:36.070> is<00:03:36.280> squeezing<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.690> when<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.050> bring

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
of this is squeezing so when you bring

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.130 
of this is squeezing so when you bring
the<00:03:38.950> weights<00:03:39.130> down<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.760> bring<00:03:40.660> them<00:03:40.780> back<00:03:40.810> up

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
the weights down and bring them back up

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.440 
the weights down and bring them back up
you're<00:03:41.440> going<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.620> add<00:03:41.740> a<00:03:41.770> one<00:03:42.100> second<00:03:42.610> temple

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
you're going to add a one second temple

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.120 
you're going to add a one second temple
at<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.600> top<00:03:43.900> when<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.230> squeeze<00:03:44.650> your<00:03:44.680> chest

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
at the top when you squeeze your chest

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.190 
at the top when you squeeze your chest
together<00:03:45.550> and<00:03:46.360> then<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.750> bring<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.020> weights

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
together and then you bring the weights

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.930 
together and then you bring the weights
back<00:03:47.380> down<00:03:47.650> whatever<00:03:48.070> tempo<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.670> lowering
