00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.010
 then continuing the personal here 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.290
 segment where I made the first video 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.839
 on how to train your dragon was 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.920
 Now I'm going to show you 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.560
 how to train your dragon 2 release 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.420
 scheduled for November 5 but 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.150
 arrived early here for me 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.550
 four then we will open that has a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.009
 glove nÃ© 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:46.410
 I have already seen that the water has an opening 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:56.309
 side that has a treatment was better 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:59.609
 than the first film then okay 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.090
 so the shiny glove has no tem 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.090
 no relief but the image is fine 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.700
 Beautiful and well, hurry, I have to ask. 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.909
 for you to see edition with blu ray 3d 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.900
 blu-ray 2d and dvd 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.119
 I have not watched this second movie yet. 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:22.140
 unfortunately here at the cinema came out only 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.770
 it's all rooms only had dub option 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.259
 huh 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.189
 and I wanted to see subtitles then I 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:35.700
 I expected to leave so that I could watch 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:43.850
 subtitled here the glove top of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.850
 low spine here the back 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.869
 anyone who wants can give a pause 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:04.420
 the audio options and region subtitles 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:13.090
 free says that the double layer here then 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:15.880
 I'm taking the glove's case and it's not so 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.489
 mole is no longer has a resistance 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:25.989
 simple password here the case cover to 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:30.150
 same sleeve cover at this stage 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.550
 different is the default is 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.910
 different given first movie that part 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.850
 behind the same thing too 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:51.910
 and here we do not have the inner part 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:03:00.400
 we have here the movie in blu ray 3d and 2d and 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:11.910
 here it is the duty of all with art to be 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:11.910
 different always better is more smooth 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:35.040
 a cast of king 2d also with printing 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:38.310
 lisa and here then dvd with another art 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:46.530
 the print is not so bad, okay? 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:49.830
 good but not enough already then the renan 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.500
 three records I'm going to change it today 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.989
 Here I am changing the case of nothing 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.540
 my collection of animations leaving 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.350
 all with transparent case change to 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.280
 you will see 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.690
 although not having is an internal art goes 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.560
 that it would be better to rebuild 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.349
 transparent but I'm going to change here 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.959
 put in this studio to see how 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:20.040
 and will stay 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:23.310
 the issue then I saw many comments 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.070
 already of this film is of several people and 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.979
 People said it was very good, there were people. 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:33.950
 who thought it was even better than the first 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.950
 Cuz movie to watch 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.640
 I hope I really like it. 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.390
 I really will like it because the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:46.590
 first movie was a surprise, right? 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:51.090
 I did not expect the movie and I liked it 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.850
 enough of the first film since the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:59.490
 edit then unfortunately this tab stays 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:05.310
 zone that has nothing to do but like this 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:13.320
 It looks nice standardized white of my 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:16.050
 collection all white transparent place 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.539
 so the first one also got him here 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.370
 This one I already showed in the video 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.270
 You're going to leave the video there. 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.330
 in the end 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.950
 This study is different, is not it 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.740
 case 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.500
 It's visible there I do not really like that. 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.710
 studio despite being more resistant and 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:38.070
 the harder it is 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.800
 it's very very dull, right? 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:51.050
 I'll put the studio is transparent 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:51.050
 Here I am here. 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.099
 then how to train your dragon also in 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.819
 transparent case 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.819
 both editions 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.650
 So I 'm going to close here and I'll leave the 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.270
 video of the first edition passing this 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.499
 you want to see more details 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:31.180
 is as down even if the issue 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:34.389
 previous desk as I already told in another 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.340
 video is the same as the one you have there 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.210
 has two disks is a disk only if the same 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.969
 thing 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.449
