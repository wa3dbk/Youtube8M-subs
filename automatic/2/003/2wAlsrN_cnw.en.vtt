00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
system for maybe August yeah some people

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.510 
system for maybe August yeah some people
might<00:03:41.990> think<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.350> looks<00:03:42.380> really<00:03:42.709> busy<00:03:42.980> but<00:03:43.340> it

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
might think it looks really busy but it

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.330 
might think it looks really busy but it
works<00:03:44.209> for<00:03:44.390> me<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:44.750> I'm<00:03:44.900> really<00:03:45.260> liking<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:46.010> I

don't<00:03:46.820> think<00:03:46.970> I'll<00:03:47.150> stick<00:03:47.360> to<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.510> one<00:03:47.750> pen

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
don't think I'll stick to the one pen

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.310 
don't think I'll stick to the one pen
challenge<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:49.220> will<00:03:49.790> most<00:03:49.970> likely<00:03:50.320> stick

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
challenge but I will most likely stick

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.650 
challenge but I will most likely stick
to<00:03:51.500> this<00:03:51.680> week<00:03:52.100> on<00:03:52.340> one<00:03:52.580> side<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:53.330> then<00:03:53.450> notes
