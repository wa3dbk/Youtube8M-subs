00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.109 
standard gearcase horsepower out ports
so<00:01:55.830> that<00:01:55.950> technology<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.549> trickling<00:01:56.970> down

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
so that technology is trickling down

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.640 
so that technology is trickling down
right<00:01:57.720> from<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.020> high<00:01:58.170> horse<00:01:58.439> power

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
right from the high horse power

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.499 
right from the high horse power
tournament<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.159> boards<00:01:59.460> right<00:01:59.939> down<00:02:00.150> to<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
tournament out boards right down to the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
tournament out boards right down to the
mid-range<00:02:00.900> product<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> lineup<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.040> it's

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
mid-range product in the lineup so it's

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.320 
mid-range product in the lineup so it's
a<00:02:02.189> great<00:02:02.369> story<00:02:02.640> yeah

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
a great story yeah

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.000 
a great story yeah
one<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.870> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.380> different<00:02:04.650> it

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
one that was a little bit different it

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.830 
one that was a little bit different it
does<00:02:05.220> a<00:02:05.250> few<00:02:05.820> other<00:02:05.880> things<00:02:06.090> how<00:02:06.480> did<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.720> guys

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
does a few other things how did you guys

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.020 
does a few other things how did you guys
actually<00:02:07.170> design<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.950> absolutely<00:02:08.640> well

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
actually design that absolutely well

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.180 
actually design that absolutely well
it's<00:02:09.210> a<00:02:09.300> two-piece<00:02:09.690> system<00:02:09.930> one<00:02:10.710> piece<00:02:11.009> is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
it's a two-piece system one piece is

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.650 
it's a two-piece system one piece is
made<00:02:11.370> out<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.550> Delrin<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.240> like<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.480> one

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
made out of Delrin just like this one

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.750 
made out of Delrin just like this one
the<00:02:12.750> other<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:12.990> made<00:02:13.290> out<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.530> Norrell<00:02:13.980> GTX<00:02:14.520> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the other is made out of Norrell GTX and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.550 
the other is made out of Norrell GTX and
those<00:02:15.270> two<00:02:15.420> pieces<00:02:15.630> fit<00:02:16.020> together

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
those two pieces fit together

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.560 
those two pieces fit together
and<00:02:16.860> they<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.130> actually<00:02:17.280> flex<00:02:17.910> back<00:02:18.540> and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
and they can actually flex back and

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.720 
and they can actually flex back and
forth<00:02:19.020> kind<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.530> emulating<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.220> connection

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
forth kind of emulating the connection

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.310 
forth kind of emulating the connection
you<00:02:20.820> get<00:02:21.000> out<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.300> rubber<00:02:21.540> hub<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.020> what

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
you get out of a rubber hub and what

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.050 
you get out of a rubber hub and what
that<00:02:22.470> flex<00:02:22.800> action<00:02:23.220> does<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.700> acts<00:02:23.850> like<00:02:24.030> a

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
that flex action does is it acts like a

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.510 
that flex action does is it acts like a
shock<00:02:24.300> absorber<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.320> absorbs<00:02:26.100> annoying

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
shock absorber and it absorbs annoying

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.100 
shock absorber and it absorbs annoying
chatter<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.060> vibration<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.750> may<00:02:27.870> notice

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
chatter and vibration you may notice

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.340 
chatter and vibration you may notice
when<00:02:28.350> you're<00:02:28.470> idling<00:02:28.800> around<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.220> dock<00:02:30.350> so

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
when you're idling around the dock so

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.010 
when you're idling around the dock so
you're<00:02:31.560> looking<00:02:31.710> at<00:02:32.360> technology<00:02:33.360> that

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
you're looking at technology that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.390 
you're looking at technology that
started<00:02:34.740> in<00:02:34.860> about<00:02:35.010> 95<00:02:36.020> 1995<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.860> now<00:02:38.130> it's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
started in about 95 1995 and now it's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.520 
started in about 95 1995 and now it's
trickling<00:02:38.730> down<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.300> mid-size<00:02:39.750> engines

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
trickling down to the mid-size engines

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.160 
trickling down to the mid-size engines
we<00:02:40.680> didn't<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.280> before<00:02:41.730> Mercury's<00:02:42.600> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
we didn't have this before Mercury's the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.890 
we didn't have this before Mercury's the
leader<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.680> props<00:02:44.010> Dirk's<00:02:45.000> pretty<00:02:45.480> much<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
leader in props Dirk's pretty much the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.680 
leader in props Dirk's pretty much the
head<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:47.130> product<00:02:47.670> development<00:02:48.060> manager

head of the product development manager

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.140 
head of the product development manager
and<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.190> new<00:02:50.400> news<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.880> brand
