00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
well I guess I was like 12 and or

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.319 
well I guess I was like 12 and or
something<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.850> too<00:00:44.969> good

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
something so not too good

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.799 
something so not too good
not<00:00:45.570> even<00:00:45.899> Aiden<00:00:46.289> four<00:00:46.530> or<00:00:46.649> something<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:48.539> I

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
not even Aiden four or something so I

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
not even Aiden four or something so I
thought<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.559> myself<00:00:49.710> why<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.489> keep<00:00:50.700> with

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
thought to myself why not just keep with

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.380 
thought to myself why not just keep with
tradition<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:51.960> before<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.320> prestige

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
tradition and right before I prestige

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.060 
tradition and right before I prestige
released<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.480> swarm<00:00:54.750> video<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> decided<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
released a swarm video so I decided to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.529 
released a swarm video so I decided to
go<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.699> unlock<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> swarm<00:00:57.449> I

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
go because you unlock the swarm I

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.439 
go because you unlock the swarm I
believe<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:57.899> level<00:00:58.230> 55<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.329> not
