00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello in this video I'll show you one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.930
 just one 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.770
 moisturizing skin mask itself 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.650
 can make 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.730
 For this you need a container with a 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.670
 good heaped spoon quark in addition 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.439
 you need fresh herbs for that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.779
 her just normal kitchens 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.970
 as with me, for example chive 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.660
 use basil parsley 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.890
 These are antibacterial and 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.830
 In addition you need a good one 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.850
 smell tangerines from the can and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.770
 Although you only need the juice from this 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.520
 in the first step you cut the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.520
 herbs small 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:57.420
 Chives just a little 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.420
 Smooth as well as the basil 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.920
 and they peter them you too 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:13.930
 some had 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:21.580
 so and now you give the herbs in your 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:24.640
 quark the quark is very good for the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:33.399
 skin and just moisturizes so 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:39.850
 now the whole thing is being stirred and now 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:45.390
 Are you still doing relatively thick and this 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:49.659
 Let's use the mandarin juice now 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.899
 Just open the can and a little bit 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.569
 pour now best by passing it over 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.520
 the spoon drop a little bit of the load 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:02.649
 juice from a can in here 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.390
 that gives a wonderful smell and 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.390
 the masses become a little more fluid 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:21.470
 so it can be a little bit pure in the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.470
 order I have two now 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.099
 purely poured 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.060
 and now the mask can already 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.739
 be applied 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.049
 I always use them on skin areas where 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.230
 I have very dry skin that at 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.000
 me, for example, the poor 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.720
 just pick up a bit of the mask 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.099
 the spoon and give her the whole 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:51.269
 just hit your skin and wear it 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:56.579
 now already a slow in circular 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:03:03.540
 massage in movements and if you 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:05.129
 your whole skin area have covered the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.409
 herbal in little advantage that she does not 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.790
 all hang on a pile so then 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.569
 Just leave it a few minutes 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.120
 and then you just wake up 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.069
 with cold tap water turns off the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.879
 Mask about every two to three days 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.500
 on 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.500
 I hope I could help you
