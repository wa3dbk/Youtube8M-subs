00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
the t-rex looks completely unlike

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.430 
the t-rex looks completely unlike
anything<00:03:20.290> we've<00:03:20.590> seen<00:03:20.620> before<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:23.380> obviously

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
anything we've seen before so obviously

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.280 
anything we've seen before so obviously
this<00:03:23.860> was<00:03:24.040> manufactured<00:03:24.760> before<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.750> film<00:03:26.019> or

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
this was manufactured before the film or

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.280 
this was manufactured before the film or
while<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.590> film<00:03:26.769> was<00:03:26.950> in<00:03:26.980> production<00:03:28.170> but<00:03:29.170> it

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
while the film was in production but it

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.670 
while the film was in production but it
looks<00:03:29.470> fantastic<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.670> I've<00:03:31.660> really<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.290> really

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
looks fantastic and I've really a really

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.940 
looks fantastic and I've really a really
individual<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.489> unique<00:03:34.230> collectible<00:03:35.230> I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
individual and unique collectible I

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.460 
individual and unique collectible I
haven't<00:03:36.910> seen<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.090> toy<00:03:37.299> set<00:03:37.570> like<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:37.959> and

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
haven't seen a toy set like this and

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.140 
haven't seen a toy set like this and
also<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.799> fact<00:03:38.980> that<00:03:39.040> it's<00:03:39.220> battery<00:03:39.730> operated

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
also the fact that it's battery operated

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.569 
also the fact that it's battery operated
is<00:03:41.019> quite<00:03:41.350> bizarre<00:03:41.530> because<00:03:41.980> usually<00:03:42.130> tracks

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
is quite bizarre because usually tracks

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.560 
is quite bizarre because usually tracks
of<00:03:42.760> this<00:03:42.910> kind<00:03:43.180> were<00:03:43.450> powered<00:03:44.320> by<00:03:44.350> mains<00:03:45.329> so<00:03:46.329> I

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
of this kind were powered by mains so I

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.110 
of this kind were powered by mains so I
haven't<00:03:47.290> seen<00:03:47.470> many<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:48.070> are<00:03:48.250> this<00:03:48.760> scale

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
haven't seen many that are this scale

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.620 
haven't seen many that are this scale
and<00:03:49.420> are<00:03:50.410> powered<00:03:50.739> by<00:03:50.769> batteries<00:03:51.480> let's<00:03:52.480> have

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
and are powered by batteries let's have

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.720 
and are powered by batteries let's have
a<00:03:52.660> quick<00:03:52.840> look<00:03:52.870> at<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.140> sides<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:54.340> here<00:03:54.579> you

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
a quick look at the sides so here you

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.090 
a quick look at the sides so here you
can<00:03:54.880> see<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.269> bottom<00:03:55.989> side<00:03:56.260> of<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.500> box<00:03:56.739> and

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
can see the bottom side of the box and

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.470 
can see the bottom side of the box and
it's<00:03:57.790> actually<00:03:58.060> quite<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.299> slimline<00:03:58.690> box<00:03:59.200> and

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
it's actually quite a slimline box and

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.100 
it's actually quite a slimline box and
it's<00:04:01.480> not<00:04:01.660> very<00:04:01.840> big<00:04:02.079> at<00:04:02.230> all

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
it's not very big at all

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.449 
it's not very big at all
which<00:04:05.110> explains<00:04:05.290> why<00:04:05.860> it<00:04:05.920> was<00:04:06.220> battery

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
which explains why it was battery

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.509 
which explains why it was battery
powered<00:04:07.170> if<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.320> was<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.470> smaller<00:04:08.860> set<00:04:11.519> and

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
powered if it was a smaller set and

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.730 
powered if it was a smaller set and
here's<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.910> other<00:04:12.940> side

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.699 

on<00:04:16.740> the<00:04:16.950> underside<00:04:17.220> we've<00:04:17.550> just<00:04:17.760> got<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.910> brown

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
on the underside we've just got a brown

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.210 
on the underside we've just got a brown
cardboard<00:04:20.180> bottom<00:04:21.770> so<00:04:22.770> there<00:04:22.920> we<00:04:23.040> have<00:04:23.190> it
