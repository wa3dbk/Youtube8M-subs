00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.040
 just the missing link of the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.920
 jungle camp at carelessness no 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.910
 indulgence every bent branch tells 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
 a story 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.010
 I chased every creature this one 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.140
 I was sure that the jungle had to offer 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.220
 that there are no challenges here 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.699
 would expect more 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.460
 but now there is something new each 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.980
 track has the size of a giant horses 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.040
 has claw-like scimitar it can be a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.040
 man in half finally tear 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 a rewarding prey would not be mine 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.820
 booty through the jungle afterwards 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.090
 porsche falls to me gradually 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.500
 which damage does this thing cause 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.789
 street in a misshapen circle 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.239
 split trees 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.710
 these gigantic wooden keepers 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 donated this land over countless 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.379
 For centuries, the shadow of its bark 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.719
 which we seemed to be able to do with iron 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.730
 weak ex all those who are foolish 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.170
 were enough to try to fell 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 do not harm 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.080
 this thing swept them away as if they were 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.600
 she thin branches how can a creature 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.470
 such a strength has just like that 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.960
 disappear 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.970
 And although she has this overlookable track 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.860
 could have left the destruction 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.460
 I do not take a single look at it 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.310
 catch 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.259
 she can rage like a hurricane and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.000
 then fog again in the thick of fog 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.740
 in the morning 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.750
 I feel a tingle when I feel 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.829
 Imagine how I finally got this creature 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.570
 face 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.100
 she will make a huge trophy 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.380
 after I crossed the clearing 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.510
 hence the flow and I new to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.880
 orientate 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.400
 There I saw a little orange 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.620
 fur ball wait blankly 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.110
 I secretly watch this from the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.270
 Distance a tiny fish jumps 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.190
 out of the river and the creature sets him 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.010
 afterwards, and jump happily into it 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.840
 rushing water to my delight 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.500
 I realize that this is one 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.730
 Jorge acts and everyone else 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.820
 that's a good sign 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.800
 I will find the best you can escape 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.600
 Nothing 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.369
 the big ears of the jord are directed 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.680
 lightning fast and turn in 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.600
 My direction runs on all fours 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.880
 with a bony boomerang in the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.910
 until he suddenly stops in front of me 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.580
 he babbles i nod the young model 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.560
 to vote and I move on 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.690
 traverse the challenging terra with 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.640
 ease defy me at the same time 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.070
 do not try to point out my 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.290
 hunt to overlook what I just 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.660
 I'm trying to absorb his weather 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.570
 I distracted a strange 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.580
 chirping makes me startle 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.870
 Jordan has followed more I can 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.440
 Do not allow them my hunting too 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.570
 to disturb 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.910
 I turn to him and wisely 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.520
 The distance looks at me questioningly 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.850
 I have to become more emphatic that good 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.140
 rome or not I sit up and 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.300
 give me a green one 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.660
 the wind whips through the field jorde 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.640
 and the earth experienced among us 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.950
 turns after a few short moments 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.080
 he his head and directly with something that 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.290
 you could keep his smile for a smile 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.819
 small boomerang high in the air 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.040
 I can not stop myself 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.659
 I let him grab the gun 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.060
 the hand and throw it in unerringly 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.819
 a tree which makes them high in the sky 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.140
 sticks it turns and turns 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.739
 tries to catch her 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.970
 by jumping around like crazy 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.370
 I'm not ten steps away 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.650
 come as a roar the market 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.109
 the deafening 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.870
 burst of stone and the crash of 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.569
 wood is everywhere supporting formula 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.310
 huge tree on the path the bony 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.879
 Jordan's weapon juts out from a trunk 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.909
 out 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:46.120
 one does not grumble about this world 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:49.919
 I seem to come from behind me 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.919
 I started a terrible mistake
