00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
beige just to soften the edges so then I

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.130 
beige just to soften the edges so then I
am<00:01:46.439> mixing<00:01:46.890> blunt<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.790> raisin<00:01:48.509> blush<00:01:48.930> which

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
am mixing blunt with raisin blush which

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170 
am mixing blunt with raisin blush which
is<00:01:49.259> another<00:01:49.560> permanent<00:01:50.220> blush<00:01:50.549> at<00:01:50.700> Mac<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
is another permanent blush at Mac and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.539 
is another permanent blush at Mac and
I'm<00:01:52.110> gonna<00:01:52.229> start<00:01:52.649> by<00:01:52.770> applying<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
I'm gonna start by applying this on the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.969 
I'm gonna start by applying this on the
outer<00:01:53.700> corner<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> same<00:01:54.659> brush<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.259> I

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
outer corner with the same brush and I

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.850 
outer corner with the same brush and I
really<00:01:56.340> love<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.090> red<00:01:57.540> tone<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.170> has<00:01:58.439> I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
really love the red tone this has I

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.530 
really love the red tone this has I
think<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.579> adds<00:01:59.790> something<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> little

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
think it adds something a little

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.270 
think it adds something a little
different<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.079> eye<00:02:01.110> look<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.770> we're<00:02:02.250> just

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
different to the eye look so we're just

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.100 
different to the eye look so we're just
gonna<00:02:02.430> apply<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.149> really<00:02:03.540> heavily<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
gonna apply that really heavily on the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.289 
gonna apply that really heavily on the
outer<00:02:04.290> corner<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.490> am<00:02:05.670> also<00:02:05.850> gonna<00:02:06.090> go

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
outer corner and then I am also gonna go

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.630

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
just to darken it up a little bit so

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.039 
just to darken it up a little bit so
once<00:03:26.700> that's<00:03:26.850> really<00:03:27.150> blended<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:27.600> gonna<00:03:27.750> put

liner<00:03:31.489> from<00:03:32.489> Lancome<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.570> haven't<00:03:34.320> used<00:03:34.440> this

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
liner from Lancome I haven't used this

liner from Lancome I haven't used this
in<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.739> video<00:03:34.859> so<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.220> thought<00:03:35.459> I'd<00:03:35.579> give<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.760> a

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
in a video so I thought I'd give it a

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.569 
in a video so I thought I'd give it a
shot<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.989> Mac<00:03:37.170> 211<00:03:37.920> brush<00:03:38.220> and

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
shot and this is the Mac 211 brush and

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.870 
shot and this is the Mac 211 brush and
for<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.810> liner<00:03:40.140> today<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.799> kept<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.489> tape<00:03:41.700> on

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
for this liner today I kept the tape on

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.490 
for this liner today I kept the tape on
this<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.540> great<00:03:42.810> trick<00:03:43.079> if<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.260> have

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
this is a great trick if you have

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.960 
this is a great trick if you have
trouble<00:03:43.980> getting<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.220> really<00:03:44.370> straight<00:03:44.760> line

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
trouble getting a really straight line

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.729 
trouble getting a really straight line
because<00:03:45.299> it'll<00:03:45.570> make<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.810> really<00:03:46.019> easy<00:03:46.049> to

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
because it'll make it really easy to

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.400 
because it'll make it really easy to
give<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.250> really<00:03:47.459> straight<00:03:47.850> line<00:03:48.260> but<00:03:49.260> I

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
give you that really straight line but I

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.050 
give you that really straight line but I
also<00:03:49.500> wanted<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.160> make<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.459> really<00:03:50.609> thick

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
also wanted to make it really thick

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.229 
also wanted to make it really thick
today<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:53.370> know<00:03:53.400> applied<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> line

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
today so I you know applied a line

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.880 
today so I you know applied a line
across<00:03:54.450> my<00:03:54.570> entire<00:03:54.900> lash<00:03:55.290> line<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.829> then

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
across my entire lash line and then

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.030 
across my entire lash line and then
really<00:03:56.850> really<00:03:56.880> thickened<00:03:57.630> up<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.079> added<00:03:58.950> a

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
really really thickened up and added a

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.259 
really really thickened up and added a
lot<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.310> length<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> wing<00:04:00.870> on<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.260> outside

lot of length to the wing on the outside
all<00:04:04.269> right<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:04.659> once<00:04:04.870> it<00:04:04.989> is<00:04:05.019> done<00:04:05.200> I<00:04:05.260> removed

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
all right so once it is done I removed

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.440 
all right so once it is done I removed
the<00:04:05.830> tape<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:06.310> then<00:04:06.790> I'm<00:04:06.909> going<00:04:07.239> in<00:04:07.390> with

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450
