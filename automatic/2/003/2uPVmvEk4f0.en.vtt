each other that sort of thing versus how

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.130 
each other that sort of thing versus how
complex<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.450> want<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.780> game<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
complex do you really want your game to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.229 
complex do you really want your game to
get<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:50.070> every<00:00:50.370> little<00:00:50.489> nifty<00:00:50.789> thing<00:00:51.149> you

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
get because every little nifty thing you

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.119 
get because every little nifty thing you
add<00:00:51.449> slows<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> game<00:00:52.410> down<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> little

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
add slows the game down just a little

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.619 
add slows the game down just a little
bit<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> keep<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.300> looking

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
bit because you have to keep on looking

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.810 
bit because you have to keep on looking
on<00:00:54.719> charts<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.260> tables<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.860> adding<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
on charts and tables and adding and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.310 
on charts and tables and adding and
subtracting<00:00:57.180> bonuses<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.930> what<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
subtracting bonuses and what have you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170 
subtracting bonuses and what have you
and<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> know<00:00:59.039> keep<00:00:59.489> track<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.969> lot<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and then you know keep track of a lot of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.970 
and then you know keep track of a lot of
stuff<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.140> you're<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> player<00:01:01.530> that's<00:01:01.770> not

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
stuff now if you're a player that's not

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
stuff now if you're a player that's not
necessarily<00:01:02.370> too<00:01:02.640> bad<00:01:02.910> because<00:01:03.180> hopefully<00:01:03.629> on

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
necessarily too bad because hopefully on

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.789 
necessarily too bad because hopefully on
your<00:01:03.989> character<00:01:04.379> sheet<00:01:04.409> you'll<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
your character sheet you'll have a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.500 
your character sheet you'll have a
little<00:01:04.949> spot<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> weapon<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.210> I'll<00:01:06.330> tell

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
little spot for the weapon and I'll tell

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.600 
little spot for the weapon and I'll tell
you<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.720> goes<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.049> at<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> given<00:01:07.590> time<00:01:07.950> if

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
