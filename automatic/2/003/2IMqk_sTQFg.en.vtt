00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 the mobile magazine welcome back to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.799
 our youtube channel is cristian 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.770
 boscolo is here with me there is luca figini 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello hi we are all here in barcelona 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.660
 at the huawei event to see the new one 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.139
 a wayne ascend b2 that first event that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.580
 let's get it to us right away we have 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.529
 found the phone we make right away 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.270
 this video knows no one e 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 we take advantage there are some reflections 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.840
 we are outdoors we say by you can 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.430
 starting off let's see a little 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.010
 then we say this is the character 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.150
 p2 you want p2 which is therefore the evolution of 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.320
 more than he already has on the market in Italy 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.540
 so probably will go to 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 position yourself on the price range that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.079
 so far it occupies alps 1 in the 500 euros 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.399
 they are also appreciated and still have 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.200
 known and not even when it will be 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.870
 some features available 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 technician meanwhile weighs 122 grams is safe 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.039
 that very light and leandro a thin 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.539
 because 136 x 67 x 8 lives 4 minutes of 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.550
 thickness therefore very much species 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.050
 thin light and thin which are two 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.600
 interesting features for a 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.770
 phone for a smartphone with android 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.420
 I'll show you some 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.449
 function then the key for the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.909
 video camera the memory card slot 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.580
 the key to unlock the phone for 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.750
 turn it on the back of the camera 3 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.119
 megapixel with flash with rocker of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.189
 volume at the bottom the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:23.430
 microphone and at the top 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.960
 we find 5 mm and the usb port col 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.509
 microphone also in this case for 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.130
 the adoption of the rumor to improve the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 joint capsule the quality of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.490
 video calls after the artistic paper 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.409
 then I leave the word again 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.659
 christian the display has a diagonal of 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.320
 4 7-inch with a resolution of 1200 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.990
 80 x 720 pixels the processor a quad 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.440
 core from 1 to 5 gigabytes and accuracy 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.350
 is called 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.540
 icy with k3b 2 for those who want then 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.210
 have fun checking which ones are 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.890
 technical specifications and supports networks e 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.470
 then you can browse and download data 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.080
 up to 150 mb per second 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.790
 ok maybe you can show some 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.670
 screen me where now of the gods 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.420
 features and we said a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.880
 1.5 gb quad core processor display 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.770
 47 inch rear camera 13 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:18.640
 1.3 megapixel front megapixel a 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.410
 GB of RAM and 16GB of storage memory 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.080
 I will point out to you , for example, that neither 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.540
 since I do we continue the 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.250
 sad that there is no scrolling through them 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.810
 classic menu to access applications 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.810
 but applications are contained in this 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.040
 further screen that is the home one 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.800
 they flicked from left to right 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.090
 here we give another another since 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.490
 on the battery we have one 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.140
 2400 ventimiglia imperia battery 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.990
 i am here should insure quite a lot 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 of car is absolutely not unlike 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.900
 of other new phones this one has 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.360
 android 4.1 the difference of others 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.310
 phones in this case we find you the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.260
 physical keys that despite being thaci though 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.610
 they are not virtual ie not not 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.610
 rest directly on the screen 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.080
 of android but they are exact exteriors 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.530
 these are some of the features 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.850
 of the p2 I told you we have the icons 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.010
 spaces in this in this further 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.720
 home screen is strongly 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.020
 customizable because there are many 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.470
 themes that can be chosen both for i 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.560
 sounds both then for the interface 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.640
 graphic then you can adapt the 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.040
 visualization of the graphic interface 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.650
 and improve and customize the background 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.400
 I'm basically interested too 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.900
 the fact for example that 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.100
 in the setting you can exit two 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.230
 how to display 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.090
 ie general options with more ones 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.100
 used and then the Hon 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.330
 or all the classic android ones 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.750
 for those who want to have a greater than 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.160
 normal use 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.260
 I'll show you the keyboard too 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.630
 is becoming practically interesting 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.040
 this period because said if rituals 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.230
 they must still take a step 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.820
 further evolution and therefore all yes 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.620
 they are trying their hand at using keys 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.480
 more skilled prediction systems than 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.790
 most refined writing in this case 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.970
 you have renewed your keyboard 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.980
 Virtual these buttons a bit larger and more 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.690
 more spaced to improve for 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.640
 flickering horizontally so the serious 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.860
 but that are a little more precise 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.450
 the excitement that if in this case yes 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.220
 use in this mode 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.470
 the feedback seems pretty good 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.070
 ok I'd say that with this first one 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.680
 contact with let p2 is all one 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.010
 Greetings from Luca Figini and Christian may 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.010
 soon
