let's talk a little bit about the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.020 
let's talk a little bit about the
dynamic<00:02:20.620> combination<00:02:20.830> because<00:02:21.490> I've<00:02:21.760> heard<00:02:21.940> a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
dynamic combination because I've heard a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.120 
dynamic combination because I've heard a
lot<00:02:22.060> about<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:23.140> know<00:02:23.170> one<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.710> example

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
lot about it you know one of the example

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.120 
lot about it you know one of the example
of<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.310> hood<00:02:24.490> with<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.660> range<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.440> shooting<00:02:26.800> over

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
of a hood with a range of shooting over

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.670 
of a hood with a range of shooting over
an<00:02:27.220> elementalist<00:02:27.820> firewall<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:29.170> he<00:02:29.230> gets<00:02:29.440> fire

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
an elementalist firewall so he gets fire

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.680 
an elementalist firewall so he gets fire
damage<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.220> increase<00:02:30.640> if<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.090> there

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
damage and increase if it is there

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.300 
damage and increase if it is there
anything<00:02:31.900> else<00:02:32.200> you've<00:02:32.380> heard<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.740> about<00:02:33.100> this

anything else you've heard of about this

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.810 
anything else you've heard of about this
subject<00:02:34.020> yeah<00:02:35.020> it's<00:02:35.230> going<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.470> be<00:02:35.560> quite<00:02:36.430> big

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
I then you have to plan out a

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.220 
I then you have to plan out a
combinations<00:02:39.490> for<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.910> lot<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.480> things<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.990> mean

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
combinations for a lot of things I mean

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.400 
combinations for a lot of things I mean
just<00:02:41.800> just<00:02:42.280> general<00:02:42.670> i've<00:02:42.760> heard<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.410> where

this this warrior stomps on this sheet

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.240 
this this warrior stomps on this sheet
of<00:02:48.910> ice<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.170> elemental<00:02:50.740> is<00:02:50.830> just<00:02:51.070> put

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
of ice that the elemental is just put

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.340 
of ice that the elemental is just put
down<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:51.760> pretty<00:02:52.330> much<00:02:52.360> against<00:02:52.720> everyone<00:02:53.260> on

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
down and pretty much against everyone on

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.380 
down and pretty much against everyone on
their<00:02:53.500> team<00:02:53.710> a<00:02:53.980> speed<00:02:54.430> boost<00:02:54.670> which<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.240> pretty

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
their team a speed boost which is pretty

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.020 
their team a speed boost which is pretty
cool<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.890> animations<00:02:57.550> are<00:02:57.760> really

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
cool and the animations are really

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.050 
cool and the animations are really
really<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:58.720> detail<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.320> cool<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.820> speak

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
really in detail and cool so to speak

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.060 
really in detail and cool so to speak
but<00:03:01.690> um<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:04.660> going<00:03:04.990> to<00:03:05.050> be<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.470> have<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.860> see

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
but um I it's going to be I have to see

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.540 
but um I it's going to be I have to see
how<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.580> does<00:03:06.790> because<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.900> be<00:03:08.050> too<00:03:09.010> much<00:03:09.040> I

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
how it does because to be too much I

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.870 
how it does because to be too much I
think<00:03:09.730> by<00:03:10.710> by<00:03:11.710> at<00:03:11.890> least<00:03:12.040> two<00:03:12.430> months<00:03:12.760> in

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
think by by at least two months in

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.400 
think by by at least two months in
there's<00:03:13.090> gonna<00:03:13.210> be<00:03:13.300> sad<00:03:13.600> combinations<00:03:14.320> that

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
there's gonna be sad combinations that

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.190 
there's gonna be sad combinations that
you<00:03:14.530> need<00:03:14.770> to<00:03:14.890> perform<00:03:15.040> before<00:03:15.940> if<00:03:16.570> if<00:03:16.870> you

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
you need to perform before if if you

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.010 
you need to perform before if if you
expect<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.920> win<00:03:18.100> if<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.880> expect<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.630> beat

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
expect the win if you expect to beat

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.580 
expect the win if you expect to beat
your<00:03:20.140> opponent<00:03:20.590> respect<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.220> reach<00:03:21.760> the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
your opponent respect to reach the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.050 
your opponent respect to reach the
PowerPoint<00:03:23.590> quicker<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.190> you're<00:03:24.310> only<00:03:24.520> to<00:03:24.910> be

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
PowerPoint quicker and you're only to be

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.850 
PowerPoint quicker and you're only to be
set<00:03:25.600> combinations<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.440> need<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.710> do

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
set combinations that you need to do

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.880 
set combinations that you need to do
let's<00:03:27.400> say<00:03:27.670> or<00:03:28.210> even<00:03:28.570> let's<00:03:29.440> say<00:03:29.530> there's<00:03:29.830> a

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
let's say or even let's say there's a

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.860 
let's say or even let's say there's a
big<00:03:30.160> battle<00:03:30.400> missed<00:03:30.700> all<00:03:31.150> five<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.630> the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
big battle missed all five of the

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.170 
big battle missed all five of the
players<00:03:32.110> result<00:03:32.620> five<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:33.040> them<00:03:33.160> in<00:03:33.370> one<00:03:33.460> point

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
players result five of them in one point

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.300 
players result five of them in one point
because<00:03:34.660> they're<00:03:34.960> all<00:03:35.110> crumbled<00:03:35.860> up<00:03:36.010> pretty

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
because they're all crumbled up pretty

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.960 
because they're all crumbled up pretty
much<00:03:36.430> whoever<00:03:36.820> gets<00:03:37.090> this<00:03:37.300> last<00:03:37.960> thing<00:03:38.350> waves

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
much whoever gets this last thing waves

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.570 
much whoever gets this last thing waves
well<00:03:39.970> it's<00:03:40.900> going<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.260> be<00:03:41.380> pretty<00:03:41.890> crucial<00:03:42.280> if

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
well it's going to be pretty crucial if

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.210 
well it's going to be pretty crucial if
you<00:03:42.700> put<00:03:42.910> down<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.420> firewall<00:03:44.200> if<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.709> have<00:03:45.070> two

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
you put down a firewall if you have two

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.800 
you put down a firewall if you have two
elements<00:03:45.640> listen<00:03:45.880> 18<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.240> book<00:03:46.390> put<00:03:46.630> down<00:03:46.780> a

elements listen 18 the book put down a
firewall<00:03:47.380> then<00:03:47.830> you<00:03:47.920> have<00:03:48.130> two<00:03:48.490> Rangers
