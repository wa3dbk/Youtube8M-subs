actually below average of what I

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.480 
actually below average of what I
normally<00:05:09.300> get<00:05:09.810> but<00:05:10.560> again<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.040> kind<00:05:11.310> of<00:05:11.370> went

12 senseless without a link so yours

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.020 
12 senseless without a link so yours
would<00:06:26.030> be<00:06:26.150> even<00:06:26.330> higher<00:06:27.190> but<00:06:28.190> that's<00:06:28.460> how<00:06:28.880> it
