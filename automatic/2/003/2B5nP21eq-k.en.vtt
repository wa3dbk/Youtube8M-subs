Engineers said it was because of global
warming<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.980> I<00:03:26.220> didn't<00:03:27.030> think<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:27.569> I

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
warming and I didn't think so and I

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.379 
warming and I didn't think so and I

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
that cavity in our lake dropped 18

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.160 
that cavity in our lake dropped 18
inches<00:03:38.400> they<00:03:38.549> said<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.819> was<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:38.970> drought<00:03:39.299> but
