and<00:00:00.120> then<00:00:00.750> it's<00:00:00.900> moment<00:00:01.199> there<00:00:01.319> you're<00:00:01.800> in<00:00:01.920> New

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
and then it's moment there you're in New

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.010 
and then it's moment there you're in New
Zealand<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.399> course<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:02.879> we<00:00:03.720> have<00:00:03.870> this

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
Zealand of course and we have this

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.660

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
weekend coming up to Wellington sevens

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.660 
weekend coming up to Wellington sevens
and<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.710> I<00:00:07.710> think<00:00:07.890> New<00:00:08.220> Zealand<00:00:08.550> were<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
and and I think New Zealand were the

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.209 
and and I think New Zealand were the
winners<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.090> last<00:00:09.240> year<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:10.530> think<00:00:11.160> at

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
winners of it last year and I think at

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.070

absolutely<00:05:40.050> i<00:05:40.500> think<00:05:41.030> most<00:05:42.030> of<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.210> guys

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.690 
absolutely i think most of the guys
throughout<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:42.870> world<00:05:43.050> cup<00:05:43.320> played<00:05:43.700> toughest

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
throughout the world cup played toughest

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.300 
throughout the world cup played toughest
game<00:05:44.910> that<00:05:45.780> you<00:05:45.870> could<00:05:46.080> play<00:05:46.320> at<00:05:46.470> westpac<00:05:46.920> so

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
game that you could play at westpac so

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.460 
game that you could play at westpac so
any<00:05:47.820> other<00:05:48.270> game<00:05:48.510> we<00:05:48.660> play<00:05:48.840> after<00:05:49.170> that<00:05:49.320> it's

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
any other game we play after that it's

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.250 
any other game we play after that it's
going<00:05:49.590> to<00:05:49.680> be<00:05:49.740> easier<00:05:49.920> so<00:05:50.430> we<00:05:50.730> know<00:05:50.850> we<00:05:51.000> have

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
going to be easier so we know we have

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.500 
going to be easier so we know we have
definite<00:05:52.260> chance<00:05:52.470> of<00:05:52.710> winning<00:05:53.510> whatever

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
definite chance of winning whatever

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.870 
definite chance of winning whatever
opponent<00:05:55.290> we<00:05:55.380> have<00:05:55.530> haven't<00:05:56.280> you<00:05:56.460> say<00:05:56.700> that

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
opponent we have haven't you say that

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.490 
opponent we have haven't you say that
kind<00:05:57.210> of<00:05:57.240> it<00:05:57.480> helps<00:05:57.690> having<00:05:57.930> team<00:05:58.320> together

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
kind of it helps having team together

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.470 
kind of it helps having team together
and<00:05:59.010> for<00:05:59.280> an<00:05:59.340> extended<00:05:59.730> period<00:05:59.760> of<00:06:00.060> time<00:06:00.120> for

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
and for an extended period of time for

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.870 
and for an extended period of time for
training<00:06:00.690> i<00:06:01.020> think<00:06:01.950> actually<00:06:02.160> i<00:06:02.430> was<00:06:02.580> one<00:06:02.790> of

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
training i think actually i was one of

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.430 
training i think actually i was one of
the<00:06:03.000> I<00:06:03.270> think<00:06:03.660> I<00:06:03.840> was<00:06:03.960> the<00:06:04.050> only<00:06:04.170> one<00:06:04.380> that

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
the I think I was the only one that

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.520 
the I think I was the only one that
wasn't<00:06:04.680> really<00:06:05.010> there<00:06:05.190> I<00:06:05.520> was<00:06:05.730> either<00:06:05.940> that

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
wasn't really there I was either that

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.400 
wasn't really there I was either that
shawnigan<00:06:07.530> camp<00:06:07.800> but<00:06:08.700> uh<00:06:08.990> but<00:06:09.990> definitely

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
shawnigan camp but uh but definitely

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.730 
shawnigan camp but uh but definitely

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
like I was at school for the past two

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.160 
like I was at school for the past two
weeks<00:06:13.980> but<00:06:14.370> from<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.510> time<00:06:15.720> between<00:06:15.870> that

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
weeks but from the time between that

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.410 
weeks but from the time between that
shawnigan<00:06:16.680> camp<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.220> then<00:06:17.760> when<00:06:17.850> I<00:06:17.880> rejoined

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
behind so I've had to work very hard to

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.430 
behind so I've had to work very hard to
catch<00:06:23.730> back<00:06:24.000> up<00:06:24.030> and<00:06:24.600> like<00:06:24.960> I<00:06:25.080> can<00:06:25.260> tell

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
definitely that the scenes much more

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.210 
definitely that the scenes much more
structured<00:06:28.200> everyone's<00:06:28.770> on<00:06:28.890> the<00:06:28.980> same<00:06:29.040> page

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
structured everyone's on the same page

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.900 
structured everyone's on the same page
and<00:06:30.050> ever<00:06:31.050> knows<00:06:31.350> what<00:06:31.380> they're<00:06:31.740> doing<00:06:31.910> so

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
yeah that's definitely helped a lot it's

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.790
