00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
don't make the progress that they do

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.189 
don't make the progress that they do
that<00:00:18.700> they<00:00:18.910> are<00:00:19.150> able<00:00:19.420> to<00:00:19.570> find<00:00:19.869> a<00:00:19.960> book<00:00:20.170> that

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
that they are able to find a book that

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.279 
that they are able to find a book that
is<00:00:20.710> just<00:00:21.130> right<00:00:21.400> for<00:00:21.699> them<00:00:21.910> if<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.810> books<00:00:23.020> too

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
is just right for them if the books too

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.650 
is just right for them if the books too
difficult<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.460> they're<00:00:24.609> working<00:00:24.820> at<00:00:25.390> the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
difficult and they're working at the

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.540 
difficult and they're working at the
word<00:00:25.840> level<00:00:26.170> on<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.650> books<00:00:26.859> and<00:00:27.160> they<00:00:27.279> can't

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
word level on the books and they can't

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.509 
word level on the books and they can't
think<00:00:27.760> about<00:00:27.910> fluency<00:00:28.449> and<00:00:28.720> comprehension

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
think about fluency and comprehension

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.830 
think about fluency and comprehension
because<00:00:30.519> they're<00:00:30.820> just<00:00:31.060> thinking<00:00:31.449> about<00:00:31.539> that

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
because they're just thinking about that

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.390 
because they're just thinking about that
Christy<00:00:32.379> and<00:00:32.800> if<00:00:33.760> it's<00:00:33.970> too<00:00:34.269> easy<00:00:35.190> then<00:00:36.190> they

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
Christy and if it's too easy then they

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.450 
Christy and if it's too easy then they
don't<00:00:36.550> have<00:00:36.790> anything<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.330> work<00:00:37.540> on<00:00:37.809> so<00:00:38.460> we

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
don't have anything to work on so we

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.329 
don't have anything to work on so we
encourage<00:00:39.820> things<00:00:40.320> these<00:00:41.320> things<00:00:41.620> in<00:00:41.949> helping

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
encourage things these things in helping

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
going to work for them as they read the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.060 
going to work for them as they read the
first<00:00:58.119> page<00:00:58.390> if<00:00:58.659> they<00:00:58.809> hold<00:00:59.049> up<00:00:59.290> a<00:00:59.440> finger

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
first page if they hold up a finger

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.450 
first page if they hold up a finger
each<00:01:00.339> time<00:01:00.729> they<00:01:00.909> miss<00:01:01.150> a<00:01:01.180> word<00:01:01.540> then<00:01:02.500> if<00:01:03.190> they

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
each time they miss a word then if they

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.789 
each time they miss a word then if they
hold<00:01:04.000> up<00:01:04.210> five<00:01:04.449> fingers<00:01:04.869> for<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.199> first<00:01:05.500> page

hold up five fingers for the first page
and<00:01:06.159> that's<00:01:06.400> an<00:01:06.670> indication<00:01:07.150> that<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.510> book

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
and that's an indication that the book

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.450 
and that's an indication that the book
is<00:01:07.840> too<00:01:08.109> hard<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.590> they<00:01:08.740> need<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.070> find<00:01:09.310> a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
is too hard and they need to find a

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
is too hard and they need to find a
different<00:01:09.609> one

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.389 

another<00:01:14.140> thing<00:01:14.469> that<00:01:14.649> they<00:01:14.799> need<00:01:15.009> to<00:01:15.159> think

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
another thing that they need to think

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.630 
another thing that they need to think
about<00:01:16.180> is<00:01:16.539> if<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:17.140> story<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.740> interest<00:01:18.369> to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
about is if the story is of interest to

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.429 
about is if the story is of interest to
them<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:18.880> if<00:01:19.210> they're<00:01:19.359> going<00:01:19.539> to<00:01:19.659> understand

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
them and if they're going to understand

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.230 
them and if they're going to understand
it<00:01:20.679> and<00:01:21.039> and<00:01:21.460> they're<00:01:21.609> going<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:21.880> be<00:01:22.000> able<00:01:22.119> to

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
it and and they're going to be able to

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.060 
it and and they're going to be able to
read<00:01:22.509> it<00:01:22.719> smoothly<00:01:23.140> if<00:01:23.590> there's<00:01:23.829> too<00:01:24.039> much

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
read it smoothly if there's too much

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.819 
read it smoothly if there's too much
dialogue<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:25.179> they're<00:01:25.299> not<00:01:25.509> able<00:01:26.109> to<00:01:26.469> read<00:01:26.649> it

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
dialogue and they're not able to read it

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.219 
dialogue and they're not able to read it
smoothly<00:01:27.159> then<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.670> makes<00:01:27.909> it<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.509> problem

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
smoothly then that makes it a problem

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.389 
smoothly then that makes it a problem
too<00:01:29.679> but<00:01:30.609> the<00:01:31.420> Fivefinger<00:01:31.929> rule<00:01:32.350> really<00:01:32.710> helps

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
too but the Fivefinger rule really helps

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.480 
too but the Fivefinger rule really helps
and<00:01:33.579> if<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:33.759> can<00:01:34.119> help<00:01:34.719> students<00:01:35.170> think<00:01:36.100> about

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
and if you can help students think about

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.910 
and if you can help students think about
that<00:01:36.789> and<00:01:37.119> then<00:01:37.719> encourage<00:01:38.289> them<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.590> find

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
that and then encourage them to find

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.069 
that and then encourage them to find
books<00:01:39.219> that<00:01:39.429> are<00:01:39.579> just<00:01:39.820> right<00:01:40.060> then<00:01:40.869> they'll

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
books that are just right then they'll

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.000 
books that are just right then they'll
become<00:01:41.259> better<00:01:41.920> readers

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
become better readers

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:53.460 
become better readers
and<00:01:43.130> I'll<00:01:43.370> enjoy<00:01:44.120> reading<00:01:44.600> mark<00:01:45.110> too

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.530
