was<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.300> Mac<00:00:27.300> arms<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> barrier<00:00:28.820> okay<00:00:29.820> so

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
was a Mac arms in the barrier okay so

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.580 
was a Mac arms in the barrier okay so
it's<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.949> pretty<00:00:32.579> similar<00:00:33.570> size<00:00:34.640> okay<00:00:35.640> take<00:00:36.590> if

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
it's a pretty similar size okay take if

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.110 
it's a pretty similar size okay take if
I'm<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> D<00:00:38.520> string<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:42.450> string<00:00:42.680> 11<00:00:43.680> Fred

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.470 

with<00:00:53.140> pinky<00:00:54.660> 14th<00:00:55.660> fret

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:07.440 

then<00:00:59.410> we<00:00:59.620> go<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.450> g<00:01:01.690> string<00:01:02.220> 11<00:01:03.220> Fred<00:01:06.450> 12

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
then we go at the g string 11 Fred 12

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.330 
then we go at the g string 11 Fred 12
right<00:01:09.840> again<00:01:10.840> 11

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
the dmg and then at the being that is

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.470 
the dmg and then at the being that is
drink<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.280> hold<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.640> train<00:02:26.879> your<00:02:27.000> fingers

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
drink if you hold the train your fingers

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.580 
drink if you hold the train your fingers

I'm not my glancing about you I think
that<00:03:20.010> exercise<00:03:20.489> at<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:21.349> 200<00:03:22.349> BPM<00:03:23.040> ok<00:03:23.819> let's

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
that exercise at the 200 BPM ok let's

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.740 
that exercise at the 200 BPM ok let's
start<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.510> start<00:03:24.719> of<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.379> 70<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.489> it's<00:03:27.389> very

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
start I start of the 70 and it's very

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.879 
start I start of the 70 and it's very
important<00:03:28.409> to<00:03:29.060> start<00:03:30.060> with<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.389> low<00:03:30.540> speed<00:03:30.930> okay

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
important to start with a low speed okay

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.300 
important to start with a low speed okay
and<00:03:32.250> then<00:03:32.939> you<00:03:33.480> build<00:03:33.870> up<00:03:34.079> your<00:03:34.139> speed<00:03:34.650> when

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
and then you build up your speed when

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.069 
and then you build up your speed when
you<00:03:35.579> can<00:03:35.959> of<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.400> dependent<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.849> start<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.930> do

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
you can of the dependent you start to do

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.690 
you can of the dependent you start to do
mistakes<00:03:40.730> then<00:03:41.730> stop<00:03:42.090> there<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.780> start<00:03:43.700> start

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
mistakes then stop there and start start

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.509 
mistakes then stop there and start start
slowly<00:03:45.120> slowing<00:03:45.780> down<00:03:46.049> speed<00:03:46.469> so<00:03:47.310> your

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
slowly slowing down speed so your

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.619 
slowly slowing down speed so your
fingers<00:03:48.409> don't<00:03:49.409> remember<00:03:51.199> the<00:03:52.199> wrong<00:03:53.629> the

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
fingers don't remember the wrong the

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.860 
fingers don't remember the wrong the
longer<00:03:55.400> exercises<00:03:56.400> ok<00:03:56.760> we<00:03:57.389> filmed<00:03:57.750> or

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
longer exercises ok we filmed or

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.159 
longer exercises ok we filmed or
something<00:03:58.199> like<00:03:58.379> that<00:04:02.359> my<00:04:03.359> dad<00:04:03.659> would<00:04:03.840> stop

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
something like that my dad would stop

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.990 
something like that my dad would stop
there<00:04:04.530> your<00:04:04.829> things<00:04:05.099> will<00:04:05.219> remember<00:04:05.669> this

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
there your things will remember this

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.319 
there your things will remember this
okay<00:04:06.449> your<00:04:06.959> muscles<00:04:07.439> your<00:04:08.209> muscle<00:04:09.209> memory
