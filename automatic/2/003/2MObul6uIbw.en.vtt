00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:15.489
 Ajax is preparing for the top match against PSV a crucial match and that 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.779
 the supporters also know a group of fans to the training for the future 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.879
 to give a heart to the players and that was one 

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:24.900
 Victory, all support is welcome for Ajax 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.949
 do you feel it is all or nothing competition 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.800
 no that is not, but it can be contrary to this point 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.260
 also coming to three points from PSV in the hour can come to nine points 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.510
 So 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.830
 except the three points that is very important for among other things 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.810
 a bit less 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.810
 also just important is that in the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.499
 what a party 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.739
 ajax was in the news the last week when the club as in various media 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.560
 topic of conversation 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.520
 and despite the fact that many players had international obligations 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.750
 ajaxieden received something from the criticism yes I heard ideas opinion 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.310
 now about becoming a hobby 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.120
 Twitter is a major prohibition club and have that 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.380
 four million people more have an opinion and two 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.050
 but i have playful police myself and then in the meantime that there is better one too 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.210
 get assigned and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.840
 this year there is coming again he tells I have a lot of opel and you note 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.830
 can of course and that does put everyone right and not in this anymore 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.170
 situation and 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.770
 will be waking up and one then sits the next ten times tuschinski 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.670
 and the crucial competition ever 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.660
 the 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.760
 look put that are already a long time man but that can be there a lot there can 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.110
 oleguer is still suffering from an injury and therefore trained separately today 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.130
 from the group 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.560
 In other places, there is a suspension against the club where he played for eleven years 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.420
 the chance is therefore that all the world in the base starts it will be just before the break 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.969
 We already decided it was known and I have not heard anything yet 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.380
 very remarkable there were killed 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.539
 and the way I play, dance and sing 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.280
 In a difficult period, the top match against PSV is an excellent option 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.850
 to work on self-confidence 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.319
 so it's always fun to play on it 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.209
 monitor the acquisition or or or something more 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.569
 or not something better 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.529
 that basically does not matter so 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.319
 so anyway and 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.799
 a competition in itself what is every competition actually is that is the 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.239
 future it is always nice to have the design competition 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.309
 people more covered in sand and gravel 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.289
 piece did not forget everything but after one 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.969
 if you go a booster level further in it is not easy but at home 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:35.879
 I think 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.069
 yes if you still do not still have world on the championship and yet indeed 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.809
 seen 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:40.839
 I think it's a good moment
