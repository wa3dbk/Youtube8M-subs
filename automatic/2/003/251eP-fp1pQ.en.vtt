00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the underlying ruby colors what you see

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.539 
the underlying ruby colors what you see
so<00:01:36.420> low<00:01:36.479> evident<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> water<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:38.369> the

so low evident in the water in the
shadow<00:01:38.820> reflections<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.380> feel<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.860> up

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
shadow reflections and you feel that up

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.740 
shadow reflections and you feel that up
in<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> sky<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:42.000> well<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:44.509> doesn't<00:01:45.509> have

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
in the sky as well this one doesn't have

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.859 
in the sky as well this one doesn't have
any<00:01:46.200> real<00:01:46.890> tightness<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.329> yet<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
any real tightness in it and yet it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.469 
any real tightness in it and yet it
doesn't<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> weakness<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.240> what

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
doesn't have a weakness and that's what

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.789 
doesn't have a weakness and that's what
I<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.840> about<00:01:53.060> doing<00:01:54.060> them<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:55.140> feeling

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
I like about doing them with feeling

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.100 
I like about doing them with feeling
that<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.610> put<00:01:56.880> everything<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.960> is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110

but you let your freedom of thought and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.160 
but you let your freedom of thought and
expression<00:02:05.460> go<00:02:06.000> forth<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:06.990> can

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
expression go forth and you really can

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.100 
expression go forth and you really can
accomplish<00:02:07.700> some<00:02:08.700> great<00:02:09.000> quality<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.869> free
