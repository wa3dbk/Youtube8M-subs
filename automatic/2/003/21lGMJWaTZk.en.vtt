actually folded using a six inch square

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.740 
actually folded using a six inch square
so<00:00:36.540> all<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.809> want<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:37.829> ahead<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
so all we want to do is go ahead and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.290 
so all we want to do is go ahead and
fold<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.379> half<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.960> create<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.320> rectangle

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
fold it in half to create a rectangle

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.240 
fold it in half to create a rectangle
open<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> two<00:00:46.739> outer<00:00:46.950> edges

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
open it up and then the two outer edges

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:57.350 
open it up and then the two outer edges
should<00:00:48.000> meet<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.690> center<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:57.149> looks

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
should meet in the center and it looks

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.229 
should meet in the center and it looks
like<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.899> French<00:00:58.620> door<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.309> if<00:01:00.090> you

like you have French door here if you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.270 
like you have French door here if you
flip<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> over<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.989> should<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.680> three

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
flip it over you should have three

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.780 
flip it over you should have three
creases<00:01:02.690> these<00:01:03.830> creases<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.100> outer<00:01:05.369> edges

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
creases these creases on the outer edges

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.859 
creases these creases on the outer edges
will<00:01:06.390> meet<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> center<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:09.420> fold<00:01:09.720> along

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
will meet in the center and fold along

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.830 
will meet in the center and fold along
the<00:01:10.799> center<00:01:11.130> crease<00:01:11.159> or<00:01:11.790> follow<00:01:12.180> along<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the center crease or follow along the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.590 
the center crease or follow along the
center<00:01:13.080> piece<00:01:15.799> just<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.360> should

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
center piece just like so and you should

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
center piece just like so and you should
have<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> piece<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> kind<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.770> has<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.430> little

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
have a piece that kind of has a little

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.249 
have a piece that kind of has a little
flap<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:22.009> either<00:01:23.009> side<00:01:23.479> the<00:01:24.479> next<00:01:24.780> step<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
flap on either side the next step is you

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.030 
flap on either side the next step is you
just<00:01:25.439> go<00:01:25.619> ahead<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> fold<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.670> half

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.630 

just<00:01:30.820> like<00:01:30.970> so<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.660> create<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.380> crease<00:01:33.340> in<00:01:33.370> the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
just like so to create a crease in the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.450 
just like so to create a crease in the
center<00:01:34.020> now<00:01:35.020> with<00:01:35.470> your<00:01:35.650> scissors

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
center now with your scissors

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
you're gonna take now you're gonna cut

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.190 
you're gonna take now you're gonna cut
along<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.500> crease<00:01:41.770> maybe<00:01:42.340> about<00:01:42.640> 1/2<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.570> 3/4

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
along the crease maybe about 1/2 to 3/4

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.160 
along the crease maybe about 1/2 to 3/4
of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.430> way<00:01:45.580> through<00:01:45.750> make<00:01:46.750> sure<00:01:46.930> you<00:01:47.080> only

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170

cut the flap and not the body same on
both<00:01:53.080> sides<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.670> like<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.120> make<00:01:56.110> sure<00:01:56.140> you

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
both sides just like so make sure you

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.200 
both sides just like so make sure you
don't<00:01:56.620> cut<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.340> body<00:01:57.550> you're<00:01:57.820> just<00:01:58.030> cutting

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.790 
the bottom half like so and you can
already<00:02:07.869> see<00:02:08.050> how<00:02:08.350> it's<00:02:08.830> taking<00:02:09.280> its<00:02:09.429> shape

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
already see how it's taking its shape

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.130 
already see how it's taking its shape
the<00:02:11.800> top<00:02:12.160> half<00:02:12.610> maybe<00:02:13.150> about<00:02:13.450> an<00:02:13.630> inch<00:02:13.720> or<00:02:14.110> so

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.350 
that you just fold it down fold it back
up<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.800> if<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.100> flip<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.459> over<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.910> looks<00:02:27.970> like
