00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
technical player and he's got slightly

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.430 
technical player and he's got slightly
better<00:03:57.459> stats<00:03:57.790> in<00:03:58.000> those<00:03:58.150> areas<00:03:58.630> but<00:03:59.109> it's<00:03:59.260> the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
better stats in those areas but it's the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.830 
better stats in those areas but it's the
both<00:03:59.680> feet<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.760> actual<00:04:01.060> sheer<00:04:01.359> pace<00:04:01.630> from

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
both feet and the actual sheer pace from

both feet and the actual sheer pace from
Alexis<00:04:02.290> which<00:04:02.470> makes<00:04:02.709> him<00:04:02.859> what<00:04:03.040> he<00:04:03.130> is<00:04:03.250> on

nine<00:04:38.110> in<00:04:38.320> six<00:04:38.620> which<00:04:38.860> is<00:04:38.890> not<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.280> greatest

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
nine in six which is not the greatest

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.460 
nine in six which is not the greatest

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.920 
goal to gain ever I you know I
appreciate<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.160> but<00:04:42.910> I'd<00:04:43.090> still<00:04:43.480> think<00:04:43.780> he's

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
appreciate that but I'd still think he's

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.480 
appreciate that but I'd still think he's
the<00:04:44.080> best<00:04:44.260> player<00:04:44.410> not<00:04:44.710> with<00:04:44.920> team<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:45.310> had<00:04:45.460> a

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
the best player not with team I had a

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.040 
the best player not with team I had a
few<00:04:45.790> games<00:04:45.970> during<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.540> little<00:04:46.750> session

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
few games during this little session

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.890 
few games during this little session
where<00:04:47.650> I<00:04:47.680> played<00:04:48.040> like<00:04:48.540> absolutely<00:04:49.540> terrible

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
where I played like absolutely terrible

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.580 
where I played like absolutely terrible
lost<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.890> game<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:52.120> pod<00:04:52.960> we<00:04:53.080> didn't<00:04:53.290> even<00:04:53.380> get

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
lost the game and pod we didn't even get

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.080 
lost the game and pod we didn't even get
a<00:04:53.650> look-in<00:04:53.920> because<00:04:54.310> I<00:04:54.400> was<00:04:54.550> so<00:04:54.670> bad<00:04:54.820> at<00:04:54.880> the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
a look-in because I was so bad at the

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.510 
a look-in because I was so bad at the
fending<00:04:55.480> whereas<00:04:56.440> when<00:04:56.650> we<00:04:56.740> go<00:04:56.890> forward<00:04:57.220> you

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
fending whereas when we go forward you

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.100 
fending whereas when we go forward you
can<00:04:57.640> see<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.030> sorts<00:04:58.300> of<00:04:58.390> goals<00:04:58.600> that<00:04:58.780> we<00:04:58.870> score

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
can see the sorts of goals that we score

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.930 
can see the sorts of goals that we score
look<00:04:59.290> at<00:04:59.350> that<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.560> rainbow<00:04:59.890> flick<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.700> then<00:05:00.820> he

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
look at that a rainbow flick and then he

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.030 
look at that a rainbow flick and then he
just<00:05:00.970> gets<00:05:01.360> his<00:05:01.540> leg<00:05:01.810> up<00:05:01.990> there<00:05:02.230> to<00:05:02.710> somehow

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
just gets his leg up there to somehow

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.760 
just gets his leg up there to somehow
score<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.760> goal<00:05:03.970> what<00:05:04.510> an<00:05:04.630> absolute<00:05:05.140> beast<00:05:05.440> he

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
score the goal what an absolute beast he

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.280 
score the goal what an absolute beast he
is<00:05:05.980> and<00:05:06.880> I<00:05:07.360> just<00:05:07.390> think<00:05:07.750> you<00:05:07.810> can<00:05:07.990> score<00:05:08.230> some

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
is and I just think you can score some

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.930 
is and I just think you can score some
of<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.650> best<00:05:08.890> goals<00:05:09.190> on<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.400> game<00:05:09.640> with<00:05:09.820> this

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940
