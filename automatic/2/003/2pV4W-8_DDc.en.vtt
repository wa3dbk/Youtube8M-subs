00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
time so I love this because it has the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.899 
time so I love this because it has the
balance<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.060> hydration<00:01:18.570> from<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.430> argan

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

oil along with the salicylic acid so

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760
