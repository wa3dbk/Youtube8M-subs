ponytail I like to use the comb because

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.840 
ponytail I like to use the comb because
it<00:01:17.260> really<00:01:17.440> gets<00:01:17.620> into<00:01:17.980> the<00:01:18.010> root<00:01:18.340> of<00:01:18.580> my<00:01:18.820> hair

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:34.800 
and then lifts it up so I don't have any
bumps<00:01:20.950> in<00:01:21.160> the<00:01:21.250> end<00:01:33.330> you<00:01:34.330> really<00:01:34.540> don't<00:01:34.690> have

bumps in the end you really don't have

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.660 
bumps in the end you really don't have
