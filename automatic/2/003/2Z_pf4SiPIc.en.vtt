00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:34.140
 hello my lemon happy wednesday quotes 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.760
 navel of the week today's video is going to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.789
 be over 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.859
 the most controversial topic of my videos 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:48.640
 and the truth I receive many messages 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.320
 daily newspapers on the hill from the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.049
 first in the first time I went up the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.320
 video the truth that has been a subject 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:01:00.129
 super super controversial and a subject that 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:04.479
 everyone asks me if it works that 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.310
 If it is bad and if I have used many 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.450
 Sometimes they ask me if I still use the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.600
 Carolina 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.750
 I keep using the hill if I keep using it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.750
 but 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.960
 I tell you that I am now using it in 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.000
 soap and has nothing differentiates 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.860
 liquid in soap only the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.370
 presentation for me has been made a 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.190
 little bit easier to use it and I'm going to 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.560
 present the bar of soap that says 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.990
 creolina for the hair and that many of 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.630
 you say that the hill is not 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.840
 is for hair that can not be used 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.660
 in the hair but it can be used in 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.420
 the hair you just have to use everything 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.420
 with measurements you already know that all the excess 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.360
 it's bad all in excess is bad girls 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.880
 so just take care 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.979
 in the way they are going to use the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.320
 chlorine do not use it too much because 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.399
 They may also resect the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.220
 hair is here to those who will present 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.899
 as well as that my favorite products that 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.440
 right now they have helped me 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.170
 quite as you know the hill helps you 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.480
 Growing hair gives you a lot of strength 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.010
 to your hair that's why you want the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.980
 hair because your hair is made if 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.500
 strong strong strong and give yourself a 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.680
 very strong your hair that is no longer 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.500
 it is and since then you do not lose yourself that much 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.230
 even hair you get more hair 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.590
 because your hair is strong comes out more 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.530
 hair and the truth I have many 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.720
 friends who have used it up to men and 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.640
 to men also works for them 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.530
 all those who ask me if this 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.100
 I can use it men if I 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.650
 can use men 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.650
 this is creolina soap 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.960
 neutral creol soap helps fight 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.920
 dandruff 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.920
 against lice and strengthens the hair 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.000
 inside from this way 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.400
 as if it were black 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.480
 I'll pass it if I subscribe like that 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.540
 step in all the hair only one 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.180
 once with the bar of soap and then after 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.000
 I give myself another wash with my soap 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.890
 you can leave it to us let's say when you 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.930
 you are bathing another you can leave with some 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.480
 5 minutes only for them to act 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.750
 all those ingredients in your hair 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.420
 all those who ask me each one if 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.670
 you have blond hair that if you 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.950
 Darkens hair and blah blah blah 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.920
 those questions 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.300
 maybe the truth is I have not noticed that 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.310
 it happens to me is that the hair that I 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.830
 change with the hair but I tell you 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.250
 I'm using this purple shampoo 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.680
 what's the use to remove all that color 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.220
 ugly yellow that after shampoo and 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.430
 transferred you go to the course already of 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.840
 that your hair changes with the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:19.590
 shampoos or with the use of the plates the 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.830
 in China golden or simply because of 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.830
 change the color of the hair because 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.500
 you occupy your retouch or for the products 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.590
 crosses in your hair is made in 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.290
 purple helps you to go that color 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.020
 like that very yellow like that yellow 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.200
 piolin that yellow that does not look like that 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.570
 so nice then that's taking you out 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.840
 that shampoo like that neutralizes the color 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:49.580
 and it helps you to have a color 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.530
 nice blond is what I'm using 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.270
 I recently cut my hair for all 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.010
 those who ask me what happened that you 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.660
 they no longer have the breeding line what 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.760
 What happens is that I cut my hair because 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.790
 I get angry not so polite and so short but 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.040
 I cut it like here recently and 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.130
 I'm going back to let grow the 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:11.280
 hair again if you want your 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.110
 hair grow you number one you have to 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.330
 identify the type of hair that 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.120
 have if your hair is very very dry 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.100
 you have to hydrate it how are you going 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.020
 moisturize the thing is to use masks 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.650
 deep for your hair you can 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.710
 use one or twice a week 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.360
 how much do you bathe you can use them 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.120
 You can even sleep with the 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.460
 masks so that your hair then 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.770
 as who says have a hydration 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.140
 deeper if you can be in your house 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.690
 all day only as well as a 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.580
 day in spa at home when you
