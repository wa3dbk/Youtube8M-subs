00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
my wizard tower right here and it's a

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.810 
my wizard tower right here and it's a
level<00:00:31.650> 5<00:00:32.000> and<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.360> very<00:00:33.570> nice<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:38.370> goes<00:00:38.610> up

level 5 and it's very nice it it goes up

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.280 
level 5 and it's very nice it it goes up
to<00:00:39.000> level<00:00:39.300> 7<00:00:40.430> upgrade<00:00:41.899> but<00:00:42.899> they<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.140> get

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to level 7 upgrade but they can get

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.650 
to level 7 upgrade but they can get
pretty<00:00:43.500> pricey

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
pretty pricey

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
pretty pricey
the<00:00:45.660> thing<00:00:45.870> about<00:00:45.899> wizard<00:00:46.440> towers<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.100> you

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the thing about wizard towers is you

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.580 
the thing about wizard towers is you
want<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.210> upgrade<00:00:48.390> those<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.320> moat

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
want to upgrade those and moat

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.799 
want to upgrade those and moat
arse-first

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
arse-first

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.660 
arse-first
the<00:00:51.809> reason<00:00:52.140> why<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:53.520> are

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the reason why is because they are

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.639 
the reason why is because they are
probably<00:00:53.960> one<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.199> most<00:00:55.379> powerful

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
probably one of the most powerful

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.029 
probably one of the most powerful
weapons<00:00:56.360> defensively<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> game<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
weapons defensively in the game so you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.029 
weapons defensively in the game so you
want<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.870> get<00:01:00.870> those<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.289> quick<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> fast

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
want to get those up quick and fast

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.380 
want to get those up quick and fast
before<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.640> upgrade<00:01:02.820> any<00:01:03.210> other<00:01:03.390> weapon

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
before you upgrade any other weapon

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.609 
before you upgrade any other weapon
wizard<00:01:06.390> towers<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:08.360> low<00:01:09.360> hitpoints<00:01:09.689> but

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
wizard towers have low hitpoints but

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.940 
wizard towers have low hitpoints but
they<00:01:10.770> cause<00:01:11.040> lots<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.790> damage<00:01:12.470> they<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.500> best

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
they cause lots of damage they are best

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.630 
they cause lots of damage they are best
used<00:01:14.369> when<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.150> keep<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.110> guarded<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.710> use

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
used when you keep them guarded and use

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.649 
used when you keep them guarded and use
them<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.119> guard<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:19.369> resources<00:01:22.490> now<00:01:23.659> there

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
them to guard your resources now there

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.710 
them to guard your resources now there
is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> flaw<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.350> them<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.909> thing<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.150> wizard

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
is a flaw to them the thing about wizard

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.080 
is a flaw to them the thing about wizard
towers<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.950> only<00:01:29.130> target<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.700> enemy

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
towers is they can only target one enemy

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.539 
towers is they can only target one enemy
at<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> time<00:01:30.659> even<00:01:31.530> though<00:01:31.829> they<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.070> lots<00:01:32.400> of

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
at a time even though they do lots of

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.370 
at a time even though they do lots of
damage<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.090> multiple<00:01:33.479> enemies<00:01:33.840> they're<00:01:34.110> only

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
damage to multiple enemies they're only

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.460 
damage to multiple enemies they're only
targeted<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.220> enemy<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:36.320> because<00:01:37.320> of

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
targeted to one enemy and because of

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
targeted to one enemy and because of
that<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.970> cannon<00:01:39.540> or<00:01:39.810> Archer<00:01:40.170> tower<00:01:41.720> takes

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
that if a cannon or Archer tower takes

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.760 
that if a cannon or Archer tower takes
them<00:01:42.990> out<00:01:44.780> then<00:01:45.780> they're<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> shoot

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
them out then they're not going to shoot

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.510 
them out then they're not going to shoot
they're<00:01:47.399> actually<00:01:47.790> going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> reset<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.310> this

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
they're actually going to reset and this

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.170 
they're actually going to reset and this
is<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> problem<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.979> know<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> lot

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
is a problem you know if you have a lot

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.600 
is a problem you know if you have a lot
of<00:01:54.210> goblins<00:01:54.840> taking<00:01:55.259> your<00:01:55.439> resources<00:01:56.219> and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
of goblins taking your resources and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.760 
of goblins taking your resources and
your<00:01:56.750> cannons<00:01:57.750> keep<00:01:57.960> shooting<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.469> one

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
your cannons keep shooting that one

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.770 
your cannons keep shooting that one
enemy<00:01:58.979> before<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.729> wizard<00:02:00.149> tower<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.630> get

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
enemy before your wizard tower can get

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.679 
enemy before your wizard tower can get
the<00:02:00.899> shot<00:02:01.110> off<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:02.270> because<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.420> they're

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the shot off and because of that they're

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.719 
the shot off and because of that they're
gonna<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:04.140> loot<00:02:04.530> your<00:02:04.740> base<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.490> fast

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
gonna just loot your base really fast

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.290 
gonna just loot your base really fast
before<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.509> even<00:02:06.689> shoot<00:02:06.960> them<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:08.789> it's

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
before you can even shoot them so it's

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.580 
before you can even shoot them so it's
always<00:02:09.539> good<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.379> keep<00:02:11.129> your<00:02:11.190> cannons

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
always good to keep your cannons

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.760 
always good to keep your cannons
and<00:02:12.740> your<00:02:13.040> archer<00:02:13.610> towers<00:02:14.170> away<00:02:15.170> from<00:02:15.620> your

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
wizard towers can't think of too many

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.220 
wizard towers can't think of too many
other<00:02:22.250> things<00:02:22.670> besides<00:02:23.510> them<00:02:23.780> being<00:02:23.810> really

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
other things besides them being really

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.960 
other things besides them being really
strong<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.890> should<00:02:24.920> upgrade<00:02:25.220> them<00:02:25.490> first

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970
