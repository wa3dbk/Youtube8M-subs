 that the dragon has come out the dark and 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:13.190
 it seems like it's halloween special not 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.900

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.029
 I know they will have been given 24 hours and it has already 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.590
 after a time of 6 hours from 18 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.900
 hours mind now are not all in but 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.590

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.570

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:37.050

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.210
 the time comes for a special price and 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.250

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.390
 called get the 65 gems I got it 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 I will go see the animation 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:07.620
 he has to paint that dark for 75 gems 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:11.090
 here I have it I like egg a lot 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.979
 and you can not wait to see what comes out 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.979
 and I do the next part 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.720
 well I'm here back and it's ready 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.790
 to hatch the dark elves dragon 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.740
 placing wants to have made a hole and 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.070
 let's see good is kind darkness 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.310
 ice and war let's see the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.310
 animations 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.330
 this would be the last animation 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.750
 but what goes up to level 15 to see the 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.750
 skills you can learn 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.330
 we go to the training center 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.330
 train when looking for the dark elf 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.810
 I say the thief looks like the dragon the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.980
 dragon for the coat he has is good 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.720
 all the attacks that they can learn 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.720
 they open with hammer blows 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.390
 the Reaper 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.379
 freezing wind 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.300
 and blows back 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.960
 and this only until it brings 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.610
 nothing more exclusion to what would be the 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.670
 resounding leech hit 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.200
 currently snow and giant claw at 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.700
 level 1 you do not have these attacks but the 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.780
 level 15 I think that they already have 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.120
 four levels because I have it already 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.790
 all with all 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.569
 or at least he used to have them all 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.280
 and this dragon would be category 4 if not 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.160
 I'm wrong because that is exclusive 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.530
 if out of the best pure or legendary 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.120
 that is to say instead of pure war for what 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.390
 same would be category 5 but as not 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.240
 because category 4 category 5 would be the 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.030
 greater than there are and would be the cigars and the 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.610
 legendary category 3 would be the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.150
 rare hybrids such as chewing gum 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.140
 with poop 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.430
 the pirate I do not know all those after 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.120
 category two would be hybrids 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.740
 normal as can be 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.710
 I do not know if I have a normal hybrid 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:59.100
 promote the case of finding it 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.850
 I do not know if this one is fossil would be 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.220
 of normal but let's go 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.900
 I do not know I do not know how I have all those who are 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.110
 easy the 6 sold and everything 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.910
 I have are brands I had the castro would be 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.980
 today's category 1 category 1 then 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.019
 would be the basics that are ours here 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.310
 and that's all I hope you liked 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.180
 the video and see you in the next 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.180
 goodbye
