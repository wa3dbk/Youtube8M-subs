00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.099
 watsoft or less of these fits 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.870
 today we meet for the woods 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.040
 who news and as you can see in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.269
 I'm not in my room all that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.889
 in fact because there is a little concern at 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.990
 hardware installation level 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.520
 so for now I was proposing you 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.560
 content of this style there because that with 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.449
 the quality of this are finally the micro 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 rather is rather nice it's 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.990
 nice to hear that we do not laugh at my 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.310
 camera hd or it was rather blah blah 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.660
 so it is a small microphone that is 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 integrated into the electronic device 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.130
 so obviously it can not please everyone 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.570
 the world and then the quality is surely 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.640
 l is not so good there is also a 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.320
 price difference just this micro the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.710
 good i think you know blue yeti 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.940
 all that costs 130 140 euros you can 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.440
 find it easily tunes do not know 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.329
 so expensive for a device 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.940
 finally for a short professional microphone 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.140
 I'll go through all this and today we 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.449
 will find for information rather 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 important attention there I warn you 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.570
 moreover in advance that these are 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.129
 speculations that I agree with 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.129
 you so it's something again 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.750
 this is not formalized here 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.949
 we do not know for now 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.149
 but it's still pretty hot or 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.129
 so I wanted to put you 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.020
 so the link in the description of a 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.909
 website that had an interview 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.979
 what you need to know that small 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.290
 information about the game gta 5 which 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.200
 are 40 million copies sold 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.479
 the game is out so there are about eight 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.860
 month with of course with about dlc 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.299
 six to nine vehicles that were released 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.340
 all this of course it is certainly by three 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.450
 vehicles 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 so if you also want rockstar 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.460
 normally at the level of developments 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.259
 of games so gta ie the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.119
 series gt r it's all four to five 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.000
 years we have noticed for example 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.009
 with gta iii liberty city vice city who 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.740
 happens in miami san andreas new york 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.869
 and then we end up in san andreas 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.000
 then apparently from this person 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.350
 there we will meet at liberty city 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.329
 so what is the information 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.470
 it's just a site that's 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.299
 still pretty well known since in fact 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.680
 they are they question praying founded 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.470
 sister Cuba and that is actually 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.110
 voices there we ask questions to a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.650
 kind of artists another composer 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.330
 late author songwriter it's me 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.409
 which is why they are asked 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.290
 questions why about their life 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.789
 private a gift it's like a faq 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.990
 Frequently Asked Questions on youtube this is at 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.940
 about the same thing except here it's 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.110
 a specialized site in there that 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.070
 questions so they ask questions 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.680
 all to people who are 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.610
 relatively known then here the break 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.160
 is one of the questions missed a 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.170
 person named dj roux who is 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.720
 here is a person who composes 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.209
 of music and who the question was 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.040
 asked in fact so it's with my 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.390
 superb accents these watts video 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.560
 games way you win 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.520
 basically what kind of kill game 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.410
 since what you need to know is that 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.540
 does he create music all that is 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.120
 the question here is in which game 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.610
 so I do not know how 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.290
 interpret this question there is what 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.300
 it's really an interpretation 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.830
 level of that question there is that 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.239
 it's in what game his music 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.850
 appear or is the question 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.260
 it's really in what game these 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.269
 last moments finally he played 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.070
 I have a hard time understanding a little 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.450
 sense of his question there there also 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.040
 other questions a little about his life 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.030
 private all that you can also check 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.980
 and of course in the description 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.630
 short so he quoted call of duty so 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.040
 do not care what we do 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.280
 interest it's like what he said 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.650
 venus golbey photo a fat take place in 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.980
 new york again liberty city so basically 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.090
 he's telling us that and after he 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.500
 there was another question that was 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.420
 asked that it serves telling us 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.299
 like what he's currently playing in the 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.480
 again finally here it is in place in the 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.660
 new gta so it is of course 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.329
 of a gta apparently in new york so at 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.829
 new york simply what is 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.360
 still weird enough 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.180
 honestly so basically kind of 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.260
 return to liberty city in quotation marks at 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.579
 which one will find a little 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.380
 by all that I found that quite 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.870
 amazing from me i do not know what 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.100
 do you think of all of this at all 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.480
 he confirms that to us so mozart this 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.040
 that he also added a kind of 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.810
 little parenthesis to which he said he 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.000
 confirmed that rock star him 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.160
 had asked some we'll say this is 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.480
 some music to which he 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.829
 wanted to put in the radio of course 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.110
 when I was sitting not necessarily there 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.790
 will have a 6 gta with the success that has had 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.290
 projects to 5 also knowing that in 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.239
 a few months and she will arrive gta 5 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.280
 on the neg generation of consoles and 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.449
 so here we can see this person has me 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.340
 who is telling us even 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:13.019
 confirmed as what and well there will be 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.630
 well I was sitting that will eventually 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.070
 go out and that finally to him he in 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.320
 working to invade 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.549
 rockstar that in quotation marks for their 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.980
 son is pretty much some music 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.250
 to take a chain or something like 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.720
 it 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.340
 so that's just about every 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.750
 information I'm sorry at the level of 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.449
 the question in fact this I tell myself 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.100
 to think of which honestly I 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.350
 would be more in what type of videos 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.389
 finally in what type of video games in this 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.850
 moment you're in late basically how 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.590
 how could I say in which game 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.290
 type of video games you appear I think 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.470
 or so the question is in what 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.840
 type of video games 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.370
 you're playing recently it was 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.350
 a pond or where the last time 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.430
 you played I do not know if you 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.870
 understand about this is that it is 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.610
 a little weird then their strawberry all that 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.990
 must not begrudge them 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.430
 do not blame me too it's not 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.720
 like that here's big opponent all 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.770
 people to thank you put a little game but the 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.030

 this rate of 6 on my facebook page 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.320
 personal it makes me very happy 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.000
 all at 2400 thought all saints in a bar 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.260
 comments I would of course put the 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.090
 link from this website in the description 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.650
 tell me what you think if 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.030
 you prefer from one to what I do 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.630
 videos of this style so basically 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.280
 in my living room 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.350
 or while you prefer that I 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.690
 do in my room all that is to 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.040
 say with my camera hd but 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.200
 unfortunately the sound and bouet is 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.610
 less good or so you prefer that 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.160
 I make sausage videos of this style 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.240
 there and why not try with i'm going 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.440
 try to buy a mixer also 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.180
 little metal bars you know 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.320
 to install my microphone to which I 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.000
 could do standing breaking news 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.680
 without having any problem but here you go 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.880
 must I order all that and it's 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.560

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.260
 leave his side 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.000
 ethics is ridiculous
