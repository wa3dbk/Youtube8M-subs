00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
if I can find one here and see a

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.340 
if I can find one here and see a
dispenser<00:04:42.520> pressure<00:04:43.270> plate<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:45.000> Spencer<00:04:46.350> so

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
dispenser pressure plate and Spencer so

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.240 
dispenser pressure plate and Spencer so
if<00:04:47.500> I<00:04:47.620> do<00:04:47.680> this<00:04:49.200> for<00:04:50.200> dads<00:04:50.410> are<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:50.920> then<00:04:51.100> I'm<00:04:51.190> I

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
if I do this for dads are and then I'm I

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.250 
if I do this for dads are and then I'm I
put<00:04:51.460> an<00:04:51.550> egg<00:04:51.700> in<00:04:51.730> it<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.630> when<00:04:52.750> I<00:04:52.780> walk<00:04:53.020> over

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
put an egg in it and when I walk over

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.300 
put an egg in it and when I walk over
this<00:04:53.410> it'll<00:04:54.010> shoot<00:04:54.130> at<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.310> wolf<00:04:55.860> so<00:04:56.860> if<00:04:56.980> I<00:04:57.100> get

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
this it'll shoot at a wolf so if I get

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.990 
this it'll shoot at a wolf so if I get
let's<00:04:57.640> say<00:04:57.940> give<00:04:58.270> me<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:59.350> pig<00:05:02.820> put<00:05:03.820> that<00:05:03.940> in

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
let's say give me a pig put that in

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.500 
let's say give me a pig put that in
there<00:05:04.440> he'll<00:05:05.440> shoot<00:05:05.620> up<00:05:05.740> a<00:05:05.770> pig<00:05:08.340> see<00:05:09.340> ah<00:05:12.510> so

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
there he'll shoot up a pig see ah so

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.230 
there he'll shoot up a pig see ah so
basically<00:05:14.250> they<00:05:15.250> will<00:05:15.400> know<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.580> place<00:05:15.850> mobs

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
basically they will know I place mobs

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.380 
basically they will know I place mobs
instead<00:05:16.990> of<00:05:17.020> eggs<00:05:17.970> like<00:05:18.970> oh<00:05:19.090> that's<00:05:19.270> pretty

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
instead of eggs like oh that's pretty

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.720 
instead of eggs like oh that's pretty
cool<00:05:19.510> a<00:05:19.720> pretty<00:05:19.930> cool<00:05:20.080> feature<00:05:20.400> I'm<00:05:21.400> pretty

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
cool a pretty cool feature I'm pretty

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.720 
cool a pretty cool feature I'm pretty
sure<00:05:21.820> that's<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:22.120> for<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.300> snapshot<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:23.730> they

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
sure that's it for the snapshot and they

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.700 
sure that's it for the snapshot and they
also<00:05:24.850> have<00:05:25.060> did<00:05:25.240> language<00:05:25.750> files<00:05:26.050> which<00:05:26.410> says

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
also have did language files which says

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.470 
also have did language files which says
here<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:28.290> ladders<00:05:29.290> I<00:05:29.610> know<00:05:30.610> everybody<00:05:31.360> was

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
here and ladders I know everybody was

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.710 
here and ladders I know everybody was
angry<00:05:31.780> at<00:05:31.840> nova<00:05:32.230> for<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.560> ladders<00:05:33.300> so<00:05:34.300> now<00:05:34.690> I

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
angry at nova for the ladders so now I

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.500 
angry at nova for the ladders so now I
they<00:05:35.410> actually<00:05:35.770> have<00:05:35.950> their<00:05:36.700> collision<00:05:37.300> box

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
they actually have their collision box

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.000 
they actually have their collision box
so<00:05:37.900> I<00:05:37.930> think<00:05:38.050> it<00:05:38.260> can<00:05:38.350> sound<00:05:38.560> on<00:05:38.770> them<00:05:38.860> like

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
so I think it can sound on them like

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.260 
so I think it can sound on them like
honey<00:05:39.280> oops<00:05:40.150> let<00:05:40.390> me<00:05:40.420> down<00:05:40.600> here

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.309 

yeah<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:45.330> can<00:05:45.509> actually<00:05:45.749> go<00:05:45.869> up<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.169> line

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
yeah you can actually go up the line

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.230 
yeah you can actually go up the line
startle<00:05:46.860> them<00:05:46.949> whereas<00:05:47.639> previously<00:05:48.089> you

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
startle them whereas previously you

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.790 
startle them whereas previously you
couldn't<00:05:48.569> that<00:05:49.080> means<00:05:49.289> you<00:05:49.499> can<00:05:49.619> now<00:05:49.770> I

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
couldn't that means you can now I

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.499 
couldn't that means you can now I
actually<00:05:50.099> fix<00:05:50.639> and<00:05:51.860> no<00:05:52.860> card<00:05:53.639> systems<00:05:54.059> for

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
actually fix and no card systems for

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.480 
actually fix and no card systems for
example<00:05:54.839> I<00:05:54.899> used<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.110> have<00:05:55.289> a<00:05:55.319> card<00:05:56.129> system

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
example I used to have a card system

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.129 
example I used to have a card system
like<00:05:56.639> this<00:05:56.819> in<00:05:56.999> place<00:05:57.210> if<00:05:57.360> I<00:05:57.419> can<00:05:57.599> find<00:05:57.749> a<00:05:57.899> cart

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
like this in place if I can find a cart

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:04.670 
like this in place if I can find a cart
I<00:06:00.680> actually<00:06:01.680> put<00:06:02.309> a<00:06:02.339> blocker<00:06:02.639> and<00:06:03.240> then<00:06:04.110> I<00:06:04.529> used

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
I actually put a blocker and then I used

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.040 
I actually put a blocker and then I used
to<00:06:04.740> put<00:06:04.949> that<00:06:05.099> there<00:06:05.339> and<00:06:05.399> cars<00:06:05.999> are<00:06:06.210> and<00:06:06.539> then

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
to put that there and cars are and then

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.189 
to put that there and cars are and then
ya<00:06:08.009> see<00:06:08.369> it<00:06:08.460> works<00:06:08.639> nice<00:06:08.849> and<00:06:09.240> now<00:06:09.360> I<00:06:09.389> you<00:06:10.169> can

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
ya see it works nice and now I you can

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.439 
ya see it works nice and now I you can
creek<00:06:10.559> our<00:06:10.740> systems<00:06:11.129> again<00:06:11.430> so<00:06:12.119> you're<00:06:12.270> like

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
creek our systems again so you're like

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.299 
creek our systems again so you're like
the<00:06:12.479> travel<00:06:12.990> in<00:06:13.169> like<00:06:13.529> mass<00:06:13.740> quantities

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:14.309 
the travel in like mass quantities

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:15.950 
the travel in like mass quantities
although<00:06:15.029> I<00:06:15.059> was<00:06:15.300> actually<00:06:15.479> thinking<00:06:15.659> of

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
although I was actually thinking of

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.799 
although I was actually thinking of
creating<00:06:16.439> another<00:06:16.770> system<00:06:17.430> of<00:06:17.759> cards<00:06:18.089> which

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:18.809 
creating another system of cards which

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:21.799 
creating another system of cards which
would<00:06:18.990> let<00:06:19.139> me<00:06:19.520> get<00:06:20.520> around<00:06:20.729> a<00:06:20.879> lot<00:06:20.999> faster<00:06:21.210> see

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:21.809 
would let me get around a lot faster see

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:26.809 
would let me get around a lot faster see
like<00:06:21.960> that<00:06:23.749> like<00:06:24.749> this<00:06:24.960> and<00:06:25.460> but<00:06:26.460> don't<00:06:26.639> use

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 
like that like this and but don't use

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.279 
like that like this and but don't use
any<00:06:26.969> downside<00:06:27.389> to<00:06:27.479> this<00:06:27.599> is<00:06:27.659> it'll<00:06:28.050> probably

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
any downside to this is it'll probably

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.129 
any downside to this is it'll probably
require<00:06:28.680> a<00:06:28.710> lotta<00:06:29.719> you<00:06:30.719> know<00:06:30.870> I'll<00:06:31.050> probably

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
require a lotta you know I'll probably

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.909 
require a lotta you know I'll probably
require<00:06:31.620> a<00:06:31.649> lot<00:06:31.889> of<00:06:31.919> iron<00:06:32.279> the<00:06:32.879> critics<00:06:33.360> these

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
require a lot of iron the critics these

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.079 
require a lot of iron the critics these
regardless<00:06:34.919> it<00:06:35.039> works<00:06:35.189> pretty<00:06:35.279> well<00:06:35.399> you<00:06:35.969> know

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:36.089 
regardless it works pretty well you know

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:38.149 
regardless it works pretty well you know
you<00:06:36.779> can<00:06:36.839> travel<00:06:37.169> long<00:06:37.439> periods<00:06:37.889> and<00:06:37.979> it's<00:06:38.129> a

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
you can travel long periods and it's a

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.309 
you can travel long periods and it's a
lot<00:06:38.279> faster<00:06:38.459> than<00:06:38.759> my<00:06:38.879> cart<00:06:39.149> I'm<00:06:40.020> gonna<00:06:40.169> in<00:06:40.259> the

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 
lot faster than my cart I'm gonna in the

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.629 
lot faster than my cart I'm gonna in the
