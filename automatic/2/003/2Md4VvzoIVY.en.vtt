fingerprint sensor fingerprint reader on

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.120 
fingerprint sensor fingerprint reader on
the<00:00:11.639> iPhone<00:00:12.450> 5s<00:00:12.780> first<00:00:13.620> thing<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.830> want<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.009> do

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
the iPhone 5s first thing you want to do

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.939 
the iPhone 5s first thing you want to do
is<00:00:14.340> go<00:00:14.700> into<00:00:14.940> settings<00:00:15.740> once<00:00:16.740> you're<00:00:16.859> on

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
is go into settings once you're on

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.929 
is go into settings once you're on
settings<00:00:17.369> tap<00:00:17.910> on<00:00:18.090> general<00:00:18.410> right<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
settings tap on general right here and

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.779 
settings tap on general right here and
then<00:00:21.380> scroll<00:00:22.380> down<00:00:22.410> until<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:22.980> passcode

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
then scroll down until you see passcode

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.400 
then scroll down until you see passcode
and<00:00:24.090> fingerprint<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.900> set<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:25.109> both

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and fingerprint you have to set up both

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.839 
and fingerprint you have to set up both
a<00:00:25.650> passcode<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:27.119> fingerprint<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.490> here<00:00:29.490> we

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
a passcode and a fingerprint so here we

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.770 
a passcode and a fingerprint so here we
are<00:00:30.080> going<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.320> turn<00:00:31.650> passcode<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.780> we'll

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
are going to turn passcode on we'll

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.420 
are going to turn passcode on we'll
enter<00:00:34.079> our<00:00:34.200> passcode<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:39.950> then<00:00:40.950> another

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
enter our passcode here and then another

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.630 
enter our passcode here and then another
feature<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.540> nice<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.219> choose

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
feature that is nice is you can choose

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.910 
feature that is nice is you can choose
how<00:00:45.270> long<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.570> want<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.200> passcode<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.829> be

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
how long you want for the passcode to be

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.979 
how long you want for the passcode to be
required<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:48.000> immediately<00:00:48.570> which<00:00:48.960> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
required you can do immediately which is

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.040 
required you can do immediately which is
pretty<00:00:49.469> strict<00:00:50.030> five<00:00:51.030> minutes<00:00:51.360> or<00:00:51.480> 15<00:00:51.780> minutes

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
pretty strict five minutes or 15 minutes

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.600 
pretty strict five minutes or 15 minutes
it's<00:00:52.170> kind<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> good<00:00:52.620> window<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.280> lets<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
it's kind of a good window that lets you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.240 
it's kind of a good window that lets you
not<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> enter<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.420> every<00:00:54.809> time<00:00:55.250> you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
not have to enter that every time you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.340 
not have to enter that every time you
want<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> use<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.820> phone<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.570> still<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.140> able

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
want to use your phone but still be able

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.099 
want to use your phone but still be able
to<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.579> know<00:00:59.699> get<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.329> security<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.870> comes

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
to you know get that security that comes

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.920 
to you know get that security that comes
from<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> after<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> get<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.539> passcode

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
from it so after you get your passcode

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.500 
from it so after you get your passcode
set<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> fingerprints<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.729> so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
set up you can go to fingerprints and so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.230 
set up you can go to fingerprints and so
here<00:01:07.170> we're<00:01:07.439> able<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:08.010> add<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> fingerprint<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
here we're able to add a fingerprint and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.969 
here we're able to add a fingerprint and
to<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.220> basically<00:01:11.900> need<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
to do this you just basically need to

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.890 
to do this you just basically need to
press<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.159> finger<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.970> home<00:01:15.090> button

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.840 

repeatedly<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.520> soon<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
repeatedly so as I do this as soon as it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.490 
repeatedly so as I do this as soon as it
senses<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.299> I'm<00:01:21.630> getting<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.049> little<00:01:22.200> bit<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
senses it I'm getting a little bit of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.399 
senses it I'm getting a little bit of
vibration<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.439> we'll<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.100> few<00:01:26.460> times

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
vibration and we'll do this a few times

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.880 
vibration and we'll do this a few times
until<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.950> has<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.280 

and<00:01:33.430> it's<00:01:33.550> going<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.760> ask<00:01:33.880> us<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.300> change<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:35.020> so

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
and it's going to ask us to change it so

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.180 
and it's going to ask us to change it so
we<00:01:35.470> get<00:01:35.710> some<00:01:36.130> different<00:01:36.690> ridges<00:01:37.690> here<00:01:38.440> for

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
we get some different ridges here for

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.280 
we get some different ridges here for
depending<00:01:39.640> on<00:01:39.730> how<00:01:40.000> we<00:01:40.060> are<00:01:40.510> actually<00:01:40.720> holding

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
depending on how we are actually holding

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.760 
depending on how we are actually holding
the<00:01:41.590> phone<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.970> that<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.270> can<00:01:43.480> more<00:01:44.260> accurately

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
the phone so that it can more accurately

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.680 
the phone so that it can more accurately
check<00:01:45.370> this<00:01:45.520> out<00:01:45.730> so<00:01:45.760> we<00:01:45.880> have<00:01:46.030> success<00:01:46.480> we've

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
check this out so we have success we've

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.610 
check this out so we have success we've
trained<00:01:47.020> one<00:01:47.260> finger<00:01:47.650> will<00:01:48.370> hit<00:01:48.490> continue<00:01:48.850> and

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
trained one finger will hit continue and

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.310 
trained one finger will hit continue and
you<00:01:50.620> can<00:01:51.420> keep<00:01:52.420> going<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.900> can<00:01:53.020> add<00:01:53.170> another

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
you can keep going you can add another

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.110 
you can keep going you can add another
one<00:01:53.650> we'll<00:01:53.830> add<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:53.979> thumb<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.820> just<00:01:57.970> keep

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
one we'll add a thumb and we just keep

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.080 
one we'll add a thumb and we just keep
tapping<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.370> it<00:02:00.370> will<00:02:00.490> get<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.610> vibration

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
tapping it and it will get a vibration

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.650 
tapping it and it will get a vibration
as<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:03.250> occurs<00:02:05.550> it's<00:02:06.550> getting<00:02:06.910> getting<00:02:07.360> some

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
as this occurs it's getting getting some

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.870 
as this occurs it's getting getting some
different<00:02:08.100> different<00:02:09.100> angles<00:02:09.520> different

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
different different angles different

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.430 
different different angles different
ridges<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.570> hopefully<00:02:10.929> we<00:02:11.020> get<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.170> better

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
ridges so that hopefully we get a better

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.040 
ridges so that hopefully we get a better
on<00:02:11.650> lock<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:13.000> believe<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:13.540> will<00:02:13.780> learn

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
on lock and I believe this will learn

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.030 
on lock and I believe this will learn
more<00:02:14.380> over<00:02:14.739> time<00:02:14.980> as<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.670> what<00:02:16.030> your<00:02:16.650> thumb<00:02:17.650> or

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
more over time as to what your thumb or

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.449 
more over time as to what your thumb or
your<00:02:18.070> finger<00:02:18.610> does<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.830> end<00:02:21.010> up<00:02:21.190> with

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
your finger does so that you end up with

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.199 
your finger does so that you end up with
an<00:02:21.760> overall<00:02:22.150> better<00:02:23.040> fingerprint<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.910> we<00:02:28.060> have

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
an overall better fingerprint so we have

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.690 
an overall better fingerprint so we have
success<00:02:28.690> again<00:02:28.989> we've<00:02:29.170> trained<00:02:29.650> two<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.580> our

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
success again we've trained two of our

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.699 
success again we've trained two of our
fingers<00:02:32.550> think<00:02:33.780> yeah<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:34.959> can<00:02:35.110> add<00:02:35.290> more<00:02:35.560> we

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
fingers think yeah we can add more we

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.100 
fingers think yeah we can add more we
had<00:02:35.860> up<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.190> five<00:02:36.459> so<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.239> can<00:02:37.390> do<00:02:37.600> another

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
had up to five so we can do another

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.990 
had up to five so we can do another
finger<00:02:41.110> or<00:02:41.260> thumb<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.890> way<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.070> can<00:02:42.340> make

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
finger or thumb that way you can make

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.460 
finger or thumb that way you can make
sure<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.390> no<00:02:43.510> matter<00:02:43.630> which<00:02:43.870> pocket<00:02:44.380> you

sure that no matter which pocket you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.100 
sure that no matter which pocket you
have<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.739> in<00:02:44.860> or<00:02:45.070> how<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.250> have<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.640> oriented

download all of these free apps with iOS

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.120 
download all of these free apps with iOS
7<00:03:50.790> with<00:03:51.300> your<00:03:51.420> new<00:03:51.510> iOS<00:03:51.690> 7<00:03:52.170> device<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:52.950> let's

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
7 with your new iOS 7 device so let's

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.160 
7 with your new iOS 7 device so let's
hop<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:53.430> here<00:03:53.700> we<00:03:54.000> have<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.210> purchase<00:03:54.600> this<00:03:54.810> so

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
hop in here we have to purchase this so

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.540 
hop in here we have to purchase this so
typically<00:03:55.710> this<00:03:55.830> would<00:03:55.980> ask<00:03:56.190> for<00:03:56.340> our

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
typically this would ask for our

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.690 
typically this would ask for our
password<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.710> instead<00:03:58.710> we<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.040> scan<00:03:59.520> our

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
password and instead we can scan our

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.540 
password and instead we can scan our
fingerprint<00:04:00.680> tap<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.830> on<00:04:01.920> there<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:05.400> took

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
fingerprint tap it on there and it took

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.460 
fingerprint tap it on there and it took
two<00:04:05.760> tries<00:04:06.030> but<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.450> went<00:04:06.630> through<00:04:06.870> here<00:04:07.290> it's

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
two tries but it went through here it's

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.320 
two tries but it went through here it's
just<00:04:07.620> asking<00:04:07.770> us<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.280> verify<00:04:08.670> such<00:04:09.120> as<00:04:09.240> the

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
just asking us to verify such as the
