00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.830
 mayonnaise you can have your mayonnaise 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.840
 buy from the supermarket then you have the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.400
 standard flavors you always have sweet 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.529
 mayonnaise i don't know if there is 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.400
 have been on holiday in france or in 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.810
 Belgium 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.550
 it tasted just like you actually did 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.920
 in my opinion should taste 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.830
 fresh acid if you make mayonnaise yourself 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.210
 you have control over all ingredients 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.670
 so you can decide what the 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.500
 are you used whether you like the garlic or 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.960
 don't put garlic in or you go with 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.000
 does olive oil or without olive oil or 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.900
 whatever oil you have it yourself 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.570
 totally in control 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.190
 you can do that instead of lemon juice you can 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.530
 also use vinegar how the sun 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.180
 in short you can do a lot of submitters yourself 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.519
 determine you want something more mustard in it 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.869
 put the once more mustard in hence 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.010
 that I just want to show how you yourself 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:05.770
 but you can make your house 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.830
 you need that and you need the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.979
 killing a line with you are i have 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.119
 taken a nice fresh white wine vinegar 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:19.180
 sunflower oil or according to olive oil 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.119
 and mustard and salt and pepper we start 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.810
 to be separated with an egg 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.520
 giving you this way protein in one 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.329
 tray 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.329
 tackle about throwing 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.960
 then we had a little mustard 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.530
 teaspoon slightly less one 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.530
 teaspoon 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.400
 we mix together with the hole you 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:18.410
 mentioned a little bit we are 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.490
 we take the oil and the high end beginning 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.490
 add small droplets 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.540
 mayonnaise exists for eighty families that 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.400
 all sorts so we stir just as long 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.530
 until the mayonnaise is thick enough pink 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.880
 want this too you can do yourself 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.440
 determine 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.340
 factory mayonnaise is always positions 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.800
 so also told half a week can 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.709
 stop and open instead of oil 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:06.640
 on another 100 yogurt or cottage cheese if you are in 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.640
 want to have something crisp mayonnaise 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.210
 I am fat enough so you but we 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.680
 still have to add flavor 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.680
 so I add a little salt 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.280
 and then you are pepper from the mill 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.620
 evert proof if it is on taste 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.340
 I think it's still a bit 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.340
 lemon juice lady may but we something fresher 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:25.710
 just have a taste for me see nice 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.760
 remember it is from fresh eggs 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.710
 made 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.290
 so it doesn't last as long as you want 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.020
 this mayonnaise in large quantities 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.030
 and I recommend getting sterilized 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.889
 take eggs and those are both big ones 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.410
 hand for sale that are thereby is the 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.770
 mayonnaise has a longer shelf life 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.770
 good luck
