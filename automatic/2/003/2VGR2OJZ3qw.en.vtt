that<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.840> after<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.710> initial<00:00:53.010> cost<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that is after the initial cost of

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.090 
that is after the initial cost of

thirteen to twenty thousand dollars for
the<00:00:56.250> turbine<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.210> question<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> how<00:00:58.199> do

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
the turbine now the question is how do

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.279 
the turbine now the question is how do
you<00:00:58.379> scale<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.579> bring<00:00:59.760> down<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> costs<00:01:00.660> so

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you scale to bring down the costs so

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.039 
you scale to bring down the costs so
that<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.399> truly<00:01:02.609> provide<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that that we can truly provide the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.320 
that that we can truly provide the
economic<00:01:04.830> argument<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> powerful

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
economic argument that is a powerful

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.200 
economic argument that is a powerful
argument<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.369> drive<00:01:08.610> people<00:01:08.640> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
argument so that it can drive people to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.789 
argument so that it can drive people to
change<00:01:09.420> behavior<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.170> make<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.470> kind<00:01:10.680> of
