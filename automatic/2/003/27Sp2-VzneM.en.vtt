retails for 1895 now i'll show you how
the<00:01:12.600> system<00:01:13.670> works<00:01:17.390> basically<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.840> start<00:01:18.900> out

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the system works basically you start out

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.929 
the system works basically you start out
with<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> tracks<00:01:19.830> these<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> tracks

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
with the tracks these are the tracks

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.910 
with the tracks these are the tracks
pre-installed<00:01:21.750> they're<00:01:22.470> interlocking

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
pieces six inches in length you just

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.980 
pieces six inches in length you just
mark<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.740> straight<00:01:25.979> line<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.520> boat<00:01:26.990> start

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
on the right side mark where the holes

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.510 
on the right side mark where the holes
have<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.420> drilled<00:01:30.810> drill<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> holes<00:01:32.100> put

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
have to be drilled drill the holes put

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.380 
have to be drilled drill the holes put
the<00:01:32.670> screws<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.210> put<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.930> next<00:01:34.200> piece<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:35.390> same

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the screws in put the next piece on same

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.300 
the screws in put the next piece on same
thing<00:01:36.600> over<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:36.869> then<00:01:37.590> put<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> last<00:01:38.159> piece

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
thing over here then put the last piece

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.940 
thing over here then put the last piece
on<00:01:38.729> when<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.420> done<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.380> score<00:01:40.740> off

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
on when you're done you can score off

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.700 
on when you're done you can score off
this<00:01:41.159> piece<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.700> break<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.450> comes<00:01:43.290> off<00:01:43.500> nice

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
this piece and break it comes off nice

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.069 
this piece and break it comes off nice
and<00:01:43.770> clean<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.240> your<00:01:45.270> 18<00:01:45.750> inches

and clean then you have your 18 inches

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.990 
and clean then you have your 18 inches
of<00:01:46.229> track<00:01:46.500> put<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.790> basically

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
of track put on here and then basically

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240 
of track put on here and then basically
what<00:01:48.869> you're<00:01:49.020> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.979> use<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
what you're going to do is use the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.609 
what you're going to do is use the
modular<00:01:50.820> pieces<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.420> design<00:01:51.780> your<00:01:51.810> system<00:01:52.200> now

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
modular pieces to design your system now

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.980 
modular pieces to design your system now
i'll<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.130> make<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> typical<00:01:53.820> design<00:01:53.970> here's<00:01:54.930> a
