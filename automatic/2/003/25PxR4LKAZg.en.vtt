00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.049
 diop people how are you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.210
 so much really very very very 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.529
 well I hope you dare to form in 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.670
 anyway me today I'm here for 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.290
 comment on this new video 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.670
 so we end up on call of duty 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.719
 kid for once again a new 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.340
 tutoring tips on how to 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.680
 work his shoot how to optimize it 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.390
 how to perform it in quotation marks and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.550
 so here is first of all useless 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.930
 to go multiplayer et cetera I you 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.250
 not advise especially not in 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.240
 multiplayer to work your shoot 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.740
 It's not terrible 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.789
 after that it's true that to make 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.380
 daily training, that is to say 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.660
 to improve on low average conan 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.430
 and the best but to perform for 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 lead in quotation marks his shoot 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.370
 to optimize his shoot rather because 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.160
 that to perform at not his life finally brief 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 it's the private part so everything 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.250
 first at the configuration level of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.899
 the part me I advise you the matte 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.700
 octane obtained that are supporting me when 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.530
 even a lot of kielce and a small map 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.270
 compared to the other maps we have but 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.920
 it's a map there is still a small 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.050
 little hot water I do not advise 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.340
 especially strike zone it seems to me 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.109
 what is her name like this is strike 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.579
 zone because that's a lot of these 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.930
 far too much close combat and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.309
 by far you can not really 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.850
 work your hot we say that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.739
 on octane 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.970
 there is a little bit of everything and so here is 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.020
 the game modes you put what you 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.909
 would you like me to advise you 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.530
 domination without you put the mode of 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.479
 game in which you play the most and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.250
 here they have recalled at the level of 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.080
 low options we do not touch here 1 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.510
 no we are not touching so you 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.920
 start a first game like this with 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.440
 your friends on the other hand just forgotten here 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.580
 two meters sibot so sibot years rookie 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.780
 you start a party with your friends 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.800
 like that and you go as you 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.780
 practice putting yourself a little bit in 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.190
 the bath and you try to really 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.990
 concentrate on your fall ie 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.700
 you do not talk you focus 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.720
 you actually put in the party and 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.670
 you tell yourself that you need to 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.710
 put all your ball and the least 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.180
 possible balls all your balls on 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.320
 your opponent and there you go 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.580
 start a little bit of react other 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.320
 shoot I advise you to do a 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.060
 normal part like that you'll see 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.920
 ah okay a little heat you 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.180
 in quotation marks after so the part 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.410
 is over the first part with the 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.060
 sibot we go back to 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.740
 configurations of the party we go in 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.619
 options it seems to me that these options of 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.520
 play here and we activate the shot in the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.950
 head only 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.030
 why yours shoot to kill 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.070
 the enemy to have them 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.670
 obligatorily directed on the head of 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.649
 your opponent 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.869
 my head is still a little smaller 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.280
 place at the level of the rest of the body and 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.110
 so there you will have to be still 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.040
 more meticulous on your shoot and there 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.330
 you will actually start 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.350
 train it you will see that after a 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.640
 month I played a lot like that on 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.739
 black up there young released a video 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.060
 for the curious a long time ago on my 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.100
 chair I released a video about 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.510
 the shoot on black ops two and you 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.620
 go see that I started a 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.760
 little bit because at the beginning it's true 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.980
 that help with aiming she is a lot 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.380
 less assisted on ghost than on wheat 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.220
 on black ops pardons and so there the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.209
 little tips that I give you 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.310
 to see that after that it's going to be a 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.510
 reflex is going to have a very good month shoot 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.799
 at first I had a lot of trouble 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.299
 do a dozen parties like that 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.769
 someone in the head only game 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.110
 launched solo I was focusing on my 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.790
 shoot and since that is much better 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.780
 more because it's true that 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.850
 at first I had a little trouble and 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.290
 so here's wanting to give up some 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.569
 game options you put the tyrants the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.980
 head only 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.930
 and so here you go 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.159
 at the level of the class g not specified 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.439
 but I really wanted with a class 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.150
 that you appreciate for example me 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.370
 I like the sap sbs that's game 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.689
 the laser visa team so that's 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.010
 really what I advice you 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.909
 masters to improve your shooter 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.650
 it is the accessory that I am 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.420
 would advise since the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.430
 ridiculous basic are not terrible on 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.409
 some weapons and so here I am you 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.389
 also advise to put some 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.370
 thing to really have a good shoot 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.379
 to optimize the recoil of your weapon 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.669
 to minimize the recoil rather the 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.040
 handle as an accessory it's really 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.150
 very well and here we are so forget 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.500
 not the games with a class and 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.760
 halls that interests you does not want 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.769
 that weapons you do not play with in 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.329
 multiplayer and so that's so I hope 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.109
 that the little trick will have made you 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.669
 pleasure 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.409
 do not hesitate to like commented on 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.659
 share the video to all your friends at 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.609
 your team and it's your entourage for 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.689
 help me if you feel like it and so 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.739
 So here I am telling you to very 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.069
