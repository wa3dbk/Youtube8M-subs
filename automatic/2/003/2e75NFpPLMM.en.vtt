Ziggler<00:01:17.430> which<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.820> law<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.240> speaking<00:01:18.780> of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
Ziggler which I law and speaking of

Ziggler which I law and speaking of
bulbs<00:01:19.140> or<00:01:19.200> I'll<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.650> him<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
bulbs or I'll get to him in just a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.149 
bulbs or I'll get to him in just a
minute<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:22.229> he's<00:01:22.500> out<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.710> money<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
minute and then he's out of money in the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.710 
minute and then he's out of money in the
bank<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.520> he<00:01:23.549> can't<00:01:23.850> even<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.119> thrown<00:01:24.390> into<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
bank so he can't even be thrown into the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.179 
bank so he can't even be thrown into the
ladder<00:01:24.960> matches<00:01:25.259> which<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.680> guess<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.070> high

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
ladder matches which I guess and high

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.679 
ladder matches which I guess and high
inside<00:01:26.460> that's<00:01:26.670> good<00:01:26.880> because<00:01:27.060> maybe<00:01:27.270> they'll

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
inside that's good because maybe they'll

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.840 
inside that's good because maybe they'll
use<00:01:27.930> his<00:01:28.409> spot<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.890> put<00:01:29.040> another<00:01:29.250> young<00:01:29.520> guy<00:01:29.700> in

knowing them they'll probably bring them

brought<00:03:38.400> up<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:38.849> Tony<00:03:39.209> Cesaro<00:03:39.599> was<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> little

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
brought up and Tony Cesaro was a little

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.800 
brought up and Tony Cesaro was a little
unfair<00:03:40.439> to<00:03:40.650> roll<00:03:41.099> their<00:03:41.549> use<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:42.299> him<00:03:42.629> yet

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
unfair to roll their use of him yet

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.869 
unfair to roll their use of him yet
because<00:03:43.109> it's<00:03:43.680> still<00:03:43.979> very<00:03:44.189> early<00:03:44.370> but<00:03:44.790> my

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
because it's still very early but my

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.179 
because it's still very early but my

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990

about<00:04:44.850> him<00:04:45.060> earlier<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.540> think<00:04:46.050> a<00:04:46.140> reason<00:04:46.440> why<00:04:46.560> I

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
about him earlier I think a reason why I

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.770 
about him earlier I think a reason why I
that<00:04:47.280> that<00:04:47.670> little<00:04:47.880> segment<00:04:48.420> I<00:04:48.540> thought<00:04:48.720> it

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
that that little segment I thought it

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.690 
that that little segment I thought it
was<00:04:48.870> actually<00:04:49.230> pretty<00:04:49.260> damn<00:04:49.620> good<00:04:49.830> at<00:04:50.550> least

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
was actually pretty damn good at least

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.220 
was actually pretty damn good at least
he<00:04:50.850> showed<00:04:51.000> emotion<00:04:51.300> when<00:04:51.660> he<00:04:51.750> told<00:04:51.930> Vicky

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
he showed emotion when he told Vicky

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.870 
he showed emotion when he told Vicky
Guerrero<00:04:52.290> that's<00:04:53.130> where<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.400> need<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.610> be<00:04:53.700> any

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
Guerrero that's where I need to be any

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.220 
Guerrero that's where I need to be any
point<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.240> around<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:54.510> order<00:04:54.720> in<00:04:54.840> which<00:04:54.870> I

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
point in around the order in which I

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.810 
point in around the order in which I
guess<00:04:55.530> he<00:04:56.010> was<00:04:56.100> supposed<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.370> probably<00:04:56.670> have<00:04:56.790> a

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
guess he was supposed to probably have a

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.980 
guess he was supposed to probably have a
match<00:04:57.030> with<00:04:57.180> her<00:04:57.270> in<00:04:57.330> order<00:04:57.600> no<00:04:57.720> way<00:04:57.840> out<00:04:57.960> and

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
match with her in order no way out and

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.440 
match with her in order no way out and
now<00:04:58.350> we<00:04:58.410> will<00:04:58.650> have<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.010> either<00:04:59.240> he<00:05:00.240> when<00:05:00.390> he

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
now we will have that either he when he

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.090 
now we will have that either he when he
was<00:05:00.570> telling<00:05:00.840> Vickie<00:05:01.140> Guerrero<00:05:01.440> that<00:05:02.010> he

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
was telling Vickie Guerrero that he

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.280 
was telling Vickie Guerrero that he
needs<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.370> be<00:05:02.520> out<00:05:02.640> there<00:05:02.760> on<00:05:02.850> his<00:05:02.910> own<00:05:03.150> I<00:05:03.450> I

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
needs to be out there on his own I I

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.110 
needs to be out there on his own I I
thought<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:04.860> was<00:05:05.010> good<00:05:05.280> because<00:05:05.460> he<00:05:05.700> really

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
thought that was good because he really

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.030 
thought that was good because he really
made<00:05:06.270> me<00:05:06.300> believe<00:05:06.540> in<00:05:06.780> not<00:05:06.960> just<00:05:06.990> because<00:05:07.290> he

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
made me believe in not just because he

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.590 
made me believe in not just because he
was<00:05:08.070> saying<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.670> and<00:05:09.000> because<00:05:09.270> I<00:05:09.300> honestly

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
was saying that and because I honestly

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.570 
was saying that and because I honestly
think<00:05:09.990> he<00:05:10.170> believes<00:05:10.530> that<00:05:10.710> because<00:05:11.040> yeah<00:05:11.190> he

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
think he believes that because yeah he

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.150 
think he believes that because yeah he
has<00:05:11.700> every<00:05:12.360> fucking<00:05:12.810> reason<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.680> believe<00:05:13.920> that

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
has every fucking reason to believe that

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.680 
has every fucking reason to believe that
he<00:05:14.580> should<00:05:14.760> be<00:05:14.790> out<00:05:15.000> there<00:05:15.180> doing<00:05:15.480> something

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
he should be out there doing something

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.000 
he should be out there doing something
he's<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:15.900> great<00:05:16.170> worker<00:05:16.200> he's<00:05:16.950> very

matches<00:05:19.980> the<00:05:20.250> CM<00:05:20.490> Punk<00:05:20.760> what<00:05:21.360> they<00:05:21.450> do<00:05:21.570> after

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
matches the CM Punk what they do after

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.960 
matches the CM Punk what they do after
that<00:05:22.610> but<00:05:23.610> I'm<00:05:23.940> in<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.210> back<00:05:24.390> of<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.660> line<00:05:25.970> ok

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
that but I'm in the back of the line ok

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.280 
that but I'm in the back of the line ok
that's<00:05:27.120> what<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.450> don't<00:05:27.720> even<00:05:27.840> want<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.110> rant

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
that's what I don't even want to rant

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.080 
that's what I don't even want to rant
about<00:05:28.380> this<00:05:28.680> even<00:05:28.920> more<00:05:29.070> like<00:05:29.370> it's<00:05:29.550> just<00:05:29.700> my

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
about this even more like it's just my

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.030 
about this even more like it's just my
whole<00:05:30.270> point<00:05:30.480> is<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:31.200> think<00:05:31.290> that<00:05:31.650> if

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
whole point is that I think that if

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.590 
whole point is that I think that if
there<00:05:32.250> weren't<00:05:32.370> any<00:05:32.550> suspensions<00:05:33.180> if<00:05:33.420> there

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
there weren't any suspensions if there

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.170 
there weren't any suspensions if there
was<00:05:33.720> no<00:05:33.870> Wellness<00:05:34.290> Policy<00:05:34.640> they<00:05:35.640> probably

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
was no Wellness Policy they probably

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.480 
was no Wellness Policy they probably
would<00:05:36.570> never<00:05:36.720> even<00:05:36.960> be<00:05:37.080> forced<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:37.740> put<00:05:37.950> take<00:05:38.460> a
