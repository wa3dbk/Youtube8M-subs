get<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.640> me<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:32.910> anyway<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> four<00:00:33.750> perks<00:00:33.989> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
get to me but anyway the four perks that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.510 
get to me but anyway the four perks that
I<00:00:34.200> think<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.620> should<00:00:34.800> be<00:00:34.829> using<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.370> this

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
I think that you should be using on this

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.459 
I think that you should be using on this
map<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.940> mob<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.300> Dead<00:00:36.510> first<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.440> all

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
map of mob of the Dead first of all

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
map of mob of the Dead first of all
there's<00:00:37.649> only<00:00:37.710> 5<00:00:37.980> perks<00:00:38.250> available<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
there's only 5 perks available so it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.549 
there's only 5 perks available so it
makes<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> little<00:00:39.719> bit<00:00:39.840> easier<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.379> other

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
makes it a little bit easier some other

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.260 
makes it a little bit easier some other
maps<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.920> moon<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.340> think<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.790> 7<00:00:42.120> or<00:00:42.180> 8

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
maps like moon I think have like 7 or 8

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.810 
maps like moon I think have like 7 or 8
perks<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.079> mob<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> dental<00:00:44.399> only<00:00:44.520> has<00:00:44.640> 5

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
perks but mob the dental only has 5

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.610 
perks but mob the dental only has 5
perks<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.329> though<00:00:45.840> those<00:00:46.079> ones<00:00:46.260> are<00:00:46.379> double

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
perks so though those ones are double

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.610 
perks so though those ones are double

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
now in my opinion there's going to be a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.840 
now in my opinion there's going to be a
toss-up<00:00:55.140> between<00:00:55.350> two<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.070> I'm<00:00:56.579> sure<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> lot

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
toss-up between two and I'm sure a lot

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.040 
toss-up between two and I'm sure a lot
of<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.090> guys<00:00:57.180> share<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> same<00:00:57.660> opinion

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
of you guys share the same opinion

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.720 
of you guys share the same opinion
between<00:00:58.620> two<00:00:58.770> perks<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.160> really<00:00:59.460> don't<00:00:59.609> do

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
between two perks that really don't do

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.000 
between two perks that really don't do
you<00:00:59.850> any<00:01:00.000> justice<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.020> them<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.320> electric

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you any justice one of them is electric

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.590 
you any justice one of them is electric
cherry<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> other<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.149> Deadshot

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
cherry and the other one is Deadshot

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.899 
cherry and the other one is Deadshot
daiquiri<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:04.500> um<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.430> reason<00:01:05.549> why<00:01:05.760> is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
daiquiri now um the reason why is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.219 
daiquiri now um the reason why is
because<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.180> later<00:01:06.360> rounds<00:01:06.540> both<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.140> them

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
because on later rounds both of them

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.510 
because on later rounds both of them
just<00:01:07.350> don't<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.650> anything<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> these<00:01:08.130> zombies

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
just don't do anything to these zombies

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.039 
just don't do anything to these zombies
unfortunately<00:01:09.000> Deadshot<00:01:09.600> daiquiri<00:01:09.720> was

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
unfortunately Deadshot daiquiri was

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
unfortunately Deadshot daiquiri was
supposed<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.409> scaled<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> higher<00:01:11.220> rounds

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
supposed to be scaled to higher rounds

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.760 
supposed to be scaled to higher rounds
but<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:11.939> does<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.450> seem<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.840> do<00:01:13.110> much<00:01:13.320> at

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
but it just does not seem to do much at

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.440 
but it just does not seem to do much at
least<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.070> myself<00:01:14.189> until<00:01:14.670> unless<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.119> down

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
least for myself until unless I get down

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.330 
least for myself until unless I get down
it<00:01:16.080> kills<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> zombies<00:01:16.710> which<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.189> very

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it kills the zombies which is just very

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.609 
it kills the zombies which is just very
odd<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.610> myself<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.630> anyway<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> number<00:01:19.470> one

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
odd to myself but anyway the number one

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.140 
odd to myself but anyway the number one
essential<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.100> obviously<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.670> Juggernog

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
essential one obviously is Juggernog

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.880 
essential one obviously is Juggernog
Juggernog<00:01:21.900> makes<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.380> you're<00:01:22.530> twice<00:01:22.710> as

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
Juggernog makes it so you're twice as

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.460 
Juggernog makes it so you're twice as
strong<00:01:23.040> against<00:01:24.000> these<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.810> zombies<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.380> I

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
strong against these these zombies and I

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.960 
strong against these these zombies and I
believe<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.860> takes<00:01:25.950> 4<00:01:26.280> hits<00:01:26.460> instead<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.820> two

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
believe it takes 4 hits instead of two

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.170 
believe it takes 4 hits instead of two
to<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.990> down<00:01:28.640> although<00:01:29.640> sometimes<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.090> feels

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
to get down although sometimes it feels

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.670 
to get down although sometimes it feels
like<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:30.509> baby<00:01:30.689> tapped<00:01:30.990> me<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> ended<00:01:31.590> up

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
like they baby tapped me and I ended up

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.890 
like they baby tapped me and I ended up
getting<00:01:31.920> down<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.939> what<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.329> anyway

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
getting down but it is what it is anyway

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.270 
getting down but it is what it is anyway
Juggernog<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> most<00:01:34.770> important<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.189> in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
Juggernog is the most important one in

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.649 
Juggernog is the most important one in
my<00:01:35.369> opinion<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> second<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.119> most<00:01:36.240> important

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
my opinion the second one most important

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.899 
my opinion the second one most important
is<00:01:36.810> could<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> toss-up<00:01:37.799> between<00:01:38.009> double<00:01:38.759> tap

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
is could be a toss-up between double tap

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.069 
is could be a toss-up between double tap
and<00:01:39.060> speed<00:01:39.659> Cola

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and speed Cola

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.440 
and speed Cola
I<00:01:40.110> definitely<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.130> both<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.340> them<00:01:41.579> double

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
I definitely like both of them double

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.569 
I definitely like both of them double
tap<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> actually<00:01:43.049> great<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.490> when<00:01:44.490> you

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
tap is actually great because when you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.800 
tap is actually great because when you
shoot<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.030> actually<00:01:45.299> shoots<00:01:45.479> twice<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
shoot it actually shoots twice the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.899 
shoot it actually shoots twice the
amount<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.020> bullets<00:01:46.250> but<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.340> does<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:47.700> use

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
amount of bullets but it does not use

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.090 
amount of bullets but it does not use
twice<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> amount<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.479> ammo<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.170> kind<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.950> cool

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
twice the amount of ammo so kind of cool

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.499 
twice the amount of ammo so kind of cool
if<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.280> guys<00:01:50.310> did<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.360> does

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
if you guys did not know that it does

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.149 
if you guys did not know that it does
not<00:01:51.659> use<00:01:51.869> twice<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> amount<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.409> ammo<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
not use twice the amount of ammo the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.039 
not use twice the amount of ammo the
downside<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.850> does<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.210> work<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
downside is it does not work with the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:55.520 
downside is it does not work with the
blundergat

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
blundergat

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.319 
blundergat
or<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> acid<00:01:56.430> got<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.850> see<00:01:57.000> there<00:01:57.180> I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
or the acid got as you can see there I

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.730 
or the acid got as you can see there I
shoot<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> ass<00:01:57.960> again<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> actually<00:01:58.439> only

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
shoot the ass again it actually only

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.219 
shoot the ass again it actually only
does<00:01:58.979> shoot<00:01:59.280> as<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.450> supposed<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.810> does<00:02:01.079> not

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
does shoot as it is supposed to does not

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.499 
does shoot as it is supposed to does not
actually<00:02:01.560> shoot<00:02:01.740> 6<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.520> shoots<00:02:02.759> 3<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.240> it

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
actually shoot 6 and it shoots 3 like it

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.090 
actually shoot 6 and it shoots 3 like it
actually<00:02:03.810> shows<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.439> kind<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.829> bummer<00:02:05.070> I

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
actually shows so kind of a bummer I

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830 
actually shows so kind of a bummer I
wish<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> would<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.579> shot<00:02:05.850> 6<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.689> would

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
wish it would have shot 6 that would

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.180 
wish it would have shot 6 that would
have<00:02:06.930> made<00:02:07.079> double<00:02:07.350> tap<00:02:07.469> even<00:02:07.740> even<00:02:08.069> more

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
have made double tap even even more

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.059 
have made double tap even even more
beastmode<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.869> other<00:02:10.020> thing<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.860> speed

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
beastmode the other thing is so speed

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.740 
beastmode the other thing is so speed

definitely<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.530> really<00:02:13.770> nice<00:02:13.920> perk<00:02:14.220> when

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
definitely a really nice perk when

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.610 
definitely a really nice perk when
you're<00:02:14.490> in<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.880> pickle<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.410> hopefully

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
you're in a pickle and you can hopefully

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.710 
you're in a pickle and you can hopefully
get<00:02:16.860> out<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.940> other<00:02:18.090> thing<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.480> I

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
get out of it but the other thing is I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.570 
get out of it but the other thing is I
really<00:02:19.650> wish<00:02:19.770> they<00:02:19.860> would<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.040> had<00:02:20.130> stamina

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
really wish they would have had stamina

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.740 
really wish they would have had stamina
up<00:02:20.640> on<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.820> map<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.150> don't<00:02:21.300> know<00:02:21.360> why<00:02:21.570> they

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
up on this map I don't know why they

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.690 
up on this map I don't know why they
didn't<00:02:21.990> add<00:02:22.110> stamina<00:02:22.560> up<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:23.340> would<00:02:23.460> have<00:02:23.550> been

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
didn't add stamina up it would have been

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.450 
didn't add stamina up it would have been
an<00:02:23.910> absolutely<00:02:24.420> awesome<00:02:25.130> perk<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.280> have

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
an absolutely awesome perk to have

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.710 
an absolutely awesome perk to have
especially<00:02:27.030> when<00:02:27.360> you're<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.600> these

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
especially when you're in these

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.240 
especially when you're in these
situation<00:02:28.200> who<00:02:28.260> were<00:02:28.380> running<00:02:28.710> tight<00:02:28.890> corners

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
situation who were running tight corners

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.950 
situation who were running tight corners
through<00:02:29.400> these<00:02:29.550> halls<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.970> stuff<00:02:30.060> stamina<00:02:30.900> up

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
through these halls and stuff stamina up

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.850 
through these halls and stuff stamina up
if<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.170> didn't<00:02:31.380> know<00:02:31.440> makes<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.710> actually

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
if you didn't know makes you actually

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.350 
if you didn't know makes you actually
run<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> little<00:02:32.280> bit<00:02:32.400> faster<00:02:32.460> which<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:32.970> just

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
run a little bit faster which is just

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.890 
run a little bit faster which is just
it's<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:34.560> awesome<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.360> that's<00:02:36.600> that's

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
it's it's just awesome so that's that's

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.660 
it's it's just awesome so that's that's
kind<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.260> it's<00:02:37.710> now<00:02:37.830> now<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.520> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
kind of that it's now now to the to the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.420 
kind of that it's now now to the to the
the<00:02:38.910> bottom<00:02:39.180> two<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.660> my<00:02:39.840> opinion<00:02:40.250> which<00:02:41.250> one

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the bottom two in my opinion which one

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.340 
the bottom two in my opinion which one
should<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.610> use<00:02:41.910> Deadshot<00:02:42.690> daiquiri<00:02:42.870> or

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
should you use Deadshot daiquiri or

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.400 
should you use Deadshot daiquiri or
electric<00:02:44.040> cherry<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:45.690> know<00:02:45.810> honestly<00:02:46.320> I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
electric cherry you know honestly I

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.980 
electric cherry you know honestly I
think<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.800> earlier<00:02:47.459> rounds<00:02:47.970> I've<00:02:48.480> only<00:02:48.690> seen

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
think that earlier rounds I've only seen

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.010 
think that earlier rounds I've only seen
um<00:02:49.820> Deadshot<00:02:50.820> daiquiri<00:02:50.970> actually<00:02:51.630> have<00:02:51.780> a

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
um Deadshot daiquiri actually have a

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.890 
um Deadshot daiquiri actually have a
return<00:02:52.320> on<00:02:52.470> its<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.890> its<00:02:53.370> investment<00:02:53.940> meaning

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
return on its on its investment meaning

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.660 
return on its on its investment meaning
you<00:02:55.140> get<00:02:55.290> headshots<00:02:55.770> more<00:02:56.190> often<00:02:56.490> than

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
you get headshots more often than

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.370 
you get headshots more often than
headshots<00:02:57.000> give<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.270> more<00:02:57.450> points<00:02:57.600> for<00:02:58.230> one

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
headshots give you more points for one

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.840 
headshots give you more points for one
and<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.190> about<00:02:59.280> got<00:02:59.459> caught<00:02:59.670> up<00:02:59.790> right

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
and I just about got caught up right

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.520 
and I just about got caught up right
here<00:03:00.060> look<00:03:00.180> at<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:00.390> but<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.020> had<00:03:01.200> shots<00:03:01.380> give

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
here look at that but I had shots give

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.080 
here look at that but I had shots give
you<00:03:01.590> more<00:03:01.740> points<00:03:02.070> but<00:03:02.250> more<00:03:02.760> importantly

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
you more points but more importantly

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.490 
you more points but more importantly
it's<00:03:03.270> easier<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.630> kill<00:03:03.810> zombies<00:03:03.959> as<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.350> go<00:03:04.470> on

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
it's easier to kill zombies as you go on

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.340 
it's easier to kill zombies as you go on
through<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.459> rounds<00:03:05.790> as<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.110> can<00:03:07.110> see<00:03:07.230> I'm

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
really effective as well so I don't know

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.410 
really effective as well so I don't know
why<00:04:12.480> they<00:04:12.630> didn't<00:04:12.840> add<00:04:13.230> more<00:04:13.410> more<00:04:14.239> perks<00:04:15.239> to
