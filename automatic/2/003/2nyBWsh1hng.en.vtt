 realize that we put them in and they 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.170
 they are going to eat very well and it also remains 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.970
 super good with many dishes for 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.380
 fill ravioli and all that then 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.199
 write down the ingredients of this recipe 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.899
 that rise with the ok for this recipe 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.270

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.760
 pieces and cooked a large carrot 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.420
 peeled into pieces and cooked medium drenthe 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.850
 cup of milk a pound and a half of potatoes 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.469

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 tablespoons butter 2 teeth 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.800
 chopped garlic salt and pepper to taste and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.930
 chopped parsley to decorate or it can be 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.060
 if they want scallion this as you 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.130
 prefer this is very easy to do 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.570
 this recipe then I will explain 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.550
 quickly what needs to be done first 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.540
 your vegetables that have to be 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.180
 cooked 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.979
 al dente so that to preserve the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.580
 nutrients, especially the vitamins that 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.200
 suddenly 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.300
 with the heat they oxidize you have to try to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.040
 Keep as much as you can 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.410
 hear this works for children who 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.130
 they begin to begin to come out 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:34.210
 winds also heavies of pedrito de 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.660
 pedrito you want the gardens by the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.170
 pedrito that we puree this way 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.170
 go ahead 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.360
 and if you do not go here he talks to you 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.260
 and the road is good you're going to put 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.260
 a little milk 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.260
 and now also pedrito good 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.480
 but I took it for good let's liquefy 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.480
 this 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.369
 what is now put to work 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.540
 I hope you do not have that blender in your 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.540
 home 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.069
 in her 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:25.739
 ok I'm shaking I tell you why 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.099
 because here we would have to put the potatoes 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.099
 liquefy 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.660
 baby wants to be my savior of the day 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.209
 I put them in nobody was 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.380
 come on let's go let's do it here let's 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:50.190
 do it here 2 hs blender 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.720
 and in the forum he knows the events we are going to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.230
 put the potatoes here in the pan 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.230
 Y 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.750
 we are going to use this this artifact and 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.060
 let's add some milk from the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.800
 from here to be able to crush 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.800
 properly now yes 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.470
 the one for the crushed 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.560
 here all right where are my roosters 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.560
 I say 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.670
 Y 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.900
 there are years I come to laugh the whole program 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.799
 How awful 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.799
 this house 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:48.549
 oh dear public, you will excuse 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:51.430
 but well I laughed alone because I was doing 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.170
 that we would have fun and if I break this 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.680
 Nothing is happening, we already have a fork 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.680
 broken 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:01.030
 more this does not because nothing good happens 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:05.040
 let's crush at this time we're going to 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.040
 add the butter 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:14.469
 and we will continue to incorporate 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:16.840
 AndrÃ© a ander is super super that is 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:19.419
 all they can do if they like them too 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.660
 when olive oil that oil 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.070
 Olive also has her little friends the 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.990
 butter because it is a product 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.729
 animal has saturated fats 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.849
 so if they have problems of 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.000
 high cholesterol triglycerides diabetes 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:36.110
 choose 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.840
 the olive oil but do it is hours already 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.970
 of fire no longer do it not hot 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.290
 because when the oil is heated 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:48.860
 you're going to last then like that outside and 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:54.250
 now if what we are going to do is that 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.250
 well let's see his football 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:05.389
 it's good that I did not know because I had 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:07.900
 name of truth they hire me to forgive 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.229
 is that you know it's Wednesday 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.030
 and well, it's time to laugh 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:17.740
 ok here we put the garlic we put him 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.389
 the cilantro that I tell you can put 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.990
 parsley you can put basil le 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:26.620
 you can put thyme rosemary chives in 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.979
 the aromatic herb of your preference and 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.400
 they are going to add it now if we are going to 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.070
 spice up a bit 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.590
 and we're going to add the rest of the 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.590
 vegetables that are already liquefied 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:48.890
 now we are going to make the super mixes 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.710
 note that the mashed potatoes of the 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.240
 Gastronomic restaurants are not very 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.880
 light that we say carry a lot 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:01.460
 butter made me the revolution 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:03.260
 which is a great great master chef s 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.830
 he says that mashed potatoes have to 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.650
 feel in your mouth like a sponge 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.200
 and then what he does is that what 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.630
 Sneak three times through a sieve what you pass 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.010
 by a sieve and you throw a lot of 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.810
 butter and stripped of the 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.460
 sponges of touching them until they 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.720
 it really makes a mash of photos you eat it 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.240
 and you die the truth is that it is a 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.100
 Delight is a delight but then they 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.620
 notice because it will always be better one 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.270
 Homemade mashed potatoes not because in the end 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.700
 of the dialogue you are going to restore you think 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.640
 between mashed potatoes and potatoes 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:38.180
 French mashed potatoes more healthy and in 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.960
 I could actually swim the same 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.419
 well we can finish mixing this 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.030
 and we are going to give it to pedrito and in what 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:50.350
 pedrito they eat it their hands are cut 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.350
 and returned
