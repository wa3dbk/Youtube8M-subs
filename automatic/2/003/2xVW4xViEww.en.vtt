birthday<00:05:22.550> kid<00:05:22.790> one<00:05:22.940> time<00:05:23.090> when<00:05:23.840> I<00:05:23.900> was<00:05:24.050> I<00:05:24.140> think

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
birthday kid one time when I was I think

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.050 
birthday kid one time when I was I think
five<00:05:24.650> years<00:05:24.950> old<00:05:25.130> I<00:05:25.250> guess<00:05:25.310> he's<00:05:25.550> modeled

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
five years old I guess he's modeled

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.710 
five years old I guess he's modeled
after<00:05:26.180> thee

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
after thee

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.230 
after thee

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
I guess he's modeled after the

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.130 
I guess he's modeled after the
animatronic<00:05:30.020> Spinosaurus<00:05:30.830> um<00:05:31.300> he<00:05:32.300> does<00:05:32.540> look

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
animatronic Spinosaurus um he does look

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.020 
animatronic Spinosaurus um he does look
a<00:05:33.260> lot<00:05:33.410> like<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.770> one<00:05:33.950> from<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.250> movie<00:05:34.430> he's
