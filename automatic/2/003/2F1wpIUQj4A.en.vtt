00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:12.580
 for me as good the strange humor that 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.970
 is the enchantments table 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.120
 this mountain is very good 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.600
 okay 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.080
 well then 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.080
 ah 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.010
 thats weird 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.480
 the crystal became that 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.040
 sprint gold charm 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.040
 I think this is a whole 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.720
 no luxuries well 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.250
 we occupy a kraft table 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.060
 and they go to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.640
 here but do not be that busy is 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.230
 all this to do it 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.060
 and then that's the enchantment table 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.080
 I'm going 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.080
 The spill 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.360
 because I think she's more delighted 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.360
 well this we are leaving in the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.360
 description 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.119
 he is not very good mate and good 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.360
 Well, it's on the enchantment table 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.090
 I do not know why and segovia 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.330
 I'll put it there and how they see the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.220
 guerrilla texture 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.220
 if he touched to see me 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.530
 I put a remedy 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.729
 ok ok we won 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.729
 green 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.899
 Well, this one in case you find one 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.899
 here 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.560
 if you listen one is 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.910
 they have fire 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.960
 as you see previously I think you love it 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:25.270
 the diamond catches fire they explode is 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.819
 the one that is coolest the gold 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.510
 to the gold one takes it flying 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.510
 Y 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.350
 take them out to fly this 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.350
 all right 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.230
 and 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.769
 this I think we also finished the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.769
 valero 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.120
 another animal out there 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.120
 I think because there are more 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.890
 so here 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.150
 is 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.150
 As you can see, he can also fly 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.020
 and this work looks at this food 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.540

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.800

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.030
 in this 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:55.100

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.100
