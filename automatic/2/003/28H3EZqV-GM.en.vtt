00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.549 
made a test on the ground and we had
great<00:00:55.530> video<00:00:55.949> quality<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.850> also<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
great video quality and also the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.470 
great video quality and also the
transmitter<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.370> working<00:00:59.699> perfectly<00:00:59.879> that's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
transmitter was working perfectly that's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.680 
transmitter was working perfectly that's
a<00:01:00.570> standard<00:01:00.809> um<00:01:01.399> turnigy<00:01:02.399> 9x<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.480> looks<00:01:03.629> like

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
a standard um turnigy 9x so looks like

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.509 
a standard um turnigy 9x so looks like
range<00:01:04.110> isn't<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.500> issue<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:05.070> why<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> went

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
range isn't an issue that's why I went

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.890 
range isn't an issue that's why I went
out<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> little<00:01:05.760> bit<00:01:05.880> further<00:01:06.090> even<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.540> couldn't

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
out a little bit further even I couldn't

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.719 
out a little bit further even I couldn't
really<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> aircraft<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.580> was<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
really see the aircraft so that was a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.390 
really see the aircraft so that was a
little<00:01:08.820> bit<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.150> worry<00:01:09.350> but<00:01:10.350> um<00:01:10.590> look<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
little bit of a worry but um look the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.640 
little bit of a worry but um look the
on-screen<00:01:11.640> display<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.930> camera<00:01:13.320> system

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
on-screen display the camera system

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
everything worked really well as you can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.310 
everything worked really well as you can
see<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> street<00:01:15.390> lights<00:01:15.570> are<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> car

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
see the street lights are on and the car

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
see the street lights are on and the car
lights<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.580> its<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.909> house<00:01:18.150> lights

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
lights are on and its in house lights

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.109 
lights are on and its in house lights
and<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.720> coming<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> said<00:01:20.820> it's

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and like coming on and like I said it's

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.399 
and like coming on and like I said it's
deceiving<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.229> lot

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
deceiving because it's actually a lot

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.740 
deceiving because it's actually a lot
dark<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> appears<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.600> look

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
dark and that it appears there but look

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.300 
dark and that it appears there but look
at<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:24.960> worked<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.350> work<00:01:25.470> well<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.159> note

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
at all worked and work well the note

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.340 
at all worked and work well the note
yeah<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> clover<00:01:27.659> leaf<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.020> 10<00:01:28.049> hour

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
yeah this is the clover leaf in 10 hour

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.590 
yeah this is the clover leaf in 10 hour
now<00:01:28.590> sku<00:01:29.159> planner<00:01:29.369> that's<00:01:29.850> right<00:01:30.060> yeah<00:01:30.270> so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
now sku planner that's right yeah so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260 
now sku planner that's right yeah so
looks<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.409> though<00:01:31.579> with<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> system<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.119> have

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
looks as though with the system we have

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.550 
looks as though with the system we have
at<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.420> moment<00:01:33.509> we'll<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.020> reasonable

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
at the moment we'll have reasonable

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.310 
at the moment we'll have reasonable
range<00:01:34.770> i<00:01:35.040> probably<00:01:35.549> won't<00:01:36.030> venture<00:01:36.329> much<00:01:37.020> more

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
range i probably won't venture much more

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.649 
range i probably won't venture much more
than<00:01:37.579> probably<00:01:38.579> 500<00:01:39.090> meters<00:01:39.329> even<00:01:39.540> though<00:01:39.630> i

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
than probably 500 meters even though i

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.030 
than probably 500 meters even though i
know<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.110> air<00:01:40.380> i'm<00:01:40.500> gonna<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> hell<00:01:41.009> of

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
know in the air i'm gonna have a hell of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.330 
know in the air i'm gonna have a hell of
a<00:01:41.159> lot<00:01:41.280> more<00:01:41.310> than<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.869> but<00:01:42.869> um<00:01:43.140> well<00:01:43.979> my<00:01:44.130> way

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
a lot more than that but um well my way

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.760 
a lot more than that but um well my way
until<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.329> range<00:01:45.540> fpv<00:01:46.079> Gil<00:01:46.320> that's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
until we get on the range fpv Gil that's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.170 
until we get on the range fpv Gil that's
right<00:01:47.040> or<00:01:47.280> maybe<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:47.850> we're<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
right or maybe when we're out in the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.249 
right or maybe when we're out in the
country<00:01:48.509> or<00:01:48.600> something<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.200> don't

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
country or something like that I don't

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.630 
country or something like that I don't
really<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.710> risk<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> better<00:01:50.399> in

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
really want to risk it in a better in

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.460 
really want to risk it in a better in
the<00:01:50.729> future<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> aircraft<00:01:52.140> land<00:01:52.350> on

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the future have the aircraft land on

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.510 
the future have the aircraft land on
someone's<00:01:52.770> house<00:01:52.950> or<00:01:53.100> something<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.430> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
someone's house or something like that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.910 
someone's house or something like that
but<00:01:54.090> look<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.689> worked<00:01:54.899> really<00:01:55.079> well<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.619> just

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
but look it worked really well I'm just

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530 
but look it worked really well I'm just
surprised<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.579> mean<00:01:56.700> looking<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.240> video

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
surprised I mean looking at this video

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.330 
surprised I mean looking at this video
this<00:01:57.750> looks<00:01:57.960> as<00:01:58.110> though<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.500> probably<00:01:59.070> what

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
this looks as though it's probably what

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.100 
this looks as though it's probably what
three<00:02:00.119> o'clock<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.509> afternoon<00:02:00.899> or

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
three o'clock in the afternoon or

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.209 
three o'clock in the afternoon or
something<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.920> probably

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
something like that it's probably

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.310 
something like that it's probably
roundabouts<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:03.509> does<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:04.229> it's

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
roundabouts what does it I think it's

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.600 
roundabouts what does it I think it's
better<00:02:04.439> clock<00:02:04.829> or<00:02:04.950> something<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.310> yeah

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
better clock or something like that yeah

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.010 
better clock or something like that yeah
