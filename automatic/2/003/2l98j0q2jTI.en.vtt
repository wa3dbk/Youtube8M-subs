00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
this lock a little bit difficult down

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.359 
this lock a little bit difficult down
here<00:01:21.930> at<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> keyway<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.280> bit

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
here at the keyway it's a little bit

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.240 
here at the keyway it's a little bit
opened<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.240> found<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.960> take<00:01:25.250> two

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
opened up so I found that if I take two

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.780 
opened up so I found that if I take two
tension<00:01:26.790> wrenches<00:01:27.090> then<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.490> South<00:01:29.490> org

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
tension wrenches then one from South org

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.700 
tension wrenches then one from South org
and<00:01:30.710> take<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:31.890> standard<00:01:32.490> tension<00:01:32.850> tool<00:01:33.710> put

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and take my standard tension tool put

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.069 
and take my standard tension tool put
them<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.040> together<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:36.540> bottom<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.020> the

them in there together the bottom of the
key<00:01:37.259> way<00:01:38.060> seems<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.270> make<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> space

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
key way seems to make up for the space

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.389 
key way seems to make up for the space
down<00:01:40.710> there<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:42.270> set<00:01:42.890> there<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.009> go

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
down there that set there we go

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.639 
down there that set there we go
and<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.899> using<00:01:46.170> my<00:01:46.259> number<00:01:46.380> one
