00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 all right 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.340
 hello everyone I hope you are very well 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.350
 eating in the video good I'm going to 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.420
 teach a few repetitions of defense and 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.280
 something curious that I have already seen in several 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.220
 attacks is that people are no longer 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.260
 taking jumps and is starting to 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.529
 carry earthquakes to destroy the 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.300
 walls and be able to reach the town hall the 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.730
 troops to accompany these spells are 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.010
 freckles are goals are the wall breaks and 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.069
 the magicians break walls to break the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.569
 first line of wall and after 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.940
 magicians golem go in 

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:41.620
 destroying everything here you see froze and 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.469
 release the earthquakes I have released 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.299
 better where this warehouse was 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.639
 gold are not nations together to be able 

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:50.739
 destroy there and they will get to where 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:51.999
 is the queen because they see here the 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.260
 kids are followed to where they are 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.149
 ruin luckily that world also 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.879
 it came down a little bit of life if they are not going to 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.769
 golden there what are those two freckles to 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.719
 the infernal tower is killing those 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.819
 magicians get a little distracted with the 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.379
 lava puppies that released the 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.520
 lava hound that is one of the best 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.829
 troops for 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.439
 in these times and there the infernal tower 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.929
 is on a goal so just a 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.429
 two times three with the golems we know 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.700
 they have a lot of life and the tower 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.409
 infernal kills the troops with the day the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.060
 queen because the queen does not have much 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.250
 life and are there all tees the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.590
 that is a pretty good strategy 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.840
 to use and kill the queen in 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.610
 this case is a level 26 queen so 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.829
 which could not finish with this 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.810
 town hall when he used his skill like this 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.060
 that remains in a small percentage the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.819
 King goes on the left as well 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.069
 that accompanied magicians and then they 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.200
 I'll leave here the curiosity of if I win 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.450
 this defense or not because it is really 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.630
 that there were few troops left 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.209
 little army and well you know the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.579
 conclusions of this but what is important 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.259
 here are the earthquakes and how the 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.049
 they were using people really 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.909
 good technique look like this is how he had to 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.679
 have used the previous partner 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.500
 to get straight to the 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.540
 town hall and not hinder in this case 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.250
 because this player was wearing 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.260
 the king came 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.910
 and the troops they were carrying were not all 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.590
 to the maximum achievement but walls to begin 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.360
 they were not to the maximum and that yes it is seen 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.150
 affected when we go against a wall 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.250
 to the level here in this case at level 10 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.010
 because we're going to need a little more 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.110
 breaking walls and because if we kill 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.930
 we break are going to throw the golem there 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.420
 the freckles already entered with the rages but 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.180
 deviates all the main thing here is that 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.890
 he does not carry his king too he could put everything 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.990
 this in the center but the golem see 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.330
 how the tower totally deviated 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.400
 hellish there is killing everything and 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.070
 little more really and the attack does not 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.420
 I will show more this player lost 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.550
 he preferred not to spend those spells that 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.370
 can use better in another attack to the 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.440
 same as those archers 15 cups but 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.410
 no shield so later they turned me 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.570
 to attack and then again with 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.459
 earthquakes see this is the strategy 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.080
 what do you have to use? 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.370
 used these earthquakes and if I 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.020
 would like to know leave it here below in 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.600
 the comments to see if the 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.060
 people are using this and learning a 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.960
 little to how to use them more because that 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.550
 I read it 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.130
 in repetitions I really have not 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.680
 practiced because if I have a little bit of 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.090
 fear that it goes wrong attack and I 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.070
 I was left without spells which is the worst thing that 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.990
 spend spellspace and no one 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.720
 as the magician does not let them break them 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.460
 walls break the walls and it takes a 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.620
 little more for her some magicians died 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.930
 go golem van valquirias van brujas 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.170
 it is a quite combined attack with 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.790
 troops then a little powerful the king 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.920
 batman or outside you have to 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.440
 go towards the center where it is the 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.480
 queen leads to the witches pretty well 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.520
 the infernal tower in a goal then it is 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.260
 frozen so that those skeletons 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.420
 can reach the area of 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.250
 city ​​hall out there the bloodhound 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.440
 As I mentioned, it is one of the best 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.970
 troops to defend now and purchases 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.620
 a purpose that in this case is 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.750
 distract the queen that was out there 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.810
 the pk died and they are going to reign 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.760
 is focused on that bloodhound to creature 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.860
 infernal is about to kill her but 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.110
 uses quite well your skill goes in a 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.970
 36 percent there the bloodhounds 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.250
 they die with the poison but the queen 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.980
 entertaining archer because they die with that 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.600
 infernal tower 37 percent you have to 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.640
 give us golem an archer is left 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.500
 barbarian king for bad luck he went for 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.840
 outside if he could not have come in and be 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.420
 his ability to knock down the town hall 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.700
 40 percent here is when you should leave 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.560
 shield if you have attacked someone let him 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.810
 shield because if not then what 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.690
 you 'll regret, let's see how the 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.600
 cracks of this earthquake and try 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.730
 make the percentage that the barbarian king 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.050
 arrives and says here do not pass the goals to 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.460
 hit the goals what we are seeing 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.870
 the aerial bomb comes out and you can give 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.670
 and diverted are trying to do 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.530
 percentage which then 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.810
 they have enough time but there 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.790
 they manage to put an end to those towers 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.249
 archers and that tower arches is pretty 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.709
 dangerous for the henchman and want 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:07.409
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:07.409
 until the next video bye
