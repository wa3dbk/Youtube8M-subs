00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.230 

here's<00:00:07.130> a<00:00:07.160> simple

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
here's a simple

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.940 
here's a simple
it's<00:00:08.360> toe

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.100 

the<00:00:12.040> fire<00:00:12.280> chamber<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.530> then<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.570> internal

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
the fire chamber and then the internal

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.820 
the fire chamber and then the internal
structures<00:00:17.770> like<00:00:17.950> this<00:00:18.279> and<00:00:19.500> when<00:00:20.500> you<00:00:20.529> put

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
structures like this and when you put

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.609 
structures like this and when you put
them<00:00:21.420> kettle<00:00:22.420> on<00:00:22.540> the<00:00:22.660> top<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:25.480> these<00:00:25.810> then

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
them kettle on the top like these then

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.310 
them kettle on the top like these then
the<00:00:26.890> smoke<00:00:27.580> comes<00:00:27.940> out<00:00:28.270> from<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:29.020> back<00:00:29.050> and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
the smoke comes out from the back and

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.320 
the smoke comes out from the back and
here<00:00:29.500> you<00:00:29.650> behave<00:00:30.039> there<00:00:30.490> you<00:00:30.610> can<00:00:30.789> also<00:00:30.970> put<00:00:31.300> a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
here you behave there you can also put a

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.560 
here you behave there you can also put a
chimney

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
chimney

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.430 
chimney
so<00:00:34.570> very<00:00:34.809> simple<00:00:36.030> rocket<00:00:37.030> stove<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.670> can<00:00:39.790> also

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
so very simple rocket stove you can also

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.049 
so very simple rocket stove you can also
instead<00:00:41.440> of<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.680> kettle<00:00:42.190> you<00:00:42.309> can<00:00:42.460> also<00:00:42.640> put<00:00:43.000> a

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
instead of a kettle you can also put a

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.320 
instead of a kettle you can also put a
cookie<00:00:43.540> plate<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:46.059> inside<00:00:46.780> it<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:49.059> that

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
cookie plate here inside it like that

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.030 
cookie plate here inside it like that
and<00:00:50.220> then<00:00:51.220> then<00:00:51.580> the<00:00:51.729> kettle<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.860> it's

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
and then then the kettle now it's

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.649 
and then then the kettle now it's
cleaner<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:57.610> you<00:00:57.760> want<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:57.970> longer<00:00:58.150> burning

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
cleaner if you want a longer burning

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.479 
cleaner if you want a longer burning
time<00:00:58.900> then<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.260> can<00:00:59.379> extend<00:00:59.680> the<00:01:00.190> fire

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
time then you can extend the fire

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.469 
time then you can extend the fire
chamber<00:01:01.379> make<00:01:02.379> a<00:01:02.409> fire<00:01:02.680> tube<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:05.619> this<00:01:05.650> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
chamber make a fire tube like this and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.960 
chamber make a fire tube like this and
you<00:01:07.479> can<00:01:07.659> put<00:01:07.810> mats<00:01:08.560> long<00:01:09.070> sticks<00:01:09.610> and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
you can put mats long sticks and

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.840 
you can put mats long sticks and
actually<00:01:10.479> burns<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:12.159> it<00:01:12.310> starts<00:01:12.670> from<00:01:12.790> here

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
actually burns when it starts from here

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.950 
actually burns when it starts from here
and<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:14.049> wood<00:01:14.260> burns<00:01:14.560> all<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:15.310> way<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.810> the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
and the wood burns all the way to the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.429 
and the wood burns all the way to the
other<00:01:17.079> end<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:20.369> here's<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.609> rocket<00:01:22.439> stove

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
other end and here's the rocket stove

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.990 
other end and here's the rocket stove
with<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.189> big<00:01:24.520> fire<00:01:24.909> chamber<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.520> here's<00:01:27.820> the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
with a big fire chamber so here's the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.389 
with a big fire chamber so here's the
catch<00:01:28.240> if<00:01:28.659> you<00:01:28.929> want<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.229> longer<00:01:29.469> burning<00:01:29.829> time

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
catch if you want a longer burning time

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.099 
catch if you want a longer burning time
and<00:01:30.869> make<00:01:31.869> it<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.890> burnheal<00:01:33.399> order<00:01:33.929> you<00:01:34.929> can

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
and make it the burnheal order you can

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.700 
and make it the burnheal order you can
put<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.590> kind<00:01:35.890> of<00:01:35.979> fire<00:01:36.340> chamber<00:01:36.670> fire<00:01:37.210> tube

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
put this kind of fire chamber fire tube

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.690 
put this kind of fire chamber fire tube
you<00:01:38.710> can<00:01:38.859> use<00:01:39.039> bigger<00:01:39.399> pieces<00:01:40.329> of<00:01:40.630> wood<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
you can use bigger pieces of wood and it

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.190 
you can use bigger pieces of wood and it
burns<00:01:42.999> very<00:01:43.210> hot<00:01:43.719> very<00:01:44.520> simple<00:01:45.520> solution<00:01:46.240> you

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
burns very hot very simple solution you

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.800 
burns very hot very simple solution you
can<00:01:47.350> also<00:01:47.560> put<00:01:48.219> some<00:01:48.249> insulation<00:01:48.999> around<00:01:49.420> it

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
can also put some insulation around it

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.450 
can also put some insulation around it
and<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.140> burns<00:01:51.130> even<00:01:51.549> hotter<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.619> my<00:01:53.890> tea<00:01:53.950> is

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
and it burns even hotter so my tea is

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.450 
and it burns even hotter so my tea is
almost<00:01:55.060> ready<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:58.090> birth<00:01:58.390> very<00:01:58.749> hot<00:01:59.460> as

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
almost ready and this birth very hot as

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.600 
almost ready and this birth very hot as
you<00:02:00.700> can<00:02:00.880> see<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.630> ends<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.920> then

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.010 

now<00:02:09.610> smoke<00:02:10.090> coming<00:02:10.660> from<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.080> chip<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:13.020> this

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
now smoke coming from the chip and this

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.530 
now smoke coming from the chip and this
is<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> simple<00:02:14.740> solution<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.360> control<00:02:16.360> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
is a simple solution to control the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.780 
is a simple solution to control the
airflow<00:02:19.950> how<00:02:20.950> much<00:02:21.280> air<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:23.320> burning<00:02:23.800> gets<00:02:24.100> so

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
airflow how much air the burning gets so

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.450 
airflow how much air the burning gets so
I'm<00:02:25.420> good<00:02:27.390> you're<00:02:28.390> going<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.690> just<00:02:29.340> leave<00:02:30.340> it

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
I'm good you're going to just leave it

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.960 
I'm good you're going to just leave it
out<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:35.470> needs<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.800> be<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.010> right<00:02:36.130> amount<00:02:36.880> of

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
out this needs to be the right amount of

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.150 
out this needs to be the right amount of
fat
