00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
I'm twisting it tightly twist it

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.399 
I'm twisting it tightly twist it
basically<00:01:45.759> all<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.420> way<00:01:46.509> down<00:01:46.840> doesn't<00:01:47.290> have

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
basically all the way down doesn't have

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.920 
basically all the way down doesn't have
to<00:01:47.530> be<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.000> way<00:01:49.030> down<00:01:49.240> for<00:01:49.420> me<00:01:49.570> because

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
to be all the way down for me because

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.760 
to be all the way down for me because
what<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.140> do<00:01:50.259> is<00:01:51.810> leave<00:01:52.810> this<00:01:53.020> them<00:01:53.290> out

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
what I do is leave this them out

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.840 
what I do is leave this them out
and<00:01:54.509> because<00:01:55.509> I<00:01:55.540> have<00:01:55.780> permed<00:01:56.140> ends<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:57.100> little

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
and because I have permed ends a little

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.240 
and because I have permed ends a little
bit<00:01:58.090> left<00:01:58.360> what<00:01:58.780> I<00:01:58.810> do<00:01:58.899> is<00:01:59.350> twist<00:01:59.710> in<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.009> same

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
bit left what I do is twist in the same

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.550 
bit left what I do is twist in the same
direction<00:02:00.610> that<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.030> was<00:02:01.180> going<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:02.350> make<00:02:02.530> a

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
direction that I was going and I make a

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:13.970 
direction that I was going and I make a
bantu<00:02:03.130> knot<00:02:09.630> like<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:12.030> make<00:02:13.030> sure<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.450> tight

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
bantu knot like so make sure it's tight

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.229 
bantu knot like so make sure it's tight
and<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.190> don't<00:02:15.370> really<00:02:15.519> have<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:16.030> use

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
and you don't really have to use

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.290 
and you don't really have to use
scrunchies<00:02:17.340> as<00:02:18.340> long<00:02:18.550> as<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.850> make<00:02:19.060> them

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
scrunchies as long as you make them

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.870 
scrunchies as long as you make them
tight<00:02:19.570> enough<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:22.410> yeah<00:02:23.459> it's<00:02:24.459> just<00:02:24.550> that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
tight enough so yeah it's just that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.509 
tight enough so yeah it's just that
simple<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.410> way<00:02:26.560> I'm<00:02:26.709> doing<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.280> want

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
simple and the way I'm doing it I want

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.460 
simple and the way I'm doing it I want
to<00:02:27.730> fall<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:28.570> so<00:02:28.840> that's<00:02:29.050> why<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.260> have

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
to fall like this so that's why I have

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:40.920 
to fall like this so that's why I have
my<00:02:29.650> parts<00:02:30.040> kind<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.519> parted<00:02:31.420> diagonally

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:49.150 

so<00:02:41.500> yeah

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.900 

I<00:02:49.190> hope<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:50.060> straight<00:02:51.550> have<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.670> mirror

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
I hope that straight have a mirror

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.280 
I hope that straight have a mirror
behind<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.360> camera<00:02:55.840> but<00:02:56.840> yeah<00:02:57.050> it's<00:02:57.230> just

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
behind the camera but yeah it's just

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.850 
behind the camera but yeah it's just
that<00:02:57.590> simple<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:59.740> I'll<00:03:00.740> show<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.220> results

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
that simple so I'll show the results

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.420 
that simple so I'll show the results
when<00:03:03.860> I<00:03:04.310> finally<00:03:05.210> decide<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.720> take<00:03:05.900> them<00:03:06.110> out

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
when I finally decide to take them out

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.920 
when I finally decide to take them out
which<00:03:07.430> will<00:03:07.610> probably<00:03:07.790> be<00:03:08.000> about<00:03:08.360> four<00:03:08.720> days

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
which will probably be about four days

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.290 
which will probably be about four days
from<00:03:09.170> now

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
from now

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:20.340 
from now
so<00:03:11.300> yeah

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.430 

putting<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.470> curl<00:03:21.710> Allah<00:03:22.130> on<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:23.350> then<00:03:24.350> I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
putting the curl Allah on and then I

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.650 
putting the curl Allah on and then I
take<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.680> little<00:03:24.950> bit<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.280> coconut<00:03:26.060> butter

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.030 
this
to<00:03:32.390> stretch<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.930> out<00:03:33.050> and<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:34.460> detangle<00:03:34.910> my<00:03:35.240> hair

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
to stretch it out and I detangle my hair

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:44.290 
to stretch it out and I detangle my hair
so<00:03:37.090> it's<00:03:38.090> not<00:03:38.330> really<00:03:40.660> it's<00:03:41.660> not<00:03:41.810> bad<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:43.210> can<00:03:44.210> do

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
so it's not really it's not bad I can do

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.200 
so it's not really it's not bad I can do
what<00:03:44.450> my<00:03:44.600> fingers<00:03:44.990> do<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:46.120> think<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.970> see

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
what my fingers do it I think so you see

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.820 
what my fingers do it I think so you see
my<00:03:50.390> curl<00:03:50.690> pattern<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:51.200> little<00:03:51.470> bit

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
my curl pattern a little bit

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.560 
my curl pattern a little bit
I've<00:03:52.550> tightly<00:03:53.390> coils<00:03:54.280> tightly<00:03:55.280> curled<00:03:55.570> coils

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
I've tightly coils tightly curled coils

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.990 
I've tightly coils tightly curled coils
whatever<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.200> call<00:03:57.440> it

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
whatever you call it

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:26.480 
whatever you call it
so<00:03:59.000> yeah<00:03:59.210> I'll<00:04:00.140> be<00:04:00.380> back<00:04:00.530> with<00:04:00.710> the<00:04:00.740> results

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.330 

so<00:04:27.490> these<00:04:28.300> are<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.080> results<00:04:29.650> I'm<00:04:29.860> about<00:04:30.010> to

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
so these are the results I'm about to

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.420
