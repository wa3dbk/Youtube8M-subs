 welcome here to follow that jus and 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.100
 I would say it goes directly to the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.100
 metro 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.079

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.189
 a kart were generated the trackside 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.900
 Of course with comment block and goes 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.089
 traveled almost infinite distance 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.410
 will have to be about 30,000 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.850
 miles of business, of course 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.989
 curious if ever limit this world 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.339
 is achieved and how long the whole 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.809
 take a look anyway 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.040
 link to this can be found below in the video 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.300
 I can also describe this week 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 a very entertaining designed video 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.899
 from greven time and nick nick recommend 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.460
 in the video together they have ten 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.449
 types of micros everyone plays 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.710
 knows that on site will be the 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.000
 mainly on fog nix channel 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.500
 He has just watched a video in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 cooperation with rewe and played and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.660
 many other youtube did 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.770
 pretty cool and i can not 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.820
 really recommend to watch video 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.320
 Here he sees a small one 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:07.339
 Detail of the gardener making a tree one 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:07.339
 flower beautiful beautiful my garden of joy 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.140
 no my buddy 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.670
 Lydia on the server is now available too 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.289
 again new ender games goes under 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.930
 the other thing is the iron golem the 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.640
 Spider or the policewoman sixth and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.049
 kids is the teleporter though 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.670
 a little overboard is the finds 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.320
 effect most useful and also find 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.240
 that is really good idea a video the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.649
 This has been explained 69 well 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.819
 from strong pad probably every time explained 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.319
 furnish you and of course you 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.520
 also below in the video description 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.460
 moved after the salary 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.729
 teleported is completely cured and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.939
 He is also for ten seconds 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.740
 invulnerable 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.240
 So I have an immense one 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.399
 advantage if I say I posted times 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.649
 somehow and directly into one 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.209
 you have tackle device and theater 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.189
 the possibility also, so to speak 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.259
 to defend directly because you just stop 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.289
 an immense advantage over one 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.770
 Opponent has a megaproject 2.0 in 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.509
 planning 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.830
 according to the latest about video could 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.270
 you think that because there is mister 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.220
 miner unplayed about the planning of the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.329
 new project talked about the project is 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.770
 we decide with very many 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.239
 youtube and should there other sources of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.160
 also similar to the megaproject 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.720
 the speculation about it is going hot and 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.430
 supposedly it should be with the mod peg peg 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.290
 be played peg I find it up 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.640
 any case cool if a megaproject 2.0 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.109
 comes about the old mega project 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.489
 I celebrated really hard but now 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.810
 not write me the comments like that 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.609
 easily it has noticed I'm with 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.170
 the project bloody beach probably still 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.579
 many others youtuber are doing and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.190
 this will be the first episode on thursday 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.450
 the 10 07 comes i really have a lot 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.889
 trouble with the cut of the videos given 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.690
 and of course hope that the whole 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:35.160
 regulate with you really well arrive 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.630
 I briefly mentioned in the trailer 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.769
 I also recently uploaded 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.060
 Of course I have and also in the 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.799
 but first result of the project explains 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.660
 Here you can see some more exclusively 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.609
 short cuts that can 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.889
 why junk turn on now hop up 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.480
 hop hop hopp hopp hopp deal go 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.950
 do not stop full says to the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:58.980
 work to work for austria 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:01.440
 so it was said that looks great 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.090
 no matter how that looks everywhere 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.459
 Then it started 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.190
 why is the study nachtmann you see 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.989
 it looks like it's fruit in the hospice it's always 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.579
 So that 's it with this one again 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.620
 let follow strong fallen also 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.799
