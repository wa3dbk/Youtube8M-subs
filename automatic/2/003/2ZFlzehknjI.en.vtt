00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.000
 good to all the boy are j and here we are 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.330
 here with a new video a new episode 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.940
 of the jazz victory, first of all, excuse me 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.130
 if I didn't upload a video yesterday though 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.890
 I had no time to avoid so I 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.949
 apologize to you for this reason in every 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.630
 case it will be an episode let's say a little 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.449
 little quiet since I will still do a 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.730
 only purchase and I will only make four 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.920
 party god not only but I show you 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.449
 only matches here I say to but there is 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 there are so many we leave immediately from this 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.320
 first opponent who had a bbva 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.960
 very very strong apart from the midfield 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.380
 which we say was not very suitable for that 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.300
 module 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.059
 in case the advantage goes with lukaku 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.600
 but my opponent immediately succeeds in 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.430
 equalize with jesÃºs navas di 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.770
 I did dominate the whole game though 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.629
 made it really hard to pull and mine 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.460
 opponent finds the 2 0 with falcao that 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.399
 really very very strong 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.270
 the game ends here, unfortunately I lose 2 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.609
 to 1 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.559
 and this road in division 1 is 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.510
 really tough 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.880
 six points in three games here are not 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 very badly, however, to win the division 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.890
 1 you have to win 7 games out of ten for 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.880
 just get 21 points and then here 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.570
 road a little uphill gave that 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.340
 however you will also see later that 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.560
 however the other games with will go 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.150
 very badly, however, it really is really 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.830
 really tough 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.630
 in any case in the next episode 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.070
 you will see many new purchases anyway 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.810
 we will try to convince division 1 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.909
 here is the purchase the only purchase of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.460
 this episode is true little gnoli since 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.740
 I had only one left-back 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.229
 I didn't say in the last episode though 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.399
 I'm only using belgium 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.920
 because so many of you have it for me 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.890
 asked and therefore leave it alone for now 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.520
 at least the bundesliga will use it like this 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.770
 sometimes 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.060
 maybe for some tournaments though 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.829
 I will mainly use this belgium 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.359
 which I really like 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.520
 many have also asked me why not 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.590
 he bought hazard here I replied 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.239
 simply because mertens a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.890
 best statistics this mertens sif 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.500
 or second in form I really have 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.680
 hallucinatory statistics I did not say 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.269
 in the last video however it has something like 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.340
 99 of finishing agility 89 also of 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.819
 long shot very high free kicks 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.769
 seems to have 95 and that's why 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.200
 I prefer mertens also because it costs up 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.819
 internet thousand credits less and then 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.060
 also a fit and is good to look at 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.739
 certainly later I will also buy hazard 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.690
 to accuse you if I buy it I would 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.239
 buy them in shape for the one I don't buy 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.920
 the normal one because I don't like it 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.170
 very much tried the fit version 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.079
 and I definitely prefer it in 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.989
 this second game we have hazard 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:55.049
 in fact I let you rest 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:58.230
 mind that concerns you here mirallas that 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.730
 as that is really very very strong 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.100
 become a bit of the protagonist of 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.920
 but this match is not there 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.690
 forget our lukaku who like to 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.450
 usually we form cannon shots from the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.850
 away and yes some of those have it 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.030
 asked if kobler or luca co informs the 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.450
 second fit and you will just buy it 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.910
 I can just see you in Europe 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.000
 I 'll buy as long as it's okay. This is how 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.730
 I keep it cool but I would like it 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.980
 also try it obviously this game 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.139
 however it was against a team we say 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.930
 with little understanding I won it 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:37.440
 quietly 52 obviously mirallas e 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.299
 lukaku as usual very very strong 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.940
 as well as benteke although as I said 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.400
 first in this game does not help 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.300
 for those less than those who now still have the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.340
 jersey in the home of a pole team 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.310
 download now exactly I do not remember 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.270
 the team seems to me to be post nun but not 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.610
 I'm sure 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.680
 in any case, put bronze sweaters on 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.840
 immediately find my opponent whom 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.930
 anyway here I would like to tell you this thing 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.280
 look, we did it with bent 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.790
 I really haven't been sculpted here either 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.620
 great problems since type three 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.320
 minutes later with faithful I can already a 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.880
 it seems to me to draw in this match 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.489
 to have used the couple again 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.040
 belen starts that really devastating 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.420
 but here he does almost everything he has 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.280
 however two minutes flips the 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.930
 situation and it makes me bring a lot 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.600
 security in short, why look here 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.400
 also what I comment that 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.570
 so 3 to 1 in the first time it seems to me that 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.570
 the game closes like this 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.550
 or maybe not exactly right now 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.960
 they remember I also find another galassi 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.620
 a beautiful goal with de se art 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.360
 in the other one this right outside boys 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.390
 you don't even have to think about it 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.120
 just buy it because it is phenomenal 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.370
 the way he plays incredible then comes back 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.000
 yet another goal by bent and that is not 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.010
 stops more 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.249
 unfortunately this mind that informs I will have to 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.439
 soon give it back to its rightful owner 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.459
 in any case it is that I will use that 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.719
 normal as I said in my opinion 

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:09.029
 practically the same as this version in 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:12.269
 shape really changes very little 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:14.129
 because the 95 strengths that have the 

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:17.099
 proves quite at stake that is a lot 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:20.369
 similar to the silver version 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:24.149
 normal however the third game e 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:27.029
 against a team still here in madrid 

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:29.099
 barcelona value not so much 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.329
 however, a liga bbva goes immediately into 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.949
 advantage him with the alarm clock at 

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:33.959
 eighteenth was not one however 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.909
 complicated game indeed left gods 

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:37.619
 crazy defense holes 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.629
 here's the thing as soon as it becomes that fit 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:41.969
 that's what these guys can do 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:43.829
 very very beautiful and even a little 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.709
 difficult because it makes the ball turn like this 

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:48.869
 it's not really from all the attackers 

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:50.669
 it happens very often that the balloon goes to 

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:52.559
 out of any case look here mertens 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.979
 thanks to its agility thanks to its 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:58.169
 dribbling as he easily finds in goals 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.289
 so guys for this episode is 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.909
 I leave you all now for the last goal but 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.279
 in case I remind you to leave a nice me 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.229
 like a comment because not of 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:09.659
 sign up if you haven't already done so e 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.549
 not see you tomorrow with a new video 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:14.189
 however, remember to advise me 

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:16.799
 always players and maybe even 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:18.659
 some new square, maybe even 

00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:20.579
 silver who knows can also bronze 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.849
 so see you tomorrow with a new one 

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:22.849
 video
