00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.890 
adviser we would rehearse the plays over
and<00:04:05.060> over<00:04:05.390> again<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:07.670> know<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:08.060> was<00:04:08.180> we<00:04:08.540> we

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
and over again and you know it was we we

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.540 
and over again and you know it was we we
actually<00:04:09.200> had<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.350> gym<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.950> was<00:04:10.070> built<00:04:10.370> a

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
actually had a gym that was built a

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.990 
actually had a gym that was built a
full-size<00:04:10.970> not<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.510> full-size<00:04:12.019> natural<00:04:12.620> sign

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
full-size not a full-size natural sign

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.680 
full-size not a full-size natural sign
but<00:04:14.000> on<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.510> stage<00:04:15.080> at<00:04:15.500> CBS<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:17.120> three<00:04:17.450> walled

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
but on a stage at CBS and three walled

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.360 
but on a stage at CBS and three walled
set<00:04:18.080> with<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.470> bleachers<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:19.010> everything

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
set with the bleachers and everything

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.140 
set with the bleachers and everything
and<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:21.049> we<00:04:21.799> would<00:04:21.980> have<00:04:22.100> rehearsal<00:04:22.610> times<00:04:22.850> it

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
and so we would have rehearsal times it

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.360 
and so we would have rehearsal times it
was<00:04:23.300> really<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:24.080> was<00:04:24.110> very<00:04:24.470> specific<00:04:25.040> I

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
was really it was very specific I

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.270 
was really it was very specific I
learned<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.240> lot<00:04:26.390> about<00:04:26.450> basketball<00:04:27.260> in<00:04:27.890> three

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
learned a lot about basketball in three

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.810 
learned a lot about basketball in three
years<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:29.380> we<00:04:30.380> just<00:04:30.620> said<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:30.979> best<00:04:31.160> time<00:04:31.280> you

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
years and we just said the best time you

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.920 
years and we just said the best time you
imagine<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:32.360> are<00:04:32.479> going<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.780> high<00:04:32.900> school

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
imagine is are going to high school

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.800 
imagine is are going to high school
again<00:04:33.410> for<00:04:33.710> another<00:04:33.830> four

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
again for another four

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.020 
again for another four
it<00:04:35.289> I<00:04:35.350> think<00:04:35.770> that's<00:04:35.919> one<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.699> earlier

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
it I think that's one of the earlier

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.640 
it I think that's one of the earlier

standpoint represented what some

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.749 
standpoint represented what some
basketball<00:04:41.979> teams<00:04:42.160> are<00:04:42.280> really<00:04:42.430> like<00:04:42.639> you
