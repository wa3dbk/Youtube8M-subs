it's<00:03:27.840> gonna<00:03:27.930> maximize<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.620> its<00:03:28.739> full

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
it's gonna maximize to its full

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.589 
it's gonna maximize to its full
potential<00:03:29.220> we're<00:03:29.730> supposed<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.060> get<00:03:30.209> exactly

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
that this fall at the DeRose 5 now I've

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.640 
that this fall at the DeRose 5 now I've
seen<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.359> evolution<00:03:33.569> of<00:03:33.870> Boost<00:03:34.079> Technology

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650
