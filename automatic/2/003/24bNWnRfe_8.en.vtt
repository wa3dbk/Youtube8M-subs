 go well today third video 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.529
 where I'm wearing someone, it'll be August 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.139
 day to hello there is beautiful 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.110
 very very long hair they are in the running 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.440
 naturally yeah they are due the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.560
 sedis energy that's yeah I even had to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.740
 shot of iron and catkin not move too much 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.420
 colorful yes and no if you arrive from the times 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.000
 or Algeria colors that's it it goes 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.240
 have to go ok we'll start then 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.239
 we're going to make a braid school is reversed 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 but in the end it will be a little style 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.219
 shallots braid that I had made you 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.870
 a little while ago 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.219
 you will see it's not so complicated 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.489
 that and I think it should be you 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.469
 please 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.469
 so we prepare before we start 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.160
 gold elastics because that's what 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.039
 you will need 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.180
 so for the a-13 school is reversed we 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.180
 takes locks on the top of the skull 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.920
 I take 3 if you do not see well I 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.960
 you put a link to a video 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.180
 would not by the info where I explain you 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.420
 well how does one do a very school 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.080
 paid you hop to the e3 wick 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.790
 we pass the right one below 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.920
 the middle one to put it between 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.659
 two others the same left one in 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.400
 below 2 below that of the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.530
 middle to put it between the two 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.119
 others and after each step one 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.220
 add hair by doing the same 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.909
 leave you the image in front of you that it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.290
 do not shoot too much and you have them 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.100
 pretty thick hair I think it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.490
 should look a little bit more 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490
 by bullets 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.840
 we have not bad actually a goy it looks like 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.860
 not it's wrong it takes and tapas 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.540
 extension of an agreement are not even 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:55.799
 watching live, I understand 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:57.090
 nothing you understand the colors g123k if 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.680
 you hair slipped a little bit 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.200
 if they are very fast it may be that they 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.590
 slide you do them on hair 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.299
 wet 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.190
 it will help you or else you put a 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.690
 little lacquer before you start that 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.330
 will also help to ensure that they 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.340
 slip less secure and textile 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.220
 wild the a6 where we could smear you 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.880
 fingers of a little shot it also helps 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.930
 so we do the whole part of the skull 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.100
 until we get to where 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.420
 we would make a ponytail along 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.340
 the avenue that a few weeks pass 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.450
 and that's where you have your s is 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.709
 reversed that does a funny thing to the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.019
 end but I'll try to catch up 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:38.250
 later and tie you it's 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:41.160
 possible but I'm dragging myself there so I 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.510
 forgiveness pancake I pull on the sides 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.269
 to give a little more volume and 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.650
 then we will do the same thing but 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.480
 with sprouts here so it will not be 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.320
 stick necessarily since it will be fair 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.720
 a press we take three strands we go 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.359
 learn that the top strands take 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.010
 that half of the hair half the 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.799
 on it and you make a braid 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.120
 reversed so we know by year 3 and we 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.579
 done like a normal braid except that at 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:15.000
 instead of going over we go into 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:17.070
 below and we do like 3 4 strands like 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 it's time to see that it's a 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.359
 press and we stop and piss off 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.359
 elastic 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.690
 of all the hair together so there 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.700
 you have a party that in braids and 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.680
 a part that norman and there we do not come 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.480
 of tea that is the part braids the 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.430
 little the species of what I call 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.630
 the shallot behind the same we are well 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.780
 shoot it to give it a little 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.520
 more volume and that the press is 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.620
 confused in it's not fair 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.150
 put on it we do the same after that 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.340
 you can remove the elastic that 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.020
 close the dress up since the very 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.730
 supported by this elastic there you 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.730
 take a little wick really not 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.800
 too thick and you make a braid 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.800
 upside down finally an inverted trace 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.440
 I take a slightly more wick 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.470
 big than the previous I find a 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:27.820
 little too small salary we know by year 3 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:30.850
 have made the attraction reverse the idea 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.380
 the ag pressure needed 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.940
 lecomte who is very well known in-stat 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.990
 moreover if you are looking for 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.390
 ideas from 2.13 to more than a million 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.710
 subscribers I think so sometimes it's 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.170
 pictures of her and sometimes it's 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.710
 pictures she takes pictures on 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.070
 other accounts 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.670
 Gold often the site so years so it's 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.340
 cool it's a good source 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:56.630
 of inspiration and enough she poses some 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.950
 beautiful hairstyles and so I spread up and 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.100
 this was a car that was done 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.430
 on a white slab of well tanned a 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.660
 Americans like me and here we are 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.630
 says it could be pretty good on 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.640
 darker hair I put your 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.040
 electric and to panic it takes 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.990
 really shoot killer you pull on the 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.060
 side and you pull up does that 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.470
 often we are afraid but there are ways 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:28.780
 she would not go to the master mario vachon 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:41.660
 the m how these areas in star wars 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:42.800
 Jazz at it is that I hope 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.000
 that george lucas do not look at this 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.920
 chain it's gonna fall to the ground 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.050
 otherwise I could have done something else 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.230
 higher up I had thought to take a 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.680
 little wick green and black and around you n 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.680
 have nothing huh 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:03.810
 beaten explain to him yeah the wicks 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.070
 around each of course and of course I 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.360
 do better than photonics during 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.540
 so I show you if you want the 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.250
 make 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.780
 obviously does it from the beginning but 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.030
 basically before putting the elastic that 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.790
 will join the hair and the braid 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.910
 you take a small lock of hair 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:22.080
 a little long and you pass it and around 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.490
 of the elastic on it if it holds and 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.470
 we will hold it and you put a 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:32.910
 small clamp lot is cannes it's 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:35.220
 better so much it does not get big 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.310
 world and we see them a lot of 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.010
 elastics of the blow bah yeah a little low 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.380
 and thank you anyway nice thank you 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:46.860
 but it's better like that I can 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.260
 aguirre and upa draw could but it 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.020
 will scare the defenses 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:54.690
 I remove the elastic from the braid and there 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:59.040
 I'm going to pick up a bit here and the 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.930
 cover with putty and so once 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.090
 that you are done, you give them 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.170
 elastic if they are visible 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.060
 near the same distance one of the 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.040
 others to balance and you can 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.020
 still pull even more on the sides 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.040
 to give even more volume to 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.020
 each shallots 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.020
 you do not see I see the beginning so I 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.250
 will go down if they do not take 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.320
 already trace and sisters I find her 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.970
 super nice but suddenly the voice is 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.380
 even more beautiful yeah if we do not know if 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.670
 I was able to hide you see as at the end 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.510
 it's still more beautiful when you 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.510
 caches the vacationers 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:36.539
 yes here I have hidden it's great if 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:40.110
 it is true that it is much better 

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:41.930
 hide good ben ali girl so you 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.919
