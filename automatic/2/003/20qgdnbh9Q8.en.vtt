originally a couple of years ago and
that<00:05:41.179> spot<00:05:41.479> and<00:05:41.509> it's<00:05:41.779> spreading<00:05:42.259> is<00:05:42.349> that<00:05:42.469> one

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:42.649 
that spot and it's spreading is that one

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:48.570 
that spot and it's spreading is that one
two<00:05:42.889> three<00:05:43.659> four<00:05:44.659> five<00:05:45.080> six<00:05:46.659> seven<00:05:47.659> eight

two three four five six seven eight

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.949 
two three four five six seven eight
another<00:05:49.580> one<00:05:49.759> back<00:05:49.939> here<00:05:51.249> and<00:05:52.839> another<00:05:53.839> one

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:53.959 
another one back here and another one

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:56.290 
another one back here and another one
here<00:05:54.110> that's<00:05:54.559> not<00:05:54.739> open<00:05:55.309> yet<00:05:55.429> I<00:05:55.610> tent<00:05:55.969> there<00:05:56.179> it

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
here that's not open yet I tent there it

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.179 
here that's not open yet I tent there it
goes<00:05:58.869> what<00:05:59.869> started<00:06:00.289> out<00:06:00.409> over<00:06:00.679> here<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:01.039> now

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:01.189 
goes what started out over here and now

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:02.829 
goes what started out over here and now
it's<00:06:01.339> spreading<00:06:01.789> across<00:06:02.059> so<00:06:02.449> hopefully

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:02.839 
it's spreading across so hopefully

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:05.469 
it's spreading across so hopefully
you'll<00:06:03.489> next<00:06:04.489> couple<00:06:04.879> of<00:06:04.909> years<00:06:04.999> this<00:06:05.300> whole

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
you'll next couple of years this whole

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.290 
you'll next couple of years this whole
area<00:06:05.839> will<00:06:05.989> be<00:06:06.110> filled<00:06:06.409> with<00:06:06.499> it<00:06:07.119> and<00:06:08.119> then

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
area will be filled with it and then

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.769 
area will be filled with it and then
that's<00:06:08.509> it<00:06:08.659> it's<00:06:08.809> just<00:06:08.989> one<00:06:09.229> time<00:06:09.499> show

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:10.779 
that's it it's just one time show
