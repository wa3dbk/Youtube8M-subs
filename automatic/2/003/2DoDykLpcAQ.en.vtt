now<00:00:01.140> let's<00:00:01.380> test<00:00:01.620> the<00:00:01.800> golden<00:00:02.159> generator<00:00:02.840> it's

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
now let's test the golden generator it's

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.579 
now let's test the golden generator it's
a<00:00:04.020> generator<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.859> type<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.580> movie<00:00:06.589> let's
