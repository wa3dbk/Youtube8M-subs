00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:07.770
 the next, I'll make a good blues 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.710
 that good loader is pulled by a 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.549
 the rock that Texan and easy style 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 top 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.070
 What I'm going to use there, I used one. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.250
 tries minor 7 on the military 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.979
 I used it on the first or second 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.729
 standard and the fifth standard is okay and I used it 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.060
 also attentive to the major tonic 7 doni 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.159
 also in the first major pattern above 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.520
 Arm is here to get the sound well. 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.399
 the more serious is where you will see that I 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.009
 I applied there, the wave is there to power. 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.049
 make the ground closed and that is a 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.030
 It's a subject I'm going to get for 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.749
 people do separated later in time to 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.179
 tonic only to detonate it where only it 

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:53.280
 It's going to be a pretty good deal, but 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.289
 Now I'm going to close on that ground there in that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.689
 style in this blues most loaded with 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.200
