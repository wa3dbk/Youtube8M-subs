00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
sugar and then I'm going to let that mix

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.300 
sugar and then I'm going to let that mix
and<00:02:02.390> I'm<00:02:02.750> going<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.020> gradually<00:02:03.590> add<00:02:03.620> my<00:02:04.070> water

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
and I'm going to gradually add my water

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:20.930 
and I'm going to gradually add my water
and<00:02:04.640> my<00:02:05.210> almond<00:02:05.870> extract

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.430 

once<00:02:21.940> all<00:02:22.150> those<00:02:22.360> ingredients<00:02:22.570> have<00:02:23.140> come

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
once all those ingredients have come

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.340 
once all those ingredients have come
together<00:02:23.710> it'll<00:02:24.490> be<00:02:24.640> very<00:02:24.880> similar<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.390> icing

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
together it'll be very similar to icing

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.110 
together it'll be very similar to icing
and<00:02:26.620> what<00:02:27.040> I'm<00:02:27.130> going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.460> do<00:02:27.610> now<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:27.970> I'm<00:02:28.090> just

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
and what I'm going to do now is I'm just

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.050 
and what I'm going to do now is I'm just
going<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.390> pour<00:02:28.690> in<00:02:28.840> my<00:02:29.020> rainbow<00:02:29.410> bits<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
going to pour in my rainbow bits and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.610 
going to pour in my rainbow bits and
then<00:02:31.060> I'm<00:02:31.180> just<00:02:31.300> going<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.750> stir<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.350> really

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
then I'm just going to stir it really

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.100 
then I'm just going to stir it really
briefly<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.490> then<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.540> will<00:02:34.660> be<00:02:34.780> ready<00:02:35.020> for

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
briefly and then it will be ready for

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.090 
briefly and then it will be ready for
the<00:02:35.350> next<00:02:35.560> step

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
the next step

these<00:03:02.230> are<00:03:02.380> chilling<00:03:02.770> but<00:03:03.250> because<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
these are chilling but because of the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.090 
these are chilling but because of the
shortening<00:03:04.810> in<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.380> frosting

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
shortening in the frosting

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.610 
shortening in the frosting
these<00:03:06.370> actually<00:03:06.820> won't<00:03:07.030> freeze<00:03:07.600> solid<00:03:08.200> just

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620

that<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.280> is<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> pretty<00:04:05.790> dry<00:04:06.209> batter<00:04:06.840> and

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
that this is a pretty dry batter and

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.170 
that this is a pretty dry batter and
that's<00:04:07.709> exactly<00:04:08.040> what<00:04:08.370> we<00:04:08.490> need<00:04:08.700> in<00:04:08.730> order<00:04:09.030> to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
that's exactly what we need in order to

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.760 
that's exactly what we need in order to
ensure<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.840> cookie<00:04:10.110> doesn't<00:04:10.410> spread

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
ensure that the cookie doesn't spread

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.280 
ensure that the cookie doesn't spread
too<00:04:11.220> much<00:04:11.400> while<00:04:11.670> it's<00:04:11.850> baking<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.390> then<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
too much while it's baking and then the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.620 
too much while it's baking and then the
frosting<00:04:13.890> pop<00:04:14.130> out<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:15.209> little<00:04:15.450> pocket

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
frosting pop out of the little pocket

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.509 
frosting pop out of the little pocket
that<00:04:15.840> we're<00:04:16.049> going<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.260> make<00:04:16.470> for<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.310> don't

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
that we're going to make for it so don't

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.710 
that we're going to make for it so don't
worry<00:04:17.669> if<00:04:18.000> your<00:04:18.859> cookie<00:04:19.859> dough<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.340> too<00:04:20.370> dry<00:04:21.120> so

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
worry if your cookie dough is too dry so

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.330 
worry if your cookie dough is too dry so
now<00:04:22.109> I'm<00:04:22.230> going<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.380> put<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.620> on<00:04:22.740> low<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.190> just

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
now I'm going to put it on low and just

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.990 
now I'm going to put it on low and just
let<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.669> mix<00:04:23.850> together<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.770> our<00:04:25.980> cookie<00:04:26.490> batter

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
let it mix together so our cookie batter

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.600 
let it mix together so our cookie batter
has<00:04:27.330> come<00:04:27.630> together<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:29.010> when<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.340> press<00:04:29.580> it

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
has come together and when you press it

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.090 
has come together and when you press it
together<00:04:30.060> it's<00:04:30.330> fairly<00:04:30.750> easy<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.590> manipulate

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
together it's fairly easy to manipulate

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.790 
together it's fairly easy to manipulate
we're<00:04:32.940> going<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.270> add<00:04:33.390> in<00:04:33.750> our<00:04:34.020> chocolate

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.280 
and just really shortly you don't have
to<00:05:11.460> chill<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.850> dough<00:05:11.880> for<00:05:12.270> this<00:05:12.419> part<00:05:12.780> I<00:05:12.870> just

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
to chill the dough for this part I just

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.020 
to chill the dough for this part I just
prefer<00:05:13.500> working<00:05:13.860> with<00:05:14.100> chilled<00:05:14.490> a--when<00:05:14.880> I'm

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
prefer working with chilled a--when I'm

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.790 
prefer working with chilled a--when I'm
doing<00:05:15.360> these<00:05:15.540> sorts<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.870> cookies<00:05:16.229> just

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
doing these sorts of cookies just

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.820 
doing these sorts of cookies just
because<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.729> does<00:05:17.970> slow<00:05:18.390> down<00:05:18.419> there<00:05:19.229> they're

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
because it does slow down there they're

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.909 
because it does slow down there they're
spreading<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:21.990> just<00:05:22.229> like<00:05:22.410> to<00:05:22.680> do<00:05:22.800> that

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
spreading and so I just like to do that

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.040 
spreading and so I just like to do that
extra<00:05:23.220> precaution<00:05:23.940> because<00:05:24.510> if<00:05:24.660> you<00:05:24.840> follow

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
extra precaution because if you follow

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.010 
extra precaution because if you follow
me<00:05:25.320> on<00:05:25.440> Instagram<00:05:25.979> you<00:05:26.250> saw<00:05:26.910> a<00:05:27.150> major<00:05:27.450> cookie
