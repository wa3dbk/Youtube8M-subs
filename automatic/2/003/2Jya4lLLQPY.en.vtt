00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
gonna call it I could not get my hands

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.600 
gonna call it I could not get my hands
on<00:00:35.970> that<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.930> i<00:00:36.960> use<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.800> anna<00:00:37.950> maria<00:00:38.309> over

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
on that one so i use to anna maria over

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.319

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.860 

alright<00:00:48.750> let's<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> limbus<00:00:49.590> order<00:00:53.870> there

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
alright let's do the limbus order there

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.330 
alright let's do the limbus order there
it<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.190> it's<00:00:56.190> pretty<00:00:56.700> much<00:00:57.860> flowing<00:00:58.860> cloud<00:00:59.460> or

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
it is it's pretty much flowing cloud or

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.299 
it is it's pretty much flowing cloud or
it's<00:01:02.340> pretty<00:01:02.550> cool<00:01:03.890> depending<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.070> style

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it's pretty cool depending on your style

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.209 
it's pretty cool depending on your style
to<00:01:05.519> suppose<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.149> I<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:07.079> it<00:01:07.109> I<00:01:10.039> wanted<00:01:11.039> to<00:01:11.130> get

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
my hands on that original plasma Laura

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.980 
my hands on that original plasma Laura
but<00:01:13.829> i<00:01:13.859> was<00:01:14.159> never<00:01:14.310> able<00:01:14.459> to<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.149> of<00:01:15.929> course

but i was never able to and of course
you<00:01:16.289> guys<00:01:16.469> know<00:01:16.709> how<00:01:16.889> the<00:01:16.950> broker<00:01:17.850> situation

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:18.569 
you guys know how the broker situation

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.519 
you guys know how the broker situation
is<00:01:19.189> anyway<00:01:20.189> let's<00:01:20.429> sort<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.179> the<00:01:21.299> blue<00:01:21.869> plasma

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:22.529 
is anyway let's sort of the blue plasma

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:34.720 
is anyway let's sort of the blue plasma
core

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.140 

there<00:01:35.730> it<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.800> plasma<00:01:37.800> core<00:01:38.010> but<00:01:38.400> we'll<00:01:38.940> see

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
there it is plasma core but we'll see

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.170 
there it is plasma core but we'll see
blue<00:01:39.440> from<00:01:40.440> what<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:40.680> hearing<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.760> saw<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
blue from what I'm hearing and I saw it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.680 
blue from what I'm hearing and I saw it
once<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:43.470> original<00:01:44.430> plasma<00:01:44.850> core<00:01:45.090> looks

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
once the original plasma core looks

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.280 
once the original plasma core looks
green<00:01:46.260> now<00:01:46.560> which<00:01:47.400> obviously<00:01:48.060> hard<00:01:48.960> light<00:01:49.260> I

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
green now which obviously hard light I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.010 
green now which obviously hard light I
would<00:01:49.560> love<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:49.920> my<00:01:49.980> hands<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.550> but<00:01:51.020> it's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
would love to get my hands on but it's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.700 
would love to get my hands on but it's
