00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.940
 I will explain the points before 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.779
 It is the same store 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.609
 Alabama next 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.070
 It is not 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.070
 Latest version features ya invitation 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.009
 Departure decision 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.050
 There is no strike point in this state 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.939
 Conventional scale 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.090
 Planned to be called Tokai in Tokyo 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.710
 It was in this state 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.710
 I think it's a twilight 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.210
 This state is certainly 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.670
 There seems to be a public offering example and there is no mistake 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.670
 If this is the place I really care about 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.780
 It is a thing that power enters 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.500
 Such as low balls 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.850
 I have bent my knee 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.370
 If you do not create such a state 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.810
 Quite 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.370
 I can not play well 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.600
 At the store 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 It's a bit like this 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.040
 Wide and pham forced stylist 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.540
 But of the body 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.750
 However 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.160
 It is a hit point 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.120
 If it is here 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.870
 Playball too 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.930
 like this 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.340
 palm 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.440
 Same ss 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.440
 If you can open it by designating it 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.780
 5th case 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.480
 I did this 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.480
 I can play that 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.090
 This state 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.390
 And rather than doing 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.580
 This state 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.580
 Because the mechanism is easy 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.930
 Well almost right beside 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.920
 more than this 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.160
 I will explain 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.240
 In the case of the area 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.240
 In such a state 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.530
 Traditional 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.399
 The difference between accepting 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.569
 Inability to trade on the other hand 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.389
 I am here 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.229
 This makes it easy to catch the ball 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.229
 It is also possible to replace land and the power is very easy to understand 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.509
 There is no mistake here 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.779
 It's very difficult unless you get it fixed 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.779
 There seems to be practice for the desk 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.889
 We eat almost right beside 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:35.290
 I will explain
