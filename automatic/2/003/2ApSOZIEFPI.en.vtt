going to bring up the image section of
Google's<00:01:00.230> search<00:01:00.530> engine<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.100> essentially

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
Google's search engine and essentially

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.359 
Google's search engine and essentially
delivery<00:01:02.360> deliver<00:01:03.050> images<00:01:03.530> as<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.860> results

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
delivery deliver images as the results

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.420 
delivery deliver images as the results
so<00:01:04.610> let's<00:01:05.420> throw<00:01:06.110> in<00:01:06.229> a<00:01:06.290> search<00:01:06.500> turn<00:01:06.860> here<00:01:07.220> and

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
so let's throw in a search turn here and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.609 
so let's throw in a search turn here and
just<00:01:08.150> off<00:01:08.270> top<00:01:08.509> I<00:01:08.630> put<00:01:08.660> stuff<00:01:09.080> like<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:09.410> in

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
just off top I put stuff like this in

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.440 
just off top I put stuff like this in
quotation<00:01:10.400> marks<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:10.790> we<00:01:10.850> put<00:01:11.000> in<00:01:11.150> quotation

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
quotation marks and we put in quotation

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.850 
quotation marks and we put in quotation
marks<00:01:11.690> that's<00:01:12.110> going<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:12.350> search<00:01:12.530> for<00:01:12.740> that

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
marks that's going to search for that

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.350 
marks that's going to search for that
phrase<00:01:13.430> it's<00:01:13.729> not<00:01:13.850> going<00:01:13.940> to<00:01:14.030> search<00:01:14.180> for
