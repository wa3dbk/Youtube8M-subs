00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.360
 before going on a mission carefully 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.630
 checked weapons cover group 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.680
 almost always armed with machine guns 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.849
 sometimes they took a light machine gun 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.259
 capture group 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.679
 armed with dependency 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:16.599
 situations 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.580
 either only pistols knives 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.470
 and took higher and automatic 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.769
 heavy bulky priests charm fit 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.569
 for reconnaissance searches 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:25.439
 so many prefer 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.239
 German automatic 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.909
 import 40 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.919
 remembers Michael Shinder 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.920
 the day after my arrival 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.820
 one of the scouts in the platoon 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.370
 got her duffel German 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.570
 machine and three movie stores 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.770
 honestly we dad said 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.220
 take the lieutenant Ryazan machine 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.190
 it will be easier 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.620
 since breaking the blockade Soviet 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.510
 intelligence has already begun to appear first 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.510
 automatons 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.470
 gun machine gun in space 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.010
 traditions of judgment 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.620
 enjoyed deserved love 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.880
 many scouts 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.900
 during isnâ€™t searches especially 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 important it is lightness and compactness 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.840
 automatons 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.980
 weighed only three kilos to the waist in 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.940
 this respect 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.670
 of this connection he is not only legendary 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.530
 us troupe 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.850
 but also a German pistol machine gun mp 38 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.560
 40 which is a kilo heavier 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.570
 Sudak 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.810
 came real scouts 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.260
 depended directly 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.040
 response of their weapons 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.290
 remembers Eugene agapov 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.490
 on the assignment the fighters capture group went 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.360
 in most cases only a pillar with 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.160
 gun and finka 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.520
 automatic in his opinion cumbersome than 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.700
 boosting them for intelligence much 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.070
 more fit 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.300
 Alexey Court and created his gun in 1940 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.260
 the second year 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.170
 in harsh conditions besieged 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.280
 Leningrad 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.140
 many experts are veterans 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.620
 recognizes both with the best automaton second 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.910
 world war 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.020
 besides compactness it differs 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.970
 convenience and high enough 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.880
 for fighting machine guns 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 opportunities 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.800
 automaton says the report 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.979
 Pirozhkov store 35 rounds 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.109
 rowdy for his high shooting times 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.779
 sometimes called cartridge eater 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:22.359
 and rate of fire 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.399
 was two times smaller so the fighters had 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.329
 opportunity to fire short 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.159
 bursts 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.969
 no less store 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.749
 released feet from the field 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.529
 retained stopping power at a distance of up to 800 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.299
 meters 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.249
 while german mp 40 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.929
 ineffective only in melee 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:40.990
 on distance 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.289
 before 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:45.269
 remembers Ivan Frost 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.040
 court claims machine was good by the fact that 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.419
 his rings are abandoned even with folded 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.559
 butt shoot anyway convenient 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:54.549
 firepower is enough for 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.319
 scouts the only thing in it is not 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.049
 there was a carrier on a single boeing but we are on 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.180
 trained to make short queues by 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.729
 five six shots 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.279
 yes and single shoot models for 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:09.039
 this is important to immediately remove the finger 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.689
 once on our trigger 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:11.299
 beaches 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.699
 but usually we didn't need to shoot 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.319
 single 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.119
 bandages and the fact that the United States 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.519
 was more reliable less sensitive 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.619
 pollution than german 340 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:27.549
 remembers Alexander Solovskiy 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.629
 German machines we did not use 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.069
 we considered them unreliable and 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.069
 respect not used 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.309
 but some scouts all the same 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:40.029
 preferred mp 40 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:41.279
 but it turned out 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.359
 rather subjective addiction 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.189
 mass production 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.719
 vending machines on the belt began at the end of 40 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:48.829
 second year 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.150
 its manufacture was simple and cheap 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.699
 what was especially important 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.469
 protracted war conditions 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.739
 he was almost completely going and 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.580
 stamped parts connected by welding 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.779
 in procurement 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:02.999
 consumption of materials for 1 will recover 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:05.979
 but three times less than one such step 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.449
 forty third year 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.469
 pike perch modified its weapon eliminating 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.529
 minor flaws and simplifying someone 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:12.729
 structural elements 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:14.729
 which further reduced the price 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.829
 production 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.579
 total for the war was released about 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.220
 half a million machines by 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.799
 professions 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.409
 business operations 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.259
 in bahrain dubai 43 shared even in 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.430
 German army 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.700
 I do not use with the designation MP 719 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:30.990
 China
