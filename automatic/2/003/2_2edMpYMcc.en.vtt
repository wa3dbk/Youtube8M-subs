this<00:04:22.580> really<00:04:22.940> sucked<00:04:23.240> really<00:04:23.480> bad<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:24.080> draw

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
this really sucked really bad to draw

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.730 
this really sucked really bad to draw
without<00:04:25.250> any<00:04:25.550> ways<00:04:25.760> to<00:04:26.000> use<00:04:26.180> them<00:04:26.330> immediately

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
without any ways to use them immediately

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.590

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
so I don't want to run multiple copies

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.409 
so I don't want to run multiple copies
of<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:29.840> know<00:04:29.990> Jeff<00:04:30.320> Jones<00:04:30.530> ran<00:04:30.919> it<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.419> you

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419
