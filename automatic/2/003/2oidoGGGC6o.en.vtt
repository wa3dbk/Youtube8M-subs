mileage as you really can but all this
is<00:00:59.429> functioning<00:01:00.120> nicely<00:01:00.569> gas<00:01:01.469> gauge<00:01:01.909> got<00:01:02.909> your

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
is functioning nicely gas gauge got your

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.320 
is functioning nicely gas gauge got your
tachometer<00:01:04.370> temperature<00:01:05.370> gauge<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:06.030> put<00:01:06.299> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
tachometer temperature gauge I put a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.960 
tachometer temperature gauge I put a
heavy-duty<00:01:06.720> radiator<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.880> of<00:01:08.880> course

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
heavy-duty radiator in it of course

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.020 
heavy-duty radiator in it of course
alternator<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.140> oil<00:01:10.439> pressure<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.159> got<00:01:11.759> a<00:01:11.820> high

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
alternator and oil pressure I got a high

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.969 
alternator and oil pressure I got a high
volume<00:01:12.240> oil<00:01:12.689> pump<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> engine<00:01:13.469> so<00:01:13.649> it<00:01:13.710> puts

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
volume oil pump in the engine so it puts

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.060 
volume oil pump in the engine so it puts
out<00:01:14.159> more<00:01:14.369> more<00:01:14.850> oil<00:01:15.320> got<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.560> heater<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
out more more oil got your heater and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.160 
out more more oil got your heater and
air<00:01:17.130> conditioning<00:01:17.670> controls<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.539> of<00:01:18.960> course

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
air conditioning controls and of course

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.700 
air conditioning controls and of course
your<00:01:19.380> radio<00:01:19.740> over<00:01:20.039> to<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> left

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.650 

steers<00:01:28.220> really<00:01:28.670> well<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.030> rack<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.390> pinion

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
steers really well the rack and pinion

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.930 
steers really well the rack and pinion
steering<00:01:29.690> worked<00:01:30.170> out<00:01:30.350> fantastic<00:01:31.250> there's<00:01:31.790> no

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
steering worked out fantastic there's no

steering worked out fantastic there's no
real<00:01:32.210> effort<00:01:32.660> even<00:01:33.530> though<00:01:33.710> it's<00:01:33.950> not<00:01:34.580> power

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
real effort even though it's not power

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.290 
real effort even though it's not power
steering<00:01:35.300> there's<00:01:35.450> no<00:01:35.600> real<00:01:35.810> effort

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.500 

I'm<00:01:38.840> in<00:01:39.020> fourth<00:01:39.350> gear<00:01:39.620> now<00:01:40.250> fourth<00:01:40.880> gear<00:01:41.150> doing

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
I'm in fourth gear now fourth gear doing

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.750 
I'm in fourth gear now fourth gear doing
50<00:01:41.870> miles<00:01:42.080> an<00:01:42.290> hour<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.830> I'm<00:01:43.190> not<00:01:43.370> even<00:01:43.520> at

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
50 miles an hour and I'm not even at

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.610 
50 miles an hour and I'm not even at
2,000<00:01:44.360> rpm<00:01:44.780> I<00:01:45.200> put<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:46.160> in<00:01:46.340> fifth<00:01:47.060> gear<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.630> I'm

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
2,000 rpm I put it in fifth gear and I'm

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.010 
2,000 rpm I put it in fifth gear and I'm
down<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:48.950> about<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.190> thousand<00:01:49.640> rpm<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:50.870> this

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
down to about a thousand rpm so this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.900 
down to about a thousand rpm so this
thing<00:01:51.230> should<00:01:51.410> get<00:01:51.620> these<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.860> gas<00:01:52.190> mileage<00:01:52.670> for

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
thing should get these a gas mileage for

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.730 
thing should get these a gas mileage for
you<00:01:53.090> if<00:01:53.630> you're<00:01:53.840> not<00:01:53.990> out<00:01:54.200> there<00:01:54.410> you<00:01:54.620> know

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
you if you're not out there you know

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.399 
you if you're not out there you know
beat<00:01:55.100> not<00:01:55.310> all<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.670> time

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
beat not all the time

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.999 
beat not all the time
but<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.369> cruises<00:01:58.729> nicely<00:01:59.469> goes<00:02:00.469> down<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.859> road

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
but it cruises nicely goes down the road

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.899 
but it cruises nicely goes down the road
nice<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.520> straight

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.300 

as<00:02:04.149> well

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
and I think just the whole package

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.429 
and I think just the whole package
worked<00:02:13.209> out<00:02:13.390> good<00:02:13.599> I<00:02:13.810> want<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.049> make<00:02:14.230> myself

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
worked out good I want to make myself
