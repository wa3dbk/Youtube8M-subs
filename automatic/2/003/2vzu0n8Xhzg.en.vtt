00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.900
 he kicks and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.920
 it just so happened that dark souls became 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.719
 Some we will remove hardcore and in games on 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.030
 least the last couple of years it 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.039
 Exactly, but if Lucy would only be 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.500
 overpriced play and tone vb1 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.480
 gained current popularity especially and 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.399
 the style is well thought out gameplay and 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.079
 deep game world allowed dark 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.659
 souls become one of the most popular 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.759
 RPD last month time 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.039
 the principle of the cow and then without the milk 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.310
 sander developers have created a second 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.530
 the part that came out 14 poppies at will and about 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.539
 only on April 25 did it linger 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.610
 personal computers and how 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.890
 Steppe turned out to be one of the most difficult and 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 unusual games of the last time now 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.210
 we'll find out with you 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.930
 I think that it would be correct to say that 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.360
 the second part of the dark souls is like the first 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.190
 just a head taller is that rare 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.320
 case when developers are not easy 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.240
 corrected all the shoals pen parts but 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.320
 perfected all the positive 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.600
 original features 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.369
 but it is worth noting that right 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.810
 absolutely no major changes 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.030
 there but let's 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.590
 about everything in order in terms of plot I 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.780
 I can't say nothing because both 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.610
 of us don't water but because as in 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.000
 the first part of it in the city park and maybe so 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.310
 to tell 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.810
 I am essentially missing a string 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.640
 is told on in the initial video and 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.409
 the ending is not for you a long confused 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.770
 the stories are not for you prescribed thoughtful 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.030
 characters are all just like in the first part 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.130
 class system I am a character editor 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.440
 also migrated straight from the first 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.450
 dark souls suffered a miserable and change 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.360
 that's what clearly catches your eye so this 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.280
 what dark souls 2 previous looks like 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.170
 parts happened more than once pleased the players 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.150
 beautiful landscapes that could be 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.190
 admire for a long time here 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.690
 artists and designers have tried on 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.920
 fame 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.049
 local locations amaze with their external 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.090
 kind of yes and in graphic terms now 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.220
 all somewhere from better than before 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.650
 to a person who was like a version 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.019
 console efficiency while you can forget 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.299
 the gameplay of the dishes also did not undergo special 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.519
 changes appeared new weapons and armor 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.540
 talismans are now much more 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.930
 consumables 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.670
 new kits and a lot of things worth 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.620
 notice that the developers are great 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.359
 worked on character animation and 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.250
 just want to say thank you so much 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.470
 for the fact that the local physics engine 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.930
 havok does not give somersaults as in the first 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.299
 parts and then it happened without an enemy and his body 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.920
 clings to the foot of our hero as a whole 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.470
 it had no effect on the game but sometimes 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.570
 too annoying 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.670
 7 laps became noticeably more they 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.590
 diverse and baggage and meet where 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.080
 how often and what is good news 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.130
 still, every boss needs his own 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.140
 special approach 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.900
 you can not just take it and plug it 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.820
 by the sword as I said above the plot is not 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.690
 what you should pay attention to 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.150
 dark souls 2 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.190
 he is kind of like here and there is kind of like you 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.960
 no desire leads us forward 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.180
 find out what's behind that one 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.220
 door unfortunately so we 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.170
 we can hardly know anything about the game 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.480
 un world in dark souls very very 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.880
 interesting characters in dark souls 2 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.470
 was more than in the previous part of it 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.959
 to not everyone still carry almost 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.300
 no value ie on the gameplay and 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.370
 we are not affected by history 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.950
 know their names however from something they 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.959
 very hard they stick their memory to us 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.030
 rare replica niro makes the player 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.010
 smiled before the game 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.750
 the developers said dark souls 2 a 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.720
 will become easier with its predecessor 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.280
 which caused a wave of indignation if you 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.590
 treat those people with caution 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.959
 glanced at the second dark souls I 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.290
 ready to calm you down the game did not render 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.910
 lodz 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.800
 misha yes there are some innovations 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.780
 that simplify gameplay 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.940
 for example now we can quickly 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.609
 move from one caste to another but 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.470
 there are also a number of new challenges. 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.729
 for example after your death the neckline 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.400
 filler already with a smaller amount 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.600
 health than before or enemies later 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.460
 some time may stop 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.260
 appear someone will say it only 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.090
 simplify the process of playing the game but do not 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.250
 forget what exactly is killing your enemies 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.320
 pump level and if not 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.360
 merchant and download level we can not 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.400
 or here's another example in the first dark 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.680
 souls we could pump character 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.660
 any campfire while in the second 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.550
 parts enhance the character characteristics 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.580
 for the accumulated soul we can only 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.970
 sap 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.650
 that is, the order simplification is its 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.720
 complication sounds silly but it's true 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.629
 there is this called balance and 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.740
 its developers where mass has entered 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.780
 deserves special mention and 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.340
 multiplayer as much as possible 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.860
 was remembered in the first dark souls 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.050
 multiplayer in the game worked extremely poorly 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.199
 and to show it games for windows live 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.830
 it was all hell but now where 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.900
 it is better 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.789
 from time to time they will gather 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.400
 other players wanting to kill us and 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.259
 pick up our souls but there are these players that 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.360
 in particularly difficult moments can come to 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.789
 us for help and two to fight with 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.199
 some boss is much easier 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.240
 some cavenants appeared in the game 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.500
 this is the local counterpart of the crime faction 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.169
 in which the player will receive 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.819
 various bonuses 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.310
 dark souls 2 didn't just justify everything 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:35.259
 imposed on her expectations but also surpassed 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.270
 their developers have not faked and 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.039
 released a great game that 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.949
 perfectly develops all those ideas that were 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.990
 laid still in demon souls dark souls 2 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.210
 as the first part constantly throws 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.370
 player challenge you will be killed again and 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.349
 again but you will go to the end until 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.599
 defeat the enemy and not experience 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.430
 indescribable thrill from a won victory well 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.740
 or are you just crazy throw game 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.690
 after a couple of dozen deaths on one and 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.729
 same month she to the next day you 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.419
 back in the game to take from her 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.969
 revenge 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.169
 And on this, I put everything like if 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:07.330
 you will like this video and 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.699
