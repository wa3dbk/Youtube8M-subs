00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.370
 I have very dark brown eyebrows myself 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.760

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.170

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.930
 I hope you enjoy it very much 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.700

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.700
 what you need for this in stupid me 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.220
 cotton wool and tim projects is that too 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.120
 don't make their skin 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:36.930
 the paint and activator comb 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.230
 and very thin brush 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.460
 and lastly, a mixing bowl and spatula 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.739
 what first am i going to make sure my 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.910
 its good on my face and that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.629
 my forehead and my eyebrow 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.399
 part just really good clean is me 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.839
 Grab the when I come and clean with it 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.390
 I very well my eyebrows and it 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.159
 part just around it so my skin 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.420
 just degrease really well and that the 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:02.879
 paint can better attach the roughly 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.739
 one and a half centimeters of paint in a container 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.119
 it sounds very strange but that is tomato 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.810
 that I always use and that is real 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.970
 enough for two eyebrows and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 Add about 6 drops of paint 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.880
 activator tool and mix this whole 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.229
 well mixed up 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 the products that I use sit I would 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.789
 they also in the description so you him 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.800
 know exactly which one I use next 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.420
 brings the protect him to for it 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.640
 ensure that I do not get my skin too far 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 I just transfer this completely 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.210
 my eyebrows go and about 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.770
 one centimeter of the round about 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.330
 and last but not least I am completely against it 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.520
 my hair grow in to make sure 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.090
 that the skin under my hairs also good 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.090
 is protected 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.100
 not you 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.049
 just follow 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.150
 I can do very well with fine combs 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.710
 careful against hair growth 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.420
 the hairs are also released from the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.049
 protect him it will be colored 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.049
 could be 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.970
 and then it's time for the paint I what 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 a very fine brush and that's how you paint 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.880
 just real eyebrows and now you do 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.890
 Really no longer be afraid that you are 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.569
 the skin of the moment really happens 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.580
 not i do it for nice you 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.040
 applying between the hairs on the hair 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.230
 I could go with all her hair 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.650
 this will take you around 2 to 5 minutes 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.650
 in places 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.450
 and then it's time to paint again 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.650
 take it off and this can just be whole 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.630
 easy to do with a cotton ball with 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.280
 lukewarm water and you just wipe it 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.280
 a few wipes all the way 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.790
 Oh 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.530
 And then this is the only principle that you 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.060
 stills not so very big but for 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.250

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.930
 million to draw each table 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.280

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.450

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.740
