 You must have always wanted to do something technical in aviation 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.230
 like with lengthy procedures and you have the ambition and technicians of qantas 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.530
 technical was hit then the aircraft technology is really something for 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.329
 you 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.689
 follow the training on twitter maintenance technician at ap 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.529
 This is a choice to be able to marry from each other imposed on it 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.390
 cards of which two to three years of training 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.800
 there are a number of internships that are closely linked and you have to go through 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.830
 ultimately lead to a role in obtaining 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.510
 the commitment but adds I would always like to help 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.760
 but I only thought about saving small profits 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 just go to 25 degrees 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.580
 Christians 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.660
 the mouth 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.630
 unless he finds that this plan had the mainstage pass on the second day 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.510
 a nice job what a society that we are for 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 from a spaceship live plane we got up seventy five hours 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.240
 been busy 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.260
 reasonable so far 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.280
 a nice period 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.690
 and that too was a very nice experience 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.930
 in practice I learn a lot, which is also what editor-in-chief learns a lot 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.800
 in the end it all revolves around one thing and that is safety and people drawing there 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.400
 of the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.620
 and of course 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.310
 the pilots before and also noticed 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.499
 this himself also covers his deeds and the temporary omens 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.140
 yes safe enough among others committed to the plane bad luck 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.850
 you want who it is precisely enough to carry out meticulous inspections 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.460
 for certain programs 3 the managers take that responsibility 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.860
 carry for work I think the sound of a series is a piece of cake 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.890
 technical acts a challenge 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.890
 then opt for a tour of the aircraft technology 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.500
 Look for more information looking to breathe new life into the 24
