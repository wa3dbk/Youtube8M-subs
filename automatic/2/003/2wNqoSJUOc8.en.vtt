Dark<00:00:19.810> Horse<00:00:19.900> is<00:00:20.200> a<00:00:20.230> cool<00:00:20.500> event<00:00:20.620> where<00:00:20.890> you<00:00:20.950> get

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
Dark Horse is a cool event where you get

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.430 
Dark Horse is a cool event where you get
to<00:00:21.160> play<00:00:21.280> as<00:00:21.370> a<00:00:21.520> car<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:22.390> idea<00:00:23.020> here<00:00:23.230> is<00:00:23.289> that

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440 
to play as a car the idea here is that

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.140 
to play as a car the idea here is that
you're<00:00:23.650> playing<00:00:23.860> a<00:00:24.039> hot<00:00:24.250> pursuit<00:00:24.580> event<00:00:24.910> you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
you're playing a hot pursuit event you

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.820 
you're playing a hot pursuit event you
get<00:00:25.300> to<00:00:25.390> chase<00:00:25.600> down<00:00:25.630> the<00:00:25.930> races<00:00:26.350> your

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
get to chase down the races your

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.590 
get to chase down the races your
objective<00:00:27.220> is<00:00:27.430> to<00:00:27.580> shut<00:00:27.880> down<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.390> race

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
objective is to shut down the race

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.420 
objective is to shut down the race
before<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.470> races<00:00:29.800> across<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:30.039> finish<00:00:30.310> line

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
before the races across the finish line

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.880 
before the races across the finish line
so<00:00:30.970> that<00:00:31.000> involves<00:00:31.720> you<00:00:31.869> chasing<00:00:32.710> down<00:00:32.829> the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
so that involves you chasing down the

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.380 
so that involves you chasing down the
races<00:00:33.370> and<00:00:33.550> basically<00:00:34.090> smashing<00:00:34.600> it<00:00:36.390> Dark

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
one of the cooler roads in the game

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.799 
one of the cooler roads in the game
where<00:00:42.130> its<00:00:42.670> rings<00:00:42.940> sweeping<00:00:43.480> there's<00:00:43.630> a<00:00:43.690> lot

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
where its rings sweeping there's a lot

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.020

of Big Ben's it's set at night as well
which<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.239> really<00:00:46.540> important<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:47.410> breaks<00:00:47.680> down

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
which is really important it breaks down

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.470 
which is really important it breaks down
your<00:00:48.130> visibility<00:00:48.430> it<00:00:48.850> makes<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.149> races

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
your visibility it makes the races

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.450 
your visibility it makes the races
slightly<00:00:49.870> harder<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.380> chase<00:00:50.649> and<00:00:50.950> you<00:00:51.190> have<00:00:51.340> to

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
slightly harder to chase and you have to

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.400 
slightly harder to chase and you have to
take<00:00:51.670> down<00:00:51.880> the<00:00:52.059> races<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.660> shut<00:00:53.200> down<00:00:53.350> the

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
take down the races and shut down the

a missing 370z it's really fast it's
really<00:01:03.730> precise<00:01:04.449> of<00:01:04.659> taking<00:01:04.989> down<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.229> races

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
really precise of taking down the races

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.789 
really precise of taking down the races
and<00:01:06.399> it's<00:01:06.520> also<00:01:06.670> great<00:01:06.909> drifting<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.619> great<00:01:08.619> way

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
and it's also great drifting a great way

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.859 
and it's also great drifting a great way
of<00:01:08.830> making<00:01:09.369> Dark<00:01:09.640> Horse<00:01:09.940> easier<00:01:10.510> and<00:01:10.659> getting

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
of making Dark Horse easier and getting

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.410 
of making Dark Horse easier and getting
a<00:01:10.930> faster<00:01:11.350> time<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.250> use<00:01:12.460> boost<00:01:12.790> as<00:01:13.119> often

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
a faster time is to use boost as often

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.390 
a faster time is to use boost as often
as<00:01:13.540> possible<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:14.200> definitely<00:01:14.890> use<00:01:15.130> boosts

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
as possible and definitely use boosts

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.280 
as possible and definitely use boosts
