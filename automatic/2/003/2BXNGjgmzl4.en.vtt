00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.030

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.570
 product what i use for this is a 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.369
 so-called mobile condoms and the company 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:29.820
 would like to respond quickly and easily 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:31.289
 it is in the packaging 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.510
 There are 2 protective covers which one 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.340
 can use twice and four 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.200
 Adhesive films and the water indicators 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.210
 which ensure that you will know immediately whether 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 water enters the cell phone like 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 quickly the water indicators react 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:52.579
 I'll show you right away 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.579
 we put the protective cover over it 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.820
 You do not need to be afraid 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.820
 which she holds out a lot 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.689
 O 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 Next, we bring the indicators 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.090
 on 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:52.869
 but first of all, I'll show you how 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:54.580
 they react quickly and as you can see 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.110
 that is pretty fast what is very important 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.250
 is 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.660
 then attach the adhesive films 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.440
 and press down firmly with your fingers 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.440

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.750

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.349

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.480

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.330

 day tested the masks protective cover 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.510
 and I have to say I'm really 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.490
 I loved the mobile phone customer 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.930
 pushed to its limits and neither me 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.610
 even the phone has come to harm 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.290
 That's why I hope she has just as much 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.730
 fun while watching as I turn 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.380
