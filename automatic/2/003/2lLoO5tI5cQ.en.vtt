is<00:02:19.910> gonna<00:02:20.090> cheap<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.840> diam<00:02:21.710> I'm<00:02:21.860> gonna<00:02:22.040> stick

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
is gonna cheap the diam I'm gonna stick

what<00:03:32.120> I've<00:03:32.240> also<00:03:32.450> done<00:03:32.690> is<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.410> extended<00:03:33.920> the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
what I've also done is I extended the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.500 
what I've also done is I extended the
potentiometer<00:03:35.150> with<00:03:35.420> three<00:03:36.110> wires<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:37.510> now

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
potentiometer with three wires and now

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.120 
potentiometer with three wires and now
it<00:03:38.660> goes<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.130> front<00:03:40.130> side<00:03:41.020> is<00:03:42.020> the<00:03:42.350> one<00:03:42.590> you

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
it goes to the front side is the one you

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.390 
it goes to the front side is the one you
will<00:03:43.310> see<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:44.170> haven't<00:03:45.170> put<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.500> cap<00:03:45.830> on<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:46.160> or

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
will see I haven't put a cap on it or

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.110 
will see I haven't put a cap on it or
something

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
something

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.320 
something
don't<00:03:47.600> really<00:03:47.840> think<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:48.230> will<00:03:48.470> need<00:03:48.709> one<00:03:49.180> and

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.410 

I<00:03:53.310> pretty<00:03:54.310> much<00:03:54.370> do<00:03:54.730> really<00:03:54.880> hard<00:03:55.210> driving

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
I pretty much do really hard driving

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.080 
I pretty much do really hard driving
power<00:03:56.050> supply<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.560> gonna<00:03:56.890> hate<00:03:57.130> or<00:03:57.550> gonna<00:03:57.850> have

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
power supply is gonna hate or gonna have

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.790 
power supply is gonna hate or gonna have
a<00:03:58.120> bad<00:03:58.510> time<00:03:58.540> with<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.170> surge<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.740> the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
a bad time with the surge of the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.840 
a bad time with the surge of the
amplifier<00:04:00.520> but<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:02.250> believe<00:04:03.250> it's<00:04:03.520> gonna<00:04:03.730> be

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
amplifier but I believe it's gonna be

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.330 
amplifier but I believe it's gonna be
fine
