00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.930 

so<00:00:12.470> restaurants<00:00:12.920> have<00:00:13.010> a<00:00:13.040> few<00:00:13.430> different<00:00:13.730> ways

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
so restaurants have a few different ways

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.620 
so restaurants have a few different ways
of<00:00:14.270> collecting<00:00:14.570> gas<00:00:14.990> data<00:00:16.180> that<00:00:17.180> I<00:00:17.210> think<00:00:17.480> are

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
of collecting gas data that I think are

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.690 
of collecting gas data that I think are
increasingly<00:00:18.290> being<00:00:18.590> brought<00:00:18.950> together<00:00:19.190> to

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
increasingly being brought together to

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.390 
increasingly being brought together to
generate<00:00:19.880> a<00:00:20.150> lot<00:00:20.390> of<00:00:20.420> interesting<00:00:20.930> insights

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
generate a lot of interesting insights

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.179 
generate a lot of interesting insights
so<00:00:22.400> almost<00:00:23.180> every<00:00:23.600> restaurant<00:00:23.840> chain<00:00:24.470> has

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
so almost every restaurant chain has

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.910 
so almost every restaurant chain has
some<00:00:25.520> way<00:00:25.700> of<00:00:25.730> creating<00:00:26.510> a<00:00:26.630> hashed<00:00:27.230> credit

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
some way of creating a hashed credit

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.920 
some way of creating a hashed credit
card<00:00:28.210> ID<00:00:29.380> so<00:00:30.820> what<00:00:31.820> they<00:00:31.940> do<00:00:32.000> is<00:00:32.330> is<00:00:32.570> they

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
card ID so what they do is is they

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.939 
card ID so what they do is is they
basically<00:00:33.080> create<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.559> non<00:00:33.860> confidential

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
basically create a non confidential

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.250 
basically create a non confidential
identifier<00:00:36.949> that<00:00:37.280> goes<00:00:37.520> with<00:00:37.790> a<00:00:37.820> ghast<00:00:38.230> with<00:00:39.230> a

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
identifier that goes with a ghast with a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.080 
identifier that goes with a ghast with a
specific<00:00:39.559> credit<00:00:40.160> card<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:40.580> they<00:00:40.670> can<00:00:40.820> track

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
specific credit card that they can track

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.520 
specific credit card that they can track
over<00:00:41.420> time<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:41.870> they<00:00:41.930> can<00:00:42.080> see<00:00:42.320> when<00:00:42.500> that

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
over time and they can see when that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.889 
over time and they can see when that
guest<00:00:42.829> comes<00:00:43.160> back<00:00:43.430> now<00:00:43.850> there<00:00:44.570> are<00:00:44.660> actually

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
guest comes back now there are actually

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.389 
guest comes back now there are actually
all<00:00:45.050> kinds<00:00:45.380> of<00:00:45.410> issues<00:00:45.560> with<00:00:45.950> that<00:00:45.980> in<00:00:46.370> terms

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
all kinds of issues with that in terms

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.610 
all kinds of issues with that in terms
of<00:00:46.760> linking<00:00:47.149> credit<00:00:47.480> cards<00:00:47.750> over<00:00:47.899> time<00:00:48.230> and

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
of linking credit cards over time and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.049 
of linking credit cards over time and
people<00:00:48.739> don't<00:00:48.950> use<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.340> same<00:00:49.520> credit<00:00:49.730> card

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
people don't use the same credit card

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.420 
people don't use the same credit card
and<00:00:50.360> there<00:00:50.809> are<00:00:50.870> many<00:00:51.079> issues<00:00:51.430> associated

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
and there are many issues associated

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.870 
and there are many issues associated
with<00:00:52.790> that<00:00:53.090> however<00:00:54.079> on<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.500> directional<00:00:55.460> basis

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
with that however on a directional basis

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.310 
with that however on a directional basis

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
interesting insights a lot of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.310 
interesting insights a lot of
restaurants<00:01:10.910> have<00:01:10.940> also<00:01:11.420> launched<00:01:11.899> a<00:01:12.050> lot<00:01:12.229> of

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
restaurants have also launched a lot of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.670 
restaurants have also launched a lot of
loyalty<00:01:13.360> programs<00:01:14.360> over<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.900> last<00:01:14.960> few<00:01:15.380> years

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
loyalty programs over the last few years

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.310 
loyalty programs over the last few years
and<00:01:16.010> I<00:01:16.130> think<00:01:16.190> loyalty<00:01:16.820> in<00:01:17.119> general<00:01:18.080> in<00:01:18.229> the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
and I think loyalty in general in the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.170 
and I think loyalty in general in the
restaurant<00:01:18.740> space<00:01:18.890> loyalty<00:01:19.670> programs<00:01:20.030> have

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
grown and a lot of the argument for

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.430 
grown and a lot of the argument for
creating<00:01:23.000> those<00:01:23.150> loyalty<00:01:23.600> programs<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.229> all

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
creating those loyalty programs is all

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.630 
creating those loyalty programs is all

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
actually is incredibly valuable source

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.390 
actually is incredibly valuable source
of<00:01:38.270> information<00:01:38.830> especially<00:01:39.830> if<00:01:40.130> you're<00:01:40.340> a

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
of information especially if you're a

two months three months four months six

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.230 
two months three months four months six
months<00:01:47.799> well<00:01:48.799> if<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.280> learn<00:01:49.520> more<00:01:49.790> about<00:01:49.909> the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
months well if you learn more about the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.789 
months well if you learn more about the
middlee<00:01:50.630> enables<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.380> get<00:01:51.590> that

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
middlee enables you to get that

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.679 
middlee enables you to get that
incremental<00:01:52.280> visit<00:01:52.759> by<00:01:53.060> targeting<00:01:53.540> them

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
incremental visit by targeting them

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.260 
incremental visit by targeting them
better<00:01:53.920> there's<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.009> lot<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.280> value<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.700> that

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
better there's a lot of value in that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.899 
better there's a lot of value in that
so<00:01:56.720> we<00:01:56.900> see<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.200> lot<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.650> going<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.070> we<00:01:58.729> also

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
so we see a lot of that going on we also

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.340 
so we see a lot of that going on we also
I<00:01:59.060> think<00:01:59.150> think<00:01:59.540> I<00:01:59.659> think<00:02:00.079> that<00:02:00.200> it's<00:02:00.320> very

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
I think think I think that it's very

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.020 
I think think I think that it's very
early<00:02:00.650> in<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.100> game<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.310> restaurants

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
early in the game in restaurants

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.580 
early in the game in restaurants
especially<00:02:02.119> relative<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:03.020> some<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.439> more

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
especially relative to some of the more

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.789 
especially relative to some of the more
advanced<00:02:04.070> retail<00:02:04.460> clients<00:02:04.850> that<00:02:05.000> we<00:02:05.090> see

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
advanced retail clients that we see

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.080 
advanced retail clients that we see
restaurants<00:02:06.799> have<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.979> lot<00:02:07.280> of<00:02:07.310> opportunities

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
restaurants have a lot of opportunities

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.359 
restaurants have a lot of opportunities
to<00:02:08.209> get<00:02:08.329> better<00:02:08.690> at<00:02:09.019> those<00:02:09.259> loyalty<00:02:09.769> analytics

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
to get better at those loyalty analytics

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.520 
to get better at those loyalty analytics
I<00:02:10.640> would<00:02:11.209> build<00:02:11.360> on<00:02:11.570> that<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:12.049> there's<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.380> lot

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
I would build on that that there's a lot

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.229 
I would build on that that there's a lot
of<00:02:12.680> other<00:02:12.920> guest<00:02:13.280> level<00:02:13.610> data<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.090> can

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
of other guest level data that you can

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.900 
of other guest level data that you can
start<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.750> tie<00:02:14.959> in<00:02:15.140> as<00:02:15.290> well<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:15.829> we<00:02:16.400> see<00:02:16.610> more

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
start to tie in as well so we see more

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.180 
start to tie in as well so we see more
and<00:02:16.970> more<00:02:17.180> data<00:02:17.480> sources<00:02:18.040> guest<00:02:19.040> satisfaction

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
and more data sources guest satisfaction

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.680 
and more data sources guest satisfaction
data<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.180> something

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
data is something

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.010 
data is something
most<00:02:21.350> large<00:02:21.770> restaurants<00:02:22.430> track<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:23.900> you

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
most large restaurants track and if you

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.380 
most large restaurants track and if you
can<00:02:24.140> tie<00:02:24.440> guests<00:02:24.800> satisfaction<00:02:25.460> data<00:02:25.610> back<00:02:26.120> in

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
can tie guests satisfaction data back in

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.970 
can tie guests satisfaction data back in
with<00:02:26.660> loyalty<00:02:27.110> data<00:02:27.470> with<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> credit<00:02:27.950> card

with loyalty data with a credit card

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.740 
with loyalty data with a credit card
hash<00:02:28.280> data<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:28.820> start<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.240> generate<00:02:29.570> some

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
hash data you can start to generate some

hash data you can start to generate some

think<00:02:34.790> over<00:02:35.000> time<00:02:35.030> we'll<00:02:35.420> see<00:02:35.570> more<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:35.900> more

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
think over time we'll see more and more

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.650 
think over time we'll see more and more

then<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.390> difficulty<00:02:50.990> will<00:02:51.290> be<00:02:51.410> what<00:02:51.560> do<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.710> do

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
then the difficulty will be what do I do

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.440 
then the difficulty will be what do I do
with<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.460> how<00:02:52.760> do<00:02:52.820> I<00:02:52.940> make<00:02:53.150> money<00:02:53.300> from

with that and how do I make money from

with that and how do I make money from
it<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.810> that's<00:02:54.020> really<00:02:54.320> where<00:02:54.590> having<00:02:55.310> the
