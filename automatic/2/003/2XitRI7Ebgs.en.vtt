00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.470
 he good day my name is anile i am 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.679
 the mom of jamie and today on violin 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.389
 a review about maxicosi axis fix this them 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.210
 autostore with your little one 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.400
 to about a year or two in stock and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.750
 can also transport backwards and then 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.439
 up to four years 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.850
 can continue to transport the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.439
 car seat no longer with 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.810
 fasten seat belts 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.150
 but you secure it with your isofix 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.489
 system of your car 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.770
 but found that price was off the start 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.110
 completely new to me but turned out to be very 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.270
 easy to use 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.430
 the car seat has indicators that are green 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.800
 be when the car seat is on the right 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.829
 connected in this way you always do 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.899
 sure you're safe with the good 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.899
 how the road is installed 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.410
 a big plus and that you power me 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.840
 when turning small into one 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.510
 definitely get out with my actual 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.570
 toddler or toddler save a lot 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.220
 fiddling and back problems 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.010
 In addition, I think it's very good for that 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.689
 before you can transport it 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.540
 doing the Scandinavian countries is already there 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.430
 a long time and I still am glad 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.350
 I now also in the Netherlands can it is one 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.689
 feel much safer small 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.890
 and certainly because we stood out in big step 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.720
 sit down the road 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 but also daily it is necessary and 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.430
 drive and I safety a very high one 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.420
 requirement but I think those are very beautiful and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.369
 ease of use is super simple and 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.070
 it is very easy to drive in the noise 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.409
 of positioning and safety 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.509
 meets the latest requirements and then with 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.030
 backward transport in particular is quite a challenge 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.340
 big plus 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.310
 definitely recommend i hope you get something 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.670
 these have been lying to your eyes and 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.670
 thanks for looking 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.469
 a
