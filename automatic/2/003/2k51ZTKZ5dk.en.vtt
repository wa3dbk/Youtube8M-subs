00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.170
 angel reyna rules out being a player 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.350
 troubled 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 Well, I can tell you the truth that 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:19.100
 at the time 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.980
 for me to be conflictive 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.890
 and responsible not to work 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.080
 is to really look for problems and 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.140
 my career I have not had one single fault 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.640
 a single late arrival it seems to me that a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.399
 In Monterrey 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.399
 justified by the commitment of the entity 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.020
 I have had problems being in places 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 nocturnal 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.100
 of fines 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.610
 and much less on the court because the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.680
 The last time I was expelled was 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.680
 three years you look like a strong team 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.360
 and they know to be direct and say things 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.430
 how are you not navarrete does not fail we have 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.400
 a water captain and a and a defense 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.330
 plastic 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.790
 well has brought him problems of course yes 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.740
 with many people, nothing more 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.230
 managers but I respect the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.870
 I also respect his way of thinking his 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.000
 way of addressing does not mean that 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.710
 are wrong or that I am wrong simply 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.090
 we have an essence 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.640
 I like to be very direct very loyal 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.030
 and I say things as they are and what 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.030
 I feel 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.600
 I was born to play soccer God gave me 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.060
 that gift and I enjoy it then I can 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.920
 Give her a little joy 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.040
 is for me better then I like it 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.860
 much that some support me some 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.860
 not so much but I think in the end 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.280
 roll the ball so they feel something in their 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.280
 heart 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.590
 today I have that is a great man a great 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.000
 professional 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.060
 he is a player who marked a time that already 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.790
 he made his career and that you have to respect him 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.310
 I want to do what we have done 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.050
 many very different things we are very 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.450
 different 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.460
 and I think we can there's only one like 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.640
 angel reyna also because there is only 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.640
 one
