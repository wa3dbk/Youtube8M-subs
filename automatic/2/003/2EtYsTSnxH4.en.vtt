wall<00:02:40.030> blade<00:02:40.480> if<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.050> look<00:02:41.260> on<00:02:41.470> right<00:02:42.010> there

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
wall blade if you look on right there

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.580 
wall blade if you look on right there
trying<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.209> zoom<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.019> can<00:02:44.230> see<00:02:44.410> it

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
trying to zoom it in so you can see it

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.860 
trying to zoom it in so you can see it
that's<00:02:45.220> actually<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.970> blade<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.630> comes

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
that's actually the blade that it comes

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.060 
that's actually the blade that it comes
with<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.180> close<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.590> blade<00:02:50.829> that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
with it's that close but the blade that

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.300 
with it's that close but the blade that
comes<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:51.549> there<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.030> non<00:02:52.980> adjusting<00:02:53.980> bleed

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
comes on there is a non adjusting bleed

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.449 
comes on there is a non adjusting bleed
so<00:02:55.269> what<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.540> do<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.870> have<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.470> customize<00:02:57.160> and

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
so what I do I have to customize and

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.810 
so what I do I have to customize and
tailor<00:02:57.519> everything<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:59.650> what<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.100> need<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.579> for

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
tailor everything to what I need it for

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.640 
tailor everything to what I need it for
you<00:03:01.209> know<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.630> really<00:03:01.840> don't<00:03:01.959> have<00:03:02.230> any<00:03:02.500> use

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
you know and I really don't have any use

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.259 
you know and I really don't have any use
for<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:03.040> square<00:03:03.340> blade<00:03:03.579> that<00:03:03.910> can't<00:03:04.150> be

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
for the square blade that can't be

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.009 
for the square blade that can't be
adjusted<00:03:04.930> because<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:06.160> know<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.310> could<00:03:07.019> you

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
adjusted because you know I could you

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.110 
adjusted because you know I could you
know<00:03:08.049> cuts<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.920> shaves<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.670> stuff<00:03:09.910> that

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
know cuts and shaves and stuff that

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.789 
know cuts and shaves and stuff that
require<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> lot<00:03:10.870> closer<00:03:11.170> then<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.650> can

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
require a lot closer then you can

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.470 
require a lot closer then you can
actually<00:03:12.010> get<00:03:12.370> with<00:03:12.579> something<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.239> can't

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
actually get with something that can't

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.110 
actually get with something that can't
be<00:03:13.660> zero<00:03:14.049> gap<00:03:14.320> but<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.100> has<00:03:15.310> pretty<00:03:15.579> good<00:03:15.670> power

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
be zero gap but it has pretty good power

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.860 
be zero gap but it has pretty good power
so<00:03:16.480> what<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.720> did<00:03:17.049> I<00:03:17.380> basically<00:03:18.280> took<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.870> five

of them that way but the Clipper I

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.310 
of them that way but the Clipper I
pretty<00:07:08.000> much<00:07:08.090> just<00:07:08.270> set<00:07:08.720> the<00:07:08.870> blade<00:07:09.080> a<00:07:09.110> little

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
pretty much just set the blade a little

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.090 
pretty much just set the blade a little
bit<00:07:09.680> closer<00:07:10.010> and<00:07:10.940> left<00:07:11.630> it<00:07:11.840> as<00:07:12.050> is<00:07:12.380> but<00:07:12.770> as<00:07:12.890> far

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100 
bit closer and left it as is but as far

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.580 
bit closer and left it as is but as far
as<00:07:13.130> the<00:07:13.340> two<00:07:13.520> trimmers<00:07:14.000> I<00:07:14.210> kind<00:07:15.140> of<00:07:15.200> tailor

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
as the two trimmers I kind of tailor

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.160 
as the two trimmers I kind of tailor
them<00:07:15.830> to<00:07:16.070> fit<00:07:16.340> more<00:07:17.030> of<00:07:17.240> what<00:07:17.450> I<00:07:17.480> need<00:07:17.810> them<00:07:17.960> for

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170 
them to fit more of what I need them for

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.750 
them to fit more of what I need them for
rather<00:07:18.440> than<00:07:18.560> the<00:07:18.800> way<00:07:18.950> that<00:07:19.070> they<00:07:19.250> are<00:07:19.460> but

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:19.760 
rather than the way that they are but

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.940 
rather than the way that they are but
they<00:07:20.450> have<00:07:20.690> pretty<00:07:20.990> good<00:07:21.080> power<00:07:21.440> and<00:07:21.830> I<00:07:21.890> do

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:21.950 
they have pretty good power and I do

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.420 
they have pretty good power and I do
