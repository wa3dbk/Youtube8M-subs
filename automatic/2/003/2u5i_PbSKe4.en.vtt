laid<00:02:34.629> out<00:02:34.659> and<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.709> function<00:02:36.099> of<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.519> lot

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
laid out and this is a function of a lot

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.690

of<00:02:36.819> different<00:02:37.120> things<00:02:37.209> most<00:02:37.810> notably<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.769> poor

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
of different things most notably a poor

interface<00:02:40.359> between<00:02:40.659> what<00:02:41.290> we<00:02:41.379> have<00:02:41.560> in<00:02:41.769> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
interface between what we have in the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.979 
interface between what we have in the
Android<00:02:42.700> device<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.299> I<00:02:43.329> have<00:02:43.390> paired<00:02:43.750> as

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
Android device that I have paired as

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.559 
Android device that I have paired as
well<00:02:44.260> as<00:02:44.379> what<00:02:44.560> we've<00:02:44.680> got<00:02:44.859> in<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.120> system

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
well as what we've got in in the system

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.319 
well as what we've got in in the system
and<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.590> just<00:02:47.799> not<00:02:47.950> talking<00:02:48.640> well<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.180> one

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
and so it's just not talking well to one

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.059 
and so it's just not talking well to one
