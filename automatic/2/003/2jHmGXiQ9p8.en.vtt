00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 in the near future on the roads may 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.400
 there will be cars that will 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.519
 used as fuel for the thorium 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.400
 Essentially this is a car with a nuclear engine 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.859
 and in case you buy yourself such 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.320
 car you probably do not refuel 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.680
 will have to since this car 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.720
 it takes one refill a hundred years just 8 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.630
 grams of substance based on 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.230
 is the torus and you can ride all your life 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.420
 quietly in the laser power system 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 have long been working on a new system 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.250
 engine that could use 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 extremely dense material in nature 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.430
 tare because of its high density tariff 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.610
 able to produce an incredible amount 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.649
 energy experiments are also being conducted 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 which use small fragments 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.739
 thorium to create a laser beam 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.420
 able to heat a liquid 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.059
 generate steam as well as rotate 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.090
 small turbine engine prototype 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.180
 which has already been created working on the torus and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.760
 has a weight of 200 kilograms and quite 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.409
 able to fit in the back of the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.680
 ordinary car 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.290
 according to experts, 1 gram tore 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.689
 releases more energy than it can 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.630
 allocate about thirty thousand liters 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.270
 gasoline specialists robert hargraves 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.090
 told in a short interview that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.860
 it is planned to create such an engine 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.110
 which will consume the source 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 energy at which release into the atmosphere 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.590
 harmful substances decrease to zero between 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.710
 so it is necessary to ensure that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.329
 fuel was cheaper than coal otherwise project 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.270
 will inevitably fail 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.780
 what is the torus and better than other sources 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.720
 energy tori emits up to 10,000 times 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.390
 less radioactive waste requiring 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.509
 many years of decay in the mining process 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.000
 thorium is only one pure 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.100
 isotope a mixture of natural uranium 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.280
 isotopes require enrichment 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.780
 work in most conventional nuclear 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.660
 reactors round fail 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.630
 support chain nuclear reactions without 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.970
 special conditions it is very useful 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.090
 property if any happens 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.430
 emergency case for example accident in 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.370
 Then the process of decomposition in the reactor 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.770
 will stop automatically in 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.940
 the end of his story Hargraves allowed 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.530
 yourself look into the near future and 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.380
 predicted that many factories and 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.440
 industrial concerns are already interested 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.780
 in the transition to the container that soon 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.780
 you and I saw with our own eyes
