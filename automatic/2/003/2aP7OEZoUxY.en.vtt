00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
volt is just such a great ability and I

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.610 
volt is just such a great ability and I
mix<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:01.900> with<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.200> tactical<00:04:03.070> advantage

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
mix it with the tactical advantage

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.020 
mix it with the tactical advantage
passive<00:04:05.620> skill<00:04:05.859> basically<00:04:06.430> making<00:04:06.609> that<00:04:06.910> you

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
passive skill basically making that you

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.539 
passive skill basically making that you
can<00:04:07.180> run<00:04:07.329> faster<00:04:07.750> for<00:04:07.989> two<00:04:08.109> seconds<00:04:08.549> sixty

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
can run faster for two seconds sixty

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.840 
can run faster for two seconds sixty
percent<00:04:09.640> faster<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.359> it's<00:04:10.540> pretty<00:04:10.750> cool<00:04:10.900> to

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
percent faster so it's pretty cool to

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.849 
percent faster so it's pretty cool to
spam<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.090> just<00:04:13.780> rush<00:04:14.049> through<00:04:14.079> stuff<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.650> get

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
spam and just rush through stuff and get

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.159 
spam and just rush through stuff and get
away<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.280> stuff<00:04:15.690> obviously<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:16.930> use

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
away and stuff obviously I use

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.379 
away and stuff obviously I use
smokescreen<00:04:17.500> with<00:04:18.010> lingering<00:04:18.340> fog<00:04:18.669> basically

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
smokescreen with lingering fog basically

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.409 
smokescreen with lingering fog basically
you're<00:04:19.720> invulnerable<00:04:20.079> for<00:04:20.590> 1.5<00:04:21.100> seconds<00:04:21.549> it's

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
you're invulnerable for 1.5 seconds it's

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.140 
you're invulnerable for 1.5 seconds it's
great<00:04:22.690> against<00:04:23.110> bosses<00:04:23.919> that<00:04:24.220> let's<00:04:24.760> say<00:04:24.970> as

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
great against bosses that let's say as

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.670 
great against bosses that let's say as
when<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.360> choose<00:04:25.660> this<00:04:25.720> fireball<00:04:26.200> you<00:04:26.320> just<00:04:26.500> pop

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
when I choose this fireball you just pop

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.950 
when I choose this fireball you just pop
that<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:27.639> soak<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.090> damage<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.600> don't<00:04:28.780> take

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
that you soak the damage you don't take

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.200 
that you soak the damage you don't take
anything<00:04:29.430> it's<00:04:30.430> great<00:04:30.639> for<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.880> pool<00:04:31.630> Bloods

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
anything it's great for the pool Bloods

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.580 
anything it's great for the pool Bloods
it's<00:04:34.210> great<00:04:34.419> for<00:04:34.570> anything<00:04:34.780> that<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.320> going<00:04:35.470> to

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
it's great for anything that is going to

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.510 
it's great for anything that is going to
kill<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.919> and<00:04:36.130> then<00:04:36.159> you

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
kill you and then you

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.580 
kill you and then you
pop<00:04:36.669> smoke<00:04:37.030> screen<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.509> you<00:04:37.930> no<00:04:38.110> longer<00:04:38.139> going

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
pop smoke screen and you no longer going

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.189 
pop smoke screen and you no longer going
to<00:04:38.710> die<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.940> requires<00:04:40.419> a<00:04:40.509> bit<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:40.690> timing<00:04:41.080> and

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
to die it requires a bit of timing and

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.400 
to die it requires a bit of timing and
it's<00:04:41.800> pretty<00:04:41.949> expensive<00:04:42.190> on<00:04:42.990> discipline<00:04:43.990> but

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
it's pretty expensive on discipline but

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.550 
it's pretty expensive on discipline but
um<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:46.180> why<00:04:46.330> my<00:04:46.720> affordability<00:04:47.229> is

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
um and this is why my affordability is

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.369 
um and this is why my affordability is
preparation<00:04:48.159> I<00:04:48.669> use<00:04:49.449> it<00:04:49.629> with<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.870> one<00:04:50.080> the

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
preparation I use it with the one the

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.740 
preparation I use it with the one the
room<00:04:50.620> focus<00:04:51.340> mine<00:04:51.550> which<00:04:51.879> basically<00:04:52.210> makes<00:04:52.509> it

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
room focus mine which basically makes it

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.230 
room focus mine which basically makes it
you<00:04:53.080> gain<00:04:53.319> discipline<00:04:53.770> over<00:04:54.099> time<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.669> not

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
you gain discipline over time and not

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.409 
you gain discipline over time and not
like<00:04:55.960> at<00:04:56.199> the<00:04:56.229> same<00:04:56.500> like<00:04:56.800> one<00:04:57.099> shot<00:04:57.370> I<00:04:57.580> but<00:04:58.240> in

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
like at the same like one shot I but in

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.980 
like at the same like one shot I but in
stop<00:04:58.690> gaining<00:04:58.840> 30<00:04:59.139> you<00:04:59.860> will<00:05:00.009> gain<00:05:00.220> 45<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:01.419> it

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
stop gaining 30 you will gain 45 so it

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.839 
stop gaining 30 you will gain 45 so it
lets<00:05:02.199> you<00:05:02.440> spam<00:05:02.680> your<00:05:02.830> stuff<00:05:03.069> and<00:05:03.310> move<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.669> bit

tribe you better have basically when you
stand<00:05:30.639> in<00:05:30.729> your<00:05:30.789> trap<00:05:31.419> you're<00:05:31.840> going<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.080> get

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
stand in your trap you're going to get

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.959 
stand in your trap you're going to get
temps<00:05:32.530> and<00:05:32.680> crit<00:05:32.889> chance<00:05:32.919> which<00:05:33.430> is<00:05:33.610> very<00:05:33.880> very

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
temps and crit chance which is very very

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.980 
temps and crit chance which is very very
very<00:05:34.569> good<00:05:35.460> in<00:05:36.460> situation<00:05:37.389> can<00:05:37.599> use<00:05:37.719> shadow

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
very good in situation can use shadow

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.430 
very good in situation can use shadow
power<00:05:38.259> and<00:05:38.729> marked<00:05:39.729> for<00:05:40.060> debt<00:05:40.270> with<00:05:40.960> a<00:05:40.990> proper

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
runes usually for Mark for that you want

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.249 
runes usually for Mark for that you want
to<00:05:44.830> use<00:05:44.919> value<00:05:45.460> of<00:05:45.669> that<00:05:45.849> basically<00:05:46.479> think<00:05:46.870> it

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:47.259 
to use value of that basically think it

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.260 
to use value of that basically think it
does<00:05:47.740> increase<00:05:48.069> the<00:05:48.250> damage<00:05:48.400> that<00:05:48.699> the<00:05:49.030> mob<00:05:49.240> is

does increase the damage that the mob is

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.480 
does increase the damage that the mob is
going<00:05:49.569> to<00:05:49.630> take<00:05:49.870> so<00:05:50.289> only<00:05:50.740> standing<00:05:51.219> in<00:05:51.310> their

very useful and I'm sure there's a

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.399 
very useful and I'm sure there's a
plenty<00:05:55.090> of<00:05:55.330> viable<00:05:55.750> traps<00:05:56.849> builds<00:05:57.849> out<00:05:58.000> there

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
plenty of viable traps builds out there

person I'm not a final trap since I find
it<00:06:00.909> somewhat<00:06:03.090> situational<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.180> guess<00:06:04.389> like<00:06:04.690> I

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
it somewhat situational I guess like I

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.990 
it somewhat situational I guess like I
know<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:05.710> just<00:06:05.860> prefer<00:06:06.130> using<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.610> mental<00:06:06.849> era

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
know I just prefer using the mental era

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.059 
know I just prefer using the mental era
overall<00:06:07.360> but<00:06:08.289> um<00:06:08.440> yeah<00:06:08.620> we're<00:06:08.770> going<00:06:08.889> to<00:06:08.949> move

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069 
overall but um yeah we're going to move

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.070 
overall but um yeah we're going to move
on<00:06:09.190> to<00:06:09.250> those<00:06:09.400> pests<00:06:09.699> passive<00:06:10.210> skills<00:06:10.449> I<00:06:10.659> guess

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
on to those pests passive skills I guess

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.899 
on to those pests passive skills I guess
a<00:06:11.110> tactical<00:06:11.680> advantage<00:06:11.710> really<00:06:12.460> nice<00:06:12.639> for

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
a tactical advantage really nice for

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.180 
a tactical advantage really nice for
getaways<00:06:13.509> and<00:06:13.659> stuff<00:06:13.990> like<00:06:14.080> that<00:06:14.139> right<00:06:15.009> now<00:06:15.069> i

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
getaways and stuff like that right now i

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.189 
getaways and stuff like that right now i
use<00:06:15.250> sharpshooter<00:06:15.940> it's<00:06:16.539> not<00:06:16.719> one<00:06:16.990> of<00:06:17.020> my

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
use sharpshooter it's not one of my

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.379 
use sharpshooter it's not one of my
favorite<00:06:17.469> at<00:06:17.590> all<00:06:17.710> i<00:06:17.919> use<00:06:18.909> it<00:06:19.060> basically

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
favorite at all i use it basically

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:21.269 
favorite at all i use it basically
because<00:06:19.690> my<00:06:19.840> crit<00:06:20.289> chance<00:06:20.319> is<00:06:20.650> very<00:06:20.860> low<00:06:21.099> right

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:21.279 
because my crit chance is very low right

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:23.580 
because my crit chance is very low right
now<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.639> i<00:06:22.240> use<00:06:22.419> it<00:06:22.599> since<00:06:22.840> I<00:06:22.990> met<00:06:23.169> using<00:06:23.500> a

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
now and i use it since I met using a

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.469 
now and i use it since I met using a
crossbow<00:06:24.069> if<00:06:24.310> I<00:06:24.430> would<00:06:24.580> be<00:06:24.699> using<00:06:25.029> a<00:06:25.090> bow<00:06:25.240> as

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
crossbow if I would be using a bow as

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.930 
crossbow if I would be using a bow as
you'd<00:06:25.750> be<00:06:25.930> using<00:06:26.469> a<00:06:26.680> archery<00:06:27.370> instead<00:06:27.729> of

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
you'd be using a archery instead of

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.879 
you'd be using a archery instead of
sharp<00:06:28.330> shooter<00:06:28.630> which<00:06:29.199> increase<00:06:29.590> the<00:06:29.770> bow

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
sharp shooter which increase the bow

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.230 
sharp shooter which increase the bow
damaged<00:06:30.219> by<00:06:30.370> fifteen<00:06:30.789> percent<00:06:32.460> if<00:06:33.460> you<00:06:34.000> have<00:06:34.210> a

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
damaged by fifteen percent if you have a

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.659 
damaged by fifteen percent if you have a
lot<00:06:34.479> of<00:06:34.509> crit<00:06:34.840> you<00:06:35.409> can<00:06:35.560> still<00:06:35.830> use<00:06:36.039> archery

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669 
lot of crit you can still use archery

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.249 
lot of crit you can still use archery
because<00:06:37.180> it<00:06:37.300> increases<00:06:37.569> your<00:06:37.750> critical<00:06:38.080> hit

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
because it increases your critical hit

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:39.779 
because it increases your critical hit
damage<00:06:38.289> by<00:06:38.710> a<00:06:38.740> lot<00:06:38.979> right<00:06:39.219> now<00:06:39.340> my<00:06:39.520> crit<00:06:39.759> chance

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
damage by a lot right now my crit chance

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.790 
damage by a lot right now my crit chance
is<00:06:40.150> very<00:06:40.360> low<00:06:40.630> so<00:06:40.810> it's<00:06:41.020> not<00:06:41.199> worth<00:06:41.409> it<00:06:41.560> for<00:06:41.770> me

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
is very low so it's not worth it for me

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.680 
is very low so it's not worth it for me
but<00:06:42.580> if<00:06:42.729> you<00:06:42.759> have<00:06:43.000> like<00:06:43.180> fifteen<00:06:43.479> percent

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
but if you have like fifteen percent

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.659 
but if you have like fifteen percent
twenty<00:06:43.960> percent<00:06:44.169> or<00:06:44.319> more<00:06:44.349> and<00:06:45.339> you<00:06:45.460> use<00:06:45.639> a

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
twenty percent or more and you use a

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:47.939 
twenty percent or more and you use a
crossbow<00:06:45.969> critical<00:06:46.870> hit<00:06:47.050> damage<00:06:47.080> the<00:06:47.620> archery

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
crossbow critical hit damage the archery

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.830 
crossbow critical hit damage the archery
passive<00:06:48.759> skill<00:06:48.940> is<00:06:49.120> going<00:06:49.360> to<00:06:49.419> be<00:06:49.509> very

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
passive skill is going to be very

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.020 
passive skill is going to be very
very<00:06:50.110> very<00:06:50.350> useful<00:06:50.919> in<00:06:51.340> terms<00:06:51.490> of<00:06:51.639> DPS

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
very very useful in terms of DPS

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.260 
very very useful in terms of DPS
increase<00:06:53.040> now<00:06:54.040> I<00:06:54.070> like<00:06:54.400> to<00:06:54.430> use<00:06:54.669> steady<00:06:54.970> aim<00:06:55.120> as

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
increase now I like to use steady aim as

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.150 
increase now I like to use steady aim as
well<00:06:55.449> it's<00:06:56.139> an<00:06:56.230> extra<00:06:56.530> twenty<00:06:56.740> percent<00:06:56.980> damage

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
well it's an extra twenty percent damage

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.370 
well it's an extra twenty percent damage
whenever<00:06:57.610> you<00:06:57.730> get<00:06:57.790> ten<00:06:58.060> yard<00:06:58.330> away<00:06:58.449> and<00:06:58.840> ten

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
whenever you get ten yard away and ten

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.270 
whenever you get ten yard away and ten
yard<00:06:59.620> is<00:06:59.860> honestly<00:07:00.400> very<00:07:00.639> small<00:07:01.060> it's<00:07:02.280> it's

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
yard is honestly very small it's it's

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.070 
yard is honestly very small it's it's
probably<00:07:05.580> yeah<00:07:06.580> I'm<00:07:06.880> pretty<00:07:07.270> sure<00:07:07.479> 10<00:07:07.750> yard<00:07:07.960> is

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
probably yeah I'm pretty sure 10 yard is

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.590 
probably yeah I'm pretty sure 10 yard is
about<00:07:08.320> this<00:07:08.710> distance<00:07:09.130> between<00:07:09.460> my<00:07:10.210> character

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600 
about this distance between my character

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.540 
about this distance between my character
and<00:07:10.630> this<00:07:10.900> NPC<00:07:11.350> it's<00:07:11.889> something<00:07:12.280> that's<00:07:12.460> very

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
and this NPC it's something that's very

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.659 
and this NPC it's something that's very
small<00:07:13.290> I'll<00:07:14.290> actually<00:07:14.530> probably<00:07:15.070> bit<00:07:15.310> small

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669 
small I'll actually probably bit small

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.659 
small I'll actually probably bit small
in<00:07:15.790> that<00:07:15.820> even<00:07:16.120> but<00:07:16.960> um<00:07:17.110> yeah<00:07:17.770> basically<00:07:18.430> it's

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 
in that even but um yeah basically it's

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.490 
in that even but um yeah basically it's
just<00:07:18.820> extra<00:07:19.300> DPS<00:07:19.720> whenever<00:07:20.110> you<00:07:20.290> and<00:07:20.410> I<00:07:20.440> on

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
just extra DPS whenever you and I on

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.420 
just extra DPS whenever you and I on
melee<00:07:20.860> range<00:07:21.100> and<00:07:21.400> it's<00:07:22.180> very<00:07:22.479> worth<00:07:22.750> it<00:07:23.430> now

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
melee range and it's very worth it now

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.850 
melee range and it's very worth it now
at<00:07:24.639> some<00:07:24.850> point<00:07:25.150> you<00:07:25.930> can<00:07:26.169> switch<00:07:26.530> some

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:26.860 
at some point you can switch some

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.710 
at some point you can switch some
abilities<00:07:27.340> around<00:07:27.639> I<00:07:27.850> know<00:07:28.270> a<00:07:28.419> lot<00:07:28.570> of<00:07:28.600> people

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
abilities around I know a lot of people

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.840 
abilities around I know a lot of people
like<00:07:29.110> to<00:07:29.229> use<00:07:29.260> Night<00:07:29.590> Stalker<00:07:29.830> critical<00:07:30.639> hits

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:30.850

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.200 
i perchance restore one disciplines are
useful<00:07:32.919> for<00:07:32.950> more<00:07:33.370> scape<00:07:34.050> and<00:07:35.639> I<00:07:36.639> think<00:07:37.030> that's

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.210 
useful for more scape and I think that's

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.020 
useful for more scape and I think that's
about<00:07:37.419> it<00:07:37.660> what<00:07:37.900> else<00:07:38.260> do<00:07:38.410> people<00:07:38.530> use<00:07:39.030> well

about it what else do people use well
