much<00:01:10.500> bigger<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.220> much<00:01:11.490> followed<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.210> way

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
much bigger it's much followed this way

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.530 
much bigger it's much followed this way
so<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.130> nice<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> spongy<00:01:14.850> now

it's<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:16.049> soaking<00:01:16.409> wet<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.100> give<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
it's not soaking wet so if I give it a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.609 
it's not soaking wet so if I give it a
squeeze<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.450> gonna<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:18.869> dripping

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
squeeze it's not gonna be like dripping

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.370 
squeeze it's not gonna be like dripping
wet<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:19.890> anything<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.939> dumped<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:22.259> know

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.120 
of the best foundations i would highly
recommend<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.960> comes<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.650> variety<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
recommend it it comes in a variety of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.069 
recommend it it comes in a variety of
different<00:01:32.220> shade<00:01:32.670> options<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.659> different

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
different shade options and different

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.590 
different shade options and different
colors<00:01:34.650> give<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.040> good<00:01:35.130> shake<00:01:35.299> because<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
colors give it a good shake because it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.969 
colors give it a good shake because it
does<00:01:36.720> say<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> shake<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> back<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
does say to shake it up in the back and

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.890 
does say to shake it up in the back and
then<00:01:38.189> that's<00:01:38.340> because<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.060> liquidy<00:01:39.750> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
then that's because it's so liquidy and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.350 
then that's because it's so liquidy and
there's<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.380> lot<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.560> pigment<00:01:41.360> pigmentation

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
there's a lot of pigment pigmentation

there's a lot of pigment pigmentation
that's<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:42.930> you've<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.350> got<00:01:43.470> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that's in there so you've really got to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.260 
that's in there so you've really got to
shake<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.340> okay<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:44.970> i<00:01:45.240> have--

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
which I'm kind of annoyed at because

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.899 
which I'm kind of annoyed at because
it's<00:01:52.229> quite<00:01:52.619> pink<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.189> plumps<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> back<00:01:53.759> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

my<00:01:53.939> hand<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.079> really<00:01:55.500> nice<00:01:55.829> coverage<00:01:56.369> not

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
my hand this is really nice coverage not

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.550 
my hand this is really nice coverage not
a<00:01:57.210> matte<00:01:57.479> finish<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> satin<00:01:58.530> finish

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
