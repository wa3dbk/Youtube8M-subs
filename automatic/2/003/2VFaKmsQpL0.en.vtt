00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
different is the serial number on this

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.130 
different is the serial number on this
but<00:01:57.400> even<00:01:57.730> a<00:01:57.820> model<00:01:58.120> number<00:01:58.420> is<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.600> same<00:01:58.840> it's

just<00:01:59.170> serial<00:01:59.620> number<00:01:59.830> but<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.010> may<00:02:00.490> defer

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
just serial number but that may defer

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.320 
just serial number but that may defer
with<00:02:01.870> all<00:02:02.140> different<00:02:02.590> person<00:02:03.010> so<00:02:03.280> kind<00:02:04.270> of

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
and also the biggest thing the easiest

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.490 
and also the biggest thing the easiest
way<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.200> tell<00:04:08.500> is<00:04:09.810> where<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:11.080> says<00:04:11.380> beat<00:04:12.300> it<00:04:13.500> is

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
way to tell is where it says beat it is

way to tell is where it says beat it is
darker<00:04:15.340> on<00:04:15.520> the<00:04:15.910> row<00:04:16.299> pair<00:04:16.510> on<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.720> left<00:04:16.930> and

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
on the fake pair it's just a little bit

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.010 
on the fake pair it's just a little bit
lighter<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.350> thicker<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:22.630> that's<00:04:22.780> the

lighter and thicker so that's the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.780 
lighter and thicker so that's the
easiest<00:04:23.350> way<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.590> tell<00:04:23.890> with<00:04:24.100> this<00:04:24.250> specific

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
text it's all close together so with

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.310 
text it's all close together so with
like<00:05:33.370> the<00:05:33.520> overall<00:05:33.970> fill<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:37.720> on<00:05:38.169> the

headband<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:39.730> fake<00:05:40.030> prayer<00:05:40.240> actually<00:05:40.630> feels

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
headband the fake prayer actually feels

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.710 
headband the fake prayer actually feels
softer<00:05:41.910> surprisingly<00:05:42.910> then<00:05:43.300> the<00:05:43.390> real<00:05:43.540> pair

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
softer surprisingly then the real pair

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.000 
softer surprisingly then the real pair
but<00:05:44.160> the<00:05:45.160> real<00:05:45.820> pair<00:05:46.080> just<00:05:47.080> feels<00:05:47.350> more<00:05:47.590> firm

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
but the real pair just feels more firm

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.300 
but the real pair just feels more firm
and<00:05:48.720> they<00:05:49.720> weigh<00:05:50.080> just<00:05:50.440> a<00:05:50.950> little<00:05:51.250> bit<00:05:51.370> more<00:05:51.640> so

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
almost the same but there's just like a

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.800 
almost the same but there's just like a
few<00:06:04.990> different<00:06:05.280> things<00:06:06.280> with<00:06:06.520> it<00:06:06.550> like<00:06:06.880> such

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.409 
few different things with it like such
as<00:06:07.960> with<00:06:08.110> the<00:06:08.229> fake<00:06:08.440> pair<00:06:09.240> sometimes<00:06:10.240> when<00:06:10.390> I

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
as with the fake pair sometimes when I

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.990 
as with the fake pair sometimes when I
get<00:06:10.479> on<00:06:10.660> Bluetooth<00:06:11.220> it's<00:06:12.220> like<00:06:12.490> when<00:06:12.729> I<00:06:12.789> when<00:06:12.970> I

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
get on Bluetooth it's like when I when I

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.670 
get on Bluetooth it's like when I when I
turn<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.600> volume<00:06:13.630> all<00:06:14.050> the<00:06:14.080> way<00:06:14.169> up<00:06:14.229> and<00:06:14.560> it's

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
turn the volume all the way up and it's

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.900 
turn the volume all the way up and it's
like<00:06:14.770> a<00:06:14.800> high<00:06:15.039> heavy<00:06:15.640> bass<00:06:15.820> song

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
like a high heavy bass song

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.190 
like a high heavy bass song
it<00:06:16.970> starts<00:06:17.300> to<00:06:17.450> shake<00:06:17.660> a<00:06:17.690> little<00:06:17.780> bit<00:06:18.050> and

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
it starts to shake a little bit and

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.500 
it starts to shake a little bit and
sounds<00:06:18.410> like<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:18.650> speaker's<00:06:19.070> busted<00:06:19.510> but

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
sounds like the speaker's busted but

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.170 
sounds like the speaker's busted but
it's<00:06:20.660> just<00:06:20.780> clear<00:06:21.140> on<00:06:21.410> the<00:06:21.680> real<00:06:21.830> pair<00:06:22.330> so

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180
