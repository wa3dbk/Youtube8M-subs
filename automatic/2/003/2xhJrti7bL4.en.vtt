00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it's pretty difficult in my opinion I'm

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.200 
it's pretty difficult in my opinion I'm
not<00:00:54.360> really<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.660> ps3<00:00:55.379> gamer<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:55.949> an<00:00:56.430> Xbox<00:00:56.730> gamer

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
not really a ps3 gamer or an Xbox gamer

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.139 
not really a ps3 gamer or an Xbox gamer
and<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.539> really<00:00:57.840> used<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.879> regular<00:00:59.879> Wii

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and I'm really used to the regular Wii

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.750 
and I'm really used to the regular Wii
remote<00:01:00.480> control<00:01:01.020> settings<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.680> aiming<00:01:02.579> with

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
remote control settings and aiming with

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
remote control settings and aiming with
the<00:01:02.879> Wii<00:01:03.000> Remote<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.470> different

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the Wii Remote so it's a different

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.469 
the Wii Remote so it's a different
that's<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.339> different<00:01:05.369> challenge<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.210> me<00:01:06.299> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that's a different challenge for me and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.030 
that's a different challenge for me and
I'm<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.110> liking<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.530> right<00:01:07.650> now<00:01:07.799> because

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
I'm kind of liking it right now because

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.429 
I'm kind of liking it right now because
it<00:01:08.939> brings<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.330> whole<00:01:09.479> new<00:01:09.510> aspect<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> game

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it brings a whole new aspect to the game

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.289 
it brings a whole new aspect to the game
and<00:01:10.939> makes<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.060> lot<00:01:12.240> funner<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.700> basically<00:01:14.700> what

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and makes a lot funner so basically what

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.780 
and makes a lot funner so basically what
I'm<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.290> talk<00:01:16.500> about<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:17.040> guess<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.580> some

advantages<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> disadvantages<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.590> using

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
advantages and disadvantages to using

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.090 
advantages and disadvantages to using
the<00:01:20.070> Wii<00:01:20.220> Remote<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.720> using<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> classic

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the Wii Remote as to using the classic

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.880 
the Wii Remote as to using the classic

classic control Pro and I don't believe

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.999 
classic control Pro and I don't believe
you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.950> lunge<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> Wii<00:01:36.030> Remote<00:01:36.560> if<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
you can lunge with the Wii Remote if you

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.940 
you can lunge with the Wii Remote if you

classic controller Pro it looks like you
can<00:01:47.189> lunge<00:01:47.399> which<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.390> pretty<00:01:48.750> cool<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850

be<00:01:56.880> lunging<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.540> it'd<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.110> kind<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.380> annoying

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
be lunging and it'd be kind of annoying

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.270 
be lunging and it'd be kind of annoying
but<00:01:59.009> its<00:01:59.850> way<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.469> still<00:02:01.469> probably<00:02:01.649> say<00:02:01.890> 90%

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
but its way so I still probably say 90%

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.830 
but its way so I still probably say 90%
of<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.820> guys<00:02:03.000> still<00:02:03.299> use<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> good<00:02:03.810> old

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
of you guys still use the good old

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.419 
of you guys still use the good old
Wiimote<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.579> I<00:02:06.200> will<00:02:07.200> probably<00:02:07.409> not<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.799> using

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
Wiimote and I will probably not be using

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.349 
Wiimote and I will probably not be using

unless I'm trying to get a gameplay for
you<00:02:14.620> guys<00:02:14.769> so<00:02:15.359> because<00:02:16.359> I<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:16.870> prefer<00:02:17.200> the

Wii Remote and the nunchuck after all
I've<00:02:21.010> been<00:02:21.280> playing<00:02:21.549> on<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.969> for<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.269> last

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:22.389 
I've been playing on that for the last

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.640 
I've been playing on that for the last
two<00:02:23.109> years<00:02:23.349> out<00:02:24.040> with<00:02:24.370> world<00:02:24.700> at<00:02:24.819> war<00:02:24.999> and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
two years out with world at war and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.530 
two years out with world at war and
reflex<00:02:26.650> then<00:02:26.889> I<00:02:27.129> write<00:02:27.849> there<00:02:28.060> was<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.269> nice

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
reflex then I write there was a nice

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.179 
reflex then I write there was a nice
commando<00:02:29.019> lunge<00:02:29.260> I'll<00:02:29.439> slow<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.799> down<00:02:29.980> for

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
commando lunge I'll slow that down for

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:35.250 
commando lunge I'll slow that down for
you<00:02:30.250> in<00:02:30.400> slow-mo<00:02:31.799> gif<00:02:32.799> commanded<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.510> that's

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
you in slow-mo gif commanded so that's

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.500 
you in slow-mo gif commanded so that's
an<00:02:35.889> obvious<00:02:36.310> advantage<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:37.090> using<00:02:37.239> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
an obvious advantage to using the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.300 
an obvious advantage to using the
classic<00:02:37.870> controller<00:02:37.989> Pro<00:02:38.469> is<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.769> knifing

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
classic controller Pro is the knifing

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.869 
classic controller Pro is the knifing
lunge<00:02:39.849> or<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.689> knifing<00:02:41.079> range<00:02:41.349> and<00:02:41.879> another

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
lunge or the knifing range and another

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.270 
lunge or the knifing range and another
advantage<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.480> tell<00:02:43.989> so<00:02:44.590> far<00:02:44.620> from<00:02:45.069> using

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
advantage I can tell so far from using

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.780 
advantage I can tell so far from using
the<00:02:46.060> classic<00:02:46.510> controller<00:02:46.629> Pro<00:02:47.049> is<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:48.129> if

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
the classic controller Pro is that if

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.520 
the classic controller Pro is that if
you<00:02:49.150> encounter<00:02:49.540> an<00:02:49.629> enemy<00:02:49.900> at<00:02:50.019> close<00:02:50.230> range

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
you encounter an enemy at close range

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.039 
you encounter an enemy at close range
the<00:02:51.159> reticles<00:02:51.609> will<00:02:51.790> kind<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.389> follow<00:02:52.629> him<00:02:52.870> and

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
the reticles will kind of follow him and

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.629 
the reticles will kind of follow him and
lock<00:02:53.199> on<00:02:53.409> so<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.799> makes<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.099> easier<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.549> hit

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
lock on so it makes it easier to hit

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.500 
lock on so it makes it easier to hit
fire<00:02:54.909> and<00:02:55.260> lock<00:02:56.260> onto<00:02:56.500> your<00:02:56.769> target<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.510> mean

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
fire and lock onto your target I mean

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.509 
fire and lock onto your target I mean
your<00:02:58.659> screen<00:02:58.930> water<00:02:59.169> automatically<00:03:00.069> Center

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
your screen water automatically Center

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.619 
your screen water automatically Center
for<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.879> so<00:03:01.169> that's<00:03:02.169> an<00:03:02.349> advantage<00:03:02.680> but<00:03:03.099> a

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
for you so that's an advantage but a

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.000 
for you so that's an advantage but a
couple<00:03:04.769> disadvantages<00:03:05.769> would<00:03:06.040> be<00:03:06.780> obviously

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
couple disadvantages would be obviously

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.179 
couple disadvantages would be obviously
their<00:03:09.010> controls<00:03:09.489> as<00:03:09.909> you<00:03:10.269> can<00:03:10.419> see<00:03:10.599> here<00:03:10.900> are

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
their controls as you can see here are

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.949 
their controls as you can see here are
kind<00:03:12.189> of<00:03:12.280> confusing<00:03:12.849> at<00:03:12.939> times<00:03:12.969> and<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.689> find

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
kind of confusing at times and I find

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.800 
kind of confusing at times and I find
myself<00:03:14.489> most<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.639> time<00:03:15.879> just<00:03:15.909> knifing

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
myself most of the time just knifing

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.199 
myself most of the time just knifing
when<00:03:17.069> really<00:03:18.069> I<00:03:18.189> mean<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.729> like<00:03:18.970> switch

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
when really I mean to like switch

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.780 
when really I mean to like switch
weapons<00:03:19.599> so<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:20.560> could<00:03:21.040> just<00:03:21.400> come<00:03:21.609> with

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
weapons so that could just come with

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.259 
weapons so that could just come with
time<00:03:22.030> getting<00:03:22.689> the<00:03:22.780> controls<00:03:23.169> down<00:03:23.349> but<00:03:24.269> we'll

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
time getting the controls down but we'll

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.909 
time getting the controls down but we'll
have<00:03:25.419> to<00:03:25.569> see<00:03:25.750> how<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:25.959> all<00:03:26.169> plays<00:03:26.500> out<00:03:26.680> over

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
have to see how it all plays out over

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.129 
have to see how it all plays out over
time<00:03:27.129> so<00:03:27.430> that's<00:03:28.269> an<00:03:28.419> advantage<00:03:28.689> right<00:03:28.930> there

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
time so that's an advantage right there

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.349 
time so that's an advantage right there
the<00:03:30.040> reticle<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.489> kind<00:03:30.699> of<00:03:30.819> followed<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> guys

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
the reticle is kind of followed the guys

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.179 
the reticle is kind of followed the guys
and<00:03:31.599> I<00:03:31.659> got<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> nice<00:03:32.199> double<00:03:32.650> ballistic<00:03:33.040> knife

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
and I got a nice double ballistic knife

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.949 
and I got a nice double ballistic knife
but<00:03:33.970> back<00:03:34.359> to<00:03:34.509> the<00:03:34.629> controls<00:03:35.019> um<00:03:36.299> in<00:03:37.299> when

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
but back to the controls um in when

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.539 
but back to the controls um in when
you're<00:03:38.079> using<00:03:38.229> the<00:03:38.409> classic<00:03:38.799> control<00:03:39.069> Pro<00:03:39.310> I

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
you're using the classic control Pro I

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.149 
you're using the classic control Pro I
use<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.449> first<00:03:41.199> button<00:03:41.560> layout<00:03:41.799> I<00:03:41.829> forget

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
use the first button layout I forget

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.409 
use the first button layout I forget
what<00:03:42.250> it's<00:03:42.370> called<00:03:42.430> it's<00:03:42.729> not<00:03:42.819> Sierra<00:03:43.209> it's

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
what it's called it's not Sierra it's

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.390 
what it's called it's not Sierra it's
the<00:03:43.569> one<00:03:43.659> before<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:44.079> has<00:03:44.919> a<00:03:44.949> pretty<00:03:45.159> weird

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
the one before it has a pretty weird

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.280 
the one before it has a pretty weird
name<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.849> don't<00:03:46.479> remember<00:03:46.599> what<00:03:46.989> it's<00:03:47.109> called

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
name I don't remember what it's called

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.559 
name I don't remember what it's called
but<00:03:48.120> anyway<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:51.129> button<00:03:51.430> layout<00:03:51.699> can<00:03:52.180> kind<00:03:52.509> of

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
but anyway the button layout can kind of

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.039 
but anyway the button layout can kind of
be<00:03:52.689> confusing<00:03:53.139> at<00:03:53.349> some<00:03:53.530> times<00:03:53.739> because<00:03:55.049> you

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
be confusing at some times because you

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.050 
be confusing at some times because you
know<00:03:56.229> it<00:03:56.500> assigns<00:03:56.889> the<00:03:57.129> same<00:03:57.310> button<00:03:57.609> to<00:03:57.759> jump

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
know it assigns the same button to jump

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.039 
know it assigns the same button to jump
and<00:03:58.239> run<00:03:58.449> so<00:03:59.259> you<00:03:59.349> can't<00:03:59.769> really<00:03:59.979> jump<00:04:01.049> when

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
and run so you can't really jump when
