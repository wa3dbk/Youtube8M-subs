00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.470
 hi friends of the ietu well as sam good sepi sponge that the team know that in 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.879
 this new video 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:16.439
 good signal as to be able to optimize the performance in the equipment to 100% that inc 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.119
 the conesup what I want to make the team faster is an environment 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.130
 of work that does not 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.980
 good if we have noticed that at certain times 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.589
 equipment tends to be slower 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.699
 in the operating phase 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.420
 for which you have to give you have to give him certosa 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.270
 there also all the estates to make the team faster 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.080
 because with this procedure we will achieve the same performance as the table 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.260
 good this what we are going to do is first - cain and cio 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.060
 and then to run or we just give you windows 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.290
 and here is the world that is 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.570
 project what does it mean 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.460
 windows registry editor 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.930
 hool register publisher 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 Well, we simply give it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.950
 accept and ready let's start what is the registry editor 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.979
 here what we are going to unfold this distinguished with matxÃ­n 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.890
 for a hundred then I do not take off the let's unfold what those play 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.760
 here softball let's look for don says 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.020
 ma and pieces 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.060
 nanjing other males blow unfold 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.440
 and here we look for juin dous the folder andy second 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.440
 so let's go 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.250
 from here there was only indus 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.090
 here we only give 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.010
 to deploy 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.010
 here the first option tesco rum version 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.260
 good this kit here in what we're going to do deploy the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.180
 I look for where it says explorer 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.390
 Whose explorer are we going to the selection before 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.040
 once we have selected 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.180
 p here simply what we are going to do estimated spa what is 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.730
 edition 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.409
 lego pay for it again 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:10.580
 and where it says 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.919
 value 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.919
 numeric alpha 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:19.049
 what is alpha numerical value or if I did not value chain 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.049
 any hostile act once you find a chain value 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.179
 oasis and nehuen two vice or good xp I think it's stick 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:28.829
 als numeric alpha 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.709
 or else interesting value 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.450
 well here just once we have created we will look for that 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.319
 what it is to change and create 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.019
 we would say to change the name 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.469
 ao penner 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.279
 locke let's say 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.279
 hughes 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.039
 one time 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.669
 and we go with the entity ll I saw the state oki 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.869
 when we were people that we do not give another entity 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.529
 and here we go to although ana 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.559
 to select 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.409
 to type 1 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.340
 and I give him 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.919
 to accept 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:18.510
 from here to some that are no longer in our process we just go to what is 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.219
 close 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.649
 we check the equipment 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:26.919
 but as it is a video tutorial I can not do this and well once they enter 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:27.939
 did the team 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.159
 they will be able to see what their performance 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.159
 The team is much better much faster 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.899
 we are going to have an operation 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:39.249
 effective 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.919
 the anabolic programs much more quickly 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.729
 the windows are going to look like their faster and good 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.539
