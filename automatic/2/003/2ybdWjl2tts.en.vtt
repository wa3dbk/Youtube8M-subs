00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.460 
pulls up your scope and it puts you in
prone<00:02:09.599> now<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.950> pretty<00:02:11.160> cool

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
prone now it's pretty cool

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.600 
prone now it's pretty cool
because<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.770> can<00:02:11.800> just<00:02:11.950> do<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.250> in<00:02:12.370> games

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
because you can just do that in games

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.180 
because you can just do that in games
and<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.390> can<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.960> pop<00:02:14.440> up<00:02:14.470> your<00:02:14.680> scope<00:02:14.950> fast

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
and you can you pop up your scope fast

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.560 
and you can you pop up your scope fast
enough<00:02:15.460> then<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.700> can<00:02:15.790> get<00:02:15.850> a<00:02:15.910> kill<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.390> then

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
enough then you can get a kill and then

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.540 
enough then you can get a kill and then
you<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:16.840> go<00:02:16.960> share<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.290> prone<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.800> if<00:02:18.460> you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
you just go share in a prone and if you

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.070 
you just go share in a prone and if you
don't<00:02:18.820> get<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.090> kill<00:02:19.300> then<00:02:19.510> you'd<00:02:19.600> hit<00:02:19.750> get<00:02:20.050> a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
don't get the kill then you'd hit get a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.290 
don't get the kill then you'd hit get a
hitmarker<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.800> then<00:02:21.760> you're<00:02:21.970> going<00:02:22.180> to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
hitmarker and then you're going to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.030 
hitmarker and then you're going to
straighten<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.720> prone<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:23.440> they<00:02:23.590> don't

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
straighten the prone so they don't

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.140 
straighten the prone so they don't
really<00:02:24.100> know<00:02:24.340> where<00:02:24.490> you're<00:02:24.610> at<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.970> then<00:02:25.090> you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
really know where you're at and then you

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.480 
really know where you're at and then you
just<00:02:25.360> go<00:02:25.870> out<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.140> Road<00:02:26.320> hopefully<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.280> kill

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
just go out of Road hopefully you kill

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.780 
just go out of Road hopefully you kill
um<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.680> here's<00:02:30.040> my<00:02:31.110> arisaka<00:02:32.340> maybe<00:02:33.340> that's<00:02:33.610> my

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
um so here's my arisaka maybe that's my

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.590 
um so here's my arisaka maybe that's my
car<00:02:34.000> oh<00:02:34.240> yeah<00:02:34.720> that's<00:02:34.900> my<00:02:34.990> car<00:02:35.200> car<00:02:36.010> 98<00:02:36.600> good

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
car oh yeah that's my car car 98 good

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.920 
car oh yeah that's my car car 98 good
stuff<00:02:37.870> um<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:39.130> quick<00:02:39.460> scoping<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.090> scope

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
stuff um just quick scoping the scope

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.070 
stuff um just quick scoping the scope
comes<00:02:41.170> up<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.440> lot<00:02:41.770> slower<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.610> on<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.510> car<00:02:43.750> than

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
comes up a lot slower in on the car than

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.960 
comes up a lot slower in on the car than
the<00:02:44.640> ptrs<00:02:45.780> um<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:47.860> don't<00:02:48.070> really<00:02:48.160> get<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.370> good

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
the ptrs um so I don't really get a good

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.540 
the ptrs um so I don't really get a good
360<00:02:49.780> right<00:02:49.930> here<00:02:50.200> it's<00:02:50.530> kind<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.070> hard<00:02:51.340> with

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
360 right here it's kind of hard with

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.150 
360 right here it's kind of hard with
those<00:02:52.480> kind<00:02:52.660> of<00:02:52.690> guns<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.260> best<00:02:53.620> gun<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.100> i

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
those kind of guns the best gun that i

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.070 
those kind of guns the best gun that i
can<00:02:54.310> do<00:02:54.400> get<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> 360<00:02:55.209> with<00:02:55.420> as<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.690> air<00:02:55.810> sokka

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
can do get a 360 with as the air sokka

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.830 
can do get a 360 with as the air sokka

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
time um I liked both the ptrs and the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.900 
time um I liked both the ptrs and the
air<00:03:19.209> sock<00:03:19.420> away<00:03:19.570> before<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.700> then<00:03:21.820> I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
air sock away before but and then I

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
know how it is just the usual routine so

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.850 
know how it is just the usual routine so
the<00:03:27.280> arisaka<00:03:27.700> has<00:03:28.239> one<00:03:29.019> of<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.200> best<00:03:29.350> quick

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
the arisaka has one of the best quick

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.979 
the arisaka has one of the best quick
scopes<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.459> don't<00:03:31.450> know<00:03:31.540> if<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:31.690> guys<00:03:31.780> know

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
scopes I don't know if you guys know

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.620 
scopes I don't know if you guys know
that<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:33.070> think<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:33.790> has<00:03:33.910> really<00:03:34.510> good

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
that but I think I has really good

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.250 
that but I think I has really good
quickscoping<00:03:35.590> but<00:03:36.190> accuracy<00:03:36.790> isn't<00:03:37.390> all<00:03:37.810> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
quickscoping but accuracy isn't all the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.680 
quickscoping but accuracy isn't all the
hottest<00:03:38.470> um<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:42.430> doesn't<00:03:42.760> do<00:03:43.299> much<00:03:43.420> damage

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
hottest um and it doesn't do much damage

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.170 
hottest um and it doesn't do much damage
even<00:03:44.290> with<00:03:44.440> stopping<00:03:44.709> power<00:03:44.950> on<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.430> always<00:03:45.880> get

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
even with stopping power on I always get

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.979 
even with stopping power on I always get
the<00:03:46.299> hip<00:03:46.480> marker<00:03:46.870> with<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.260> air<00:03:47.350> Sokka<00:03:47.650> but

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
the hip marker with the air Sokka but

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.039 
the hip marker with the air Sokka but
all<00:03:49.989> in<00:03:50.320> all<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.769> love<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.549> arisaka<00:03:51.970> I<00:03:52.360> don't

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
all in all I love the arisaka I don't

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.070 
all in all I love the arisaka I don't
care<00:03:53.230> what<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.530> guys<00:03:53.560> think<00:03:54.570> I'll<00:03:55.570> of<00:03:55.870> any
