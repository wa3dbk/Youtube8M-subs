done well you have to keep in mind that

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.950

WWE<00:00:34.500> has<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.040> core<00:00:35.399> audience<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.180> buys<00:00:36.570> every

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
WWE has a core audience that buys every

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.950 
WWE has a core audience that buys every
pay-per-view<00:00:37.469> event<00:00:37.829> if<00:00:38.120> WWE<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.629> cut

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
pay-per-view event if WWE was to cut

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.840 
pay-per-view event if WWE was to cut
let's<00:00:40.710> say<00:00:40.890> half<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.309> their<00:00:41.399> pay-per-view

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
let's say half of their pay-per-view

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
let's say half of their pay-per-view
events<00:00:42.350> basically<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.559> would<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
events basically what would have to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.700 
events basically what would have to
happen<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.489> WWE<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.690> remain<00:00:46.020> profitable<00:00:46.320> on

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
happen for WWE to remain profitable on

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.350 
happen for WWE to remain profitable on
pay-per-view<00:00:46.920> would<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.610> those

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
pay-per-view would be those

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.119 
pay-per-view would be those
pay-per-views<00:00:48.960> would<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.440> double<00:00:49.920> in

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
pay-per-views would have to double in

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.090 
pay-per-views would have to double in
the<00:00:50.190> amount<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.940> pay-per-view<00:00:51.090> buys<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.379> what

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the amount of pay-per-view buys so what

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
the amount of pay-per-view buys so what
would<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.430> really<00:00:53.640> happen<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.120> WWE<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
would that really happen if WWE was to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.930 
would that really happen if WWE was to
cut<00:00:55.199> half<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.590> their<00:00:55.739> pay-per-views<00:00:56.219> would

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
cut half of their pay-per-views would

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.490 
cut half of their pay-per-views would
those<00:00:57.149> other<00:00:57.480> pay-per-view<00:00:58.050> events<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
those other pay-per-view events that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
those other pay-per-view events that
that<00:00:58.680> are<00:00:58.770> remaining<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.340> those

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
that are remaining with those

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.450 
that are remaining with those
pay-per-view<00:01:00.120> buy<00:01:00.300> rates<00:01:00.570> double<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:02.039> I

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
pay-per-view buy rates double and I

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.740 
pay-per-view buy rates double and I
think<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> answer<00:01:03.059> would<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.210> no<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.449> don't

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
think the answer would be no I don't

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.679 
think the answer would be no I don't
think<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.229> WWE<00:01:05.010> would<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.939> lot<00:01:06.270> more<00:01:06.299> by

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
think that WWE would get a lot more by

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.969 
think that WWE would get a lot more by
rates<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> group<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> people

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
rates I think you have a group of people

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.950 
rates I think you have a group of people
then<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:08.820> gonna<00:01:08.909> buy<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> pay-per-views<00:01:09.780> no

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
then I'm gonna buy the pay-per-views no

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.850 
then I'm gonna buy the pay-per-views no
matter<00:01:10.140> what<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.520> end<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.860> WWE

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
matter what and that's the end of it WWE

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
matter what and that's the end of it WWE
has<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> formula<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.000> works<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.900> on

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
has a formula that works for them on

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.160 
has a formula that works for them on
pay-per-view<00:01:17.600> maybe<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.780> would<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> good

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
pay-per-view maybe it would be a good

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.800 
pay-per-view maybe it would be a good
idea<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.619> cut<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> few<00:01:20.070> paper<00:01:20.280> views<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
idea to cut a few paper views that that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.600 
idea to cut a few paper views that that
might<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> good<00:01:22.380> idea<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:22.920> far<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.189> I'm

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
might be a good idea but as far as I'm

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.120 
might be a good idea but as far as I'm
you<00:01:24.210> know<00:01:24.390> doing<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.350> TNA<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.740> doing<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you know doing what TNA is doing and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.679 
you know doing what TNA is doing and
only<00:01:26.159> having<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.939> back<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.450> four

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
only having going back to like four

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.859 
only having going back to like four
pay-per-view<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.170> year<00:01:28.530> III<00:01:29.250> think<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> WWE

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
pay-per-view a year III think that a WWE

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.050 
pay-per-view a year III think that a WWE
would<00:01:30.990> lose<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> lot<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.680> money<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.790> don't

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
would lose a lot of money and I don't

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.140 
would lose a lot of money and I don't
think<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.360> would<00:01:33.450> work<00:01:34.640> but<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:35.909> time

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
think it would work but you know time

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.780 
think it would work but you know time
will<00:01:36.299> tell<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.509> TNA<00:01:37.189> suddenly<00:01:38.189> sees<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.490> huge

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
will tell if TNA suddenly sees a huge

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.300 
will tell if TNA suddenly sees a huge
surge<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.150> their<00:01:39.600> pay-per-view<00:01:40.049> buy<00:01:40.229> rates<00:01:40.530> by

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
surge in their pay-per-view buy rates by

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.940 
surge in their pay-per-view buy rates by
doing<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> year<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.710> live

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
doing for a year you know for live

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.760 
doing for a year you know for live
pay-per-view<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.520> year<00:01:44.850> then<00:01:45.119> perhaps<00:01:45.930> WWE

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
pay-per-view a year then perhaps WWE

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.520 
pay-per-view a year then perhaps WWE
will<00:01:46.950> follow<00:01:47.159> suit<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.110> TNA<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
will follow suit but you know with TNA I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.770 
will follow suit but you know with TNA I
think<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.310> they'll<00:01:50.490> get<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.939> slight<00:01:51.329> increase

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
think that they'll get a slight increase

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.020 
think that they'll get a slight increase
and<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.130> those<00:01:53.280> those<00:01:53.670> taped

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and you know with those those taped
