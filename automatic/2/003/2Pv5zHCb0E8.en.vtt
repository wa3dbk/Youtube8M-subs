alright<00:00:01.620> so<00:00:01.890> here<00:00:02.190> i<00:00:02.220> have<00:00:02.370> my<00:00:03.140> Nintendo<00:00:05.750> color

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:06.919 
alright so here i have my Nintendo color

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.350 
alright so here i have my Nintendo color
TV<00:00:07.919> game<00:00:08.220> 15<00:00:09.110> and<00:00:10.110> i<00:00:10.830> jested<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> incinerators

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
TV game 15 and i jested the incinerators

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.510 
TV game 15 and i jested the incinerators
so<00:00:13.139> it's<00:00:14.420> it's<00:00:15.420> pretty<00:00:15.750> good<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.020> still<00:00:17.010> every

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
so it's it's pretty good but still every

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.630 
so it's it's pretty good but still every
time<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.029> ball<00:00:18.949> every<00:00:19.949> time<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.279> game<00:00:20.460> makes

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
time the ball every time the game makes

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.450 
time the ball every time the game makes
a<00:00:20.730> noise<00:00:21.320> starts<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.500> screen<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.310> there's

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
a noise starts the screen and there's

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.390 
a noise starts the screen and there's
still<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> lot<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.830> interference<00:00:28.130> so<00:00:29.130> here's

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
still a lot of interference so here's

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.590 
still a lot of interference so here's
the<00:00:29.699> circuit<00:00:30.420> board<00:00:31.940> and<00:00:34.040> here<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
the circuit board and here is the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.000 
the circuit board and here is the
attenuator<00:00:36.600> slots<00:00:37.579> for<00:00:39.350> channels<00:00:40.350> 1<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.739> 2<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
attenuator slots for channels 1 and 2 a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.740 
attenuator slots for channels 1 and 2 a
second<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:44.850> are<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.629> take

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
second there they are and you just take

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.360 
second there they are and you just take
a<00:00:48.809> screwdriver<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.860> adjust<00:00:50.160> them

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
a screwdriver in there and adjust them

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.600 
a screwdriver in there and adjust them
it's<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.239> RF<00:00:51.860> Japanese<00:00:52.860> channel<00:00:53.190> 1<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.370> 2

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
it's just RF Japanese channel 1 and 2

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.180 
it's just RF Japanese channel 1 and 2
there's<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> switch<00:00:54.239> right<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.570> front<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.870> it

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
there's a switch right in front of it

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.229 
there's a switch right in front of it
I'm<00:00:56.190> done<00:00:56.699> down<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:59.059> attenuator<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
I'm done down here is a attenuator it

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:10.490 
I'm done down here is a attenuator it
says<00:01:02.510> 4.5<00:01:03.510> megahertz<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:08.720> from<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.900> could

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
says 4.5 megahertz and from what I could

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.940 
says 4.5 megahertz and from what I could
tell<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:11.159> affects<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> audio<00:01:12.570> mostly<00:01:15.920> but<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
tell that affects the audio mostly but I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.380 
tell that affects the audio mostly but I
was<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.250> wondering<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.939> any<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.570> know

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
was just wondering if any of you know

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.690 
was just wondering if any of you know
any<00:01:21.390> ways<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:22.049> adjust<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.250> an<00:01:23.310> RF

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
any ways to adjust this from an RF

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.130 
any ways to adjust this from an RF
output<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.840> maybe<00:01:25.490> composite<00:01:26.490> video<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.240> mono

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
output to maybe composite video and mono

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.130 
output to maybe composite video and mono
or<00:01:28.670> s-video<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> mana<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:30.570> something<00:01:31.020> like

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
or s-video and mana or something like

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.480 
or s-video and mana or something like
that<00:01:33.409> let's<00:01:34.409> interesting<00:01:34.860> system<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.460> is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that let's interesting system there is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.819 
that let's interesting system there is
the<00:01:35.790> there<00:01:36.470> is<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:38.150> battery<00:01:39.150> compartment<00:01:39.829> but

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the there is the battery compartment but

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.170 
the there is the battery compartment but
you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.009> also<00:01:41.130> use<00:01:41.280> an<00:01:42.180> AC<00:01:42.329> adapter<00:01:44.180> there's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you can also use an AC adapter there's

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:54.260 
you can also use an AC adapter there's
the<00:01:45.390> paddle<00:01:45.750> controllers<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:52.880> they<00:01:53.880> actually

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the paddle controllers and they actually

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.910 
the paddle controllers and they actually
can<00:01:54.689> disconnect<00:01:55.140> from<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> system<00:01:56.600> as<00:01:57.920> you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
can disconnect from the system as you

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.630 
can disconnect from the system as you
can<00:01:59.100> see<00:01:59.430> right<00:02:02.329> just<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.450> second<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
can see right just a second this is the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:15.270 
can see right just a second this is the
power<00:02:05.909> cable

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:26.110 

trying<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.370> get<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.519> focus<00:02:16.909> for<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.209> guys<00:02:25.120> not

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
trying to get the focus for you guys not

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.589 
trying to get the focus for you guys not
really<00:02:26.389> succeeding<00:02:26.930> anyways<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:28.389> the<00:02:29.389> film

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
really succeeding anyways the the film

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:37.559 
really succeeding anyways the the film
Ford's<00:02:29.930> can<00:02:30.109> disconnect<00:02:34.510> as<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.810> can<00:02:35.930> see<00:02:36.170> and

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
Ford's can disconnect as you can see and

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.179 
Ford's can disconnect as you can see and
that<00:02:38.569> actually<00:02:38.930> takes<00:02:39.230> away<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.680> paddle<00:02:40.069> on

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
that actually takes away the paddle on

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:48.250 
that actually takes away the paddle on
screen<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.900> literally<00:02:42.439> disappears<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:47.260> that's

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
screen it literally disappears so that's

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.199 
screen it literally disappears so that's
an<00:02:48.409> interesting<00:02:48.919> little<00:02:49.819> piece<00:02:49.970> of

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
an interesting little piece of

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.240 
an interesting little piece of
information<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.260> just<00:02:54.379> plugs<00:02:54.680> back<00:02:54.980> in

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
information and it just plugs back in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.690 
information and it just plugs back in
and<00:02:56.030> now<00:02:56.150> we<00:02:56.209> have<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.540> controller<00:02:56.840> again<00:02:57.700> now

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
and now we have the controller again now

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.539 
and now we have the controller again now
we've<00:02:58.819> got<00:02:58.939> the<00:02:59.030> paddle<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.419> their<00:02:59.599> gun<00:03:03.549> and

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
we've got the paddle of their gun and

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.599 
we've got the paddle of their gun and
now<00:03:05.000> we<00:03:05.060> have<00:03:05.180> our<00:03:05.389> endless<00:03:05.900> game<00:03:06.319> again<00:03:08.139> but

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
now we have our endless game again but

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.469 
now we have our endless game again but
fairly<00:03:10.609> interesting<00:03:11.060> system<00:03:12.879> this<00:03:13.879> wire<00:03:14.150> and

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:14.479 
fairly interesting system this wire and

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:15.939 
fairly interesting system this wire and
this<00:03:14.599> board<00:03:14.840> on<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.079> bottom<00:03:15.409> here<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.739> just

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:15.949 
this board on the bottom here is just

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:19.990 
this board on the bottom here is just
the<00:03:16.540> switches<00:03:17.540> on<00:03:17.659> the<00:03:17.780> face<00:03:17.989> panel<00:03:18.819> as<00:03:19.819> you

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
the switches on the face panel as you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.030 
the switches on the face panel as you
can<00:03:20.150> see<00:03:23.079> that<00:03:24.079> just<00:03:24.260> has<00:03:24.409> different<00:03:24.620> game

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
can see that just has different game

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.629 
can see that just has different game
modes<00:03:25.069> different<00:03:25.939> game<00:03:26.090> options<00:03:27.549> you<00:03:28.549> can

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
modes different game options you can

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.369 
modes different game options you can
give<00:03:28.790> two<00:03:28.970> paddles<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:29.449> each<00:03:29.599> player<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:30.169> can

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
give two paddles to each player you can

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.830 
give two paddles to each player you can
make<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.069> paddle<00:03:31.459> half<00:03:31.639> size<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.479> it<00:03:32.599> also<00:03:32.720> has

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
make a paddle half size and it also has

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.119 
make a paddle half size and it also has
different<00:03:33.229> games<00:03:33.379> of<00:03:33.560> hockey<00:03:34.239> tennis<00:03:36.129> that's

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
different games of hockey tennis that's

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.619 
different games of hockey tennis that's
different<00:03:37.519> obstacles<00:03:37.790> like<00:03:38.239> in<00:03:38.449> this

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
different obstacles like in this

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.679 
different obstacles like in this
particular<00:03:39.290> mode<00:03:39.769> there's<00:03:40.099> a<00:03:40.400> bunch<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.419> walls

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
particular mode there's a bunch of walls

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.390 
particular mode there's a bunch of walls
in<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.139> center<00:03:42.409> of<00:03:42.439> the<00:03:42.530> screen<00:03:44.739> as<00:03:45.739> you<00:03:46.220> can

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
in the center of the screen as you can

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.740 
in the center of the screen as you can
see<00:03:48.909> so<00:03:50.530> in<00:03:51.530> any<00:03:51.949> case<00:03:52.069> I<00:03:52.669> was<00:03:53.269> just<00:03:53.419> wondering

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
see so in any case I was just wondering

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.240 
see so in any case I was just wondering
if<00:03:53.810> there's<00:03:53.930> any<00:03:53.989> way<00:03:54.199> to<00:03:54.229> modify<00:03:54.439> it<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.009> I<00:03:55.069> can

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
if there's any way to modify it so I can

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.759 
if there's any way to modify it so I can
get<00:03:55.370> rid<00:03:55.489> of<00:03:55.579> all<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:56.030> RF<00:03:56.389> noise<00:03:56.599> like<00:03:56.989> every

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
get rid of all the RF noise like every

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:04.059 
get rid of all the RF noise like every
time<00:03:57.979> you<00:03:58.569> introduce<00:03:59.569> any<00:03:59.780> kind<00:04:00.079> of<00:04:02.079> like<00:04:03.079> if

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
time you introduce any kind of like if

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.099 
time you introduce any kind of like if
into<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.459> wires<00:04:04.669> if<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.269> make<00:04:05.449> noise<00:04:07.840> if<00:04:08.840> you

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
into the wires if I make noise if you

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.509 
into the wires if I make noise if you
for<00:04:09.650> example<00:04:09.680> that's<00:04:10.129> dia<00:04:12.129> attenuators<00:04:13.129> or

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
for example that's dia attenuators or

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.860 
for example that's dia attenuators or
anything<00:04:13.849> in<00:04:13.939> here<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.209> can<00:04:14.389> hear<00:04:14.629> and<00:04:15.379> react

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
anything in here you can hear and react

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.860 
anything in here you can hear and react
so<00:04:17.870> anyways<00:04:18.859> and

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
so anyways and

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.860 
so anyways and
information<00:04:20.380> would<00:04:20.530> be<00:04:20.560> greatly<00:04:21.040> appreciated
