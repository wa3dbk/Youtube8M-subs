so<00:00:02.490> I<00:00:02.520> have<00:00:02.820> just<00:00:03.000> finished<00:00:03.120> getting<00:00:03.780> a

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
so I have just finished getting a

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.670 
so I have just finished getting a
calibrated<00:00:04.589> level<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.299> 83<00:00:06.299> DB<00:00:06.690> right<00:00:07.319> here<00:00:07.589> at

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
calibrated level of 83 DB right here at

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.220 
calibrated level of 83 DB right here at
the<00:00:07.770> listening<00:00:08.130> position<00:00:08.309> by<00:00:09.300> getting<00:00:09.870> an

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
the listening position by getting an

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.910 
the listening position by getting an
output<00:00:10.880> calibrated<00:00:11.880> noise<00:00:12.090> output<00:00:12.679> and<00:00:13.679> then

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
output calibrated noise output and then

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.330 
output calibrated noise output and then
adjusting<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.910> monitors<00:00:15.710> 483<00:00:16.710> DV<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
adjusting the monitors 483 DV at the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.550 
adjusting the monitors 483 DV at the
listening<00:00:17.670> position<00:00:17.990> what<00:00:18.990> I'm<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.380> do

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
listening position what I'm going to do

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.790 
listening position what I'm going to do
now<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.600> adjust<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:22.680> hardware<00:00:23.449> input<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.800> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
now is adjust the hardware input of the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.220 
now is adjust the hardware input of the
microphone<00:00:26.359> in<00:00:27.359> order<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.260> zero<00:00:29.070> DB<00:00:29.429> on

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
microphone in order to get a zero DB on

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.139 
microphone in order to get a zero DB on
the<00:00:31.520> monitoring<00:00:32.540> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.750> input<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:35.149> although

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the monitoring on the input and although

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.869 
the monitoring on the input and although
again<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.050> said<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.410> already<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.370> did

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
again like I said it's already I did

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.639 
again like I said it's already I did
this<00:00:39.030> beforehand<00:00:39.690> i'm<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> show<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
this beforehand i'm going to show you

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.479 
this beforehand i'm going to show you
that<00:00:41.129> what<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.850> zero<00:00:42.270> looks<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.489> again

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that what that zero looks like and again

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.119 
that what that zero looks like and again
you're<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> make<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> adjustment<00:00:45.719> at

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
you're going to make the adjustment at

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.819 
you're going to make the adjustment at
the<00:00:47.129> microphone<00:00:47.730> input<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.289> already<00:00:49.469> have

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the microphone input so we already have

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.790 
the microphone input so we already have
0<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.989> need<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> make<00:00:52.379> sure<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.710> we

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
0 here we just need to make sure that we

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:24.910 
0 here we just need to make sure that we
get<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> zero<00:00:53.460> back<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> input

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.069 

now<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.219> to<00:01:26.310> switch<00:01:26.579> between<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.420> K<00:01:27.659> 20

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
now I'm going to switch between the K 20

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.899 
now I'm going to switch between the K 20
K<00:01:28.200> 12<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.039> k14<00:01:30.950> noise<00:01:31.950> levels<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.579> show<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
K 12 and k14 noise levels and show you

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.370 
K 12 and k14 noise levels and show you
what<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.270> difference<00:01:33.630> looks<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.200> our

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
what the difference looks like on our

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.060 
what the difference looks like on our
monitor<00:01:34.920> input<00:01:35.610> monitor<00:01:36.409> we're<00:01:37.409> at<00:01:37.530> k<00:01:37.710> twenty

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
monitor input monitor we're at k twenty

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.300 
monitor input monitor we're at k twenty
right<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.729> k<00:01:39.719> 20<00:01:40.079> again<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.710> 59

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
right now and that k 20 again is at 59

00:01:41.310 --> 00:02:11.840 
right now and that k 20 again is at 59
right<00:01:43.460> turn<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:44.729> long

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.450 

so<00:02:12.850> I'm<00:02:13.330> going<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.630> leave<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.080> at<00:02:14.260> k14<00:02:15.190> and

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
so I'm going to leave it at k14 and

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.130 
so I'm going to leave it at k14 and
you're<00:02:16.150> going<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.450> see<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.140> we<00:02:17.830> are<00:02:18.040> now<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:19.140> 60

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
you're going to see that we are now a 60

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.640 
you're going to see that we are now a 60
B<00:02:20.350> too<00:02:20.680> hot<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.790> input<00:02:21.970> monitor<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.780> then

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
B too hot on the input monitor and then

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.930 
B too hot on the input monitor and then
when<00:02:24.490> we<00:02:24.700> will<00:02:25.030> use<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.320> adjust<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
when we will use that to adjust the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.630 
when we will use that to adjust the
volume<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.630> our<00:02:28.900> monitors<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:30.190> hardware

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
volume on our monitors the hardware

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
volume on our monitors the hardware
volume<00:02:31.000> down<00:02:31.570> 6<00:02:32.020> DB<00:02:32.410> again<00:02:33.210> just<00:02:34.210> as<00:02:34.360> we<00:02:34.510> did

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
volume down 6 DB again just as we did

00:02:34.660 --> 00:03:18.910 
volume down 6 DB again just as we did
before

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.699 

so<00:03:19.920> now<00:03:20.730> i<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> calibrated<00:03:21.689> level<00:03:22.080> for

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
so now i have a calibrated level for

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.850 
so now i have a calibrated level for
mixing<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.579> mastering<00:03:23.810> pop<00:03:24.810> records<00:03:25.230> using

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
mixing and mastering pop records using

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.740 
mixing and mastering pop records using
the<00:03:26.159> k14<00:03:27.000> metering<00:03:27.750> system<00:03:28.280> um<00:03:29.280> what<00:03:30.150> again

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
the k14 metering system um what again

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.539 
the k14 metering system um what again
what<00:03:30.900> I've<00:03:31.019> done<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.349> I've<00:03:31.500> used<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:32.069> higher

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
what I've done is I've used a higher

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.979 
what I've done is I've used a higher
noise<00:03:33.180> source<00:03:33.629> and<00:03:34.280> I've<00:03:35.390> mayalu<00:03:36.390> used<00:03:36.750> this

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
noise source and I've mayalu used this

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.270 
noise source and I've mayalu used this
as<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.819> leveling<00:03:38.819> monitor<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.950> I've<00:03:40.950> adjusted

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
as a leveling monitor and I've adjusted

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.250 
as a leveling monitor and I've adjusted
my<00:03:41.879> monitors<00:03:42.629> down<00:03:43.049> 6<00:03:43.920> DB<00:03:44.840> you'll<00:03:45.840> notice<00:03:46.230> that

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
my monitors down 6 DB you'll notice that

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.309 
my monitors down 6 DB you'll notice that
I<00:03:46.440> did<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.709> adjustment<00:03:47.370> at<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:49.049> mixer

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
I did that adjustment at the mixer

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.149 
I did that adjustment at the mixer
instead<00:03:50.099> of<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.400> monitors<00:03:50.790> themselves<00:03:52.159> this

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
instead of the monitors themselves this

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.610 
instead of the monitors themselves this
is<00:03:53.400> because<00:03:54.060> you're<00:03:54.690> going<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.900> sometimes

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
is because you're going to sometimes

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.349 
is because you're going to sometimes
want<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:55.980> be<00:03:56.069> able<00:03:56.129> to<00:03:56.280> switch<00:03:56.519> between<00:03:56.730> these

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
want to be able to switch between these

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.670 
want to be able to switch between these
things<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.959> only<00:03:58.139> thing<00:03:58.319> that's

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
things and the only thing that's

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.099 
things and the only thing that's
essential<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.730> know<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.510> only<00:04:00.720> reason<00:04:00.840> that

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
essential to know the only reason that

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.259 
essential to know the only reason that
you're<00:04:01.200> doing<00:04:01.470> any<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.829> this<00:04:02.099> is<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:02.879> that<00:04:02.909> you

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
you're doing any of this is so that you

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.740 
you're doing any of this is so that you
know<00:04:03.569> what<00:04:04.290> your<00:04:04.950> what<00:04:05.519> your<00:04:05.599> calibrated<00:04:06.599> love

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
know what your what your calibrated love

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.580 
know what your what your calibrated love
listening<00:04:07.260> level<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:08.430> whereas<00:04:09.209> before

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
listening level is so whereas before
