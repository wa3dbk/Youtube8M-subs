00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.740
 I'm going to teach you how to finish off a traffic tree. 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.810
 career 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.810
 will turn my attention to a version 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.789
 You'll get line 1 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.449
 he will pass through the race of the last saga the good 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.849
 I already told mine to facilitate. 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.519
 you will learn by pulling it is a sign of sintra that it does not get 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.839
 showing with a very big sign and a September pension if I did not win 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.289
 o mst 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.979
 mine and is going forward I will never go back with her back to 

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:38.180
 finalization 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.210
 I'll always walk with her. 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.290
 introduces the glory of the right pro and sometimes are 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.970
 today the line going forward 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.970
 always ahead of where the sound is coming from 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.190
 coming back again at Petros 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.920
 pull there 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.230
 stay on top of a larger larger block point 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.540
 this is for any type of finishing with a crochet needle 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.030
 you can rest assured that even though it's in Dubai it will not let go 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.690
 I arrived in space 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.060
 where I can 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 again make a simple snack 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.780
 place 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.290
 phase being so would not bet on the line from one point to another 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.980
 It was even good. 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.400
 Let's now hide my 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.690
 passing through the points always walking to the front of work 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.960
 not digging because if you go back 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 the line will be folding effectively done 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.320
 Are you going to walk the line? 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.380
 to a point you may be cutting 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.890
 watch how it is 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.520
 the finishing 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.660
 detail 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.520
 I passed the line for the match the coach 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.839
 from the point 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:13.029
 Why are we going to be with the world this other square? 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.540
 so there's no need to get the line to the box part 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.879
 done that 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.729
 just cut well 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.959
 is ready finalized 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.529
 no apparent north 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.839
 You do not know where your work was finalized. 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.089
 and this is the partridge right
