so<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.580> helpers<00:01:32.910> drill<00:01:33.210> works<00:01:33.930> coach<00:01:34.440> rocky

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
so the helpers drill works coach rocky

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
so the helpers drill works coach rocky
is<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> start<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.340> lean<00:01:35.640> forward<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
is going to start to lean forward and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.980 
is going to start to lean forward and
snap<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.410> his<00:01:37.979> last<00:01:38.280> two<00:01:38.610> steps<00:01:38.940> as<00:01:39.210> quickly<00:01:39.780> as

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
snap in his last two steps as quickly as

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.540 
snap in his last two steps as quickly as
possible<00:01:40.020> there<00:01:40.619> are<00:01:40.710> two<00:01:40.890> ways<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> let<00:01:41.430> you

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
possible there are two ways to let you

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.740 
possible there are two ways to let you
know<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.970> doing<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.240> drill<00:01:42.450> right

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
know that you're doing this drill right

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.010 
know that you're doing this drill right
number<00:01:43.410> one<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:44.039> third<00:01:45.030> best<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.869> can

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
number one is third best and you can

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.469 
number one is third best and you can
hear<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.259> almost<00:01:46.590> sounds<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.160> noise

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
hear it almost sounds like one noise

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.230 
hear it almost sounds like one noise
really<00:01:48.479> really<00:01:48.810> quick<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.259> number<00:01:49.649> two<00:01:49.890> as<00:01:50.250> he

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
really really quick and number two as he

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.400 
really really quick and number two as he
can<00:01:51.450> control<00:01:52.280> okay<00:01:53.280> note<00:01:53.520> stuff<00:01:53.759> he<00:01:53.880> doesn't

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
can control okay note stuff he doesn't

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.200 
can control okay note stuff he doesn't
fall<00:01:55.410> forward<00:01:55.950> okay<00:01:56.340> when<00:01:56.550> you<00:01:56.670> fall<00:01:56.880> forward

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
fall forward okay when you fall forward

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.210 
fall forward okay when you fall forward
that<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.660> sign<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:57.930> your<00:01:58.200> core<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.740> your

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
that is a sign that your core and your

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.160 
that is a sign that your core and your
upper<00:01:59.580> body<00:01:59.789> is<00:02:00.119> not<00:02:00.330> staying<00:02:00.630> back<00:02:00.960> in

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
upper body is not staying back in

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.160 
upper body is not staying back in
staying<00:02:01.440> tall<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.310> instead<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:03.570> are<00:02:03.869> losing

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
staying tall but instead you are losing

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.529 
staying tall but instead you are losing
control<00:02:04.470> that<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.280> whenever<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.330> fall

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
control that and whenever you fall

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.749 
control that and whenever you fall
forward<00:02:06.899> that's<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.680> sure<00:02:07.979> sign<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.429> you're

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
forward that's a sure sign that you're

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
forward that's a sure sign that you're
going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.060> jump<00:02:09.509> forward<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.140> not<00:02:10.350> jump<00:02:10.649> up

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
going to jump forward and not jump up

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.460 
going to jump forward and not jump up
now<00:02:11.250> if<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.640> control<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.330> which<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.230> just

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
now if you can control that which I just

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.020 
now if you can control that which I just
pit<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.800> do<00:02:13.890> which<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.459> when<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:14.880> control

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
pit and do which is when you can control

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.270 
pit and do which is when you can control
that<00:02:15.510> then<00:02:16.350> you're<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.830> jump<00:02:17.010> further

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
that then you're going to jump further

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.490 
that then you're going to jump further
okay<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.269> then<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.840> when<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.110> results

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
okay and then that is when the results

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.740 
okay and then that is when the results
come<00:02:19.680> when<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.250> can<00:02:20.430> come<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> max<00:02:21.510> speed

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
come when you can come in on a max speed

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.030 
come when you can come in on a max speed
approach<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.850> actually<00:02:23.930> control<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.380> jump

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
approach and actually control and jump

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.800 
approach and actually control and jump
straight<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.400> as<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:26.850> there's<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.209> wall<00:02:27.420> an<00:02:27.630> inch

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
straight up as if there's a wall an inch

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.240 
straight up as if there's a wall an inch
from<00:02:27.959> your<00:02:28.140> nose<00:02:28.320> that's<00:02:28.739> what<00:02:28.920> we're<00:02:29.070> going

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
from your nose that's what we're going

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.759 
from your nose that's what we're going
so<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> simple<00:02:31.140> drill<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.590> can

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
so this is a simple drill that you can

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.280 
so this is a simple drill that you can
just<00:02:32.010> add<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.519> your<00:02:32.640> warmup<00:02:33.269> two<00:02:33.660> three<00:02:34.110> even

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
just add to your warmup two three even

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.090 
just add to your warmup two three even
four<00:02:34.470> times<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.100> week<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.579> hear<00:02:36.120> through<00:02:36.480> each

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
four times a week just hear through each

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.890 
four times a week just hear through each
three<00:02:38.100> or<00:02:38.220> four<00:02:38.400> times<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.940> peace<00:02:39.209> okay<00:02:39.720> it's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
three or four times of peace okay it's

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.569 
three or four times of peace okay it's
not<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.230> want<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.470> do<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.769> often<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.310> I

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
not you want to do this often be I

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.340 
not you want to do this often be I
should<00:02:42.570> say<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.750> don't<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.079> do<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.290> a
