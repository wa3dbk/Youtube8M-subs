plastic<00:02:49.280> covering<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.120> got<00:02:50.750> off<00:02:50.840> my<00:02:50.870> computer

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
plastic covering I got off my computer

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.789 
plastic covering I got off my computer
that<00:02:51.680> protects<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.989> computer<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.379> put<00:02:54.709> it

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
that protects the computer and I put it

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:55.640 
that protects the computer and I put it
on<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.129> screen

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
on a screen

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.229 
on a screen
protective<00:02:57.170> anyway<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.769> that's<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.849> signal

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
protective anyway so that's the signal

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.819 
protective anyway so that's the signal
I'm<00:03:00.299> getting<00:03:00.569> on<00:03:00.689> that<00:03:03.140> which<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.319> imagined

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
I'm getting on that which I imagined

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.720 
I'm getting on that which I imagined
it's<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.099> gun<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.900> casing<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.739> bullet<00:03:08.519> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
it's a gun the casing to a bullet and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.380 
it's a gun the casing to a bullet and
what<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.629> do<00:03:09.750> after<00:03:10.110> that<00:03:10.819> is<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:12.060> put<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
what I do after that is I put the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.990 
what I do after that is I put the
threshold<00:03:12.900> up<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.230> about<00:03:13.470> its<00:03:14.310> just<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:14.879> you

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
threshold up to about its just so you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.890 
threshold up to about its just so you
can<00:03:15.120> hear<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:16.370> 13<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.579> then<00:03:17.700> put<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.659> game

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
can hear it 13 and then put the game

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:29.809 
can hear it 13 and then put the game
back<00:03:18.930> at<00:03:19.409> 12<00:03:19.680> o'clock<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:28.129> summer<00:03:29.129> is<00:03:29.250> working

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
back at 12 o'clock so summer is working

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.180 
back at 12 o'clock so summer is working
now<00:03:30.030> that's<00:03:30.810> what<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.139> want<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.409> see<00:03:31.650> actually<00:03:32.159> I

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
now that's what I want to see actually I

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.960 
now that's what I want to see actually I
did<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> test<00:03:32.700> if<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.269> see<00:03:33.450> my<00:03:33.599> tutorial<00:03:34.109> review

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
did a test if you see my tutorial review

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.149 
did a test if you see my tutorial review
I'm<00:03:35.970> sure<00:03:36.239> it's<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.780> it's<00:03:37.319> buckshot<00:03:37.799> which<00:03:38.040> is

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
I'm sure it's a it's buckshot which is

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.160 
I'm sure it's a it's buckshot which is
good<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:38.519> that's<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.819> same<00:03:38.970> as<00:03:39.120> gold<00:03:39.359> is

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
good because that's the same as gold is

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.619 
good because that's the same as gold is
released<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:40.709> what<00:03:40.829> I've<00:03:40.889> been<00:03:40.920> told<00:03:41.629> to

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
released that's what I've been told to

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.530 
released that's what I've been told to
maybe<00:03:43.530> just<00:03:43.769> go<00:03:43.889> ahead<00:03:44.129> and<00:03:44.220> check<00:03:44.340> yep<00:03:44.579> but

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
maybe just go ahead and check yep but

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.509 
maybe just go ahead and check yep but
when<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.840> did<00:03:46.049> some<00:03:46.200> testing<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.799> some<00:03:47.159> real

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
when I did some testing and some real

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.539 
when I did some testing and some real
gold<00:03:47.700> my<00:03:48.389> girlfriend<00:03:48.810> really<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.829> signals<00:03:50.430> I

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
gold my girlfriend really that signals I

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:58.809 
gold my girlfriend really that signals I
was<00:03:50.670> getting<00:03:50.939> a<00:03:50.970> speedometer<00:03:51.299> always<00:03:51.840> read

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.030 

nice<00:03:59.819> little<00:04:00.209> number<00:04:00.389> at<00:04:01.109> least<00:04:01.169> that's<00:04:01.709> what

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
nice little number at least that's what

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.680 
nice little number at least that's what
I'm<00:04:02.220> thinking<00:04:02.639> I<00:04:02.669> have<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.790> phone<00:04:03.030> bill<00:04:03.209> yet<00:04:03.419> so

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
I'm thinking I have a phone bill yet so

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.770 
I'm thinking I have a phone bill yet so
let's<00:04:04.470> see<00:04:04.620> what<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.799> found<00:04:04.980> I'll<00:04:05.250> let<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.459> know

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
let's see what I found I'll let you know

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.309 
let's see what I found I'll let you know
that<00:04:07.340> was<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> buckshot<00:04:08.790> which<00:04:09.449> is<00:04:09.989> cool

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
that was a buckshot which is cool

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.860 
that was a buckshot which is cool
actually<00:04:10.709> I'm<00:04:11.159> not<00:04:11.639> excited<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.389> is<00:04:12.540> but

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
actually I'm not excited that it is but

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.270 
actually I'm not excited that it is but
it's<00:04:13.590> going<00:04:13.769> to<00:04:13.889> bring<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.159> same<00:04:14.310> as<00:04:14.489> gold<00:04:14.790> so

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
it's going to bring the same as gold so

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.789 
it's going to bring the same as gold so
I<00:04:17.280> think<00:04:17.789> I<00:04:17.880> got<00:04:18.030> an<00:04:18.090> idea<00:04:18.180> how<00:04:18.599> to

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
I think I got an idea how to

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.159 
I think I got an idea how to
discriminate<00:04:19.799> out<00:04:20.449> on<00:04:21.449> this<00:04:21.599> machine<00:04:21.810> by

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
discriminate out on this machine by

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.250 
discriminate out on this machine by
doing<00:04:22.500> this<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:24.000> that's<00:04:24.659> the<00:04:24.810> numbers<00:04:25.110> I'm

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
doing this so that's the numbers I'm

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.899 
doing this so that's the numbers I'm
looking<00:04:25.530> for<00:04:25.770> at<00:04:26.220> least<00:04:26.400> that's<00:04:26.610> all<00:04:26.760> I<00:04:26.789> can

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
looking for at least that's all I can

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.500 
looking for at least that's all I can
say<00:04:27.060> for<00:04:27.300> at<00:04:27.900> this<00:04:28.289> point<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:29.330> I'd<00:04:30.330> like<00:04:30.449> to

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
say for at this point and I'd like to

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.600 
say for at this point and I'd like to
find<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.870> gold<00:04:31.050> nugget<00:04:31.199> that<00:04:31.500> big<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:32.520> would

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
find a gold nugget that big that would

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.719 
find a gold nugget that big that would
be<00:04:32.729> cool<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.720> I'm<00:04:34.050> getting<00:04:34.289> some<00:04:34.729> interesting

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
be cool so I'm getting some interesting

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.610 
be cool so I'm getting some interesting
signals<00:04:36.389> this<00:04:36.539> thing<00:04:36.720> definitely<00:04:36.990> picks<00:04:37.440> up

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
signals this thing definitely picks up

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.980 
signals this thing definitely picks up
smaller<00:04:37.949> stuff<00:04:38.250> another<00:04:38.550> coil<00:04:38.820> did<00:04:39.060> so<00:04:39.840> you

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
smaller stuff another coil did so you

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.770 
smaller stuff another coil did so you
can't<00:04:40.320> hear<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.740> but<00:04:41.120> that's<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.300> numbers<00:04:42.659> I'm

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
can't hear it but that's the numbers I'm

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.180 
can't hear it but that's the numbers I'm
getting<00:04:44.599> um

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
getting um

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.020 
getting um
and<00:04:47.060> then<00:04:47.450> I<00:04:47.540> turn<00:04:47.780> on<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.350> I<00:04:48.700> caught<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.850> gold

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
and then I turn on the I caught the gold

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.400 
and then I turn on the I caught the gold
bone<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:51.280> get<00:04:52.280> along<00:04:52.640> all<00:04:52.940> it's<00:04:53.750> a<00:04:53.900> low<00:04:54.080> tone

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
bone and get along all it's a low tone

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:02.470 
bone and get along all it's a low tone
low<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.820> I<00:04:58.540> got<00:04:59.540> this<00:04:59.960> other<00:05:00.200> water<00:05:01.270> this<00:05:02.270> is

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
low so I got this other water this is

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.760 
low so I got this other water this is
stuff

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
stuff

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.200 
stuff
I<00:05:04.860> don't<00:05:05.160> know<00:05:05.370> what<00:05:05.520> it<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:05.759> I<00:05:06.000> don't<00:05:06.090> think

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
I don't know what it is I don't think

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.510 
I don't know what it is I don't think
it's<00:05:06.389> close<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:06.930> then<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.770> just<00:05:08.099> got<00:05:08.280> this

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
it's close and then I just got this

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.260 
it's close and then I just got this
which<00:05:08.879> is<00:05:09.680> it's<00:05:10.680> heavier<00:05:11.099> but<00:05:11.490> imagine<00:05:12.150> it's

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
which is it's heavier but imagine it's

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.270 
which is it's heavier but imagine it's
an<00:05:12.840> old<00:05:13.050> boat<00:05:13.259> or<00:05:13.500> something<00:05:13.889> so<00:05:14.069> more

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
an old boat or something so more

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
time has tripled I can literally get

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.370 
time has tripled I can literally get
these<00:05:44.430> out<00:05:44.639> in<00:05:44.940> a<00:05:45.000> matter<00:05:45.360> of<00:05:45.449> like<00:05:45.630> 10<00:05:45.870> seconds

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
these out in a matter of like 10 seconds

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.180 
these out in a matter of like 10 seconds
so<00:05:46.860> I'm<00:05:47.539> soon<00:05:48.539> as<00:05:48.630> I<00:05:48.690> hit<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:48.960> target<00:05:49.199> and

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
so I'm soon as I hit the target and

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.749 
so I'm soon as I hit the target and
pointed<00:05:50.610> on<00:05:50.729> this<00:05:51.259> so<00:05:52.259> like<00:05:52.500> one<00:05:52.740> shovel<00:05:53.159> and

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
pointed on this so like one shovel and

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.260 
pointed on this so like one shovel and
it's<00:05:53.970> out<00:05:54.150> so<00:05:54.990> where<00:05:55.830> my<00:05:56.039> Garrett<00:05:56.430> and<00:05:57.180> the

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
it's out so where my Garrett and the

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.719 
it's out so where my Garrett and the
bigger<00:05:57.479> coils<00:05:57.960> are<00:05:58.830> a<00:05:58.889> little<00:05:59.159> bit<00:05:59.280> more<00:05:59.460> work

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
bigger coils are a little bit more work

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.020 
bigger coils are a little bit more work
of<00:06:00.300> course<00:06:00.630> because<00:06:00.960> they're<00:06:01.370> so<00:06:02.370> large<00:06:02.610> in

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
of course because they're so large in

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.850 
of course because they're so large in
the<00:06:03.240> heart<00:06:03.479> of<00:06:03.599> pinpoint<00:06:04.110> but<00:06:04.379> this<00:06:04.620> thing

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860
