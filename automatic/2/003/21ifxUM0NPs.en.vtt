I'm leaning against a corgi Corky I
would<00:00:45.450> say<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.050> about<00:00:46.379> equal<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.039> strength

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

quirky in this game is very passive and
I<00:01:01.800> would<00:01:01.920> say<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.309> his<00:01:02.520> main<00:01:02.879> flaw<00:01:03.270> he's

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.800 
I would say that's his main flaw he's
passive<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> fault<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:06.240> he<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.600> let

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
passive to a fault because he just let

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.340 
passive to a fault because he just let
me<00:01:06.930> give<00:01:07.110> him<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> free<00:01:07.590> hit<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:09.450> night<00:01:09.630> lets<00:01:09.840> me

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350

recommend<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.720> starting<00:01:34.380> item<00:01:35.090> just<00:01:36.090> don't

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
recommend that starting item just don't

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.569 
recommend that starting item just don't
do<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.990> need<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:37.770> kind<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.100> defense

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
do it you need some kind of defense

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.679 
do it you need some kind of defense
ideally<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:39.780> if<00:01:40.650> not<00:01:40.829> defense<00:01:41.310> at<00:01:41.490> least<00:01:41.759> boots

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
ideally or if not defense at least boots

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.780 
ideally or if not defense at least boots
which<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.680> defensive<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.369> different<00:01:44.670> way

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
which are defensive in a different way

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.990 
which are defensive in a different way
and<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.119> they<00:01:45.270> give<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.659> movement<00:01:46.110> speed

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
and that they give you movement speed

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.490 
and that they give you movement speed
and<00:01:48.000> also<00:01:48.299> starting<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.810> longsword<00:01:49.229> means

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
and also starting with longsword means

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.620 
and also starting with longsword means
you<00:01:49.590> only<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:49.979> potion<00:01:50.399> which<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.420> not

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you only get one potion which is not

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.980 
you only get one potion which is not
ideal<00:01:51.899> either<00:01:52.590> i<00:01:53.180> started<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:54.390> cloth<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
ideal either i started with cloth and

ideal either i started with cloth and
five<00:01:55.140> pots<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.740> i<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> huge<00:01:56.430> advantage

little jump on me so his Valkyrie strike
I<00:02:13.709> knew<00:02:14.640> he<00:02:14.790> couldn't<00:02:14.970> get<00:02:15.090> away<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.530> just

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
I knew he couldn't get away so I just

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.729 
I knew he couldn't get away so I just
used<00:02:17.610> my<00:02:17.819> ignite<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.510> I'll<00:02:19.080> attacked<00:02:19.470> him<00:02:19.650> and

resets when you get a kill in case you
didn't<00:02:26.340> know<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:28.349> was<00:02:28.830> able<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.190> jump

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
didn't know that so I was able to jump

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.430 
didn't know that so I was able to jump
straight<00:02:29.700> back<00:02:29.760> out<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.300> be<00:02:30.780> completely<00:02:31.140> safe

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
straight back out and be completely safe

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.839 
straight back out and be completely safe
after<00:02:32.099> doing<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.220> whole<00:02:35.459> reason<00:02:35.610> he

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
after doing that so the whole reason he

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.790 
after doing that so the whole reason he
died<00:02:36.060> there<00:02:36.349> partly<00:02:37.349> is<00:02:37.410> because<00:02:37.440> he<00:02:37.680> doesn't

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
died there partly is because he doesn't

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.550 
died there partly is because he doesn't
have<00:02:37.890> any<00:02:38.099> defensive<00:02:38.550> item<00:02:38.819> but<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.530> other

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
have any defensive item but the other

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.140 
have any defensive item but the other
reason<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.190> he<00:02:41.370> gave<00:02:41.519> me<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:41.790> much<00:02:41.880> free

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
reason is just he gave me so much free

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.360 
reason is just he gave me so much free

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
him and kill him with my night so he

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.890

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
played far too passive and I would

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.809 
played far too passive and I would
suggest<00:03:07.080> if<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.950> want<00:03:08.099> to<00:03:08.190> play<00:03:08.310> defensive

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
suggest if you want to play defensive

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.539 
suggest if you want to play defensive
that's<00:03:09.000> fine<00:03:09.360> but<00:03:10.049> i<00:03:10.319> would<00:03:10.950> suggest<00:03:11.069> thinking

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
that's fine but i would suggest thinking

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.339 
that's fine but i would suggest thinking
of<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.760> as<00:03:11.910> playing<00:03:12.269> defensively<00:03:12.900> not

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
of it as playing defensively not

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.000 
of it as playing defensively not
passively<00:03:14.330> what<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.450> want<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.720> do<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.170> you

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
passively what you want to do is you

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.699 
passively what you want to do is you
want<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.700> focus<00:03:17.910> on<00:03:18.120> last<00:03:18.359> hitting<00:03:18.600> yes<00:03:19.019> but

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
want to focus on last hitting yes but

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.680 
want to focus on last hitting yes but
when<00:03:19.980> they<00:03:20.130> come<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.609> harass<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.299> hit<00:03:21.660> a

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
when they come in to harass you hit a

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.170 
when they come in to harass you hit a
mac<00:03:21.959> punish<00:03:22.920> them<00:03:23.070> for<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.609> your<00:03:23.910> creeps

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
mac punish them for it and your creeps

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.770 
mac punish them for it and your creeps
will<00:03:24.299> hit<00:03:24.420> them<00:03:24.570> too<00:03:24.630> probably<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:27.239> that's<00:03:27.540> a

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
will hit them too probably so that's a

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.300 
will hit them too probably so that's a
little<00:03:27.989> bit<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.260> extra<00:03:28.470> damage<00:03:28.829> that's

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
little bit of extra damage that's

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.830 
little bit of extra damage that's
actually<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:29.940> your<00:03:30.120> favor<00:03:30.359> when<00:03:30.720> you're

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
actually in your favor when you're

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.840 
actually in your favor when you're
playing<00:03:31.049> defensively<00:03:31.590> if<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.519> just<00:03:32.549> play

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
playing defensively if you just play

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.670 
playing defensively if you just play
passive<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:34.019> sit<00:03:34.200> back<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.560> let

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
passive and you just sit back and let

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.470 
passive and you just sit back and let
them<00:03:34.799> get<00:03:34.920> free<00:03:35.220> damage<00:03:35.609> on<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.970> then

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
them get free damage on you then

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.940 
them get free damage on you then
eventually<00:03:36.660> they'll<00:03:37.200> just<00:03:37.380> be<00:03:37.530> able<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.769> kill

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
eventually they'll just be able to kill

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.199 
eventually they'll just be able to kill
you<00:03:38.190> or<00:03:38.340> zone<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.060> out<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.390> lane<00:03:39.569> so

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
you or zone you out of the lane so

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.020 
you or zone you out of the lane so
always<00:03:42.380> trade<00:03:43.380> hits<00:03:43.620> don't<00:03:44.069> just<00:03:44.489> take<00:03:44.730> free

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
always trade hits don't just take free

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.039 
always trade hits don't just take free
hits<00:03:46.609> so<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:48.060> can<00:03:48.180> see<00:03:48.269> this<00:03:48.359> quirky<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.810> kind

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
hits so you can see this quirky is kind

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.780 
hits so you can see this quirky is kind
of<00:03:49.200> being<00:03:49.500> zoned<00:03:49.799> back<00:03:50.100> just<00:03:50.519> trying<00:03:50.609> to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
of being zoned back just trying to

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.059 
of being zoned back just trying to
naturally<00:03:51.239> pushes<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.720> lane<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.650> isn't

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
naturally pushes the lane so that isn't

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.599 
naturally pushes the lane so that isn't
costing<00:03:53.489> him<00:03:54.139> as<00:03:55.139> much<00:03:55.500> as<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.799> would<00:03:55.980> if<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.370> was

probably what you want to try to do is

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.450 
probably what you want to try to do is
you<00:05:13.840> want<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.169> make<00:05:14.320> her<00:05:14.710> think<00:05:14.889> she<00:05:15.100> can<00:05:15.280> kill

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
you want to make her think she can kill

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.110 
you want to make her think she can kill
you<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.820> I<00:05:16.510> get<00:05:16.720> her<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:16.990> jump<00:05:17.199> on<00:05:17.380> you<00:05:17.620> and

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
you and I get her to jump on you and

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.670 
you and I get her to jump on you and
then<00:05:19.120> your<00:05:19.360> jungler<00:05:19.660> comes<00:05:19.750> in<00:05:20.139> and<00:05:20.289> kills<00:05:20.500> her

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
then your jungler comes in and kills her

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.710 
then your jungler comes in and kills her
that<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.580> risky<00:05:21.970> because<00:05:22.060> she<00:05:22.330> has<00:05:22.449> a<00:05:22.479> lot<00:05:22.660> of

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
that is risky because she has a lot of

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.570 
that is risky because she has a lot of
burst<00:05:23.020> damage<00:05:23.229> so<00:05:23.770> sometimes<00:05:24.220> she'll<00:05:24.430> just

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
burst damage so sometimes she'll just

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.760 
burst damage so sometimes she'll just
kill<00:05:24.820> you<00:05:24.970> anyway<00:05:25.289> as<00:05:26.289> you<00:05:26.440> can<00:05:26.560> see<00:05:26.740> right

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
kill you anyway as you can see right

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.839 
kill you anyway as you can see right
there<00:05:28.710> thana<00:05:29.710> can<00:05:29.979> even<00:05:30.250> jump<00:05:30.490> and<00:05:30.669> kill

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
there thana can even jump and kill

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.580 
there thana can even jump and kill
people<00:05:31.030> out<00:05:31.300> towers<00:05:31.810> from<00:05:32.050> pretty<00:05:32.410> high

people out towers from pretty high

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.560 
people out towers from pretty high
health<00:05:32.860> like<00:05:33.130> I<00:05:33.250> just<00:05:33.310> did<00:05:33.550> because<00:05:34.180> her<00:05:34.360> burst

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
health like I just did because her burst

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.570 
health like I just did because her burst
damage<00:05:34.780> is<00:05:35.110> so<00:05:35.320> high<00:05:35.500> and<00:05:35.860> because<00:05:36.160> she<00:05:36.400> can

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
damage is so high and because she can

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.790 
damage is so high and because she can
just<00:05:36.760> jump<00:05:36.970> right<00:05:37.090> back<00:05:37.210> out<00:05:37.599> after<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:38.620> kill

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
just jump right back out after the kill

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.770 
just jump right back out after the kill
a<00:05:40.830> really<00:05:41.830> good<00:05:41.979> time<00:05:42.220> to<00:05:42.880> go<00:05:43.180> back<00:05:43.389> to<00:05:43.690> the

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
a really good time to go back to the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.659 
a really good time to go back to the
lane<00:05:43.990> is<00:05:44.260> when<00:05:44.770> your<00:05:44.949> creeps<00:05:45.190> are<00:05:45.340> already

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.180 
lane is when your creeps are already
pushed<00:05:46.000> up<00:05:46.210> to<00:05:46.479> the<00:05:46.630> turret<00:05:47.020> that's<00:05:47.800> because

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
pushed up to the turret that's because

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.450 
pushed up to the turret that's because
their<00:05:48.760> turret<00:05:49.389> will<00:05:49.960> kill<00:05:50.320> your<00:05:50.560> creeps<00:05:50.949> that

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
their turret will kill your creeps that

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.430 
their turret will kill your creeps that
means<00:05:51.760> your<00:05:51.940> creeps<00:05:52.210> cannot<00:05:52.810> kill<00:05:53.110> their

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
means your creeps cannot kill their

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.430 
means your creeps cannot kill their
creeps<00:05:53.800> is<00:05:53.979> fast<00:05:54.750> so<00:05:55.750> by<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:55.960> time<00:05:56.169> you<00:05:56.349> get

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
creeps is fast so by the time you get

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.210 
creeps is fast so by the time you get
back<00:05:56.500> to<00:05:56.830> lane<00:05:57.099> fewer<00:05:57.729> creeps<00:05:58.060> will<00:05:58.240> be<00:05:58.389> dead

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
back to lane fewer creeps will be dead

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.560 
back to lane fewer creeps will be dead
so<00:06:00.220> you<00:06:00.310> see<00:06:00.460> I'm<00:06:00.550> already<00:06:00.669> running<00:06:00.909> back<00:06:01.240> and

not even going to miss close to a whole

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.770 
not even going to miss close to a whole
way<00:06:05.169> I'm<00:06:05.409> just<00:06:05.530> going<00:06:05.710> to<00:06:05.770> miss<00:06:05.949> a<00:06:05.979> few<00:06:06.190> creeps

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
way I'm just going to miss a few creeps

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.180 
way I'm just going to miss a few creeps
and<00:06:07.780> i'm<00:06:07.900> already<00:06:08.080> back<00:06:08.289> to<00:06:08.500> lane<00:06:08.650> and<00:06:08.680> i<00:06:08.979> can

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
and i'm already back to lane and i can

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.710 
and i'm already back to lane and i can
start<00:06:09.490> getting<00:06:09.550> these<00:06:09.880> last<00:06:10.120> hits<00:06:10.330> again

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.750 

so<00:06:15.720> at<00:06:15.990> this<00:06:16.020> point<00:06:16.290> you<00:06:16.440> see<00:06:16.710> that<00:06:17.070> what<00:06:17.640> this

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
so at this point you see that what this

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.540 
so at this point you see that what this
quirky<00:06:18.180> is<00:06:18.240> passive<00:06:18.990> play<00:06:19.200> and<00:06:19.560> poor<00:06:20.220> item

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
quirky is passive play and poor item

me at this point I have 49 creep kills
and<00:06:28.440> he<00:06:29.340> has<00:06:29.490> only<00:06:29.640> 14<00:06:30.270> so<00:06:31.200> that's<00:06:31.890> pretty

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
and he has only 14 so that's pretty

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.130 
and he has only 14 so that's pretty
awful<00:06:32.880> I<00:06:33.810> have<00:06:34.490> about<00:06:35.490> four<00:06:36.090> times<00:06:36.270> his<00:06:36.750> creeps

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
awful I have about four times his creeps

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.490 
awful I have about four times his creeps
floor<00:06:38.720> right<00:06:39.720> there<00:06:39.750> that<00:06:40.080> wasn't<00:06:40.350> really

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
floor right there that wasn't really

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.140 
floor right there that wasn't really
necessary<00:06:40.650> but<00:06:41.280> I<00:06:41.400> knew<00:06:41.520> I<00:06:41.550> didn't<00:06:41.850> have<00:06:41.910> my

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
necessary but I knew I didn't have my

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.640 
necessary but I knew I didn't have my
night<00:06:42.420> back<00:06:42.600> up<00:06:42.780> yet<00:06:42.930> and<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.140> didn't<00:06:43.410> think<00:06:43.500> I

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
night back up yet and I didn't think I

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.810 
night back up yet and I didn't think I
was<00:06:43.740> going<00:06:43.890> to<00:06:43.980> be<00:06:44.070> able<00:06:44.160> to<00:06:44.310> kill<00:06:44.550> him<00:06:44.670> without

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
was going to be able to kill him without

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.670 
was going to be able to kill him without
ignite<00:06:45.350> because<00:06:46.350> he's<00:06:46.500> playing<00:06:46.800> so<00:06:47.490> cowardly

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
ignite because he's playing so cowardly

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.470 
ignite because he's playing so cowardly
so<00:06:49.680> i<00:06:49.710> decided<00:06:50.100> i<00:06:50.310> would<00:06:50.370> just<00:06:50.700> jump<00:06:51.000> and

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
so i decided i would just jump and

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.300 
so i decided i would just jump and
harass<00:06:51.780> him<00:06:52.020> with<00:06:52.230> my<00:06:52.440> ultimate<00:06:52.920> which<00:06:53.130> has<00:06:53.280> a

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
harass him with my ultimate which has a

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.490 
harass him with my ultimate which has a
relatively<00:06:53.850> short<00:06:54.000> cooldown<00:06:54.450> the<00:06:55.320> only

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
relatively short cooldown the only

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.010 
relatively short cooldown the only
problem<00:06:55.680> with<00:06:55.860> doing<00:06:56.010> that<00:06:56.280> is<00:06:56.720> that<00:06:57.720> your

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
problem with doing that is that your

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.060 
problem with doing that is that your
ultimate<00:06:58.410> is<00:06:58.590> one<00:06:58.830> of<00:06:58.950> your<00:06:59.070> escapes<00:06:59.460> so

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
ultimate is one of your escapes so

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.370 
ultimate is one of your escapes so
basically<00:07:02.420> when<00:07:03.420> somebody<00:07:03.720> tries<00:07:03.870> to<00:07:04.140> gank

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
basically when somebody tries to gank

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.680 
basically when somebody tries to gank
you<00:07:04.650> you<00:07:05.100> can<00:07:05.340> jump<00:07:05.610> yes<00:07:05.970> but<00:07:06.300> you<00:07:06.420> can<00:07:06.450> also

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
you you can jump yes but you can also

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.450 
you you can jump yes but you can also
use<00:07:06.840> your<00:07:07.110> ultimate<00:07:07.380> to<00:07:07.620> blow<00:07:07.890> the<00:07:08.070> ganker

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
use your ultimate to blow the ganker

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.950 
use your ultimate to blow the ganker
away<00:07:10.790> so<00:07:11.790> that<00:07:11.850> puts<00:07:12.390> my<00:07:12.510> ultimate<00:07:12.840> on

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
away so that puts my ultimate on

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.320 
away so that puts my ultimate on
cooldown<00:07:13.200> but<00:07:13.860> I<00:07:14.070> have<00:07:14.220> flash<00:07:14.490> up<00:07:14.760> I<00:07:14.940> still

best<00:07:45.270> i'll<00:07:45.780> try<00:07:46.170> to<00:07:46.520> work<00:07:47.520> on<00:07:47.700> it<00:07:47.880> since<00:07:48.150> i'm

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 
best i'll try to work on it since i'm

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.970 
best i'll try to work on it since i'm
doing<00:07:48.570> this<00:07:48.690> kind<00:07:48.960> of<00:07:49.050> on<00:07:49.200> the<00:07:49.230> fly<00:07:49.500> without

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:49.980 
doing this kind of on the fly without

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.910 
doing this kind of on the fly without
scripting<00:07:50.520> it<00:07:50.810> hopefully<00:07:51.810> the<00:07:52.080> next<00:07:52.230> one<00:07:52.530> will

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:52.920 
scripting it hopefully the next one will

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.010 
scripting it hopefully the next one will
be<00:07:52.950> a<00:07:53.460> little<00:07:53.760> bit<00:07:54.060> more<00:07:54.240> informative<00:07:54.660> and

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 
be a little bit more informative and

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.900 
be a little bit more informative and
hopefully<00:07:55.680> this<00:07:55.860> one<00:07:56.100> had<00:07:56.280> at<00:07:56.400> least<00:07:56.520> a<00:07:56.700> few

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:56.910 
hopefully this one had at least a few

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.140 
hopefully this one had at least a few
good<00:07:57.690> tidbits
