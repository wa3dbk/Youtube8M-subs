and<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:17.300> way<00:02:17.420> we<00:02:17.570> do<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:17.989> is<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:20.150> going<00:02:20.269> to

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
and the way we do this is just going to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.030 
and the way we do this is just going to
do<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.510> control<00:02:20.900> up<00:02:21.050> arrow<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.470> can<00:02:21.709> see<00:02:22.010> a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
do a control up arrow so I can see a

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.990 
do a control up arrow so I can see a
little<00:02:22.280> bit<00:02:22.370> better<00:02:22.550> here<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:24.850> while<00:02:25.850> you

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
little bit better here and while you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.720 
little bit better here and while you
have<00:02:26.030> your<00:02:26.420> default<00:02:26.720> cube<00:02:27.110> selected<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.550> just

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
have your default cube selected you just

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.650 
have your default cube selected you just
test<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.660> scale<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.610> I'm<00:02:32.060> going<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.239> go<00:02:32.540> ahead

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
test the scale and I'm going to go ahead

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.720 
test the scale and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:32.840> hit<00:02:32.900> Z<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.709> get<00:02:33.830> wireframe<00:02:34.340> view<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:34.640> we

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
and hit Z to get wireframe view so we

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.160 
and hit Z to get wireframe view so we
can<00:02:34.760> see<00:02:35.209> what<00:02:35.720> we're<00:02:35.870> doing

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
can see what we're doing

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.160 
can see what we're doing
so<00:02:37.040> probably<00:02:37.519> right<00:02:37.850> there<00:02:38.060> as<00:02:38.209> far<00:02:38.510> as<00:02:38.690> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
so probably right there as far as the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.430 
so probably right there as far as the
the<00:02:40.510> x-axis<00:02:41.890> on<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.950> sides<00:02:43.760> there<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:45.140> I'm

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
the x-axis on the sides there and I'm

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.600 
the x-axis on the sides there and I'm
going<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.650> choose<00:02:46.030> sy<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.090> scale<00:02:47.540> along<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> Y

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
going to choose sy to scale along the Y

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.860 
going to choose sy to scale along the Y
bring<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.790> up<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.480> very<00:02:51.079> edge<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.870> it's

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
bring that up to the very edge and it's

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.930 
bring that up to the very edge and it's
actually<00:02:54.260> pretty<00:02:54.350> close<00:02:54.820> which<00:02:55.820> is

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
actually pretty close which is

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.160 
actually pretty close which is
interesting<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.970> all<00:02:59.090> we<00:02:59.239> need<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.450> do<00:02:59.660> is<00:02:59.959> move

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
interesting so all we need to do is move

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.670 
interesting so all we need to do is move
this<00:03:00.350> image<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.739> little<00:03:00.860> bit<00:03:01.100> along<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.730> Y<00:03:02.680> so

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
this image a little bit along the Y so

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.310 
this image a little bit along the Y so
that's<00:03:04.190> point<00:03:04.670> one<00:03:05.060> I'm<00:03:05.450> going<00:03:05.600> to<00:03:05.660> do<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.750> point

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
that's point one I'm going to do a point

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.920 
that's point one I'm going to do a point
two<00:03:06.920> five<00:03:08.230> maybe<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.440> was<00:03:09.560> negative<00:03:10.190> 0.05

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
two five maybe that was negative 0.05

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.319 
two five maybe that was negative 0.05
yep<00:03:11.930> okay<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:13.670> that's<00:03:13.910> pretty<00:03:14.000> good<00:03:14.269> right

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
yep okay so that's pretty good right

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:14.770 
yep okay so that's pretty good right
there

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
there

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.470 
there
that's<00:03:15.079> not<00:03:15.320> bad<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.820> main<00:03:17.000> thing<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.299> want

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
that's not bad the main thing you want

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.630 
that's not bad the main thing you want
to<00:03:17.540> be<00:03:17.630> concerned<00:03:18.049> with<00:03:18.290> right<00:03:18.470> now<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.980> don't

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
to be concerned with right now is don't

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.270 
to be concerned with right now is don't
move<00:03:19.940> your<00:03:20.239> geometry<00:03:20.570> or<00:03:21.110> your<00:03:21.500> cube<00:03:21.860> at<00:03:22.100> all

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
move your geometry or your cube at all

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.120 
move your geometry or your cube at all
just<00:03:23.209> scale<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.540> because<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.799> don't<00:03:24.950> want<00:03:25.070> to

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
just scale it because you don't want to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.310 
just scale it because you don't want to
get<00:03:25.220> your<00:03:25.370> geometry<00:03:25.640> out<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.570> center

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
get your geometry out of the center

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.580 
get your geometry out of the center
point<00:03:27.500> there<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.970> control<00:03:29.540> up<00:03:29.690> arrow<00:03:29.840> back

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
point there so control up arrow back

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.599 
point there so control up arrow back
here<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:31.160> I'm<00:03:31.220> going<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.489> go<00:03:31.609> to<00:03:33.459> actually<00:03:34.459> let

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
here and I'm going to go to actually let

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.240 
here and I'm going to go to actually let
me<00:03:34.700> choose<00:03:35.000> in<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.390> get<00:03:35.510> rid<00:03:35.630> of<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.250> I'm

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
me choose in to get rid of that and I'm

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.530 
me choose in to get rid of that and I'm
going<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.430> go<00:03:37.609> to<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:38.060> side<00:03:38.269> view<00:03:38.299> here

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
going to go to the side view here

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.490 
going to go to the side view here
control<00:03:39.170> up<00:03:39.320> arrow<00:03:39.760> Z<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:41.239> as<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.350> can<00:03:42.440> see

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
control up arrow Z and as you can see

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.330 
control up arrow Z and as you can see
our<00:03:43.750> length<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:44.989> car<00:03:45.200> is<00:03:45.290> quite<00:03:45.440> a<00:03:45.829> bit

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
our length of the car is quite a bit

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.770 
our length of the car is quite a bit
bigger<00:03:46.519> than<00:03:46.609> our<00:03:46.820> side<00:03:47.090> view<00:03:47.359> for<00:03:47.630> whatever

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
bigger than our side view for whatever

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.420 
bigger than our side view for whatever
reason<00:03:48.320> so<00:03:49.239> go<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.780> background<00:03:50.959> images

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
reason so go to the background images

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:02.339 
reason so go to the background images
and<00:03:54.150> I'm<00:03:55.019> just<00:03:55.110> gonna<00:03:55.349> scale<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.069> up

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.330 

so<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.159> fits<00:04:03.629> that<00:04:04.629> area<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.140> now<00:04:05.980> we<00:04:06.040> need<00:04:06.310> to

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
so it fits that area and now we need to

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:15.720 
so it fits that area and now we need to
scale<00:04:06.969> the<00:04:07.469> Z<00:04:08.469> so<00:04:09.219> choose<00:04:10.030> this<00:04:10.480> Z<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:15.430> what

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
scale the Z so choose this Z and what

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.189 
scale the Z so choose this Z and what
we're<00:04:15.849> looking<00:04:16.090> at<00:04:16.239> really<00:04:16.539> is<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.840> bottom<00:04:16.989> of

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
we're looking at really is the bottom of

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.800 
we're looking at really is the bottom of
car<00:04:17.380> on<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.680> top<00:04:17.889> of<00:04:18.009> the<00:04:18.100> hood<00:04:18.310> here<00:04:18.699> so<00:04:19.630> we

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
car on the top of the hood here so we

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.050 
car on the top of the hood here so we
need<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.049> move<00:04:20.169> this<00:04:20.380> down<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:21.459> image<00:04:21.789> down<00:04:22.000> a

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
need to move this down this image down a

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.110 
need to move this down this image down a
little<00:04:22.240> bit<00:04:22.650> again<00:04:23.650> not<00:04:23.919> moving<00:04:24.310> our<00:04:24.580> actual

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
little bit again not moving our actual

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.409 
little bit again not moving our actual
cube<00:04:28.320> so<00:04:29.320> as<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:29.710> have<00:04:30.039> sort<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.610> like<00:04:30.729> a<00:04:30.759> you

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
cube so as I have sort of like a you

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.210 
cube so as I have sort of like a you
know<00:04:31.449> curve<00:04:31.870> here<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.830> was<00:04:32.949> kind<00:04:33.190> of

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
know curve here it was kind of

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.469 
know curve here it was kind of
estimating<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.680> is<00:04:36.150> pretty<00:04:37.150> much<00:04:37.300> in

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
estimating that this is pretty much in

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.499 
estimating that this is pretty much in
the<00:04:37.509> center<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:38.139> we<00:04:38.259> have<00:04:38.440> front<00:04:39.370> back<00:04:39.550> top<00:04:40.300> and

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
the center so we have front back top and

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.219 
the center so we have front back top and
bottom<00:04:40.810> as<00:04:41.500> far<00:04:41.710> as<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.860> cube<00:04:42.900> control<00:04:43.900> up<00:04:44.080> arrow

go<00:04:45.070> back<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.849> our<00:04:46.180> front<00:04:46.539> view<00:04:46.660> control<00:04:47.470> up

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
go back to our front view control up

go back to our front view control up
arrow<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:49.530> z<00:04:50.910> wireframe<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.990> we<00:04:53.229> just<00:04:53.440> need

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
arrow and z wireframe and we just need

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.450 
arrow and z wireframe and we just need
to<00:04:54.039> move<00:04:54.160> this<00:04:56.430> image<00:04:57.430> over<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:57.940> little<00:04:58.060> bit

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
to move this image over a little bit

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:07.080 
to move this image over a little bit
scale<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:00.639> down<00:05:00.669> a<00:05:00.820> little<00:05:01.000> bit

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.610 

and<00:05:07.570> bring<00:05:08.200> it<00:05:08.350> down<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.919> little<00:05:09.070> bit<00:05:09.250> here

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
and bring it down a little bit here

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.520 
and bring it down a little bit here
maybe<00:05:11.940> negative<00:05:12.940> 0.45<00:05:14.130> something<00:05:15.130> like<00:05:15.220> that

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
maybe negative 0.45 something like that

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.330 
maybe negative 0.45 something like that
okay<00:05:17.530> so<00:05:17.560> not<00:05:18.100> perfect<00:05:18.580> by<00:05:18.700> any<00:05:18.730> means<00:05:19.030> but

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
okay so not perfect by any means but

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.010 
okay so not perfect by any means but
hopefully<00:05:21.340> will<00:05:21.639> generally<00:05:22.419> be<00:05:22.450> working<00:05:22.900> in

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
hopefully will generally be working in

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.440 
hopefully will generally be working in
the<00:05:23.110> same<00:05:23.169> 3d<00:05:23.860> space<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.400> mean<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:24.940> whole<00:05:25.090> idea

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
the same 3d space I mean the whole idea

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.690 
the same 3d space I mean the whole idea
is<00:05:25.510> to<00:05:25.630> make<00:05:25.750> sure<00:05:26.080> that<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.620> geometry<00:05:27.580> that

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
is to make sure that the geometry that

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.890 
is to make sure that the geometry that
you're<00:05:27.910> working<00:05:28.150> on<00:05:28.210> as<00:05:28.389> you<00:05:28.510> look<00:05:28.720> at<00:05:28.870> your

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
you're working on as you look at your

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.820 
you're working on as you look at your
background<00:05:29.260> views<00:05:30.389> is<00:05:31.389> in<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:33.070> same<00:05:33.510> same

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
background views is in the same same

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.220 
background views is in the same same
relative<00:05:36.030> 3d<00:05:37.030> space<00:05:37.300> I<00:05:37.480> guess<00:05:37.510> you'd<00:05:37.900> call<00:05:37.930> it

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
relative 3d space I guess you'd call it

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.740 
relative 3d space I guess you'd call it
so<00:05:38.770> you<00:05:38.830> as<00:05:39.400> you<00:05:39.970> work<00:05:40.090> on<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.330> side<00:05:40.540> view

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
so you as you work on the side view

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.960 
so you as you work on the side view
you're<00:05:41.020> working<00:05:41.260> on<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.470> same<00:05:41.710> area<00:05:42.220> as<00:05:42.430> you

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
you're working on the same area as you

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.090 
you're working on the same area as you
would<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.300> top<00:05:43.479> and<00:05:43.840> praten<00:05:44.530> all<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:44.889> I

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
would the top and praten all that I

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.860 
would the top and praten all that I
think<00:05:45.280> I<00:05:45.460> think<00:05:45.639> you<00:05:45.729> understand<00:05:46.090> that<00:05:46.150> anyway

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
think I think you understand that anyway

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.129 
think I think you understand that anyway
so<00:05:46.930> then<00:05:47.830> get<00:05:48.790> rid<00:05:48.880> of<00:05:48.970> these<00:05:49.090> menus<00:05:49.540> do

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
so then get rid of these menus do

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.810 
so then get rid of these menus do
control<00:05:50.620> as<00:05:50.919> quicksave<00:05:51.810> and<00:05:53.550> basically<00:05:54.550> we

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
control as quicksave and basically we

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.580 
control as quicksave and basically we
have<00:05:55.060> our<00:05:56.340> background<00:05:57.340> views<00:05:57.880> set<00:05:58.360> up<00:05:58.510> so<00:05:59.470> in

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
have our background views set up so in

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.200 
have our background views set up so in
the<00:05:59.680> next<00:05:59.830> part<00:05:59.950> of<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:00.220> tutorial<00:06:00.550> part<00:06:00.880> 4

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
the next part of the tutorial part 4

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.060 
the next part of the tutorial part 4
what<00:06:01.419> we're<00:06:01.510> going<00:06:01.630> to<00:06:01.660> be<00:06:01.780> doing<00:06:01.960> is<00:06:02.440> starting

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
what we're going to be doing is starting

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.390 
what we're going to be doing is starting
to<00:06:03.250> do<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.790> rough<00:06:04.419> in<00:06:04.630> on<00:06:05.080> the<00:06:05.590> actual<00:06:05.889> modeling

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
to do a rough in on the actual modeling

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.010 
to do a rough in on the actual modeling
of<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:07.000> car<00:06:07.210> so<00:06:08.200> I'll<00:06:08.440> see<00:06:08.710> you<00:06:08.740> then
