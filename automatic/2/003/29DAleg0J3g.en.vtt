that's<00:00:00.930> this<00:00:01.079> wall<00:00:19.580> so<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.730> wheel<00:00:20.939> is

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
that's this wall so this wheel is

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.810 
that's this wall so this wheel is
spending<00:00:21.449> anything<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.230> straight<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.730> you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
spending anything but straight so you

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
spending anything but straight so you
walk<00:00:24.090> around<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> put<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> wheel<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
walk around so put the wheel in the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.639 
walk around so put the wheel in the
truing<00:00:32.219> stand<00:00:32.510> get<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> tight<00:00:33.899> well<00:00:34.290> centered

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649

the dial is adjustable for the size
wheel<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.590> these<00:00:41.370> work<00:00:41.640> from<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.239> 16<00:00:42.629> inch

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
wheel you have these work from a 16 inch

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.560 
wheel you have these work from a 16 inch
wheel<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> 7<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.040> received<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:45.300> they<00:00:45.420> also

wheel to a 7 and received and they also

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.529 
wheel to a 7 and received and they also
adjust<00:00:46.020> speed<00:00:46.230> wise<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:47.309> wider<00:00:47.730> rings<00:00:48.090> or

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
adjust speed wise for wider rings or

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.139 
adjust speed wise for wider rings or
tuning<00:00:49.399> deviations

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
tuning deviations

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.869 
tuning deviations
I<00:00:51.180> usually<00:00:51.600> started<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.980> biggest<00:00:53.340> problem

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
I usually started the biggest problem

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.599 
I usually started the biggest problem
and<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:54.780> work<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.410> way<00:00:58.399> really<00:00:59.399> bad<00:00:59.989> here

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
and then work my way really bad here

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.399 
and then work my way really bad here
it's<00:01:02.609> too<00:01:03.239> far<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> right<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:04.320> going

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
it's too far to the right so I'm going

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.289 
it's too far to the right so I'm going
to<00:01:04.500> tighten<00:01:04.920> spokes<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> left<00:01:05.880> side<00:01:06.150> of

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
to tighten spokes on the left side of

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.190 
to tighten spokes on the left side of
the<00:01:06.420> wheel<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.630> pull<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> back<00:01:07.470> over<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the wheel to pull it back over so if you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.260 
the wheel to pull it back over so if you
only<00:01:10.439> want<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.890> about<00:01:11.189> Nathan<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.700> turn<00:01:11.970> or

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
only want to do about Nathan a turn or

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.780 
only want to do about Nathan a turn or
quarter<00:01:12.630> turn<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> time<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.640> don't

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
quarter turn at a time so you don't

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.649 
quarter turn at a time so you don't
overdo<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.999 

and<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.890> rubbing<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> left<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> I

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and now it's rubbing on the left so I

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
and now it's rubbing on the left so I
could<00:01:23.250> either<00:01:23.900> tighten<00:01:24.900> spokes<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> right

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
could either tighten spokes on the right

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.609 
could either tighten spokes on the right
to<00:01:25.920> pull<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.420> or<00:01:27.420> loosen<00:01:27.900> these<00:01:28.020> spokes<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to pull it or loosen these spokes on the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.210 
to pull it or loosen these spokes on the
left<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.400> sort<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> push<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.470> it<00:01:31.470> all<00:01:31.590> depends

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
left to sort of push it it all depends

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.420 
left to sort of push it it all depends
on<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.700> tension<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:33.180> already<00:01:33.509> there

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
on the tension that's already there

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.950 
on the tension that's already there
these<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:36.030> tight<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:36.630> don't<00:01:36.659> want

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
these are really tight and I don't want

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.270 
these are really tight and I don't want
to<00:01:36.990> add<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.470> attention<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.950> it

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
to add more attention to it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.680 
to add more attention to it
because<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.670> afraid<00:01:38.789> of<00:01:38.970> popping<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.420> boat

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
because I'm afraid of popping this boat

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.899 
because I'm afraid of popping this boat
so<00:01:39.930> I'm<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.200> loosen<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.799> left<00:01:41.009> side<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so I'm going to loosen the left side to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.730 
so I'm going to loosen the left side to
release<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> little<00:01:42.420> tension<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.289> it<00:01:43.320> wants<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
release a little tension so it wants to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:54.320 
release a little tension so it wants to
go

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.960 

and<00:01:54.750> now<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.230> haven't<00:01:55.800> done<00:01:55.920> anything<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
and now I haven't done anything to the

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.750 
and now I haven't done anything to the
the<00:01:57.450> tips<00:01:57.740> but<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.890> don't<00:01:59.070> hear<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.370> rubbing

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
the tips but you don't hear it rubbing

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.180 
the tips but you don't hear it rubbing
and<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.540> still<00:02:00.870> out<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.560> true<00:02:01.710> little<00:02:01.920> bit<00:02:02.040> so

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
and it's still out of true little bit so

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.670 
and it's still out of true little bit so
we're<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.490> dial<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.170> go<00:02:04.620> to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
we're going to dial this in and go to

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.330 
we're going to dial this in and go to
the<00:02:04.800> next<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.120> and<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.390> forth<00:02:06.980> and<00:02:07.980> so<00:02:08.160> it's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the next so on and so forth and so it's

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.990 
the next so on and so forth and so it's
straight<00:02:10.100> it's<00:02:11.100> rubbing<00:02:11.460> a<00:02:11.520> lot<00:02:11.700> while<00:02:11.880> you

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
straight it's rubbing a lot while you

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.350 
straight it's rubbing a lot while you
spend<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.390> does<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.050> ever<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.440> cosmetic<00:02:14.190> it

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
spend in does it ever like cosmetic it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.350 
spend in does it ever like cosmetic it
can<00:02:15.590> it's<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:16.770> would<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.730> ever<00:02:17.820> set<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.240> out

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
can it's like would you ever set it out

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.950 
can it's like would you ever set it out
temporarily<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.560> really<00:02:19.770> bad<00:02:20.420> just<00:02:21.420> do<00:02:21.840> it

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
temporarily it's a really bad just do it

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.320 
temporarily it's a really bad just do it
by<00:02:22.110> eyeball<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:25.610> sometimes<00:02:26.610> there's<00:02:26.880> sticker

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
by eyeball so sometimes there's sticker

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.970 
by eyeball so sometimes there's sticker
on<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.600> sidewall<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.260> rim<00:02:28.440> for<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:28.950> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
on the sidewall of the rim for like a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.680 
on the sidewall of the rim for like a
disc<00:02:29.250> brake<00:02:29.490> wheel<00:02:29.700> things<00:02:30.060> like<00:02:30.240> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
disc brake wheel things like that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.540 
disc brake wheel things like that
we've<00:02:31.020> got<00:02:31.170> plastic<00:02:31.620> covers<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.100> go<00:02:32.280> over

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
we've got plastic covers that go over

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.720 
we've got plastic covers that go over
these<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.780> doesn't<00:02:34.110> damage<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:35.220> generally

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
these so it doesn't damage but generally

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.820 
these so it doesn't damage but generally
it's<00:02:36.060> going<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> braking<00:02:37.110> surface<00:02:37.260> anyway

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
it's going on the braking surface anyway

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.100 
it's going on the braking surface anyway
so<00:02:38.580> you're<00:02:39.210> not<00:02:39.330> really<00:02:39.540> going<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:39.930> much

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
so you're not really going to do much

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.350 
so you're not really going to do much
damage<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.150> really

to<00:02:50.350> get<00:02:50.530> vertical<00:02:51.040> hops<00:02:51.520> out<00:02:51.990> we<00:02:52.990> have<00:02:53.230> to

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
to get vertical hops out we have to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.790 
to get vertical hops out we have to
adjust<00:02:55.140> adjust<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.440> truing<00:02:56.770> stand

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
adjust adjust the truing stand

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.560 
adjust adjust the truing stand
accordingly<00:02:57.550> so<00:02:57.880> right<00:02:58.060> now<00:02:58.240> we're<00:02:58.450> looking

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
accordingly so right now we're looking

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.290 
accordingly so right now we're looking
at<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.930> side<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> rim<00:02:59.850> we<00:03:00.850> want<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.090> tune

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
at the side of the rim we want to tune

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.160 
at the side of the rim we want to tune
it<00:03:01.450> out<00:03:02.670> they<00:03:03.670> listen<00:03:04.210> so<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.720> see<00:03:04.960> what's

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
it out they listen so I can see what's

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.790 
it out they listen so I can see what's
going<00:03:05.290> on<00:03:05.710> height<00:03:06.070> wise<00:03:07.080> there's<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.140> big<00:03:10.800> right

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
going on height wise there's a big right

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.190 
going on height wise there's a big right
there

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.140 

just<00:03:15.650> there's<00:03:16.310> good<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:17.840> type<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.379> band<00:03:19.150> no

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
just there's good this type of band no

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.790 
just there's good this type of band no

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
amount of loosening these folks I could

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.790 
amount of loosening these folks I could
pull<00:03:21.950> these<00:03:22.069> folks<00:03:22.370> out<00:03:22.580> entirely<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.800> that's

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
pull these folks out entirely and that's

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.440 
pull these folks out entirely and that's
not<00:03:25.040> going<00:03:25.250> really<00:03:25.489> do<00:03:25.819> it<00:03:25.940> it's<00:03:26.300> bet<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:32.209> going

lefty-loosey pitcher that's the

importance of doctor too much because it

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.600 
importance of doctor too much because it
does<00:04:11.239> look<00:04:11.269> backwards<00:04:12.190> so<00:04:13.190> if<00:04:13.459> you're

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
does look backwards so if you're

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.039 
does look backwards so if you're
loosening<00:04:14.000> when<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.329> sure<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.540> tightening

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
loosening when you sure to tightening

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.039 
loosening when you sure to tightening
and<00:04:15.230> you're<00:04:15.349> just<00:04:15.500> gonna<00:04:15.680> throw<00:04:15.799> it<00:04:16.010> off<00:04:16.190> more

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
and you're just gonna throw it off more

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.479 
and you're just gonna throw it off more
but<00:04:18.049> if<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:18.320> only<00:04:18.470> do<00:04:18.650> an<00:04:18.739> eighth<00:04:18.889> returning<00:04:19.459> a

every few adjustments laterally you want

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.900

deviation out I'm also throwing off the
side<00:04:45.700> to<00:04:45.850> side<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:49.060> where<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.450> was<00:04:49.660> straight

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
side to side so where it was straight

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.040 
side to side so where it was straight
but<00:04:50.980> not<00:04:51.010> round<00:04:51.460> now<00:04:52.390> that<00:04:52.570> I've<00:04:52.660> worked<00:04:52.840> the

roundness out it's not straight so you

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:11.310
