00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.520
 play fair today i have my little one 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.560
 trading tip for you 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.030
 that will not be back in fifty 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.870
 minutes video but is more of a 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.740
 small tip but that could be very 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.010
 be promising 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 we are looking for a gold player on the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.029
 home to the position we can 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.279
 I like to do that in general 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.619
 midfielder then become, so to speak 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.869
 all positions covered even if the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 guy was made as zs is so 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.809
 central striker ms or as zm or 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.550
 even as a striker so be there 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.110
 really all listed and that's why 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.460
 I like to play midfielder here 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.620
 Here we are looking for a Dutchman 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.500
 Maybe something is already happening 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.809
 with you when we search here 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 Dutchman comes from the series a 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.550
 and plays at inter milan 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.250
 now that's going to happen here we go 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.649
 times 12,500 1 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.030
 So let's do the search for us 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.369
 looking exactly wesley sneijder and why 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.570
 we are looking for wesley sneijder now easy 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.939
 so in the middle of it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.150
 We are looking for him for this reason 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.270
 wesley sneijder becomes 99 percent too 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.670
 galatasaray istanbul switch 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.890
 and what does that mean for us now? 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.520
 fifa 13 ultimate team players 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.439
 that means he will not be more than 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.159
 be inter milan player in the pigs 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.290
 and thus he will not be more than 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.680
 series a player in the pigs is yes 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.299
 logical and that means we can do that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.759
 like to watch talk on feed 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.909
 in the series there is a as eg 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:47.579
 actually only boateng for me 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.990
 honor zmz dm almost is home win 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.180
 that was it already 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.549
 sums up as a competition so i always talk 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.060
 of real competition and that is 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.500
 at most hamzic and hamsik is like 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.390
 of course, now go from the normal 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.000
 version from slower 178 ps had a lot 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.069
 worse pass and the dribblings of 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.979
 sneijder is also better and sneijder 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.130
 unfortunately so that people know as 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.900
 unfortunately boa 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.200
 this really is also such an aspect of the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.060
 in fut therefore engages you see this gentleman 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.150
 really does not compete much 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.590
 therefore quite often bought so the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.200
 slider is really in the series a 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.000
 bought quite often and what happens 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.820
 now if you see it here 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.680
 start price 11 47 no one has bought so 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.420
 because of the price war because already on 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.970
 but in every case we come to praise 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.530
 right now and now you can 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.420
 probably think if it's the slider 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.210
 no longer in the pacs are there for inter 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.850
 milan then there is only the the 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.350
 that is what it is like on the market 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.210
 similar to when the team of the week 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.980
 comes that the prices of the players 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.050
 rise because people are no longer in 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.960
 pÃ©cs are so it is synonymous with transfers 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.700
 only it is that way, so the sneijder 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.880
 will not be in the text anymore than 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.130
 series a games and is thus there is 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.070
 just stop his series of gold cards 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.970
 on the market and there are none to and 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.730
 what does that mean? 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.350
 The price will rise and I believe he 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.460
 becomes neat at sneijder too 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.220
 because it really does increase 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.900
 interesting player is and currently 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.730
 we can try here now 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.730
 to filter what really is the least 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.740
 prices let's do 11 57 we find 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.900
 not yet i can tell you i have 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.270
 yesterday for eleven it was yesterday 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.450
 evening until night some already for 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.950
 11,000 immediate purchase also found 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.430
 I think a few for under 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.610
 10.000 auctioned I'll show you now 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.160
 something to ok so apparently that is 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.430
 price even at 12 5 so just has with 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.870
 12 5 or were there some at 12 5 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.630
 currently the price so my trading tip 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.580
 is the star of the wirt go up but 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.990
 it will go up 100 percent 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.910
 Of course, this has to go along with everything 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.060
 must take place from the change 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.680
 pacs come out and then wesley 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.900
 sneijder go up he will be on everyone 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.430
 so over 15,000 shoot everything 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.040
 others would make me pretty pretty 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.840
 wonder if I already tell him 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.550
 will shoot over 15,000 there you can 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.800
 probably already this one 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.959
 I just want to rhyme something together 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.850
 let's say for how much you buy that 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.540
 So that's just euro you can 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.310
 also around 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.530
 to keep the profit margin completely small 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.570
 You can also buy some for 13 5 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.550
 of course now would be nonsense because 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.060
 Of course you should always the cheapest 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.020
 to buy 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.760
 and I would really recommend you 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.260
 Do it yourself especially if it works 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.600
 Of course, not everyone is with you 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.550
 it's possible to do this a bit at night 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.250
 maybe even now 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.110
 this afternoon because the tip is yes 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.810
 he will not last that long 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.130
 because I think that's going to happen soon 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.690
 that a bit, unfortunately, that's no 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.210
 So I think he will soon 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.980
 rise and that's why it should be relative 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.790
 promptly happen that you are the snyders 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:05.110
 So I'll probably buy that 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:08.350
 snyders up to 12,000 yes but up to 12,000 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.210
 therefore I will offer the r and her 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.930
 can you imagine going down 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.430
 definitely not because it is easy 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.950
 not with the pacs is why he is 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.990
 Do not go down and I'll get you 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.030
 probably up to 12,000 of the offer and 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.430
 Although many , as I said yesterday 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.650
 already some under 10,000 of the offered 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.880
 I would already almost 2000 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.760
 participate in the prize winners 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.680
 but if they rise above 15,000 then 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.570
 I'm almost breast 5000 unfortunately 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.000
 win and that's more then 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.710
 Interesting 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.220
 So I would recommend 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:45.850
 sneijders to ban 12,000 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.240
 best of course for as little as it 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.810
 going 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.460
 and calmly enter midfielder as 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.600
 Of course, you will 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.710
 probably will not find any 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.080
 which certainly can not find because the 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.180
 Information too expensive is also as 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.890
 Central striker will cut and off 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.560
 used at times that means you can 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.220
 also central striker for up to 12,000 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.230
 buy from the gentleman schneider 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.300
 I think this tip will definitely work 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.430
 rise if now that you really 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.080
 out is so it is so well today 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.820
 I think today so sign in 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.680
 I just got up on turkey 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.950
 transfermarkt.de again an article 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.860
 read and once the signature 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.590
 so to speak, and all the big ones 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.680
 sports homepage etc 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.360
 that will announce some 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.950
 probably already attentive and 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.840
 are already some buy 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.640
 the price is going to go up slowly 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.970
 and if it really is that far 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.440
 is that you say popp now we want 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.120
 Wesley is no longer an inter player 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.840
 in the pigs because he is now in the 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.210
 Turkey plays as from the date it is 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.050
 go right up you will 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.060
 really see 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.220
 that's like with the form players 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.080
 So or the golden players the one 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.760
 have been in shape for a week and therefore no 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.490
 Gold card can be pulled 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.130
 the players always go up 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.690
 because there is no replenishment 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.720
 is just this normal offer 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.150
 Demand the offer will be natural 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.400
 thereby smaller and the demand is 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.320
 still the same 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.900
 but then of course the request higher 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.650
 is because no replenishment is the 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.600
 So players are getting my tip 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:26.200
 invests in wesley sneijder 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.090
 he 'll go up . It's like that 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.040
 always without guarantee but I am me 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.110
 sure and you will also see me 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.610
 I'll be back soon after I know that 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.130
 but I will do with the account 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.290
 also some sneijder go shopping 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.370
 So do not take me too much if 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.860
 I should ask 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.450
 I would say that was such a small one 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.340
 Tip I tried this one 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:48.970
 to bring some close why in 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:51.130
 that will happen and yes I would 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.570
 say if you like it writes 

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.790
 but what in the comments 

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.560
 give it a thumbs up let yourself in the 

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.760
 forum we look there too 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.850
 discuss things 

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.230
 and yes, in general what's me then 

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.300
 I would say that he is happy 

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.190
 have been waiting for the 

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.100
 next trading tip because that comes 

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:11.760
 that was from me quite early 

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.760
 take care
