00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
to go into building experience like I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.980 
to go into building experience like I
said<00:02:04.500> inventive<00:02:05.250> definitely<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
best sounds the best building experience

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.710 
best sounds the best building experience
out<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> all<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.280> ultra<00:02:11.280> build<00:02:11.720> figures

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.900 
from this year
I'd<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.950> say<00:02:15.099> it's<00:02:15.280> not<00:02:15.370> exactly<00:02:15.489> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
I'd have to say it's not exactly the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.449 
I'd have to say it's not exactly the
best<00:02:16.090> figure<00:02:16.540> definitely<00:02:17.260> by<00:02:17.440> longshots<00:02:18.069> I'd

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
best figure definitely by longshots I'd

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.339 
best figure definitely by longshots I'd
say<00:02:18.730> but<00:02:18.910> sir<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.540> building<00:02:19.690> experience

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
say but sir the building experience

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.500 
say but sir the building experience
itself<00:02:20.830> was<00:02:21.160> actually<00:02:21.280> pretty<00:02:21.819> unique<00:02:22.239> and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
itself was actually pretty unique and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.839 
itself was actually pretty unique and
innovative<00:02:22.629> I<00:02:23.140> like<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:24.160> um<00:02:25.620> again<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:27.430> final

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
innovative I like it um again the final

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.210 
innovative I like it um again the final
results<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.660> finished<00:02:28.959> result<00:02:29.260> isn't<00:02:29.530> top

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
results the finished result isn't top

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.449 
results the finished result isn't top
notch<00:02:30.250> but<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:31.330> building<00:02:31.720> was<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:32.459> unique

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
notch but the building was just unique

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.150 
notch but the building was just unique
so<00:02:34.390> that's<00:02:35.230> why<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.440> liked<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.799> so<00:02:35.950> much

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
problem is though they're not really

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.620 
problem is though they're not really
attached<00:05:25.159> to<00:05:25.430> anything<00:05:25.909> so<00:05:26.300> they<00:05:26.389> can<00:05:26.539> just

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
attached to anything so they can just

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.330

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
and back and forth I mean right through

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.230 
and back and forth I mean right through
articulation<00:05:31.099> for<00:05:31.190> his<00:05:31.310> arms<00:05:31.639> but<00:05:31.789> just<00:05:32.030> a<00:05:32.090> bit

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
articulation for his arms but just a bit

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.990
