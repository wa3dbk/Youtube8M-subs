00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.330
 hello love sports of styles welcome 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.740
 to the new club is yes and today 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.330
 we really have a lot of strength 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.790
 saved up, we pack our course 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.670
 really much weight today under 20 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.180
 450 kilo 6 200 kilo no 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.890
 problem 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.539
 well for me but not for the 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.670
 guys the weightlifter department of the 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.850
 Berlin tsc 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.749
 [Applause] 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.749
 [Music] 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.480
 weight lifting is at tsc as 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.280
 competitive sports operated the first 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.410
 team goes in the bundesliga at the 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.810
 start goal for all athletes remains however 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.040
 Participation in international 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.960
 major events of the department heads 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.270
 andrÃ© poitschke himself was also with the 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.560
 while the others play in the Olympics 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.030
 if you look at the history of 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.780
 berliner tsc looks at their weight 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.190
 lift then you have a whole 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.470
 quantity boast what are the Sun 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.440
 biggest successes i think the biggest ones 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.340
 Successes are Olympic medals 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.140
 olympia participations world championship 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.820
 medals european championship medals 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.380
 and looks down actually so far 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.630
 the youth area in german 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.030
 championships and many regularly 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.830
 many gold and silver medals 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.930
 Weightlifter department of the dsc is 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.610
 german federal base that means 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.770
 optimal training conditions 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.310
 professional environment and high class 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.990
 Trainer 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.800
 but not only world-class athletes 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.330
 Tsc is for everyone 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.400
 Age classes open at the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.170
 children and pull themselves through to 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.960
 the seniors with us at the moment as the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.810
 oldest athletes are around the 17 lead 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.870
 and so we have a broad spectrum 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.460
 and have fun to be all and if it is 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.409
 not enough for the big bump 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.630
 no problem with 20 departments 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.880
 Tsc is for everyone 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.140
 Another type of sport will be the same 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.970
 far, it is still with me 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.229
 I do not want more about that now 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.229
 to lift weight in experience 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.439
 [Music] 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.959
 the weightlifting started at the end of the 19 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.630
 century and since 1896 part of the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.190
 Olympic games up to 260 kilos 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.610
 are blown up by the athletes 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.590
 akimbo 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.480
 because you could first suspect that before 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.490
 all power plays a big role 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.140
 robert joachim is was in this year 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.120
 to start the world championship 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.400
 He explained to me that muscle mass, however 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.780
 Not everything is decisive is power 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.500
 already an important role though 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.030
 much more is the technology up 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.770
 for a certain point you can stop with 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.600
 power very much but if the 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.330
 technology is determined and now the 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.370
 most of the strength will not be trained 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.560
 especially when lifting the weight 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.660
 and shoulder muscles what are they 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.280
 to bring the ideal conditions 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.700
 we already operate the sport far above 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.400
 to be able to 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.500
 yes I say agility is just 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.900
 very crucial that you can move in 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.030
 the ankles in the shoulder area is 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.980
 that maybe you are not too big 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.000
 I say that's the angle of stop 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.680
 arms legs hull reasonably fits and 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.150
 yes, just enjoy the fun 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.180
 make weightlifting a bit 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.870
 interest motivation and then to the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.030
 everything fits 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.739
 You should also be technically flexible 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.959
 be for lifting the weight there 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.060
 two different variants that tear 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.340
 and come across what exactly is 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.200
 difference so you start with us 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.400
 im torn that risen is in principle 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.500
 the technically demanding discipline 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.260
 what where the dumbbell in one 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.530
 I am told that the sequence of movements will be unwound 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.049
 times 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.720
 and in the thrust it is stop 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.310
 divided it into two parts: 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.400
 it has launched and thereby one can 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.290
 just technical problems you 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.590
 maybe somewhere gave it away 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.370
 correct even better than when tearing 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.750
 yes wonderful then I would say 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.280
 I decide to break myself and the 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.579
 now had the long thank you 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.579
 conquer 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.110
 [Music] 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.240
 So the trade is for me now 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.440
 wonderfully loaded with 25 kilos I think 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.580
 I should be able to do that though 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.420
 I will let me explain this technique 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.380
 from the michael as wm-participant me 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.209
 wonderful 25 kilos 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.640
 she'll get it all right now 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.380
 easily she adjusts to the hand of 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.210
 shoulder board in the very hand to it 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.140
 is in the squat and straight back and 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.240
 firmly on the trade 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:34.760
 And she is feeling her breast 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:38.750
 And is in the squat who now 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.370
 now it is just about to make one 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.030
 slowly upstroke and push 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.090
 it behind the head in promising 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:50.060
 that's that's almost level for 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.310
 beginner ok so i think that i have 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.840
 a bit high and michael thanks 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.650
 that we show what I am going to become 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:02.539
 briefly the evaluation 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.539
 [Music] 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.419
 25 kilos to bring up successfully 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.160
 im thinking i think that as 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.410
 beginner done quite well though I did 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.840
 did not have to force much but had to 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.760
 who, of course, then at the 250 kilos 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.260
 Of course, this should be a try 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.340
 Bring base of force 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.540
 It does not do everything, though 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.730
 decisive but agility 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.900
 Coordination and speed I am 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.730
 yes also a very big role to all 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.710
 to be far ahead and if you 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.030
 then would like to learn these skills 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.220
 are you here with the berliner tsc with 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.690
 a monthly contribution of eight to 13 euros 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.030
 I have fun for everyone 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.830
 found in weightlifting on 9 11
