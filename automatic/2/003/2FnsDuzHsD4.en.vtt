00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.940
 a Frankfurt house wall becomes the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.230
 a symbol of tolerance for that very reason 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.150

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.099

 house wall and the landmark for 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.300
 tolerance and what does it all have 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.170
 actually with football and harmony 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.600
 to do frankfurt 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.849
 For one, this house is and initiated 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.529
 from the Frankfurt fan project to another 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.840
 adorns the landmark easily 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.090
 recognize anthony yeboah beginning of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.590
 1990s storm star of harmony 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.000
 frankfurt was twice scorer 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.739
 the bundesliga 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.940
 in the jersey of Eintracht Frankfurt and 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.280
 At that time probably everyone was 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 eintracht-fan cheered and still has 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.700
 he got up early with the topic 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.039
 have to deal with racism and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.180
 was confronted with it and at that time 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.160
 he already made himself strong for it 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.600
 and that's why it's here today 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.300
 be at the inauguration of this monument 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 We have a own price 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.100
 the award is in memory remain 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.960
 and among 15 applications was the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.970
 matthias weinfurter with his project 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.030
 a frankfurter house facade becomes the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.600
 landmark for tolerance of the first price 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.159
 was a very great concept 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.130
 submitted and we knew if that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.659
 then works it will be easy to 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.840
 best first price we are at all 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.430
 The wars can if ever 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.960
 Congratulations from Eintracht ev 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.820
 and maybe you can do us 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.729
 explain what is the idea behind 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.159
 This artwork so the idea is 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.189
 actually , let's say that first 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.290
 I have three interests so or too 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.909
 three pillars for the project 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.740
 being a bit like that is one thing 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.520
 I am 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.310
 is studying visual communication like this 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.680
 overall design that 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.899
 somehow lies within the framework of my mine 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.850
 On the other hand I am in harmony 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.610
 Frankfurt fan and the other I have 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.680
 I have him for the third part 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.750
 ideal interest just a sign to 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.929
 oppose discrimination 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.399
 exclusion and linked to the 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.369
 history of harmony is 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.069
 course internet exchanges case study where 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.200
 where to just tell a story like that 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.019
 can tell 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.150
 and yes, a theme say so well 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.989
 can question and not not 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.430
 Maybe not always completely open 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.799
 a name comes and the discussion 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.569
 also first time can build up such a 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.310
 just under the age of matthias weinfurter 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.680
 and dominik dresel with around 20 helpers 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.540
 worked on the project only then in 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.959
 the last two weeks finalized 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.880
 has been 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.400
 I just wanted to mention it 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.390
 know that we can be happy that 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.470
 We do something like this here in Frankfurt 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.400
 There are cities where you can do so 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.500
 can not do something and I would 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.150
 almost say that you also have the fanszene 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.940
 and lead group ultras 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.739
 Frankfurt should mention that it 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.030
 people gave it up 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.890
 have that just nazis have fun 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.570
 at the harmony and the work of 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.670
 Both are very well received 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.769
 many guests came to niederrad 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.480
 to inaugurate the house wall duly 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.100
 the home of the Nassau for 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.400
 the artwork provided 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.500
 It was a project where we said 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.120
 have is really to frankfurt 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.440
 is fits to our company 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:28.000
 There was music from Marlon as well as from the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:30.220
 sons mannheims in football clubs one 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.239
 Tradition in the city has also reflected 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.319
 always a little bit in this city 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.730
 Again I believe in harmony 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.420
 frankfurt has always been cosmopolitan 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.550
 We have an association there on the wall of the house 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.799
 a statement the picture of tony yeboah 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.569
 and not just the fans, for example 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.640

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.099

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.200

 Stadttor it is an entrance portal that 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.079
 says you're coming to a city where 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.760
 racism where intolerance has no place 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.120
 and then finally entered the special 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.769

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:14.170

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.060
 of course personally with his 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.060
 signature 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:10.310
