 thanks for watching this video 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:22.030
 see you soon the report continues to laleu 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:25.030
 disappointed at first to have clouds and 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.150
 a well realize that suddenly you 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.330
 can remove the glasses and watch 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.900
 directly 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.960
 the sun is the clouds that make 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.910
 a little filter and that allows us to 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.970
 look directly at the sun without us 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:47.220
 burst your eyes and thus admire the 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.550
 moon exit and it's really magical 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.620
 magic 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.070
 so I tried to modify at the same 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.050
 time is the brightness with the 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.050
 pictures are deadly 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:17.850
 erika flashes yes here are the clippers 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.970

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:27.900
 clouds 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:32.300
 Here it is great it explodes there is 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.300
