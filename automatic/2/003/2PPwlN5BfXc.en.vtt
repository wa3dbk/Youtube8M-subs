 Do you know what kind of overpaid money I often listen to these days

 If you crossed the loan does Mase Baike have to pay the interest every year 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:25.840
 Interest rates of more than 15 to 20% were taken so far , which was originally good without Harah 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:33.450
 The 2010 law is in place, and interest rate audiences beyond the courts will be banned 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:36.780
 Debt decreased and money came to return at the interest rate of the amount that I had paid extra 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.730
 Extra interest paid for years 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:47.240
 Those who have paid the tip are likely to be converted a lot 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:54.570
 If repayment is complete, you can claim it within 10 years 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:01:00.500
