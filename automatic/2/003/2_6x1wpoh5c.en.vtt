remember<00:00:12.690> learning<00:00:13.019> about<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.650> social

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
remember learning about in social

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.799 
remember learning about in social
psychology<00:00:14.280> class<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> didn't<00:00:15.660> remember

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
psychology class so I didn't remember

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.300 
psychology class so I didn't remember
the<00:00:16.049> specifics<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.859> took<00:00:17.039> some

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the specifics and it took some

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.150 
the specifics and it took some
researching<00:00:18.000> online<00:00:18.210> but<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.050> think<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.619> got<00:00:19.890> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
researching online but I think I got a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.189 
researching online but I think I got a
pretty<00:00:20.400> close<00:00:20.850> approximation<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> study

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
pretty close approximation to the study

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.400 
pretty close approximation to the study

that<00:02:21.360> they've<00:02:21.989> done<00:02:22.230> studies<00:02:22.680> across

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
that they've done studies across

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.250 
that they've done studies across
cultures<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.849> they<00:02:23.940> found<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.330> most<00:02:24.599> people

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
cultures and they found the most people

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.479 
cultures and they found the most people
associate<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.950> shape<00:02:26.459> with<00:02:27.390> Kiki<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.530> tecate

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.690 
associate the shape with Kiki and tecate
ticket<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.470> tecate<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.680> most<00:02:32.489> people

I<00:02:37.049> found<00:02:37.349> this<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.680> be<00:02:37.709> interesting<00:02:38.160> because

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
I found this to be interesting because

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.339 
I found this to be interesting because
first<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.819> all<00:02:39.000> it's<00:02:39.239> it's<00:02:39.810> kind<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
first of all it's it's kind of like a

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.740 
first of all it's it's kind of like a
cross-cultural<00:02:41.220> finding<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:42.329> they<00:02:42.510> found

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
cross-cultural finding that they found

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.690 
cross-cultural finding that they found
the<00:02:42.870> most<00:02:43.019> people<00:02:43.349> agree<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:43.769> this<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.220> forget

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
the most people agree on this I forget

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.130 
the most people agree on this I forget
which<00:02:44.819> cultures<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.390> wasn't<00:02:45.720> actually<00:02:46.019> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
which cultures it wasn't actually the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.110 
which cultures it wasn't actually the
two<00:02:46.319> different<00:02:46.650> studies<00:02:47.010> one<00:02:47.519> study<00:02:47.730> used

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
two different studies one study used

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.210 
two different studies one study used
jian<00:02:48.870> boba<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.010> then<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.190> other

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
jian boba I think and then the other

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.819 
jian boba I think and then the other
study<00:02:50.549> used<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.880> catch<00:02:51.090> Ian<00:02:51.239> voluma<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.959> kind

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
study used to catch Ian voluma it kind

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.039 
study used to catch Ian voluma it kind
of<00:02:52.980> reminds<00:02:53.489> me<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.670> autumn<00:02:54.209> autopia<00:02:54.720> for

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
of reminds me of autumn autopia for

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.130 
of reminds me of autumn autopia for
shapes<00:02:55.410> not<00:02:55.940> really<00:02:56.940> onomatopoeia<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:57.930> when

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
shapes not really onomatopoeia is when

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.259 
shapes not really onomatopoeia is when
the<00:02:58.620> word<00:02:58.799> sounds<00:02:59.220> like<00:02:59.280> what<00:02:59.489> it<00:02:59.519> represents

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
the word sounds like what it represents

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.059 
the word sounds like what it represents

but<00:03:09.569> this<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.900> kind<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.319> like<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.489> time<00:03:11.730> looks

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
but this is kind of like this time looks

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.120 
but this is kind of like this time looks
like<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.569> would<00:03:12.690> be<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.840> Kiki<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.709> kind<00:03:13.980> of

like it would be a Kiki and this kind of
looks<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.609> it<00:03:15.239> could<00:03:15.540> be<00:03:15.569> a<00:03:15.720> boba<00:03:16.370> apart<00:03:17.370> from

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
looks like it could be a boba apart from

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.910 
looks like it could be a boba apart from
our<00:03:17.609> alphabet<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.420> how<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.600> Luba<00:03:19.170> kind<00:03:19.829> of

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
our alphabet and how the Luba kind of

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.160 
our alphabet and how the Luba kind of
the<00:03:20.250> bee<00:03:20.430> has<00:03:20.790> kind<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.239> rounded<00:03:21.690> edges<00:03:22.019> like

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
the bee has kind of rounded edges like

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.210 
the bee has kind of rounded edges like
this<00:03:22.200> does<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.859> ki<00:03:23.280> ki<00:03:23.549> ki<00:03:24.060> KI<00:03:24.870> or<00:03:25.769> cicchetti

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
this does and ki ki ki KI or cicchetti

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.190 
this does and ki ki ki KI or cicchetti
they<00:03:26.760> have<00:03:26.849> more<00:03:27.000> pointy<00:03:27.480> letters<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.989> guess

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
they have more pointy letters I guess

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.349 
they have more pointy letters I guess
you<00:03:28.349> could<00:03:28.560> say<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:29.069> wonder<00:03:29.340> if<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.700> think<00:03:30.090> this

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
you could say I wonder if I think this

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.809 
you could say I wonder if I think this
was<00:03:30.480> also<00:03:30.660> implicated<00:03:30.959> in<00:03:31.639> cultures<00:03:32.639> that

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
was also implicated in cultures that

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.330 
was also implicated in cultures that
don't<00:03:33.180> follow<00:03:33.510> up<00:03:33.780> our<00:03:34.049> alphabet<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.130> then

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
don't follow up our alphabet and then

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.860 
don't follow up our alphabet and then
just<00:03:35.579> like<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.880> sounding<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.569> words

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
just like the sounding of the words

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.800 
just like the sounding of the words
sounds<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:37.709> what<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.419> thought<00:03:39.630> that

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
sounds like what it is so I thought that

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.379 
sounds like what it is so I thought that
was<00:03:39.930> interesting<00:03:40.109> I<00:03:40.769> don't<00:03:41.310> know<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.060> exact

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
was interesting I don't know the exact

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.360 
was interesting I don't know the exact
statistics<00:03:42.989> because<00:03:43.139> again<00:03:43.440> don't<00:03:43.950> have<00:03:44.220> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
statistics because again don't have the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.180 
statistics because again don't have the
actual<00:03:44.519> studies<00:03:45.150> with<00:03:45.510> me<00:03:45.780> now<00:03:46.019> but<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:47.010> just

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
actual studies with me now but I just

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.020 
actual studies with me now but I just
thought<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.400> was<00:03:47.459> interesting<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.940> they

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
thought it was interesting and they

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.069 
thought it was interesting and they
actually<00:03:48.299> found<00:03:48.419> that<00:03:48.540> people<00:03:48.750> with<00:03:48.870> autism

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
actually found that people with autism

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.729 
actually found that people with autism
didn't<00:03:49.709> tend<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.160> get<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.459> same<00:03:50.669> results<00:03:51.030> but

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
didn't tend to get the same results but

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.720 
didn't tend to get the same results but
90<00:03:52.739> something<00:03:53.010> percent<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.609> population

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
90 something percent of the population

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.659 
90 something percent of the population
did<00:03:54.389> get<00:03:54.630> similar<00:03:54.870> results<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:56.310> rest<00:03:56.489> of<00:03:56.609> the

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
did get similar results the rest of the

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.220 
did get similar results the rest of the
time<00:03:56.910> so<00:03:57.329> that<00:03:57.540> was<00:03:57.690> interesting<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.200> thought

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
time so that was interesting I thought

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.680 
time so that was interesting I thought
you<00:03:58.440> would<00:03:58.560> enjoy<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.829> and<00:03:59.340> also

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
you would enjoy that and also

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.349 
you would enjoy that and also
synesthesia<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:01.049> saw<00:04:01.440> some<00:04:01.880> ponderings<00:04:02.880> on<00:04:03.209> the

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
synesthesia I saw some ponderings on the

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.670 
synesthesia I saw some ponderings on the
internet<00:04:03.660> about<00:04:03.840> whether<00:04:04.109> could<00:04:04.380> be<00:04:04.470> related

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
internet about whether could be related

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.800 
internet about whether could be related
to<00:04:04.859> synesthesia<00:04:05.549> so<00:04:05.940> where<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.269> experience

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
to synesthesia so where the experience

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.470 
to synesthesia so where the experience
of<00:04:06.959> one<00:04:07.319> sense<00:04:08.069> kind<00:04:08.849> of<00:04:08.940> leads<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.419> an

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
of one sense kind of leads to an

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.270 
of one sense kind of leads to an
experience<00:04:09.989> in<00:04:10.169> another<00:04:10.500> sense<00:04:10.859> that<00:04:11.040> seems

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
experience in another sense that seems

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.159 
experience in another sense that seems
to<00:04:11.430> be<00:04:11.459> totally<00:04:11.730> unrelated<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.660> more<00:04:12.870> unique

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
to be totally unrelated the more unique

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.789 
to be totally unrelated the more unique
cases<00:04:13.859> of<00:04:14.220> synesthesia<00:04:14.760> would<00:04:15.180> be<00:04:15.359> if<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:16.229> see

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
cases of synesthesia would be if you see

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.050 
cases of synesthesia would be if you see
it<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.219> letter<00:04:18.209> or

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
it a letter or

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.840 
it a letter or
number<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:20.230> see<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.160> letter<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.579> number

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
number and you see the letter the number

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.600 
number and you see the letter the number
in<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.090> different<00:04:22.419> color<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.050> your<00:04:23.230> your<00:04:23.889> brain

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
in a different color so your your brain

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.340 
in a different color so your your brain
kind<00:04:24.910> of<00:04:24.970> associates<00:04:25.570> each<00:04:25.870> letter<00:04:26.139> in<00:04:26.260> each

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
kind of associates each letter in each

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.560 
kind of associates each letter in each
number<00:04:26.710> with<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.889> different<00:04:27.220> color<00:04:27.400> or<00:04:27.639> people

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
number with a different color or people

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.330 
number with a different color or people
who<00:04:28.600> chase<00:04:29.260> something<00:04:29.620> different<00:04:30.100> with<00:04:30.220> each

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
who chase something different with each

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.030 
who chase something different with each
note<00:04:30.760> like<00:04:31.570> musical<00:04:32.139> note<00:04:32.320> which<00:04:32.919> is

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
note like musical note which is

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.260 
note like musical note which is
interesting<00:04:33.430> because<00:04:33.460> I<00:04:33.669> guess<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:34.060> wouldn't

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
interesting because I guess you wouldn't

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.150 
interesting because I guess you wouldn't
want<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:34.810> hear<00:04:35.080> bad<00:04:35.260> notes<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.830> because<00:04:36.010> you

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
want to hear bad notes and because you

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.100 
want to hear bad notes and because you
have<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.580> bad<00:04:36.880> taste<00:04:37.150> in<00:04:37.389> your<00:04:37.450> mouth<00:04:37.570> literally

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
have a bad taste in your mouth literally

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.040 
have a bad taste in your mouth literally
but<00:04:38.919> um<00:04:39.310> yeah<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:40.180> those<00:04:40.480> are<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.660> more<00:04:40.870> unique

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
but um yeah so those are the more unique

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.350 
but um yeah so those are the more unique
cases<00:04:41.410> indecision<00:04:42.040> one<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:42.460> one<00:04:43.030> of<00:04:43.180> my

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
post on synesthesia you can write that

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.770 
post on synesthesia you can write that
down<00:05:03.790> in<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:03.970> comments<00:05:04.300> I<00:05:04.389> don't<00:05:04.600> really

encourage advertising yourself on my
videos<00:05:07.570> but<00:05:07.900> it's<00:05:08.229> related<00:05:08.919> to<00:05:08.950> the<00:05:09.130> video<00:05:09.400> and

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700

yeah so if you wrote that blog post you

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.770 
yeah so if you wrote that blog post you
can<00:05:11.710> write<00:05:12.010> it<00:05:12.130> down<00:05:12.250> but<00:05:12.880> basically<00:05:13.419> like

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
can write it down but basically like

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.330 
can write it down but basically like
this<00:05:13.990> could<00:05:14.200> be<00:05:14.290> kind<00:05:14.470> of<00:05:14.590> like<00:05:14.740> synesthesia

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
this could be kind of like synesthesia

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.210 
this could be kind of like synesthesia
related<00:05:15.910> because<00:05:16.630> it's<00:05:17.320> a<00:05:17.410> visual<00:05:17.590> stimuli

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
related because it's a visual stimuli

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.710 
related because it's a visual stimuli
that's<00:05:18.250> kind<00:05:18.729> of<00:05:18.760> reminding<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:19.389> of<00:05:19.419> an

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
that's kind of reminding you of an

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.000 
that's kind of reminding you of an
auditory<00:05:22.320> representation<00:05:23.320> of<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.590> or<00:05:23.770> an

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
auditory representation of it or an

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.770 
auditory representation of it or an
auditory<00:05:24.729> word<00:05:24.970> kind<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.300> reminds<00:05:25.660> your

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
auditory word kind of reminds your

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.420 
auditory word kind of reminds your
visual<00:05:26.169> stimuli<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:26.830> guess<00:05:27.130> there<00:05:27.280> could<00:05:27.370> be

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
visual stimuli I guess there could be

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.670 
visual stimuli I guess there could be
arguments<00:05:27.940> either<00:05:28.210> way<00:05:28.510> but<00:05:29.050> that's<00:05:29.200> kind<00:05:29.590> of

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
arguments either way but that's kind of

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.909 
arguments either way but that's kind of
