00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
right here so that's the cover and on

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.400 
right here so that's the cover and on
the<00:00:57.539> back<00:00:57.930> what<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.420> just<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.960> info

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the back what we have is just the info

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.160 
the back what we have is just the info
and<00:01:01.770> everything<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:03.960> it

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.500 
and everything so if you see here it
says<00:01:04.199> every<00:01:04.949> stride<00:01:05.339> matters<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.330> think

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
says every stride matters I don't think

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
says every stride matters I don't think
you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.750> read<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.380> plastic<00:01:07.799> is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you can read it because the plastic is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.480 
you can read it because the plastic is
still<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.210> I'll<00:01:09.330> read<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.810> says

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
still on it but I'll read it it says

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.399

so<00:01:53.009> let's<00:01:53.369> get<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:53.909> into<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.479> cut<00:01:55.110> this

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
so let's get right into this cut this

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.530 
so let's get right into this cut this
open<00:01:55.439> account<00:01:55.860> way<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> play<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:59.540> let's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
open account way to play it and let's

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.710 
open account way to play it and let's
open<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:01.200> up

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:12.320 

and<00:02:04.720> see<00:02:05.049> what's<00:02:05.259> inside<00:02:05.579> which<00:02:06.579> is<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.720> disc

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.949 

big<00:02:13.330> there's<00:02:13.540> some<00:02:13.690> plastic<00:02:13.930> left<00:02:14.349> on<00:02:14.560> here

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
big there's some plastic left on here

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.780 
big there's some plastic left on here
yep<00:02:16.959> pull<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.040> out<00:02:18.250> go<00:02:19.120> back<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.510> side<00:02:19.810> and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
yep pull that out go back this side and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.759 
yep pull that out go back this side and
so<00:02:21.790> there<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.209> is<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:22.690> think<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.349> can<00:02:23.500> read<00:02:23.650> it

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
so there it is I think you can read it

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.520 
so there it is I think you can read it
clearer<00:02:24.099> now<00:02:24.340> without<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.150> plastic<00:02:25.690> on<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.319> if

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
clearer now without the plastic on it if

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.130 
clearer now without the plastic on it if
you<00:02:27.220> want<00:02:27.489> but<00:02:28.500> yeah<00:02:29.500> let's<00:02:29.769> open<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.220> up<00:02:30.370> now

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
