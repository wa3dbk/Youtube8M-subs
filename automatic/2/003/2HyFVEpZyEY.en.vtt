00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
represent their learning has actually

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.910 
represent their learning has actually
increased<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:25.150> quality<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.810> their<00:03:26.050> work<00:03:26.080> even

with the latest technology tools
project-based<00:03:29.320> learning<00:03:29.530> can<00:03:30.220> be

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
project-based learning can be

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.900 
project-based learning can be
challenging<00:03:31.120> for<00:03:31.150> teachers<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.950> we<00:03:32.980> came<00:03:33.760> up

oh good okay it's easier to teach out of
a<00:03:41.019> textbook<00:03:41.320> where<00:03:41.620> this<00:03:41.769> day<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.100> tells<00:03:42.310> me<00:03:42.459> to

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
we've connected the learning to

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.809 
we've connected the learning to
real-world<00:06:13.870> problems<00:06:14.319> and<00:06:15.039> the<00:06:15.460> integration

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
real-world problems and the integration

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:17.400 
real-world problems and the integration
of<00:06:15.970> technology<00:06:16.509> has<00:06:16.599> helped<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:16.960> students<00:06:17.289> to

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
of technology has helped the students to

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.140 
of technology has helped the students to
actually<00:06:17.710> produce<00:06:17.889> quality<00:06:18.190> products<00:06:18.759> so

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
actually produce quality products so

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.659 
actually produce quality products so
that's<00:06:19.330> the<00:06:19.509> reward<00:06:19.870> and<00:06:20.110> to<00:06:20.409> me<00:06:20.919> it's<00:06:21.340> it's

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
that's the reward and to me it's it's

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.159 
that's the reward and to me it's it's
been<00:06:21.849> probably<00:06:22.090> the<00:06:22.240> most<00:06:22.389> rewarding<00:06:22.599> way<00:06:23.020> of
