00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.110
 yo everyone is hot who 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.940
 I hope you are doing well 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.260
 could have seen it in the title it's not a 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.119
 video like the others so what he 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.590
 must know is that sir thomas 62 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.150
 was hacked his youtube channel 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.850
 so I'll explain the story 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.740
 just after that but before that I invite you 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.289
 to go support sir thomas 62 in 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.910
 subscribing to his channel then I you 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.380
 do not prompt to subscribe but go to 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.920
 less to support that would really make him 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.930
 pleasure 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.520
 you can find his channel in the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.140
 description of this video 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.910
 so now I'm going to explain 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.890
 the story from a to z 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.660
 so I was in skype conversation with 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.430
 thomas we are often used to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.440
 watch movies together then we have 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 decided to go watch a movie 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.370
 but before that thomas been see in his 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.920
 gmail account if he had not received a 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.870
 mail and suddenly he saw that he had received 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.520
 an email like what and base his word of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.859
 pass of his youtube channel had been 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.600
 changed and in fact thomas him he had 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.350
 nothing changed so we started to 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.359
 stressing 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.250
 yet there was nothing wrong with 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.110
 his channel he had all his videos there 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.000
 was still connected so he was 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.560
 change your password via the email 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.390
 he received and when he got 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.340
 reconnected is not his channel had been 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.780
 removed so that was dirty 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.820
 story I tried everything you 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.439
 detail for the moment we do not know 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.140
 if his chain is definitely 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.880
 deleted we will see that with our network 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.619
 but in any case I hope that his chain 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.180
 will be re-opened as I wanted 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.070
 said at the beginning of the video if we went 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.750
 support thomas by subscribing to his 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.159
 chain and it would really make him 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.049
 pleasure and that would encourage him to 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.520
 resume videos should know that 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.060
 it's not easy to lose a chain 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.189
 Youtube 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.869
 personally I have already been a victim of 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.270
 I've already lost a chain that had 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.130
 24 thousand subscribers then it's not nothing 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.390
 lose a most complicated chain 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 it's not about losing subscribers but 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 it's about losing all the content you 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.700
 did but against losing 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.229
 subscribers too that hurts so 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.210
 it's really hard but it's not the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.860
 number of subscribers who counts then I 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.049
 invites you for the last time to 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.430
 support sir thomas 62 you will be able 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.110
 find his chain in the description 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.790
 of video so thanks to all 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.530
 to encourage thomas and to support him 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.719
 thanks again for watching the video 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.710
 so far we find ourselves either at 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.280
 the time when very soon 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.280
