00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
now all we've done is taking these all

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.729 
now all we've done is taking these all
you<00:00:33.630> have<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> bits<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.050> pieces<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.590> just

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
you have a bits and pieces on and just

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.770 
you have a bits and pieces on and just
sort<00:00:34.950> them<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> generous<00:00:36.210> handful<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.570> salt

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
sort them so a generous handful of salt

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.600 
sort them so a generous handful of salt
the<00:00:37.200> especially<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.950> there<00:00:38.129> about<00:00:38.280> half

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the especially not in there about half

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.220 
the especially not in there about half
an<00:00:38.760> hour<00:00:38.910> exactly<00:00:39.420> right<00:00:39.629> gets<00:00:39.780> moisture<00:00:40.110> out

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
an hour exactly right gets moisture out

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.959 
an hour exactly right gets moisture out
and<00:00:40.410> then<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.920> probably<00:00:41.070> cook<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.820> can

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
and then just probably cook it we can

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.700 
and then just probably cook it we can
wipe<00:00:42.239> off<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> excess<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.379> see<00:00:43.530> how

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
wipe off the excess so you can see how

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.920 
wipe off the excess so you can see how
much<00:00:43.890> moisture<00:00:44.850> comes<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.629> skin

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
much moisture comes out of that skin

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.180 
much moisture comes out of that skin
that's<00:00:46.289> what's<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.620> help<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.860> go<00:00:46.920> nice

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
there as well so this is about throwing

go into an oven 150 degrees Celsius a
nice<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.330> low<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:19.050> for<00:02:19.140> about<00:02:19.200> two<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.590> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
nice and low but for about two and a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.830 
nice and low but for about two and a
half<00:02:20.010> hours<00:02:20.520> or<00:02:20.700> get<00:02:21.240> really<00:02:21.570> get<00:02:21.690> all<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
flavors really slow cook it becomes so a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.970 
flavors really slow cook it becomes so a
mixture<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.620> put<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.950> oven

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
mixture so if you put that in the oven

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.640 
mixture so if you put that in the oven
yes<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.810> two<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> half<00:02:28.200> hours<00:02:28.380> time

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
yes and in two and a half hours time

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.870 
yes and in two and a half hours time
we'll<00:02:28.920> come<00:02:29.100> back<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.890> smells<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.430> good

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
we'll come back to it it smells so good

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.430 
we'll come back to it it smells so good
where's<00:02:33.360> all<00:02:33.510> those<00:02:33.660> same<00:02:33.870> smells<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.320> had

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
where's all those same smells you had

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.680 
where's all those same smells you had
before<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.280> know<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.910> bit<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.270> cooked

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
before and you know the bit is cooked

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.110 
before and you know the bit is cooked
okay<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.080> we<00:02:37.230> can<00:02:37.350> fish<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.650> out<00:02:37.740> at<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.790> point

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
okay so we can fish it out at this point

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.460 
okay so we can fish it out at this point
I<00:02:39.330> realize<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.050> not<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.230> most<00:02:40.350> attractive

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
I realize it's not the most attractive

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.860 
I realize it's not the most attractive
looking<00:02:41.100> food<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.300> take<00:02:42.420> out<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.630> leg

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
looking food but we take out that leg

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.780 
looking food but we take out that leg
out<00:02:43.020> pop<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.560> onto<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.800> tray<00:02:44.040> for<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.640> meantime

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
out pop it onto a tray for the meantime

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.730 
out pop it onto a tray for the meantime
Jamie<00:02:45.630> if<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:45.900> put<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.110> into<00:02:46.260> our<00:02:46.350> herbs

Jamie if you can put that into our herbs

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.350 
Jamie if you can put that into our herbs
we<00:02:46.830> need<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> crisp<00:02:47.310> up<00:02:47.460> that<00:02:47.550> skin<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.180> now<00:02:48.300> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
we need to crisp up that skin so now the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.120 
we need to crisp up that skin so now the
oven<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.720> hot<00:02:48.960> as<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.320> will<00:02:49.410> possibly<00:02:49.770> go<00:02:49.980> and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
oven is hot as it will possibly go and

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.890 
oven is hot as it will possibly go and
these<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.850> few<00:02:51.120> minutes<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.450> crisp<00:02:51.720> up

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
these just a few minutes to crisp up

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.780 
these just a few minutes to crisp up

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
meanwhile J we can do our filling cool

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.710 
meanwhile J we can do our filling cool
so<00:02:56.250> obviously<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.060> go<00:02:57.150> inside

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
so obviously this is going to go inside
