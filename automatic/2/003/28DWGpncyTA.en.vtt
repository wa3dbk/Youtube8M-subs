with this leather pouch which does a
really<00:00:15.990> good<00:00:16.170> job<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.410> protecting<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.039> device

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
really good job of protecting the device

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.370 
really good job of protecting the device
although<00:00:17.820> at<00:00:17.940> first<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.390> extremely<00:00:19.080> tight

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
although at first it's extremely tight

another<00:00:20.189> small<00:00:20.580> problem<00:00:21.029> with<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> pouch<00:00:21.480> is

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
another small problem with the pouch is

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.330 
another small problem with the pouch is
that<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.350> hard<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.740> device<00:00:22.980> out<00:00:23.189> you

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
that it's hard to get the device out you

that it's hard to get the device out you
can<00:00:23.460> squeeze<00:00:23.730> from<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> bottom<00:00:24.359> which<00:00:24.779> will

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
can squeeze from the bottom which will

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.599 
can squeeze from the bottom which will
probably<00:00:25.140> turn<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> device<00:00:25.890> accidentally

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.020 
as they've been doing for several
generations<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.860> devices<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.700> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
generations of devices now and it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.190 
generations of devices now and it
actually<00:01:39.060> makes<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.570> lot<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.720> sense<00:01:39.840> because

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
actually makes a lot of sense because

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.990 
actually makes a lot of sense because
now<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> turn<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> device<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.790> one

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
now you can turn on the device with one

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.429 
now you can turn on the device with one
hand<00:01:42.240> which<00:01:42.450> without<00:01:42.810> having<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> hold<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
hand which without having to hold the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.069 
hand which without having to hold the
device<00:01:43.560> press<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.689> tap<00:01:45.899> that

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
device press up here so we can tap that

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
device press up here so we can tap that
and<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.470> turn<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> screen<00:01:47.159> will

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and it will turn on the screen will

let's<00:01:58.140> talk<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> little<00:01:58.560> bit<00:01:58.770> more<00:01:58.979> about<00:01:59.340> this

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
let's talk a little bit more about this

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.420 
let's talk a little bit more about this
screen<00:02:00.500> obviously<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.799> capacitive

of<00:02:15.480> people<00:02:15.630> were<00:02:15.780> asking<00:02:16.200> about<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.680> in

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
of people were asking about that in

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.150 
of people were asking about that in
terms<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:18.210> sensitivity<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.920> as

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
terms of sensitivity it's not as

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.890 
terms of sensitivity it's not as
sensitive<00:02:20.640> as<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.970> iphone<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.510> probably

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
sensitive as the iphone it's probably

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.710 
sensitive as the iphone it's probably
within<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.740> same<00:02:22.950> realm<00:02:23.250> as<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.940> HTC<00:02:24.420> hero

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720

and other HTC android devices that have

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.000 
and other HTC android devices that have
a<00:02:26.910> capacitive<00:02:27.510> display<00:02:27.650> what's<00:02:28.650> interesting

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
a capacitive display what's interesting

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.550 
a capacitive display what's interesting
is<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.640> screen<00:02:29.910> sensitivity<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:31.200> not

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
is that the screen sensitivity is not

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.730 
is that the screen sensitivity is not
too<00:02:32.070> different<00:02:32.490> than<00:02:32.730> say<00:02:33.120> an<00:02:33.390> HTC<00:02:34.290> touch<00:02:34.500> pro

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
too different than say an HTC touch pro

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.710 
too different than say an HTC touch pro
in<00:02:34.950> fact<00:02:35.220> I'd<00:02:35.400> say<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.760> hd2<00:02:36.300> has<00:02:36.450> about

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
in fact I'd say that the hd2 has about

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.540 
in fact I'd say that the hd2 has about
twenty<00:02:37.440> twenty-five<00:02:37.830> percent<00:02:37.980> increased

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
twenty twenty-five percent increased

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.370 
twenty twenty-five percent increased
screen<00:02:38.910> sensitivity<00:02:39.240> where<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.170> really

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
screen sensitivity where you really

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.230 
screen sensitivity where you really
notice<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.830> change<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.310> capacitive<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:41.970> how

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
notice the change to capacitive is how

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.449 
notice the change to capacitive is how
the<00:02:42.300> screen<00:02:42.810> feels<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.770> course<00:02:44.070> on<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.250> touch

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
the screen feels of course on the touch

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.160 
the screen feels of course on the touch
pro<00:02:44.640> two<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.090> get<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.270> little<00:02:45.540> bit<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.930> sunken

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
pro two you get a little bit of a sunken

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.830 
pro two you get a little bit of a sunken
in<00:02:46.530> feel<00:02:47.430> when<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:48.180> press<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.600> screen

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
in feel when you you press on the screen

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.240 
in feel when you you press on the screen
because<00:02:49.110> it's<00:02:49.290> resistive<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.920> requires

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
because it's resistive it requires

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.120 
because it's resistive it requires
pressure<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:51.300> on<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.510> capacitive<00:02:52.050> display

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.710 
rocker on the bottom we have 3.5
millimeter<00:03:16.950> audio<00:03:17.489> which<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.790> great<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.209> a

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
millimeter audio which is great and a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.570 
millimeter audio which is great and a
micro<00:03:19.110> USB<00:03:19.140> port<00:03:19.860> for<00:03:19.890> charging<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.489> syncing

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
micro USB port for charging and syncing

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.150 
micro USB port for charging and syncing
and<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.209> quite<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.420> deviation<00:03:22.049> from<00:03:22.160> HTC's

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
and this is quite a deviation from HTC's

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160 
and this is quite a deviation from HTC's
EXT<00:03:23.850> USB<00:03:24.330> port<00:03:24.630> which<00:03:24.660> they've<00:03:24.989> been<00:03:25.140> using

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
EXT USB port which they've been using

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.140 
EXT USB port which they've been using
for<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:25.920> really<00:03:26.130> long<00:03:26.160> time<00:03:26.340> now<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.120> a

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
for a really long time now but this is a

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.970 
for a really long time now but this is a
more<00:03:27.390> standardized<00:03:27.989> port<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:28.650> we're<00:03:28.769> glad

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
more standardized port and so we're glad

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.220 
more standardized port and so we're glad
they<00:03:29.160> switched<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.760> here<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.840> microphone

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
they switched and here is a microphone

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.100 
they switched and here is a microphone
on<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:32.580> other<00:03:32.790> side<00:03:33.090> there<00:03:33.330> is<00:03:33.360> nothing

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
on the other side there is nothing

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.140 
on the other side there is nothing
except<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> little<00:03:35.310> notch<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:35.940> use<00:03:36.120> to

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
except the little notch that you use to

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.640

very<00:03:41.880> clean<00:03:42.420> design<00:03:43.290> they<00:03:43.920> obviously<00:03:44.070> wanted

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
very clean design they obviously wanted

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.000 
very clean design they obviously wanted
to<00:03:44.880> make<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.329> all<00:03:45.600> about<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.320> screen<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.890> it

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
to make it all about the screen and it

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.710 
to make it all about the screen and it
really<00:03:47.190> is<00:03:47.400> let's<00:03:48.030> turn<00:03:48.209> over<00:03:48.360> to<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.570> back

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
we're going to talk about photo quality

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.550 
we're going to talk about photo quality
in<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.940> upcoming<00:04:00.090> review<00:04:00.540> now<00:04:01.200> kind<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.470> a

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
in the upcoming review now kind of a

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.140 
in the upcoming review now kind of a
problem<00:04:01.860> is<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> edges<00:04:02.790> for<00:04:03.000> this

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
problem is that the edges for this

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.110 
problem is that the edges for this
camera<00:04:03.420> are<00:04:03.690> extremely<00:04:04.560> sharp<00:04:04.890> in<00:04:05.160> fact<00:04:05.760> so

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
camera are extremely sharp in fact so

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.569 
camera are extremely sharp in fact so
sharp<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.600> if<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.440> have<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.130> face<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.459> down

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
sharp that if you have it face it down

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.479 
sharp that if you have it face it down
on<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> table<00:04:09.000> or<00:04:09.299> on<00:04:09.959> its<00:04:10.350> back<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:11.310> move

on a table or on its back and you move
the<00:04:11.670> phone<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.150> may<00:04:12.269> actually<00:04:12.450> cut<00:04:12.900> into<00:04:13.170> the
