00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Emerson talks about beauty here more 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.710
 a video game was commented from the cross and 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.470
 6/3 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.880
 Of course it's a test video but we 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.830
 let's do a gameplay because he does not 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.059
 has no benchmark for us to 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.440
 we are testing 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.179
 only this video will be differentiated 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 This video is going to show you 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.680
 the performance difference using 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.859
 all methods in front of more than the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.750
 game has to we are looking at a point 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.140
 fix the fps to line 80 above 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.370
 80 actually and the use of gpu 97% 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.230
 of the second gpu and 89 91 of the first gpu 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.620
 good beauty 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.450
 use you ask down here 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:53.730
 ok options raps a fx a let's disable 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:57.840
 the fx realize that neither fps drops much 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.280
 neither does the same fps actually fall with fx 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.750
 Aecim it is and what are disabled 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.909
 even fps 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.159
 But the graphic looks ugly. 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.310
 so an analysis at least use 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:20.640
 use programs will look cute 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:25.850
 good sma low 1 x 1 let's apply fell there 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.040
 27 ps will the party 23 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.930
 still well played 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.689
 are you another mgp image or why are you 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.180
 gpu because he is using flys there 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.439
 because this line of 680 because I am 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.439
 using this law 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.979
 then it has a sma in mg for what it is 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.979
 multi gpu 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:59.880
 the chart looks pretty good 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:02:03.090
 To and only to pay for our video continued 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.380
 She already fell to 63 fpf you saw that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.890
 already had a huge fall research the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.890
 average 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.700
 already dropped more 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:26.319
 Only the tx to what I perceive 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:31.310
 it leaves a blur effect it seems that 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.440
 to move from the image 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.230
 so I did not find it so beautiful, I 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.420
 also needed to pass the image and 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.280
 heavy as hell and will be ours on 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:47.780
 medium has already been waiting like that 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.400
 not going then 18 dropped another ten pieces 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.260
 awesome and will send there night there it goes 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:58.910
 drop every 10 years ps 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:01.609
 come rex now comes the the oppressed in 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.989
 oms here is one of the most 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:16.390
 that it exists at or sit at 6 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:16.390
 fps 60 together middle 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:30.990
 already dropped to 53 fell at the foot of fps is 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.550
 incredibly crash practically at a10 fp 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.990
 7 thousand 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:49.470
 now as extreme as utis 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:52.050
 the more in me this species is 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.330
 Thank you to play with the team. 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.700
 I 'm not obligated here I'm doing a 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.400
 video test people when I go to play 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.920
 I do not play bridges and that's because 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.020
 game is running below 60 fps and 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.480
 some conditions get bad for you 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.300
 play you can you imagine playing the game 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.600
 online case study where many people 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.310
 they'll be playing with graphics in the long 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.560
 neck theoretically they will be with 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.780
 performance better than ping 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.160
 on the internet of course why the servers 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.350
 are Americans 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.300
 and you're playing fellows in the mouchÃ£o 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.670
 because of the configuration systems 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.730
 so this varies from person to person 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.340
 if you want to play the game with the anti 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.020
 Heroes on high with low fps you can 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.000
 play 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.660
 it's not because you're running a neighborhood that 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.130
 and you will not play fla if 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.540
 someone talking is helping four 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.010
 tenth problem you're playing you 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.030
 I understand the story you are 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.840
 enjoying the game 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:59.190
 screw the rest and talk nonsense that 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:05:00.900
 you 're not running at most a good 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.480
 So you saw there that you fell a lot 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.480
 so let's go back to the place professed 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:19.080
 the game is very playable to 80 happy 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:32.979
 she's going to die the faster she's going to stay 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:35.370
 quick to kill anything else if 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.370
 to hide 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.960
 our guys do not die incredible 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.080
 Good people so it was this is a 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.960
 comparative video of the performance in the 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.240
 online environment of course you will 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.290
 realize the graphic difference this here 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.330
 Do you realize the eye more by using the 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.700
 print screen is for you to compare the 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.130
 images but the naked eye or you think 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.320
 note the difference really the difference 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.600
 that is in video unfortunately youtube 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.520
 already decreases the quality outside the 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.320
 The camera that I'm recording is right to 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.170
 lighting here also has a window in the 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.940
 my front that gets a little foggy 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.950
 the image of what I'm picking up 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.650
 monitor beauty but I hope you guys 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:40.240
 have liked the video try to understand 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.130
 people the game it's heavy if you try 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.660
 run the team if any 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:49.030
 crossfire mr configuration 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:52.660
 maybe you have to use it in a quad sl 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.370
 a crossfire coast quad to get 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.560
 to be playing the game with Messi's team 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.290
 up to 60 sa eff 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.360
 Why does the cross fail the game is? 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.040
 running below 60 fps 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.840
 but of course it's just you change a lot more 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.880
 You're not required to run with everything on 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.630
 Max wants to enjoy the game who has 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.780
 story 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:13.870
 Decrease Uncle Use Your Video Card 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.300
 she only has 1 giga not use very high 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:19.780
 because the game reversed to it uses a 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.460
 point two gigabytes of video memory 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.430
 that is, if you have a packet of 1 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.350
 giga will happen some light because the 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.410
 video card has no memory 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.520
 enough to handle and the textures of 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.020
 game envy and anger 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.210
 if you apply where there is more memory 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.090
 increases even more and how much 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:39.310
 the higher the resolution of the larger game will be 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.690
 the use of the video memory of your 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.670
 video card beauty 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.670
 A big hug to everyone and thanks.
