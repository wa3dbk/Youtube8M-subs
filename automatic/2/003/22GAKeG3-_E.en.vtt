years<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.149> years<00:02:01.209> for<00:02:01.750> anything<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.709> comes

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
years and years for anything that comes

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.169 
years and years for anything that comes
out<00:02:03.159> of<00:02:03.189> this<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.520> be<00:02:03.609> turn<00:02:03.819> into<00:02:04.000> something

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
out of this to be turn into something

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.910 
out of this to be turn into something
can<00:02:04.450> be<00:02:04.539> used<00:02:04.719> in<00:02:04.840> people<00:02:05.170> with<00:02:05.229> real<00:02:05.439> diseases

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
can be used in people with real diseases

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.160 
can be used in people with real diseases
the<00:02:06.549> goal<00:02:06.789> is<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.240> eventually<00:02:07.329> create<00:02:08.110> a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
the goal is to eventually create a

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.080 
the goal is to eventually create a
national<00:02:08.500> bank<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.160> stem<00:02:09.429> cells<00:02:09.759> that<00:02:10.000> could

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
national bank of stem cells that could

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.539 
national bank of stem cells that could
be<00:02:10.209> used<00:02:10.450> by<00:02:10.720> anyone<00:02:11.140> what<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.010> shows<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.280> that

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
be used by anyone what it shows is that

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.900 
be used by anyone what it shows is that
the<00:02:12.940> science<00:02:13.329> of<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.890> stem<00:02:14.890> cell<00:02:15.160> biology<00:02:15.190> is

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
the science of of stem cell biology is

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.509 
the science of of stem cell biology is
really<00:02:16.569> only<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:17.200> its<00:02:17.319> infancy<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:18.220> don't<00:02:18.340> know

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
really only in its infancy we don't know

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.830 
really only in its infancy we don't know
what<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.819> possibilities<00:02:19.209> could<00:02:19.540> be<00:02:19.599> we

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
what the possibilities could be we

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.319 
what the possibilities could be we
really<00:02:20.079> need<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.260> work<00:02:20.470> on<00:02:20.590> all<00:02:20.739> fronts<00:02:21.329> fronts

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
really need to work on all fronts fronts

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.059 
really need to work on all fronts fronts
that<00:02:22.360> today<00:02:22.870> make<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> turning<00:02:23.650> point<00:02:23.680> in

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
that today make a turning point in

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.630 
that today make a turning point in
scientific<00:02:24.879> discovery<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:27.310> big<00:02:27.610> news

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
scientific discovery it's big news

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.600 
scientific discovery it's big news
because<00:02:28.360> these<00:02:28.660> these<00:02:29.379> stem<00:02:29.980> cells<00:02:30.010> could

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
because these these stem cells could

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.869 
because these these stem cells could
give<00:02:30.819> us<00:02:31.590> 100,000<00:02:32.590> new<00:02:32.709> lines<00:02:33.010> which<00:02:33.670> would

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
give us 100,000 new lines which would

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.220 
give us 100,000 new lines which would
take<00:02:34.000> care<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.329> ninety-nine<00:02:34.750> percent<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:35.170> the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
take care of ninety-nine percent of the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.720 
take care of ninety-nine percent of the
american<00:02:35.290> population<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.190> that's<00:02:36.340> really

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
american population and that's really

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.490 
american population and that's really
important<00:02:37.239> Meredith<00:02:37.540> because<00:02:38.110> right<00:02:38.290> now<00:02:38.319> we

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
important Meredith because right now we

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.009 
important Meredith because right now we
only<00:02:38.739> have<00:02:38.890> 21<00:02:39.670> lines<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.660> other<00:02:40.750> cool

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
only have 21 lines and the other cool

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.990 
only have 21 lines and the other cool
thing<00:02:41.049> is<00:02:41.290> they<00:02:41.920> followed<00:02:42.280> these<00:02:42.430> cells<00:02:42.700> long

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
thing is they followed these cells long

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.220 
thing is they followed these cells long
enough<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.420> know<00:02:43.540> they<00:02:43.750> don't<00:02:43.930> turn<00:02:44.109> into

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
enough to know they don't turn into

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.319 
enough to know they don't turn into
cancers<00:02:44.769> they<00:02:44.889> don't<00:02:45.040> turn<00:02:45.190> into<00:02:45.340> tumors<00:02:45.790> this

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
cancers they don't turn into tumors this

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.670 
cancers they don't turn into tumors this
looks<00:02:46.720> like<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.019> going<00:02:47.109> to<00:02:47.200> be<00:02:47.260> very<00:02:47.290> safe

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
looks like it's going to be very safe

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.349 
looks like it's going to be very safe
technology<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.579> it<00:02:48.730> sounds<00:02:48.970> like<00:02:49.030> we<00:02:49.180> then

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
technology and it sounds like we then

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.030 
technology and it sounds like we then
avoid<00:02:49.720> all<00:02:49.870> those<00:02:50.019> ethical<00:02:50.440> questions<00:02:50.889> that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
avoid all those ethical questions that

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.920 
avoid all those ethical questions that
we<00:02:51.160> have<00:02:51.340> when<00:02:51.489> we<00:02:51.519> involve<00:02:52.120> embryos<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.840> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
we have when we involve embryos in the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.120 
we have when we involve embryos in the
process<00:02:53.260> yeah<00:02:53.349> this<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.650> interesting<00:02:53.980> women

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
process yeah this is interesting women

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.710 
process yeah this is interesting women
would<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.609> still<00:02:54.880> give<00:02:55.060> consent<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.569> say

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
would have to still give consent to say

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.360 
would have to still give consent to say
yes<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.139> course<00:02:56.349> use<00:02:56.500> my<00:02:56.680> fluid<00:02:56.980> or<00:02:57.069> use<00:02:57.190> the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
yes of course use my fluid or use the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.520 
yes of course use my fluid or use the
placenta<00:02:57.880> but<00:02:58.329> babies<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:58.959> still<00:02:59.170> be<00:02:59.319> born

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
placenta but babies can still be born

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.839 
placenta but babies can still be born
healthy<00:03:00.010> there's<00:03:00.280> not<00:03:00.459> going<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.609> be<00:03:00.670> any

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
healthy there's not going to be any

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.240 
healthy there's not going to be any
violation<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.690> fetuses<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.410> fluid<00:03:02.980> or

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
violation of fetuses it's fluid or

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.370 
violation of fetuses it's fluid or
placenta<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.630> it's<00:03:04.870> going<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.049> be<00:03:05.170> interesting

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
placenta so it's going to be interesting

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.559 
placenta so it's going to be interesting
to<00:03:05.739> see<00:03:05.889> how<00:03:06.040> this<00:03:06.250> sort<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.549> breaks<00:03:06.730> down<00:03:06.970> but

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
to see how this sort of breaks down but

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.690 
to see how this sort of breaks down but
as<00:03:07.750> for<00:03:08.019> ethical<00:03:08.410> charges<00:03:08.950> or<00:03:09.160> abortion

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
as for ethical charges or abortion

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.729 
as for ethical charges or abortion
charges<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.419> don't<00:03:10.810> see<00:03:10.989> how<00:03:11.109> that<00:03:11.260> surrounds

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
charges I don't see how that surrounds

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.470 
charges I don't see how that surrounds
this<00:03:11.859> at<00:03:12.040> all<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.370> then<00:03:12.609> somebody<00:03:12.819> married<00:03:13.299> to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
this at all and then somebody married to

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.990 
this at all and then somebody married to
a<00:03:13.510> man<00:03:14.139> with<00:03:14.380> ms<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:15.040> wanted<00:03:15.370> answers<00:03:15.700> yesterday

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
a man with ms I wanted answers yesterday

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.270 
a man with ms I wanted answers yesterday
will<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:16.840> probably<00:03:17.109> see<00:03:17.560> them<00:03:17.739> in<00:03:17.829> my<00:03:17.919> life<00:03:17.950> too

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
will I probably see them in my life too

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.500 
will I probably see them in my life too
you<00:03:18.370> know<00:03:18.609> what<00:03:18.700> everyone<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:19.060> being<00:03:19.299> very

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
you know what everyone is being very

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.449 
you know what everyone is being very
cautious<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:20.230> scientists<00:03:21.010> have<00:03:21.069> really<00:03:21.310> been

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
cautious the scientists have really been

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.280 
cautious the scientists have really been
quite<00:03:21.730> prudent<00:03:21.970> about<00:03:22.239> this<00:03:22.569> but<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:22.930> think

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
quite prudent about this but I think

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.270 
quite prudent about this but I think
this<00:03:23.380> is<00:03:23.500> going<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.709> happen<00:03:23.829> quite<00:03:24.220> quickly

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
this is going to happen quite quickly

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.830 
this is going to happen quite quickly
they're<00:03:25.120> going<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.269> start<00:03:25.389> to<00:03:25.540> grow<00:03:25.690> this

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
they're going to start to grow this

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.509 
they're going to start to grow this
they've<00:03:26.049> already<00:03:26.200> go<00:03:26.440> nerve<00:03:26.739> bone<00:03:27.220> and

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
they've already go nerve bone and

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.360 
they've already go nerve bone and
bladder<00:03:27.790> outside<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:29.349> human<00:03:29.919> body<00:03:30.040> and

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
bladder outside of a human body and

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.250 
bladder outside of a human body and
they've<00:03:30.579> done<00:03:30.760> implantation<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.690> think<00:03:32.169> you're

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
they've done implantation I think you're
