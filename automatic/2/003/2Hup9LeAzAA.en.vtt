00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
so in this video we'll have a look at

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.420 
so in this video we'll have a look at
five<00:00:14.959> steps<00:00:15.320> that<00:00:15.469> are<00:00:15.740> involved<00:00:16.160> with<00:00:16.309> the

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
five steps that are involved with the

again<00:00:22.940> we're<00:00:23.210> in<00:00:23.330> Savino<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:24.290> operators

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
again we're in Savino the operators

kingsroad one of the first points to
consider<00:00:30.500> when<00:00:31.000> restoring<00:00:32.000> an<00:00:32.390> antique<00:00:32.660> chest

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
consider when restoring an antique chest

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.380 
consider when restoring an antique chest
and<00:00:33.230> drawers<00:00:33.440> is<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.890> shrinkage<00:00:34.310> of<00:00:34.640> course

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
and drawers is the shrinkage of course

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.410 
and drawers is the shrinkage of course
wood<00:00:35.870> moves<00:00:36.500> over<00:00:36.860> time<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.970> veneers<00:00:38.300> that

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
wood moves over time the veneers that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.080 
wood moves over time the veneers that
sit<00:00:38.750> on<00:00:38.840> top<00:00:38.900> of<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.350> wood<00:00:39.470> also<00:00:40.070> move<00:00:40.310> in<00:00:40.970> a

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
sit on top of the wood also move in a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.970 
sit on top of the wood also move in a
different<00:00:41.450> way<00:00:41.630> to<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:42.140> wood<00:00:42.320> that<00:00:42.860> is

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
different way to the wood that is

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.520 
different way to the wood that is
sitting<00:00:43.160> underneath<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.200> two<00:00:45.410> of

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
sitting underneath it and so the two of

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.400 
sitting underneath it and so the two of
them<00:00:45.710> can<00:00:46.250> actually<00:00:46.540> start<00:00:47.540> cracking<00:00:48.140> start

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
them can actually start cracking start

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.550 
them can actually start cracking start
moving<00:00:49.060> etc<00:00:50.060> so<00:00:50.210> shrinkage<00:00:50.750> is<00:00:50.989> one<00:00:51.350> of<00:00:51.470> the

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
moving etc so shrinkage is one of the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.799 
moving etc so shrinkage is one of the
first<00:00:51.800> problems<00:00:52.329> that<00:00:53.329> needs<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.780> be

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
first problems that needs to be

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.080 
first problems that needs to be
addressed<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:54.500> that's<00:00:54.739> why<00:00:55.040> with<00:00:55.760> antique

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
addressed and that's why with antique

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.690 
addressed and that's why with antique
chests<00:00:56.660> when<00:00:57.020> you<00:00:57.200> move<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:58.130> actual<00:00:58.460> drawer

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
chests when you move the actual drawer

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.520 
chests when you move the actual drawer
sometimes<00:00:59.300> they<00:00:59.510> can<00:00:59.690> become<00:00:59.870> sort<00:01:00.230> of<00:01:00.290> a<00:01:00.350> bit

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
sometimes they can become sort of a bit

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.209 
sometimes they can become sort of a bit
hard<00:01:00.770> to<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.640> move<00:01:01.820> into<00:01:02.090> pull<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.630> push<00:01:03.410> to

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.219 
hard to to move into pull and push to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:08.740 
hard to to move into pull and push to
push<00:01:04.430> forward<00:01:05.049> a<00:01:06.049> second<00:01:06.650> thing<00:01:07.630> after<00:01:08.630> the

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
push forward a second thing after the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.200 
push forward a second thing after the
the<00:01:09.080> shrinkage<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.830> address<00:01:10.130> is<00:01:10.490> the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
the shrinkage to address is the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.570 
the shrinkage to address is the
blistering<00:01:11.870> of<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.350> name<00:01:12.620> as<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:13.100> mentioned

is stand upside down what we see here is
actually<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.040> lower<00:02:22.250> rail<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.790> chest<00:02:23.120> of

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
actually the lower rail of the chest of

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.020 
actually the lower rail of the chest of
drawers<00:02:23.570> which<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.410> exactly<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.280> area<00:02:25.610> where

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
drawers which is exactly the area where

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.020 
drawers which is exactly the area where
you<00:02:26.120> expect<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.750> be<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.860> most<00:02:28.100> where<00:02:28.400> you

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
you expect it to be the most where you

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.390 
you expect it to be the most where you
see<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.360> chipping<00:02:29.840> of<00:02:30.320> veneering<00:02:30.920> wood<00:02:31.130> here

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
see the chipping of veneering wood here

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.930 
see the chipping of veneering wood here
is<00:02:31.580> basically<00:02:32.150> very<00:02:32.480> basically<00:02:33.140> due<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
is basically very basically due to the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.840 
is basically very basically due to the
cleaning<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.380> particular<00:02:36.620> rooms<00:02:37.520> in

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
cleaning of the particular rooms in

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.780 
cleaning of the particular rooms in
which<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.780> particular<00:02:39.620> piece<00:02:39.980> would<00:02:40.640> have

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
which this particular piece would have

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.020 
which this particular piece would have
stood<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.470> literally<00:02:42.470> hitting<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.670> bottom

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
stood and literally hitting the bottom

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.540 
stood and literally hitting the bottom
of<00:02:44.240> these<00:02:44.420> pieces<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:45.020> furniture<00:02:45.200> with<00:02:45.800> with<00:02:46.520> a

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
of these pieces of furniture with with a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.970 
of these pieces of furniture with with a
brush<00:02:46.850> with<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> stick<00:02:47.480> or<00:02:47.660> more<00:02:48.320> recently<00:02:48.740> with

brush with a stick or more recently with
with<00:02:49.910> hoover's<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.020> those<00:02:51.800> are<00:02:52.250> often<00:02:52.430> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
with hoover's so those are often the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.690 
with hoover's so those are often the
areas<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.120> need<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.960> be<00:02:54.280> mostly<00:02:55.280> addressed

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
areas that need to be mostly addressed

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.550 
areas that need to be mostly addressed
and<00:02:55.970> then<00:02:56.330> Step<00:02:56.570> five<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.110> furniture

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
and then Step five and furniture

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.030 
and then Step five and furniture
restoration<00:02:57.710> is<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.660> addressing<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.650> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
restoration is the addressing of the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.100 
restoration is the addressing of the
actual<00:03:01.460> top<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.210> piece<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.690> course<00:03:02.900> one

actual top of the piece of course one

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.250 
actual top of the piece of course one
can<00:03:03.290> imagine<00:03:03.500> on<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.400> top<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.780> pieces<00:03:06.140> of

can imagine on the top of the pieces of
furniture<00:03:06.440> that's<00:03:07.310> exactly<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.000> area<00:03:08.330> that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
furniture that's exactly the area that

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.670 
furniture that's exactly the area that
gets<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.990> most<00:03:09.190> usage<00:03:10.190> by<00:03:10.760> putting<00:03:11.090> pieces<00:03:11.510> on

gets the most usage by putting pieces on

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.199 
gets the most usage by putting pieces on
top<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.740> it<00:03:13.120> moist<00:03:14.120> or<00:03:15.020> wet<00:03:15.080> vases<00:03:16.010> or<00:03:16.610> objects

that<00:03:17.900> might<00:03:18.080> be<00:03:18.140> scratches<00:03:18.800> etcetera<00:03:19.370> so

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
that might be scratches etcetera so

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.540 
that might be scratches etcetera so
that's<00:03:19.760> sort<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.270> fifth<00:03:20.540> area<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:22.010> the

that's sort of a fifth area that the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.410 
that's sort of a fifth area that the
restorers<00:03:23.500> address<00:03:24.500> in<00:03:24.770> probably<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.239> most

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
restorers address in probably the most
