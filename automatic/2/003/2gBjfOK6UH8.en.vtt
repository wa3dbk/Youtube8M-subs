 [Music] 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.940
 hello today we are going to do a mini tutorial 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.340
 give smiles 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.350
 we're going to need a rectangle of 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.289
 cardboard of 14 x 27 centimeters 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.970
 ruler 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.550
 diurex pencil scissors 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.140
 and what you want to decorate good what 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.750
 first thing we're going to do is take 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.000
 our rectangle in this way and let's 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.910
 to mark at nine centimeters by the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.790
 two sides having the sheet or cardboard 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.379
 in this way we are going to join the points 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:52.089
 but with a line that is not straight but as if 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.089
 were seams in this way 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.410
 Now what you are going to do is take another 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.380
 time your rule and you're going to put this 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.780
 shape and you're going to mark every three 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.460
 centimeters until the sheet ends 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.950
 above and below our sheet 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.799
 Now what we are going to do is the same 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.580
 what we did before joining the points with the 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.470
 same technique as sewing now what 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.560
 what you are going to do is take your rule and 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.700
 fold down the dotted part towards 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.700
 in and out 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.340
 [Music] 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.100
 and now what you're going to do is cut 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.740
 each of the squares rather 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.500
 rectangles by the dotted part with 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.720
 your scissors or your cutter 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.740
 since you do not have that, you are going to draw 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.180
 smiles in each of the rectangles 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.690
 [Music] 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.210
 and now you're going to put the phrase take a 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.210
 smile and in parentheses are free 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.899
 now you are going to take your diurex and go to 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.060
 put a fair bit above the 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.009
 dotted part so that at the moment 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.340
 Pull the smile do not come to them with 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.550
 everything and the paper and only decorates it as 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.670
 you more as you please and nothing and can 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.160
 paste in your room or at the door 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.890
 your room that is where I recommend you 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.319
 to stick it and well if you do this 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.390

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.799
 would be stuck on our door sorry 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.190
 and well, this is just a draft 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:39.910
 that I did and to take measures and to 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.120
 to see how the sign looks and now 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.459
 You'll see that just by seeing your sign and 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.190
 read it the people are going to get a 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.019
 smile and then if you want to take it 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.750
 you just have to pull this part 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.019
 and you're done with a sandwich 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.780
