00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
arrow cannon or machine gun or whatever

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.320 
arrow cannon or machine gun or whatever
you<00:00:10.740> want<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.920> call<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:11.340> this<00:00:11.460> just<00:00:12.059> shoot

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
you want to call it but this just shoot

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.240 
you want to call it but this just shoot
arrows<00:00:12.660> really<00:00:13.469> quickly<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.860> as<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.070> see

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
arrows really quickly and as you see

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.560 
arrows really quickly and as you see
from<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.490> first<00:00:14.700> bit<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.000> may<00:00:15.120> look<00:00:15.269> like<00:00:15.330> you

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
from the first bit it may look like you

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.670 
from the first bit it may look like you
just<00:00:15.599> put<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.279> lever<00:00:17.279> behind<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.270> actual

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
just put a lever behind the actual

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.980 
just put a lever behind the actual
dispenser<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.730> not<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.510> you

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
dispenser but this not like that so you

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.810 
dispenser but this not like that so you
will<00:00:22.109> note<00:00:22.230> place<00:00:22.439> your<00:00:22.619> dispenser<00:00:23.250> facing

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
will note place your dispenser facing

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.160 
will note place your dispenser facing
the<00:00:23.910> way<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.090> want<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.390> shoot<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> arrows

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
the way you want to shoot the arrows

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.420 
the way you want to shoot the arrows
like<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:25.590> here<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> be

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
like I do here so it's going to be

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.310 
like I do here so it's going to be
facing<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:27.000> way<00:00:27.060> too<00:00:27.269> that's<00:00:28.050> where<00:00:28.230> your

facing this way too that's where your

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.050 
facing this way too that's where your
arrows<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.710> going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:28.980> shooting<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.760> then

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
arrows are going to be shooting and then

arrows are going to be shooting and then
you<00:00:30.330> want<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.660> dip<00:00:31.140> free<00:00:32.040> by<00:00:32.520> four<00:00:32.880> behind<00:00:33.570> it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
you want to dip free by four behind it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.600 
you want to dip free by four behind it
as<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.260> I'm<00:00:34.350> doing<00:00:34.620> now<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:35.160> shown<00:00:35.579> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
two well one away from the edge you want

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.470 
two well one away from the edge you want
to<00:01:02.250> put<00:01:02.399> two<00:01:02.579> blocks<00:01:02.879> doesn't<00:01:03.210> matter<00:01:03.329> which

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
to put two blocks doesn't matter which

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.390 
to put two blocks doesn't matter which
block<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> put<00:01:05.250> two

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
block is but you just have to put two

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.560 
block is but you just have to put two

blocks then you want to wire up the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.460 
blocks then you want to wire up the
circuit<00:01:09.570> thing<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.900> i'm<00:01:10.080> doing<00:01:10.260> with

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
circuit thing like i'm doing with

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.340 
circuit thing like i'm doing with
redstone<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:12.000> four<00:01:12.479> redstone<00:01:12.900> torches

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
redstone and with four redstone torches

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.990

and then you want to place one in the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.910 
and then you want to place one in the
middle<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.229> want<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> destroy<00:01:16.770> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
middle and you want to destroy this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.770 
middle and you want to destroy this
block<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> place<00:01:17.490> one<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.600> see

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
block and place one there as you see

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960 
block and place one there as you see
this<00:01:18.960> part<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.439> where<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:20.009> placed<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
this part here where I placed it in the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.999 
this part here where I placed it in the
wall<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> make<00:01:22.650> multiple

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
wall if you want to make multiple

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.630 
wall if you want to make multiple
shooters<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.509> dig<00:01:24.689> holes<00:01:25.409> next<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
shooters you just dig holes next to the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.580 
shooters you just dig holes next to the
one<00:01:26.790> I've<00:01:27.150> actually<00:01:27.330> placed<00:01:27.750> into<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> wall

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
one I've actually placed into the wall

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.850 
one I've actually placed into the wall
so<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.579> guys<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:30.110> do<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.560> about

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so you guys can do that and have about

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.310 
so you guys can do that and have about
like<00:01:32.070> six<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.640> row<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.170> keep

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
like six in a row and it will just keep

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.649 
like six in a row and it will just keep
shooting<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.950> you'll<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> gist<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
shooting but you'll you get the gist of

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.960 
shooting but you'll you get the gist of
this<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.680> got<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> couple<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.310> there<00:01:38.520> so

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
this like it's got a couple in there so
