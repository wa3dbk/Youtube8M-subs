00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
the the ownership of the Internet so

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.780 
the the ownership of the Internet so
let's<00:04:37.290> say<00:04:37.500> like<00:04:37.680> China<00:04:38.040> or<00:04:38.460> something<00:04:38.670> like

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
let's say like China or something like

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.130 
let's say like China or something like
that<00:04:38.850> takes<00:04:39.300> it<00:04:39.420> over<00:04:41.570> things<00:04:42.570> such<00:04:42.870> like

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
that takes it over things such like

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.500 
that takes it over things such like
Google<00:04:43.590> Chrome<00:04:43.770> Internet<00:04:44.400> Explorer<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.330> so

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
Google Chrome Internet Explorer and so

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.190 
Google Chrome Internet Explorer and so
forth<00:04:45.810> aren't<00:04:46.260> going<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.800> be<00:04:46.980> of<00:04:47.820> any<00:04:48.780> good<00:04:49.020> to

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
forth aren't going to be of any good to

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.930 
forth aren't going to be of any good to
you

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940
