why<00:04:01.920> it's<00:04:02.220> just<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.460> matter<00:04:02.640> of<00:04:02.730> two<00:04:02.970> strings

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
why it's just a matter of two strings

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.900 
why it's just a matter of two strings
but<00:04:03.980> looks<00:04:04.980> like<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.220> got<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.400> do<00:04:05.490> it<00:04:05.610> manually

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
but looks like you got to do it manually

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.830

and as before the rear seat base extends

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.600 
and as before the rear seat base extends
forward<00:04:13.110> so<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.830> back<00:04:13.980> seats<00:04:14.280> fall

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
forward so the back seats fall

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.920
