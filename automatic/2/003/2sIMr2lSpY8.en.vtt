00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 it was time for you to know the 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.689
 misterito the man of science fell 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.689
 I loved a grandchild 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.920
 very good since I am very honored to 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.750
 have teporaca hear we already saw the work 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.860
 is excellent, thank you and they leave me 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.630
 that in your preparation 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.180
 you were here a lot in the city 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.250
 of Mexico and you were cycling 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.080
 that went everywhere on bicycles and 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.120
 It is very good also for the exercise 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.769
 but in the anthill we also wanted 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.070
 do something with bikes with wheels 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:42.989
 good to create science are you ready that 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.989
 between please the science team 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 brothers cheek what he's going to do 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.940
 let's prove something physical 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.310
 which is very interesting for a lot 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.560
 Attention to what we have here is 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.450
 known as a gyroscope is worth what 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.000
 unique that is a wheel that is 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 connected with these cables these cables 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.790
 chairs plus rope ok and if you turn not 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.409
 nothing happens 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:22.079
 ok what would happen if I cut one of these 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.030
 what would happen if I imagine if the law of 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.890
 gravity does not fail us is something that 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.259
 happen but there to the law of gravity 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.750
 another law is opposed to it now 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.670
 let's see if there is a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.849
 appeal to exactly there is a 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.429
 fight out there what we're going to do what 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:44.819
 next one is more help me the two I 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.549
 I'm going to sustain they add tour it and you we 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.610
 we will help cut the cords their 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.149
 caravans stockings one - sided 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.489
 come who carries it more than start 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:02.740
 they want to beat out there will force the 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:07.090
 rooster come 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.090
 no longer serve you anything else 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.810
 this happens what is called moment 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.430
 angular in physics there are three types of 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.950
 moments ok 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.390
 angular moment linear moment the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.610
 uncomfortable moment when you see me in the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.040
 experiments 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.040
 It is true 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.159
 from the most like a tree until its 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.950
 moment that was the angular momentum is the 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.579
 resistance of a body to l'aquila la 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.790
 rotation 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.040
 ok and here what is happening is that that 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.680
 angular momentum is opposed to the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.630
 gravity and when it's spinning it 's what 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.380
 compensate 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.250
 now that the rotation goes back to the 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.250
 gravity and let's go 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.840
 in the resistance to change the rotation 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.550
 perfect, that's the angular moment and 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.250
 now the mind on this side 6 because 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.170
 let's let's keep playing with this 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.740
 for something very funny that enters by 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.740
 favor in man 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.590
 d 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.690
 here on this side by the name of black 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.460
 cantinflea with eyes 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.680
 that we have never seen them before 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.680
 but he has not opened his eyes 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.600
 please or that low for this needs 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.780
 Please help me with one foot 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.580
 cited here in the center is clear with the 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.590
 another journey levels said its neighbor 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.890
 because if I do not know how this does not have a 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.890
 base 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:01.440
 is behind me this means that almost 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.810
 all we are going to do is that with this 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.200
 apparatus let's create the rotation for 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.320
 the rim ok and what is going to be a magician is 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.690
 hold the wheel and let's change the 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.820
 angular moment is to say you are going to turn 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.620
 the wheel and you're going to check how you're going to 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.290
 turn on your own axis 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.560
 only by moving the wheel or the 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:27.270
 feet that you love when you dance 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.630
 exactly when it dances crisis over 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.100
 all 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:36.060
 he said he will continue teaching his little son 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.060
 ride a bike 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:45.400
 do not drop your son 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.400
 when you feel the right speed 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.750
 look 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.750
 and so much 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.569
 concrete 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.430
 removes it from the rope 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.970
 but if we are going to see a lot of fun 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.560
 I try it with my hand and I would like 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.550
 back do not make the man in black 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.550
 I brake him with my tongue 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.660
 then, taking up this, it happens that 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:33.180
 renting it changes the angular momentum of 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.180
 the wheel and that's why it turns on 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.090
 Mrs 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.419
 ah 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.419
 here
