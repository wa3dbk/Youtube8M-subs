00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and I don't really like that part of it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.160 
and I don't really like that part of it
but<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.430> do<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> chose<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.600> duration

but I do like to chose you the duration

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
but I do like to chose you the duration
in<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.830> tenth<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.310> second<00:01:35.700> here<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.970> go<00:01:36.090> you

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
in the tenth of a second here you go you

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.420 
in the tenth of a second here you go you
see<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.510> now<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> shock<00:01:37.860> wave<00:01:38.130> I

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
see that now because of the shock wave I

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.500 
see that now because of the shock wave I
like<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.920> bar<00:01:41.159> thing<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.150> much<00:01:42.299> I

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
like that the bar thing not so much I

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.789 
like that the bar thing not so much I
could<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.780> how<00:01:42.900> it<00:01:42.990> could<00:01:43.110> help<00:01:43.200> new<00:01:43.439> players

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.630 
noticed this I hadn't read anything
about<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> notes<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.829> don't<00:02:05.340> know

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
about it on the notes I don't know

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.419 
about it on the notes I don't know
exactly<00:02:06.270> how<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.900> work<00:02:07.100> but<00:02:08.100> how<00:02:08.399> I

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
exactly how it's going to work but how I

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.490 
exactly how it's going to work but how I
think<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.299> going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.570> work<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.049> this<00:02:10.320> is

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
think that it's going to work is this is

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.770 
think that it's going to work is this is
a<00:02:10.649> passive<00:02:11.160> ability<00:02:11.519> all<00:02:11.760> races<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.570> classes

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
a passive ability all races and classes

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.380 
a passive ability all races and classes
have<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.549> when<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.700> deal<00:02:14.880> damage<00:02:15.120> to

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
have this when you deal damage to

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.900 
have this when you deal damage to
another<00:02:15.600> player<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:16.680> battle<00:02:17.280> they<00:02:17.549> receive<00:02:17.850> a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
another player in battle they receive a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.479 
another player in battle they receive a
15-percent<00:02:18.660> reduced<00:02:19.010> healing<00:02:20.010> or<00:02:20.310> less

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
15-percent reduced healing or less

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.000 
15-percent reduced healing or less
healing<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:22.110> think<00:02:22.410> that's<00:02:22.560> gonna<00:02:22.709> stack

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
healing and I think that's gonna stack

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.560 
healing and I think that's gonna stack
on<00:02:23.190> top<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.400> mortal<00:02:23.760> start<00:02:24.000> d<00:02:24.120> buffs<00:02:24.329> and<00:02:24.450> I

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
on top of mortal start d buffs and I

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.759 
on top of mortal start d buffs and I
think<00:02:24.780> that's<00:02:24.930> close<00:02:25.140> its<00:02:25.320> way<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.530> saying

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
think that's close its way of saying

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.800 
think that's close its way of saying
healing<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.579> a<00:02:26.610> little<00:02:26.940> bit<00:02:27.060> overpowered<00:02:27.600> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
healing is a little bit overpowered and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.009 
healing is a little bit overpowered and
this<00:02:28.019> is<00:02:28.139> what's<00:02:28.350> gonna<00:02:28.470> fix<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.489> PvP<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.359> I

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
this is what's gonna fix it in PvP and I

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.320 
this is what's gonna fix it in PvP and I
like<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.380> idea<00:02:31.709> i<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.310> that's<00:02:32.489> cool

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
like that idea i think that's cool
