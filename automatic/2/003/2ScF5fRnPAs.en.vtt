00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.620 
I get on the game and I think right
actually<00:01:53.490> no<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.119> how<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.299> want<00:01:54.540> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
actually no this is how I want this

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179 
actually no this is how I want this
house<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> go<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.380> plans<00:01:55.619> out<00:01:55.799> differently

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
house to go and it plans out differently

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.249 
house to go and it plans out differently
to<00:01:56.310> how<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.360> intended<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.930> which<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.200> really

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
to how I intended it which is really

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.850 
to how I intended it which is really
good<00:01:58.619> because<00:01:58.680> um<00:01:59.479> otherwise<00:02:00.479> my<00:02:01.079> imagination

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
good because um otherwise my imagination

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.399 
good because um otherwise my imagination
would<00:02:01.950> be<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.219> limited<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.140> but<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.259> does

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
would be really limited so but it does

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.319 
would be really limited so but it does
mean<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.680> some<00:02:05.310> things<00:02:05.579> in<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> wrote

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
mean that some things in the one I wrote

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.229 
mean that some things in the one I wrote
when<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.979> do<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> video<00:02:08.340> by<00:02:08.849> actually

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
when I do it in the video by actually

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.729 
when I do it in the video by actually
playing<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.810> sims<00:02:10.080> 4<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.410> recording

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
playing the sims 4 and recording

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.600 
playing the sims 4 and recording
everything<00:02:10.950> so

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
everything so

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.880 
everything so
x<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:12.180> can<00:02:12.330> tell<00:02:12.630> when<00:02:12.990> i'm<00:02:13.110> thinking<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:13.830> i

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
x you can tell when i'm thinking what i

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.770 
x you can tell when i'm thinking what i
need<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.190> do<00:02:14.400> next<00:02:14.580> what<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.270> put<00:02:15.450> then<00:02:15.600> you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
need to do next what I can put then you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.570 
need to do next what I can put then you
can<00:02:15.930> tell<00:02:16.200> when<00:02:16.860> I've<00:02:17.010> plan<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.430> do<00:02:17.550> something

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
can tell when I've plan to do something

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.330 
can tell when I've plan to do something
or<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.540> mean<00:02:19.020> sometimes<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.740> obvious

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
or I mean sometimes it's just obvious

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.250 
or I mean sometimes it's just obvious
isn't<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.670> like<00:02:20.910> what<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.690> should<00:02:21.840> put<00:02:22.050> where

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
isn't it like what you should put where

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.480 
isn't it like what you should put where
and<00:02:22.290> other<00:02:22.620> times<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.040> really<00:02:23.340> confusing

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
and other times it's really confusing

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.340 
and other times it's really confusing
and<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.240> have<00:02:24.390> loads<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.660> choices<00:02:24.930> and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
and you have loads of choices and

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.590 
and you have loads of choices and
sometimes<00:02:25.770> nothing<00:02:26.250> really<00:02:26.460> works<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:27.030> with

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
sometimes nothing really works like with

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.480 
sometimes nothing really works like with
the<00:02:27.720> roof<00:02:27.930> here<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.500> had<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.710> lot<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.920> problems

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
the roof here I had a lot of problems

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.890 
the roof here I had a lot of problems
with<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.820> roof<00:02:30.060> trying<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.570> figure<00:02:30.810> all<00:02:30.870> that

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
with the roof trying to figure all that

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.130 
with the roof trying to figure all that
out<00:02:31.080> but<00:02:31.440> i<00:02:31.500> think<00:02:31.740> i'm<00:02:31.860> booking<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:33.140> anyway

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
out but i think i'm booking and anyway

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.680 
out but i think i'm booking and anyway
yeah<00:02:34.290> there's<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.560> lot<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:35.090> kind<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.150> fountains

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
yeah there's a lot of kind of fountains

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.380 
yeah there's a lot of kind of fountains
in<00:02:37.070> this<00:02:38.070> house<00:02:38.250> as<00:02:38.459> well<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.180> made<00:02:39.360> it

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
in this house as well so that made it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.380 
in this house as well so that made it
look<00:02:39.510> really<00:02:39.870> modern<00:02:40.940> also<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.060> video<00:02:42.300> is

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
look really modern also this video is

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.720 
look really modern also this video is
really<00:02:42.660> short<00:02:43.020> because<00:02:43.500> obviously<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.610> was

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
really short because obviously I was

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.820 
really short because obviously I was
only<00:02:44.820> doing<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> exterior<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.650> made

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
only doing the exterior and if I made

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.930 
only doing the exterior and if I made
any<00:02:46.860> longer<00:02:47.370> i<00:02:47.400> think<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.730> would<00:02:47.820> have<00:02:47.910> just

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
any longer i think it would have just

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.320 
any longer i think it would have just
been<00:02:48.120> really<00:02:48.720> dull<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.590> watch<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.850> we're

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
been really dull to watch it like we're

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.870 
been really dull to watch it like we're
over<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.750> really<00:02:52.020> long<00:02:52.200> period<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.680> time<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.850> i

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
over a really long period of time so i

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.340 
over a really long period of time so i
think<00:02:54.120> i've<00:02:54.209> got<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.450> right<00:02:54.570> speed<00:02:54.870> here<00:02:55.140> but

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
think i've got the right speed here but

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.350 
think i've got the right speed here but
if<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.950> think<00:02:56.160> it's<00:02:56.280> too<00:02:56.459> fast<00:02:56.670> then<00:02:57.030> let<00:02:57.270> me

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
if you think it's too fast then let me

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.479 
if you think it's too fast then let me
know<00:02:58.550> so<00:02:59.550> yeah<00:02:59.730> anyway<00:03:00.120> um<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.280> pretty
