00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.249
 with this expression we have wanted 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.779
 reflect from the collection 

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:11.050
 permanent in a phenomenon that we could 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.260
 call contemporary that is different 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.689
 of the current is different from the present and 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.880
 is already in instruments make up an idea 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.980
 historical that is the contemporary and 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.900
 when it appears we can say that what 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.510
 contemporary begins at the end of the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.180
 70 there are a series of key moments like 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.690
 is 89 the fall of the berlin wall in 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.149
 the invention of the discovery of 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.829
 internet in the 91 the iraq war and 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.370
 also the dismemberment of the union 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.260
 Soviet and 2001 specifically we have 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.320
 thoughtful has wanted to reflect 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.000
 about the 80s and 90s in the 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.070
 which somehow create the foundations 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.809
 of what is the current moment that is 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.420
 fundamental to know where we come from 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.420
 where are we and where can we go 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.129
 are the elements that define this 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.989
 period on the one hand the interest in what 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.900
 which is called post- media interest 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.930
 for an art that is no longer focused on 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.290
 a specific medium as was the high 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.050
 modernity of the 50s nor nor 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.899
 is marked by an opposition to this 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.030
 medium but it is an art that works 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.060
 with a transversality perspective 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.720
 a perspective in which all 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.640
 means can be used in a work 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.979
 which is an open work and this is the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.810
 second aspect that must be 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.570
 completed by the viewer therefore 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.479
 we went from an art centered on the author 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.819
 in the first half of the century to an art 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.819
 where the viewer is very important 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.680
 the works obviously being a sample 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.220
 made from the collection works 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.650
 they would say that 90% of the collection of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.750
 that 90 to another 90 are unpublished works 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.400
 works that have not been seen so far 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.530
 because they have been buying lately 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.790
 for him or acquiring for the museum and 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.830
 then 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.750
 from this network work that is 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.040
 doing the museum with others 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.490
 European institutions are 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.130
 Latin American countries there are agreements 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.830
 deposit collaboration specifically there 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.000
 three works that are part of this 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.370
 project that is called the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.770
 international that has a grant 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.230
 with sponsorship with funding from the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.090
 European community but not time the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.910
 European Union itself asks us to 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.040
 there is this collaboration and therefore there 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.050
 three extraordinary works of the Museum of 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.870
 funk to see news yemen line hoven and a 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.940
 piece of magma that are part of this 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.440
 network that is called European the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.420
 international 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.510
 the exhibition is organized in three 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.540
 scopes a first scope that of some 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.740
 mode would be the matrix where it is defined 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.770
 four aspects that are important for 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.060
 understand the rest of the production 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.130
 one has to do with the importance of 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.830
 photography in the 80s the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.130
 importance of the document other the return 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.380
 to the board the return to the genre to the 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.980
 fine arts tradition for artists 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.050
 who want to work in a way 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.590
 contemporary but in his giving up a 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:25.130
 to a tradition the third aspect has 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.260
 what to see with the image the image as 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.110
 element built as element to 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.940
 starting from common given from which 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.300
 the artist works and finally how 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.210
 make a radical art in an era in the 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:46.090
 which the art institution has become 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.090
 hegemonic as the case of my languages
