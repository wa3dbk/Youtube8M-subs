blacks<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:43.040> sharp<00:02:43.730> whites<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:44.810> going<00:02:44.930> to

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
sensors aperture rating and it actually

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.270 
sensors aperture rating and it actually
gives<00:03:44.060> you<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.239> better<00:03:44.750> low-light<00:03:45.470> picture

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
gives you a better low-light picture

gives you a better low-light picture
that<00:03:46.640> seems<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:46.910> be<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.060> lot<00:03:47.300> less<00:03:47.660> washed<00:03:47.989> out

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290

that seems to be a lot less washed out
again<00:03:48.890> comparing<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.610> cameras<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.120> like

comparing<00:03:50.840> apples<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.380> apples<00:03:51.470> you're<00:03:51.980> pretty

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
comparing apples to apples you're pretty

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.789 
comparing apples to apples you're pretty
much<00:03:52.400> on<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.820> exact<00:03:53.420> same<00:03:53.630> level<00:03:54.079> now<00:03:54.470> as<00:03:54.650> far

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
much on the exact same level now as far

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.740 
much on the exact same level now as far
as<00:03:54.920> features<00:03:55.100> go<00:03:55.489> of<00:03:55.820> course<00:03:56.209> we<00:03:56.390> all<00:03:56.480> know<00:03:56.510> the

through<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.430> day<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:14.360> other<00:04:14.540> big<00:04:14.780> thing<00:04:15.049> is

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
through the day the other big thing is

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.620 
through the day the other big thing is
adding<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.680> microSD<00:04:16.640> card<00:04:16.970> now<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.390> thought

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
adding a microSD card now I thought

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.080 
adding a microSD card now I thought
great<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.959> 16<00:04:18.530> gigabyte<00:04:18.739> phone<00:04:19.400> I'll<00:04:19.760> just

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
great a 16 gigabyte phone I'll just

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.330 
great a 16 gigabyte phone I'll just
double<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.630> I'll<00:04:20.810> triple<00:04:21.200> all<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:21.440> had<00:04:21.560> a<00:04:21.590> 32<00:04:22.070> gig

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
double it I'll triple all I had a 32 gig

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.300 
double it I'll triple all I had a 32 gig
or<00:04:22.580> even<00:04:22.910> up<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.120> 64<00:04:23.630> gig<00:04:23.660> micro<00:04:24.050> SD<00:04:24.500> card<00:04:24.770> but

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
or even up to a 64 gig micro SD card but

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.490 
or even up to a 64 gig micro SD card but
the<00:04:25.520> trick<00:04:25.820> is<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.900> can't<00:04:27.200> put<00:04:27.410> your

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
the trick is you can't put your

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.529 
the trick is you can't put your
applications<00:04:28.160> on<00:04:28.280> there<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.610> micro<00:04:29.060> SD<00:04:29.330> card

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
applications on there the micro SD card

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.790 
applications on there the micro SD card
is<00:04:29.660> only<00:04:29.810> gonna<00:04:29.930> be<00:04:30.050> about<00:04:30.140> as<00:04:30.350> good<00:04:30.530> as

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
is only gonna be about as good as

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.360 
is only gonna be about as good as
storing<00:04:31.490> pictures<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.240> video<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.110> music<00:04:33.370> now

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
storing pictures and video and music now

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.969 
storing pictures and video and music now
the<00:04:34.460> next<00:04:34.520> big<00:04:35.000> concern<00:04:35.479> is<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.930> battery<00:04:36.410> now

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
the next big concern is the battery now

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.650 
the next big concern is the battery now
I<00:04:37.010> know<00:04:37.130> smartphones<00:04:37.820> use<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.150> tremendous

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
I know smartphones use a tremendous

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.820 
I know smartphones use a tremendous
amount<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:38.960> battery<00:04:39.260> no<00:04:39.410> matter<00:04:39.590> what

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
amount of battery no matter what

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.690 
amount of battery no matter what

a<00:04:49.039> little<00:04:49.280> bit<00:04:49.460> better<00:04:49.669> battery<00:04:50.180> life<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.450> the

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
a little bit better battery life and the

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.940 
a little bit better battery life and the
way<00:04:50.660> i<00:04:50.690> tested<00:04:51.140> it<00:04:51.200> was<00:04:51.380> I<00:04:51.590> played<00:04:52.130> movies<00:04:52.610> on
