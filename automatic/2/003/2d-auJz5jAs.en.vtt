efficiency<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.209> nuclear<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:57.600> there's<00:02:57.930> a

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
efficiency of the nuclear so there's a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.820 
efficiency of the nuclear so there's a

nine coefficient of drag and that really

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.380 
nine coefficient of drag and that really
