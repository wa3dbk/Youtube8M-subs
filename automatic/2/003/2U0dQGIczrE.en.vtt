00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.690
 family salad salad called 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.570
 Russian 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.039
 for making salad we need 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.029
 1 herring 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:17.930
 salty 1 potato and onion apple 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:20.410
 half lemon mustard and 4 tablespoons 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.820
 spoons of vegetable oil 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.430
 you can take a potato just from 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.820
 me potatoes are not very many peels and 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.920
 Insure boiled 2 2 small 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:38.180
 common linden one normal potato 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:42.430
 clear also do not clean the onion so that 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.440
 then we clean we will just cut 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.040
 Now let's start the edge of our deal 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.020
 herring 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.500
 I do not pretend how to just want 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.010
 share with you how i do it now 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.590
 I'm still out of the box and also 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.590
 I met this name not only Russian 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.129
 salad salad called as german 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.039
 Salad such a contrast is often served in 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.649
 Russian cuisine restaurants 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:13.130
 here's your password and abdomen cut off your head 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:16.249
 extract the insides very often when 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.139
 brushing fish which generally do not hang on 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:20.139
 in the kitchen I put a bag on my arm 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:29.439
 behold and where the fin is left 

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:32.479
 legs check for 2 halves cleaning 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:41.319
 bones basically and that kind of glass from that 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:44.359
 fin and bone rib remove the skin and 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:47.299
 here is one half of the fillet with us 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:50.119
 almost ready we clean on 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.109
 Well, let 's get this done. 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.529
 spine also doing the same thing 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:01.219
 and in the first case, choose different 

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:04.680
 1000 films all just trash play from 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:08.550
 fish so that we do not interfere with work 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:17.870
 with fish we extract foil 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:17.870
 all remove the bones in this way and 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.230
 Now again, I remove the skin by catching it 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.360
 get out on principle easy here a minute u 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.170
 I got torn a but the movie we need 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.730
 Straight so much desirable now 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.190
 understand why, well, here we find the fillet and 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.950
 cleared 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.890
 Now we can cut into thin slices 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.320
 strips strip much thinner 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.400
 probably what you see is their private edge 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:54.690
 it seems extremely honorable a little more 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:58.850
 cut into strips so that the same 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.850
 doing the most with the other half 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.310
 lovers he really likes about everything in 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.190
 delighted 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.290
 they all sense as melting warily 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.890
 I treat it is for me much the apple 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.860
 Strange nazim potatoes have such 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.540
 long cubes 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.640
 here is and my husband is just a delight and this one 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.890
 salad and standing at the brow and also not 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:29.430
 the first year so add to the herring 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.530
 now we cut the onion into rings better 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.360
 there will be an onion from a booth long 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.220
 less nato rings will be a little less 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.860
 there will be paint and of course we lay out our 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.800
 Onions in a bowl, all mix well 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.060
 so that our rings break up into small ones 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.030
 ringlets now cut apple apple 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.610
 better to take durum 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:59.580
 green not friable we clean a skin 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:03.020
 extract the seeds and cut the same 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.920
 like a potato tacomoto 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:13.130
 long slices just cut 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.130
 length and cut this way 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.240
 so here 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.210
 and then we add the same bowl to our 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.180
 the apple salad is added last and 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.580
 immediately preparing pouring you not 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.470
 we mix even 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.180
 take our butter squeeze lemon there 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.460
 I had a little trouble 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.120
 why is it all the monster went there 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.620
 some kind of soft pain he's on better 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.690
 Of course lemon press in a separate 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.790
 a bowl and then add to the butter not 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:53.110
 so did not make a lemon about juice 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:56.160
 lemon leaves 2 3 tablespoons 4 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.110
 tablespoons strand of vegetable oil 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.100
 add a teaspoon straight on the floor 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.780
 full of mustard and all carefully 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.280
 mix until smooth consistency 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.320
 top poured our apples if 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.840
