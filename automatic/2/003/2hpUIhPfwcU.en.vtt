00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
okay so I'm gonna try and show you how

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.430 
okay so I'm gonna try and show you how
to<00:00:03.899> pull<00:00:04.140> these<00:00:04.350> bolts<00:00:05.190> out<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.490> manifold

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.680 

you<00:00:10.440> need<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:11.690> pair<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.719> pliers<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:16.369> what<00:00:17.369> these

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
you need a pair of pliers and what these

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
you need a pair of pliers and what these
bolts<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> sleeve<00:00:19.350> around<00:00:19.740> them<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
bolts have a sleeve around them and the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.540 
bolts have a sleeve around them and the
sleeve<00:00:21.270> has<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> little<00:00:21.810> lip<00:00:26.689> that's<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
sleeve has a little lip that's the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.910 
sleeve has a little lip that's the
sleeve<00:00:31.369> that's<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.579> top<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.969> sleeve<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
sleeve that's the top of the sleeve and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
sleeve that's the top of the sleeve and
that's<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> bottom<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.489> has<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.730> little

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
that's the bottom and has this little

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.970 
that's the bottom and has this little
lip<00:00:36.239> which<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:36.989> catches<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.590> bottom<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
lip which just catches on the bottom of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.650 
lip which just catches on the bottom of
the<00:00:38.100> plastic<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> manifold<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> has<00:00:39.420> like

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the plastic on the manifold it has like

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.740 
the plastic on the manifold it has like
a<00:00:39.690> little<00:00:40.790> stepped<00:00:41.790> edge<00:00:43.219> but<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.629> grab<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
a little stepped edge but if we grab the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.540 
a little stepped edge but if we grab the
bolt<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:47.450> some<00:00:48.450> pliers<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.340> have

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
bolt with some pliers and you just have

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.189 
bolt with some pliers and you just have
to<00:00:50.700> apply<00:00:50.940> pressure<00:00:52.219> moderately<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.899> sort

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
to apply pressure moderately and I sort

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.520 
to apply pressure moderately and I sort
of<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.440> use<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> nail<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.340> push<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.670> down

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
of just use a nail just to push it down

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.349 
of just use a nail just to push it down
to<00:00:58.530> push<00:00:58.739> that<00:01:01.160> pass<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.520> lipped<00:01:02.850> edge<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
to push that pass the lipped edge on the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:11.200 
to push that pass the lipped edge on the
plastic<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:07.820> we<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.330> bolt<00:01:09.570> here

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
plastic and we can get that bolt here

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:20.960 
plastic and we can get that bolt here
now<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:15.799> sleeve<00:01:16.799> off<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> bolt<00:01:19.970> we

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
now to get the sleeve off the bolt we

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.320 
now to get the sleeve off the bolt we
need<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.390> use<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:23.460> pliers<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.119> probably

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
need to use the pliers that are probably

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.950 
need to use the pliers that are probably
not<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> camera<00:01:30.439> two<00:01:31.439> pairs<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.740> pliers<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
not the camera two pairs of pliers I

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.420 
not the camera two pairs of pliers I
find<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.140> better<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.590> put<00:01:34.799> these<00:01:35.009> big<00:01:35.280> ones

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
find it's better if I put these big ones

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.889 
find it's better if I put these big ones
so<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:38.150> lip<00:01:39.150> catches<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.750> them<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.899> use

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
so that the lip catches on them and use

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.190 
so that the lip catches on them and use
the<00:01:43.350> little<00:01:43.560> ones<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> bolt<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.899> just

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the little ones on the bolt and you just

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.660 
the little ones on the bolt and you just
have<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> pull<00:01:48.829> quite

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
have to pull quite

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:03.690 
have to pull quite
I'm<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:53.120> bit<00:02:00.370> yeah<00:02:01.370> it<00:02:01.910> does<00:02:02.150> come<00:02:02.360> off

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
I'm a bit yeah it does come off

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700 
I'm a bit yeah it does come off
eventually<00:02:04.900> there's<00:02:05.900> only<00:02:06.020> two<00:02:06.260> little<00:02:06.530> tabs

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
eventually there's only two little tabs

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.170 
eventually there's only two little tabs
in<00:02:06.980> there<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.310> hold<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:08.650> nothing<00:02:10.030> cuz<00:02:11.030> then

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
in there that hold the nothing cuz then

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.930 
in there that hold the nothing cuz then
that<00:02:11.360> has<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.600> little
