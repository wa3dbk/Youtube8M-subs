well<00:00:05.000> what<00:00:06.000> are<00:00:06.120> some<00:00:06.600> common<00:00:06.779> mistakes<00:00:07.049> that

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
well what are some common mistakes that

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.070 
well what are some common mistakes that
you<00:00:08.100> see<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.700> know<00:00:08.820> powerlifters<00:00:09.750> making

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
you see you know powerlifters making

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.169 
you see you know powerlifters making
that<00:00:10.799> you'd<00:00:10.920> like<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.130> see<00:00:11.340> people<00:00:11.490> change<00:00:11.880> or

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
that you'd like to see people change or

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.790 
that you'd like to see people change or
think<00:00:12.420> about<00:00:12.510> more<00:00:13.010> I<00:00:14.010> think<00:00:15.110> 22<00:00:16.110> real<00:00:16.470> traps

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
think about more I think 22 real traps

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.350 
think about more I think 22 real traps
that<00:00:17.009> people<00:00:17.250> fall<00:00:17.460> into<00:00:17.610> from<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.000> programming

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
that people fall into from a programming

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.050 
that people fall into from a programming
standpoint<00:00:18.689> is<00:00:19.140> either<00:00:19.619> too<00:00:20.430> much<00:00:20.609> intensity

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
standpoint is either too much intensity

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.230 
standpoint is either too much intensity
or<00:00:21.359> too<00:00:22.109> much<00:00:22.230> volume<00:00:22.500> guys<00:00:23.490> want<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.880> max<00:00:24.060> out

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
or too much volume guys want to max out

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.990 
or too much volume guys want to max out
every<00:00:24.539> single<00:00:24.840> week<00:00:25.460> so<00:00:26.460> they're<00:00:26.640> never<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
every single week so they're never it is

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.730 
every single week so they're never it is
like<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.750> short<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.140> intensity<00:00:28.680> in

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
like just in short was intensity in

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.259 
like just in short was intensity in
volume<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.400> are<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.519> talking<00:00:29.789> about<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:29.939> so

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
volume what are we talking about here so

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.269 
volume what are we talking about here so
intensity<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.930> you<00:00:31.410> know<00:00:31.500> how<00:00:31.859> heavy<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
intensity is you know how heavy the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.560 
intensity is you know how heavy the
weight<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.580> compared<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.150> your<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.360> rep<00:00:33.540> max

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
weight is compared to your one rep max

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.260 
weight is compared to your one rep max
it's<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:34.949> how<00:00:35.370> tough<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.790> faces

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
it's it's not like how tough of faces

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
it's it's not like how tough of faces
you<00:00:36.510> may<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:37.380> music<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.739> play<00:00:37.980> yeah

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you may really what music you play yeah

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.030 
you may really what music you play yeah
metal<00:00:38.820> path<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.989> volume<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.680> you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
metal path and then the volume is you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.650 
metal path and then the volume is you
know<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> total<00:00:41.430> amount<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.879> work<00:00:42.360> your

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
know the total amount of work your

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.410 
know the total amount of work your
tonnage<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:44.370> mainly<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.730> referring

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
tonnage and it's mainly just referring

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.000 
tonnage and it's mainly just referring
to<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> working<00:00:45.840> sets<00:00:46.230> usually<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:46.680> yeah

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
to the working sets usually right yeah

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.029 
to the working sets usually right yeah
yeah<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.260> too<00:00:49.410> much<00:00:49.559> intensity

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
yeah and so the the too much intensity

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.190 
yeah and so the the too much intensity
crew<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.149> know<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.390> want<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> max<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.960> every

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
crew you know they want to max out every

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.299 
crew you know they want to max out every
single<00:00:52.320> week<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.039> cool-looking

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
really heavy like 1 2 3 rep Max's or

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.880 
really heavy like 1 2 3 rep Max's or
it's<00:01:05.399> you<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:05.940> always<00:01:06.210> max<00:01:06.840> reps<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it's you know always max reps that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.500 
it's you know always max reps that
they're<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.700> they're<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> end<00:01:09.420> up

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
they're just they're going to end up

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.929 
they're just they're going to end up
training<00:01:09.780> above<00:01:10.140> their<00:01:11.130> maximum<00:01:11.580> recover

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
training above their maximum recover

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.870 
training above their maximum recover
above<00:01:12.210> all<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.390> might<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:14.520> people<00:01:14.640> who

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
above all you might or the people who

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.090 
above all you might or the people who
are<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.720> guys<00:01:15.869> are<00:01:16.020> doing<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.380> always

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
are if the guys are doing that always

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.910 
are if the guys are doing that always
like<00:01:17.520> Max<00:01:17.820> rep<00:01:18.090> sets<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.439> always<00:01:19.710> one

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
like Max rep sets or if it's always one

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.649 
like Max rep sets or if it's always one
to<00:01:20.070> three<00:01:20.220> rep<00:01:20.369> Max's<00:01:20.759> they're<00:01:21.360> never<00:01:21.509> going

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
to three rep Max's they're never going

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.390 
to three rep Max's they're never going
to<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> time<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.350> their<00:01:22.470> training<00:01:22.860> where

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to have a time in their training where

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.539 
to have a time in their training where
they<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.580> enough<00:01:23.939> volume<00:01:24.240> enough<00:01:24.840> practice<00:01:25.549> to

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
they do enough volume enough practice to

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.820 
they do enough volume enough practice to
improve<00:01:26.670> their<00:01:27.030> technique<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
improve their technique you know and to

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.280 
improve their technique you know and to
build<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.820> necessary<00:01:30.000> muscle<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:31.080> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
build the necessary muscle right to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.170 
build the necessary muscle right to
really<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> great<00:01:32.070> lifter<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
really be a great lifter and then the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.230 
really be a great lifter and then the
too<00:01:33.329> much<00:01:33.479> volume<00:01:33.780> side<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.770> things<00:01:35.240> there

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
too much volume side of things there

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
too much volume side of things there
they're<00:01:36.780> taking<00:01:36.930> almost<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> badge<00:01:37.710> of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
they're taking almost like a badge of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.649 
they're taking almost like a badge of
honor<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.400> look<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.759> how<00:01:38.909> much<00:01:39.180> work<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.600> did

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
honor like look at how much work I did

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.929 
honor like look at how much work I did
and<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.680> volume<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.250> great<00:01:41.460> volume<00:01:41.880> is

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and and volume is great volume is

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.399 
and and volume is great volume is
important<00:01:42.329> volumes<00:01:42.630> probably<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.930> best<00:01:43.200> way

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
important volumes probably the best way

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.260 
important volumes probably the best way
to<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.680> stronger<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:44.939> you're<00:01:45.060> two

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to get stronger but when you're two

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.510 
to get stronger but when you're two
weeks<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.659> from<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.960> meet<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.369> don't

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
weeks out from a meet and you you don't

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.090 
weeks out from a meet and you you don't
really<00:01:47.610> need<00:01:47.790> 565<00:01:48.420> yeah<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.500> say<00:01:49.649> even

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
