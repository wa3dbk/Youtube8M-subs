00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
and a classic example that would be free

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.680 
and a classic example that would be free
burger<00:00:26.860> you<00:00:27.070> have<00:00:27.160> to<00:00:27.430> harmonize<00:00:28.240> guitar

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:46.020 

you<00:00:39.820> have<00:00:39.910> another<00:00:40.120> guitar<00:00:40.420> going

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.900 

cetera<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.560> so<00:00:48.560> that's<00:00:49.430> what's<00:00:49.610> going<00:00:49.760> on

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
cetera and so that's what's going on

underneath solo wise what you want to
pay<00:00:54.350> attention<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.950> is<00:00:56.290> again<00:00:57.290> I've<00:00:57.470> got<00:00:57.650> the

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
pay attention to is again I've got the

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.270 
pay attention to is again I've got the
triplet<00:00:58.190> figures<00:00:58.750> like<00:00:59.750> in<00:00:59.960> measure<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:01.129> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
triplet figures like in measure in the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:11.560 
triplet figures like in measure in the
first<00:01:01.519> measure<00:01:02.019> where<00:01:03.019> you've<00:01:03.140> got<00:01:10.330> so<00:01:11.330> it's

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
first measure where you've got so it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.590 
first measure where you've got so it's
basically<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:13.060> triplet<00:01:14.060> comes<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.390> beat

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
basically the triplet comes on beat

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.820 
basically the triplet comes on beat
three<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:16.960> you<00:01:17.960> want<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.170> watch<00:01:18.320> out<00:01:18.500> for<00:01:18.649> beat

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
three and you want to watch out for beat

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.700 
three and you want to watch out for beat
three<00:01:19.250> in<00:01:19.490> most<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.180> those<00:01:20.270> measures<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.780> eat

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
three in most of those measures you eat

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.320 
three in most of those measures you eat
three<00:01:22.009> has<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.160> triplet<00:01:22.550> in<00:01:22.759> measure<00:01:23.060> one

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
three has a triplet in measure one

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.580 
three has a triplet in measure one
measure<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.840> measure<00:01:24.140> three<00:01:26.200> watch<00:01:27.200> out<00:01:27.410> for

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
measure to measure three watch out for

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.850 
measure to measure three watch out for
those<00:01:28.990> other<00:01:29.990> thing<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.470> wanted<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.800> mention

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
those other thing I wanted to mention

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.690 
those other thing I wanted to mention
about<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:31.960> is<00:01:34.990> let's<00:01:35.990> jump<00:01:36.470> down<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:37.100> all<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
about this is let's jump down to all the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:46.770 
about this is let's jump down to all the
way<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.820> page<00:01:39.820> or<00:01:40.820> let's<00:01:41.000> say<00:01:41.210> measure<00:01:41.630> number

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:54.940 

measure<00:01:47.830> number<00:01:49.450> 21<00:01:53.020> let<00:01:54.020> me<00:01:54.080> just<00:01:54.259> play<00:01:54.920> it

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
measure number 21 let me just play it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.450 
measure number 21 let me just play it
slow<00:01:55.340> motion<00:01:55.670> for<00:01:55.850> you

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.430 

me

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.810 

those<00:02:04.440> measures<00:02:04.830> 21<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.430> 22<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:08.340> reason<00:02:08.700> it

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
those measures 21 and 22 the reason it

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.230 
those measures 21 and 22 the reason it
sounds<00:02:09.330> off<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:10.110> because<00:02:10.290> I<00:02:10.680> max<00:02:11.040> ending<00:02:11.430> our

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
sounds off is because I max ending our

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.390 
sounds off is because I max ending our
recent<00:02:12.630> sounds<00:02:12.960> somewhat<00:02:13.500> syncopated<00:02:14.130> is

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
recent sounds somewhat syncopated is

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400 
recent sounds somewhat syncopated is
because<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.300> I'm<00:02:15.930> actually<00:02:16.080> acts

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
because it is and I'm actually acts

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:27.290 
because it is and I'm actually acts
inning<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:20.090> c-note

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.130 

in<00:02:28.260> here<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.650> maxing<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.340> note<00:02:29.930> just<00:02:30.930> see

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
in here that I maxing this note just see

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.040 
in here that I maxing this note just see
and<00:02:32.000> sometimes<00:02:33.000> those<00:02:33.120> accidents<00:02:33.510> fall<00:02:33.870> on

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
and sometimes those accidents fall on

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.390 
and sometimes those accidents fall on
the<00:02:34.290> upbeat<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:37.560> kind<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.980> sounds<00:02:38.340> like

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the upbeat so it kind of sounds like

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.910 
the upbeat so it kind of sounds like
it's<00:02:38.880> often<00:02:39.720> then<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.170> know<00:02:40.290> it's<00:02:40.440> off<00:02:40.650> rhythm

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
it's often then you know it's off rhythm

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.470 
it's often then you know it's off rhythm
then<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.310> comes<00:02:41.430> back<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.850> sync<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.300> that's

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
then it comes back in sync and that's

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.080 
then it comes back in sync and that's
simply<00:02:42.810> because<00:02:43.040> you're<00:02:44.040> you're<00:02:44.640> essentially

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
simply because you're you're essentially

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.470 
simply because you're you're essentially
playing<00:02:46.520> sometimes<00:02:47.520> three<00:02:47.910> notes<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.270> three

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
playing sometimes three notes a three

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.760 
playing sometimes three notes a three
note<00:02:48.630> pattern<00:02:48.810> sometimes<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.350> four<00:02:49.590> note

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
note pattern sometimes a four note

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.220 
note pattern sometimes a four note
pattern<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.850> when<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.240> accident<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.960> see

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
pattern and when you accident that see

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.670 
pattern and when you accident that see
every<00:02:52.650> time<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.220> have<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> downbeat<00:02:54.680> it

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
every time you have a downbeat it

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.700 
every time you have a downbeat it
basically<00:02:56.310> makes<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.730> sound<00:02:56.850> syncopated<00:02:57.710> so

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
basically makes it sound syncopated so

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.550 
basically makes it sound syncopated so
let<00:02:59.700> me<00:02:59.820> explain<00:03:00.030> how<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.990> practice<00:03:01.530> that

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
let me explain how to practice that

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.350 
let me explain how to practice that
measure<00:03:01.920> I'm<00:03:02.310> talking<00:03:02.520> about<00:03:02.550> measures<00:03:02.880> 21

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
measure I'm talking about measures 21

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.310 
measure I'm talking about measures 21
and<00:03:03.630> 22<00:03:04.080> at<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.440> point<00:03:05.600> if<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:07.140> try<00:03:07.260> to

and 22 at this point if you just try to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.990 
and 22 at this point if you just try to
