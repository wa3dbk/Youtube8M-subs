00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hi all 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.300
 today we are still talking about removing makeup 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.250
 or clean your face something so 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.290
 important that we should do all the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.880
 days whether we make it or not 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.340
 the cleansing of the skin is fundamental 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.410
 in the morning and in the evening we go to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.869
 to do is to make up the face of 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.550
 make- up remover as it is to make up the eyes 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.949
 we already have another segment that you can 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 Click to see what my routine 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.510
 make-up of eyes that have their 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.610
 particularities taking into account that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.110
 I have also been in the world for many years 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.510
 of the show and makeup 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.010
 putting on makeup and he has learned me the way 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.020
 of doing it that has worked very well for me 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.879
 and that I hope it also works for us 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.010
 all of you the first thing that you have to 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.680
 say when are we going to remove makeup is it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.320
 that we have to wash our hands very 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.410
 well and more if you follow my routine because 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.090
 he used his hands for everything with which 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.489
 the themes of my fingers are totally 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.250
 protagonists with which the hands very 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.239
 clean then also if you wear glasses 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.799
 of contact you have to remove them the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.450
 time to remove makeup from us 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.100
 even when you make the face do not go 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.659
 a reason to focus a little bit of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.840
 makeup inside 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.420
 then we need a product to 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.759
 make up each one has his own 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.880
 favorite brand that can be milk 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.069
 the liquid can be cream 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 I would tell you that you will take a look at 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:30.119
 our makeup remover gel or cleanser 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.310
 aloe vera base what do we do what 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.530
 you can click on our channel because 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 I use it I'm delighted for me it was a 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.979
 I find that I can really discover it and 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.929
 also nourishes the skin very well you know 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.899
 the advantages of the cloud will leave it very 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.909
 hydrated , it's very economical, you can 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.739
 to know what is inside and also 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.079
 it is very important but apart from that 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:55.770
 we need other things we need then 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.569
 to your address curl wipe like that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.209
 normal towel type but more 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.709
 you can also use those 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.359
 wipes that we take with mushrooms 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.060
 trip that can also be used in 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.500
 house those wipes that are so useful and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.109
 mostly skip practices when 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.849
 we travel but I prefer to leave them 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:14.040
 only for when I travel when I'm in 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.170
 house quietly used products 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.530
 most appropriate for each 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.380
 I want to remove make-up we have the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.349
 very famous or the most famous discs of 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.640
 cotton quoted very soft and very useful 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:32.760
 to remove make-up but what I use are 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.250
 the sponge makeup remover discs 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.590
 and I use them because at the same time I have the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.690
 feeling that they make me light 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.910
 exfoliation that in the case of the skin 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.100
 that I have that is a normal skin that 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.040
 it is neither dry nor sensini excessively 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.959
 sensitive or fat because a parrot exists 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.330
 very well but that depends on you 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.890
 if the feeling like that of a little scratched 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.780
 in the chespi teen spirit 'and it bothers us 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.460
 they immediately change but I 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.070
 I use it because it works for me 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.470
 what do we do in those hands so clean 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.200
 that we have, we apply the product that 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.390
 Whatever we explained in the tips of 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.270
 fingers 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.150
 and massage masters very carefully and much 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.220
 softness whole area except for 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.510
 assumption of the area of â€‹â€‹the eyes that already 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.090
 the most made up work because the first 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.970
 step of makeup is the eyes before 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.150
 that the rest of the face as is normal 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.030
 then we passed out very 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.730
 Gently cream or a gel all over the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.990
 face the neck and the neckline and the hands 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.850
 you have also made up your 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.709
 hands one night you want to have them 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.330
 resplendent and have the same as the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.500
 face that I am very important everything 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.420
 who is makeup has to 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.660
 remove makeup according to what I can 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.180
 all those neckline areas whose face 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.130
 you pass the sponge passes that sponge 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.230
 that you have previously immersed in 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.880
 warm water and you have drained it because 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.739
 logically it is with people who do it 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.900
 with sponge forms dry but I do not 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.650
 I recommend it with the mojadita sponge 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.650
 and negative drained and you go massaging 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.700
 Gently all your face in front 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.990
 existing in these areas more 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.880
 conflicting that sometimes would be the 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.830
 embedded makeup that are those 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.440
 grooves of the nose 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.020
 do not forget open little ears too 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.400
 orejitas because if you have a hairstyle very 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.440
 retired the face is also convenient 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.090
 Make up for you that it seemed that the cars 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.370
 different colors the ear of the rest in 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.320
 face everything you have makeup 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.730
 what you have to do is make up and when it is 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.919
 because not also of course you're going to 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.020
 Drain the sponge several times 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.030
 you will go back to wet with warm water 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.980
 elapsed again and continue 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.590
 massaging all the skin until no longer 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.340
 there is no trace and then yes then 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.870
 You can apply a little bit of tonic in 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.960
 the skin of the face so in the eyes not 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.789
 but on the face like that 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.530
 we both have a tonic also in 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.630
 our channel that is done at home very 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.639
 you can easily try to do it and 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.800
 try it we are going to use it and in my 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.360
 case I use it also goes very well but 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.000
 If you can not use the product that 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.860
 you have as a habit if you think there is 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.410
 tonics too strong for you 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.270
 in the situation it would be very simple 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.479
 you just take the cotton you quoted a 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.729
 little plane of these submerges them in water 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.400
 I drain it but very drained and 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.920
 then you apply the tonic in the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.140
 cotton 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.690
 and then I would apply it all over my face 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.090
 to remove the remains that may have been 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.740
 get milk cleanser or 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.570
 Makeup remover evaluation will appear 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.790
 until the last rest that could have 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.680
 stay of our face and also for 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.090
 that the pores are closed a little and 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.930
 then we will have the face 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.210
 ready to apply our cream 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.190
 day or night cream there is also 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.820
 people I do from time to time that 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.340
 tonic also apply with 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.840
 disco the sponge disk i do it 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.420
 very often too but I repeat 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.340
 I have a very resistant skin and it is not 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.380
 nothing delicate in the sense that a 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.360
 Double gentle exfoliation does not make you 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.330
 no harm but I raise others you start 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.250
 only with the first of the cream and 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.290
 the next one we'll see what you're testing 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.690
 because everyone knows his face better 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.100
 that nobody expects you to follow the advice 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.200
 that I send you with all my heart and that 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.820
 It is a fruit of experience I assure you 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.820
 of many years visits
