dragon<00:02:19.110> designs<00:02:19.530> can<00:02:19.920> change<00:02:20.340> almost

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
dragon designs can change almost

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.570 
dragon designs can change almost
immediately<00:02:21.720> after<00:02:22.290> they<00:02:22.440> hit<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.920> adult

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
immediately after they hit the adult

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.210 
immediately after they hit the adult
form<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.420> as<00:02:25.019> you<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.260> see<00:02:25.409> he<00:02:25.620> only<00:02:25.860> has<00:02:25.980> two

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
form and as you can see he only has two

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.580 
form and as you can see he only has two
legs<00:02:26.519> he's<00:02:26.819> missing<00:02:27.180> an<00:02:27.330> arm<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.810> two<00:02:28.110> arms<00:02:28.290> at

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
legs he's missing an arm on two arms at

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.390 
legs he's missing an arm on two arms at
least<00:02:28.799> I<00:02:29.180> mean<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.209> like<00:02:30.540> forelimb<00:02:31.220> dragons<00:02:32.220> or

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
least I mean I like forelimb dragons or

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.110 
least I mean I like forelimb dragons or
a<00:02:32.480> six<00:02:33.480> limb<00:02:33.780> dragon<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.290> mean<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.739> think<00:02:35.250> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
a six limb dragon I mean I think the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.210 
a six limb dragon I mean I think the
arms<00:02:36.569> are<00:02:36.690> considered<00:02:37.170> two<00:02:37.530> limbs<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:38.069> then

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
arms are considered two limbs and then

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.750 
arms are considered two limbs and then
legs<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.730> then<00:02:38.819> wings<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.329> six<00:02:40.340> great<00:02:41.340> we're

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
legs and then wings so six great we're

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.180 
legs and then wings so six great we're
gonna<00:02:41.879> level<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.269> up<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.659> there<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.530> is

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
gonna level it up and there it is

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.240 
gonna level it up and there it is
all<00:02:45.000> right<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.140> pretty<00:02:46.349> simple<00:02:46.709> dragon

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
all right so it's a pretty simple dragon

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.300 
all right so it's a pretty simple dragon
I<00:02:47.340> like<00:02:47.790> how<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.269> looks<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.799> Bigfoot<00:02:49.799> in<00:02:50.069> a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.599 
I like how it looks like Bigfoot in a
way<00:02:52.549> but<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.670> thing<00:02:53.879> is<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:55.440> know<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:56.190> still
