00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
stiff suspension being zero you could

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.710 
stiff suspension being zero you could
have<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.369> adjusted<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.239> all<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.540> way<00:00:24.689> a

can<00:02:58.560> do<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.769> sieve<00:02:59.069> different<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:04.650> really

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
can do a sieve different this really

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:16.320 
can do a sieve different this really
simple

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.970 

and<00:03:16.570> also<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.980> mark<00:03:18.340> right<00:03:18.370> here
