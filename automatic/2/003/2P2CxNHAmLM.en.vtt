 this is baking soda 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.829
 such a yellow ribbon 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.229
 such very very pretty flowers 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:23.110
 they are all exactly the same so pretty 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:26.350
 dyes and you can use the same 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.250
 the most if you have it or just 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:36.119
 put a jar is not visible place so 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:40.259
 let's start taking our baking soda and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.259
 put about three spoons 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:00.350
 that and we do then we take this sturgeon 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.030
 they prepared you said choose 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:15.170
 one of these tubes and add cable 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:19.010
 20-30 rubber oil and so I added 20 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.650
 droplets but really they are full of cycle 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:28.989
 walls and I probably add a little more 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.989
 to smell more added 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.769
 Now we take foil 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:43.340
