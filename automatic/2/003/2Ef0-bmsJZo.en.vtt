00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.139 

all<00:00:01.020> right<00:00:01.170> so<00:00:01.439> now<00:00:01.620> we<00:00:01.680> have<00:00:02.010> talked<00:00:02.970> about

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
all right so now we have talked about

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.280 
all right so now we have talked about
this<00:00:03.990> real<00:00:04.470> number<00:00:04.980> system<00:00:05.279> joining<00:00:06.210> with<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
this real number system joining with the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.410 
this real number system joining with the
imaginary<00:00:08.010> numbers<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.790> becoming<00:00:09.210> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
imaginary numbers and becoming the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.049 
imaginary numbers and becoming the
complex<00:00:09.990> number<00:00:10.380> system<00:00:10.580> so<00:00:11.580> all<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.940> our

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
complex number system so all of our

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.270 
complex number system so all of our
complex<00:00:12.690> numbers<00:00:13.170> will<00:00:13.440> come<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> form<00:00:14.070> of

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
complex numbers will come in the form of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.450 
complex numbers will come in the form of
as<00:00:14.490> some<00:00:15.059> number<00:00:15.440> plus<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.949> then<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.340> an

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
as some number plus and then we have an

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.300 
as some number plus and then we have an
imaginary<00:00:18.000> part<00:00:18.560> okay<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.619> now<00:00:19.859> we've<00:00:20.039> we've

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
imaginary part okay so now we've we've

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.140 
imaginary part okay so now we've we've
introduced<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.119> thing<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.980> this<00:00:22.980> bi<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:24.029> we

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
introduced this thing I this bi but we

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.240 
introduced this thing I this bi but we
need<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.070> okay

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
need to know what it is okay

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.429 
need to know what it is okay
the<00:00:26.460> imaginary<00:00:27.150> unit<00:00:27.830> denoted<00:00:28.830> by<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.519> is

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
the imaginary unit denoted by this I is

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.470 
the imaginary unit denoted by this I is
defined<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.279> number<00:00:32.700> whose<00:00:32.940> square<00:00:32.969> is

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
defined as the number whose square is

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.600 
defined as the number whose square is
negative<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.880> very<00:00:35.880> fancy<00:00:36.480> way<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> say<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
negative one very fancy way to say I

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.270 
negative one very fancy way to say I
squared<00:00:38.610> equals<00:00:39.270> negative<00:00:39.600> one<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:41.010> is

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
squared equals negative one this is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.910 
squared equals negative one this is
something<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.989> know<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.739> just

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
something that you have to know you just

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.220 
something that you have to know you just
you<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.780> memorize<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.760> now<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.629> squared

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you have to memorize it now if I squared

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.950 
you have to memorize it now if I squared
is<00:00:49.590> negative<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.539> were<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> take

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
is negative one then if we were to take

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.760 
is negative one then if we were to take
the<00:00:52.140> square<00:00:52.500> root<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.980> both<00:00:53.190> sides<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:54.770> would

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the square root of both sides I would

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.290 
the square root of both sides I would
have<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> equal<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> square<00:00:56.910> root<00:00:57.149> of

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
have to equal the square root of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.410 
have to equal the square root of
negative<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.899> again<00:00:58.550> this<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.760> another<00:01:00.059> thing

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
negative one again this is another thing

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.260 
negative one again this is another thing
that<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.649> memorize<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:03.030> you're

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
that we just have to memorize so you're

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.090 
that we just have to memorize so you're
gonna<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.690> actually<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> list<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.890> four

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
gonna have actually a list of four

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.770 
gonna have actually a list of four
things<00:01:05.430> whenever<00:01:05.670> we're<00:01:06.060> done<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
things whenever we're done with this

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.899 
things whenever we're done with this
section<00:01:07.100> that<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.700> off<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
section that you have to know off the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.020 
section that you have to know off the
top<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.240> your<00:01:09.479> head<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.439> equals<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.729> square

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
top of your head so I equals the square

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.050 
top of your head so I equals the square
root<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.420> negative<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.700> squared<00:01:14.700> equals

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
root of negative one I squared equals

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.590 
root of negative one I squared equals
negative<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.200> those<00:01:16.409> are<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.770> first<00:01:17.070> two<00:01:17.600> in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
negative one those are your first two in

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.090 
negative one those are your first two in
that<00:01:18.810> list<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.350> four<00:01:19.560> things<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.979> we're

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
that list of four things that we're

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.510 
that list of four things that we're
going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> create<00:01:21.200> okay<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.259> let's<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:23.040> how<00:01:23.310> in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
going to create okay so let's see how in

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.480 
going to create okay so let's see how in
the<00:01:23.640> world<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.420> help<00:01:24.750> us<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.490> looking

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the world this will help us in looking

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.910 
the world this will help us in looking
at<00:01:26.610> problems<00:01:27.259> so<00:01:28.259> let's<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.619> through<00:01:28.770> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
at problems so let's go through this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.420 
at problems so let's go through this
example<00:01:29.479> here<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:31.040> first<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
example here we have first of all this

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.130 
example here we have first of all this
says<00:01:32.700> write<00:01:33.000> each<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.450> following<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
says write each of the following is a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.130 
says write each of the following is a
pure<00:01:34.619> imaginary<00:01:35.369> number<00:01:35.570> now<00:01:36.570> when<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.900> talk

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
pure imaginary number now when we talk

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.560 
pure imaginary number now when we talk
about<00:01:37.380> pure<00:01:37.770> imaginary<00:01:38.460> numbers<00:01:38.939> we're

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
about pure imaginary numbers we're

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.760 
about pure imaginary numbers we're
talking<00:01:39.960> about<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.610> BI<00:01:41.850> part<00:01:42.649> we're<00:01:43.649> not

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
talking about just the BI part we're not

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.560 
talking about just the BI part we're not
talking<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.520> remember<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.299> said

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
talking you know it remember it said

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.510 
talking you know it remember it said
that<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.200> our<00:01:46.320> complex<00:01:46.799> numbers<00:01:47.250> come<00:01:47.490> in

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that all of our complex numbers come in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.319 
that all of our complex numbers come in
the<00:01:47.640> form<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.210> plus<00:01:48.509> bi<00:01:49.130> if<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.909> have

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the form of a plus bi if we just have

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.819 
the form of a plus bi if we just have
this<00:01:52.200> part<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:53.009> called<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.460> pure<00:01:53.880> imaginary

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
this part it's called the pure imaginary

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.469 
this part it's called the pure imaginary
whenever<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:56.009> join<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> real<00:01:57.119> part

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
whenever we join it with the real part

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.870 
whenever we join it with the real part
is<00:01:57.869> whenever<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:59.040> talk<00:01:59.369> about<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.759> as

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
is whenever we really talk about it as

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.510 
is whenever we really talk about it as
being<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.420> truly<00:02:01.579> complex<00:02:02.579> number<00:02:04.159> okay<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.219> if

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
being a truly complex number okay so if

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.069 
being a truly complex number okay so if
we're<00:02:05.670> gonna<00:02:05.759> write<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.060> as<00:02:06.509> an<00:02:06.630> imaginary

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
we're gonna write this as an imaginary

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.979 
we're gonna write this as an imaginary
number<00:02:07.200> let's<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.459> pretend<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.780> did

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
number let's just pretend that we did

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.530 
number let's just pretend that we did
not<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.500> negative<00:02:10.739> there<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:12.180> just

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
not have that negative there if we just

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.040 
not have that negative there if we just
saw

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
saw

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.100 
saw
square<00:02:13.380> root<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.590> 16<00:02:14.450> then<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:15.600> would<00:02:15.720> say<00:02:15.900> oh

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
square root of 16 then we would say oh

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.670 
square root of 16 then we would say oh
well<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.530> square<00:02:16.800> root<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.010> 16<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.580> 4<00:02:18.680> but

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
well the square root of 16 is 4 but

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.390 
well the square root of 16 is 4 but
because<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.910> negative<00:02:21.510> there<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.100> way

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
because of that negative there in a way

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.460 
because of that negative there in a way
it's<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.300> if<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.020> are<00:02:25.140> breaking<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.070> up<00:02:26.430> into

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
it's as if you are breaking this up into

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.180 
it's as if you are breaking this up into
16<00:02:28.470> times<00:02:29.280> negative<00:02:29.790> 1<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.720> then<00:02:31.590> taking<00:02:32.070> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
16 times negative 1 and then taking the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.490 
16 times negative 1 and then taking the
square<00:02:32.220> root<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.850> each<00:02:33.030> one<00:02:33.410> remember<00:02:34.410> I'm

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
square root of each one remember I'm

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.490 
square root of each one remember I'm
doing<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.160> with<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.430> other<00:02:35.580> square<00:02:35.970> roots

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
doing that with the other square roots

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.800 
doing that with the other square roots
so<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.650> square<00:02:37.920> root<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.100> 16<00:02:38.670> would<00:02:38.850> be<00:02:38.910> 4<00:02:39.540> and

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
so the square root of 16 would be 4 and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.380 
so the square root of 16 would be 4 and
the<00:02:40.680> square<00:02:40.980> root<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.250> negative<00:02:41.370> 1<00:02:41.880> by

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the square root of negative 1 by

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
the square root of negative 1 by
definition<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:46.050> this<00:02:46.200> would<00:02:46.410> be<00:02:46.670> 4<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:48.410> now

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
definition is I so this would be 4 I now

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.940 
definition is I so this would be 4 I now
we<00:02:49.770> can<00:02:50.160> look<00:02:50.490> at<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.880> also<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:52.470> see<00:02:52.740> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
we can look at it also if we see the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.800 
we can look at it also if we see the
square<00:02:53.250> root<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.520> negative<00:02:53.670> 16<00:02:54.390> or<00:02:54.600> something

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
square root of negative 16 or something

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.190 
square root of negative 16 or something
similar<00:02:55.580> if<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:57.090> understand<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.140> that

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
similar if you understand that that

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.550 
similar if you understand that that
negative<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.280> going<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.760> create<00:03:00.030> an<00:03:00.390> eye<00:03:00.630> you

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
negative is going to create an eye you

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.370 
negative is going to create an eye you
can<00:03:01.800> just<00:03:02.310> work<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.180> number<00:03:03.690> part<00:03:04.080> and

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
can just work with the number part and

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.850 
can just work with the number part and
then<00:03:04.920> tack<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.550> eye<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:06.060> at<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.420> end<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.830> we

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
then tack the eye on at the end so we

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.170 
then tack the eye on at the end so we
could<00:03:08.160> look<00:03:08.280> at<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.670> say<00:03:08.760> ok<00:03:08.970> let's

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
could look at this and say ok let's

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.000 
could look at this and say ok let's
ignore<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.690> negative<00:03:10.050> for<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> minute<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
ignore the negative for a minute the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.370 
ignore the negative for a minute the
square<00:03:11.280> root<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.430> 16<00:03:11.850> would<00:03:11.970> be<00:03:12.030> 4<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.870> then

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
square root of 16 would be 4 and then

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.530 
square root of 16 would be 4 and then
because<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.830> have<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.160> negative<00:03:14.760> we<00:03:15.210> have<00:03:15.240> to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
because we have that negative we have to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.680 
because we have that negative we have to
tack<00:03:15.750> on<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.140> eye<00:03:16.820> that's<00:03:17.820> exactly<00:03:18.480> what<00:03:18.600> I'm

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
tack on the eye that's exactly what I'm

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.140 
tack on the eye that's exactly what I'm
going<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:18.989> here<00:03:19.340> I'm<00:03:20.340> gonna<00:03:20.550> ignore<00:03:20.760> this

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
going to do here I'm gonna ignore this

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.630 
going to do here I'm gonna ignore this
negative<00:03:21.209> for<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> minute<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.470> just<00:03:23.370> look<00:03:23.520> at

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
negative for a minute and just look at

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.090 
negative for a minute and just look at
the<00:03:23.700> square<00:03:24.000> root<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.180> 3<00:03:24.650> well<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.830> square

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
the square root of 3 well the square

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.740 
the square root of 3 well the square
root<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.340> 3<00:03:26.610> cannot<00:03:26.940> be<00:03:27.000> broke<00:03:27.360> down<00:03:27.570> any

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
root of 3 cannot be broke down any

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.540 
root of 3 cannot be broke down any
further<00:03:27.959> there<00:03:28.290> are<00:03:28.410> not<00:03:28.620> two<00:03:28.950> things<00:03:29.310> that

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
further there are not two things that

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.479 
further there are not two things that
multiply<00:03:29.700> together<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.750> get<00:03:30.870> 3<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.590> one<00:03:32.370> of

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
multiply together to get 3 and one of

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.060 
multiply together to get 3 and one of
them<00:03:32.580> is<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> perfect<00:03:32.850> square<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:33.950> really<00:03:34.950> and

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
them is a perfect square so really and

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.620 
them is a perfect square so really and
truly<00:03:35.280> we<00:03:35.489> just<00:03:35.700> have<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.970> leave<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.360> as<00:03:36.600> the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
truly we just have to leave this as the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.500 
truly we just have to leave this as the
square<00:03:36.989> root<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.140> 3<00:03:37.470> but<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.489> negative<00:03:38.880> part

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
square root of 3 but that negative part

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.470 
square root of 3 but that negative part
that's<00:03:40.260> what<00:03:40.530> creates<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.070> eye<00:03:41.480> someone

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
that's what creates the eye someone

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.560 
that's what creates the eye someone
attack<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.020> eye<00:03:43.050> on<00:03:43.470> at<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.800> end<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:45.480> our

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
attack the eye on at the end so our

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.430 
attack the eye on at the end so our
answer<00:03:45.989> would<00:03:46.170> be<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.709> square<00:03:47.010> root<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.190> 3<00:03:47.459> I

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
answer would be the square root of 3 I

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.140 
answer would be the square root of 3 I
now<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.500> eye<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.800> not<00:03:50.040> underneath<00:03:50.910> the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
now the eye is not underneath the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.570 
now the eye is not underneath the
radical<00:03:51.690> that's<00:03:52.440> very<00:03:52.860> important<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.550> have

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
radical that's very important you have

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.910 
radical that's very important you have
to<00:03:53.820> make<00:03:54.120> sure<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.720> are<00:03:54.870> outside<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.800> the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
to make sure that you are outside of the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.630 
to make sure that you are outside of the
radical<00:03:56.130> before<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:57.060> put<00:03:57.450> in<00:03:57.570> your<00:03:57.720> eye

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
radical before you put in your eye

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.170 
radical before you put in your eye
hugely<00:03:59.640> important<00:04:01.280> ok<00:04:02.280> what<00:04:02.430> about<00:04:02.520> this<00:04:02.760> one

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
hugely important ok what about this one

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.390 
hugely important ok what about this one
here<00:04:03.930> again<00:04:04.050> let's<00:04:04.470> just<00:04:04.680> ignore<00:04:04.890> that<00:04:05.130> we're

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
here again let's just ignore that we're

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.820 
here again let's just ignore that we're
working<00:04:05.760> with<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.120> negative<00:04:06.630> if<00:04:06.959> we<00:04:07.530> just

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
working with the negative if we just

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.699 
working with the negative if we just
have<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.310> 18<00:04:08.880> then<00:04:09.720> we<00:04:09.900> would<00:04:10.050> say<00:04:10.320> that<00:04:10.350> would

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
have the 18 then we would say that would

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.310 
have the 18 then we would say that would
be<00:04:10.860> 9<00:04:11.130> times<00:04:11.489> 2<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.480> we<00:04:12.690> would<00:04:12.900> take<00:04:13.110> the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
be 9 times 2 and we would take the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.199 
be 9 times 2 and we would take the
square<00:04:13.590> root<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:13.950> each<00:04:14.130> one<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.430> those<00:04:14.700> and

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
square root of each one of those and

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.180 
square root of each one of those and
then<00:04:16.049> we<00:04:16.140> would<00:04:16.260> say<00:04:16.500> well<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.739> square<00:04:16.980> root

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
then we would say well the square root

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.509 
then we would say well the square root
of<00:04:17.250> 9<00:04:17.519> is<00:04:17.549> 3<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.690> we<00:04:19.560> can't<00:04:19.890> do<00:04:20.070> anything<00:04:20.100> with

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
of 9 is 3 and we can't do anything with

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.950 
of 9 is 3 and we can't do anything with
the<00:04:20.609> square<00:04:20.880> root<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.060> 2<00:04:21.239> so<00:04:21.479> we<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.780> leave

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
the square root of 2 so we have to leave

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.430 
the square root of 2 so we have to leave
it<00:04:22.280> but<00:04:23.280> because<00:04:23.729> we<00:04:24.270> had<00:04:24.539> that<00:04:24.750> negative

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
it but because we had that negative

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.070 
it but because we had that negative
underneath<00:04:25.770> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
underneath the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.350 
underneath the
radical<00:04:26.560> we<00:04:26.710> have<00:04:26.889> to<00:04:27.039> tack<00:04:27.310> on<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.819> eye<00:04:27.849> at

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
radical we have to tack on the eye at

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.350 
radical we have to tack on the eye at
the<00:04:28.509> end<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.860> this<00:04:30.099> would<00:04:30.310> be<00:04:30.490> 3<00:04:30.849> square<00:04:31.210> roots

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
the end so this would be 3 square roots

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.229 
the end so this would be 3 square roots
of<00:04:31.509> 2<00:04:31.569> I
