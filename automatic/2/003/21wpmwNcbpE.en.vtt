00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 talking planes are in front of everyone 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.020
 adult people always first time 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.670
 a bit strange 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.019

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.590
 That's why I have them now too 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.150
 review is chased directly 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.039
 one last one it came out the first part 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.690
 and it's about that and that again 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.010
 is still our race champion yet 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.650
 his gear because he is one 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.660
 plane does not work anymore so that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.519
 he can not fly anymore and races 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.590
 After an accident, he then goes to 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.170
 Firefighters should learn how to make forest fires 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.239
 deletes just as aviator and learned has 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.980
 even a little bit more than just 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.620
 extinguish fires but also just like you 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.940
 behaves as a hero like the whole 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.160
 Looks like you 're the trailer of the din 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.340
 iso indian hk call beats his 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.090
 with wind to make drum there 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.260
 with dollar comes complete and with lightning 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.309
 before 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.309
 I heard a drum 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.159
 what up at his altitude 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.620
 you were smaller i thought 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.830
 to become a lawyer firefighter 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.430
 All over the place makes the camper sad 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.560
 a party of my people makes the 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.980
 camper program that's what I said 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.980
 Yes 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.460
 I'll never understand why those are out 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.290
 a perfectly functioning plane 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.290
 we did not want to jump anymore 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:51.580
 out of this air on excuse me 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.010
 understood boss of the rim they have you 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.490
 thrown off the b17 you're in fact 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.700
 a bomb by tow truck 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:12.070
 Chassis off los shows you the wheels 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:15.660
 rossini permission granted the ready to go 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.430
 make unloading on the head of the board 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.930
 this guy all on what I say yes that 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.670
 had also just written out 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.670
 that too and that 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.630
 10 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.630
 charge 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.720
 make you refer 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.790
 how is wildlife going this evening? 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.790
 the party itself you some games 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:56.209
 that has made him fantastic 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.580
 chilli you can see it also plan 2 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.500
 quasi in the exact same look as the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.110
 first part was probably even 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.120
 produced directly one after the other and 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.450
 Generally, that's all very much 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.519
 after cars out so who cast the movies 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.800
 like who is also here from the stylish 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.420
 Stylistics well advised in any case 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.730
 but you also realize that it is not 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.860
 high budget animated film is so 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.120
 cost about 50 million dollars if 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.069
 to announce now that with track 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.849
 simply compares three to four times as 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.500
 was expensive 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.690
 then you also notice that the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.060
 animation not so over the top 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.230
 to detail total remains 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.660
 but always such a very sympathetic 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.120
 note i just believe as a human 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.769
 you can always find everything with cars and 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.959
 planes and once you get there 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.760
 at the same time in his own 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.470
 childhood is brought back one finds 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.390
 the first time very nice and that 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.640
 He makes the film too, he really is 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.769
 Incredibly harmless, it happens too 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.780
 not so much but he is very 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.540
 sympathetic and you like the story 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.160
 also just really see and you know 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.049
 also that as well the smaller kiddies 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.730
 which are always an incredible amount 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.769
 have fun with the film and if you have that 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.359
 just knows if you watch the movie goes 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.579
 one's heart too 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.079
 You do not have to be like that to the story itself 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.480
 say a lot because that is not now 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.730
 it is a classic one 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.310
 fallen hero in any kind and 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.489
 wisely returns to life and 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.530
 another task finds that is quite 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.329
 nice to look at but is now for everyone 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.550
 the three to four films in his life 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.930
 has not been surprising 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.850
 but that is not bad at all 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.050
 not even that just like the animation 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.240
 just did not say so now 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.880
 Outstanding are the 3d effects 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.190
 just in the somewhat spectacular flight 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.320
 look quite cool 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.240
 even if the fires are extinguished 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.860
 if a nice deep to the rear and 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.700
 at the same time from the plane then comes 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.260
 also forward 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.810
 So that's something I can do 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.160
 especially recommend him then with 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.230
 the smaller one 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.050
 sibling to watch the movie 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.220
 or just everybody who says I love you 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.360
 animated film I have to see everyone then 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.890
 You will not be totally crazy here either 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.970
 Disappointed from the cinema race of you 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.090
 I would still like to know now 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.880
 what are the movies you like to watch 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.260
 but preferably in the younger or with 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.590
 smaller siblings was that so 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.550
 your favorite little sibling 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.210
 movie also writes in the 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.280
 Comments 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.230
 my personal rating for plans 2 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.430
 even turns out a bit more positive 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.710
 as to the first part 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.270
 I give six out of ten points though 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.890
 I also have to take it into account 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.330
 is not a masterpiece of it now 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.580
 you can not find an animation either 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.890
 but must have seen at the same time 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.690
 he just unbelievably sweet unbelievable 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.010
 dear with a nice message and 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.140
 crisp short that one could say 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.880
 can comes above average is just 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.790
 That's why there are six out of ten points 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.280
 from me for place two preferred 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.970
 says I want a realfilm im 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.230
 see cinema 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.040
 I like it when people are a bit 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:45.050
 dancing sections maria poll in the 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.150
 Also the part of the canal still cares 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.920
 with it and who says but I want 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.180
 maybe stay home and 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.650
 more like a movie on the couch 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.760
 I can look at the couch classic 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.680
 recommend from the last sunday 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.150
 planet the monkey prevolution looks 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.160
