00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:13.970
 has caused this wonderful Sunday with 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:13.970
 the house to work a few meals 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.070
 up what we need is cover 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.960
 empanadas and but criollas I do not use it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.949
 skirts raised them if they take off the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.080
 that go to the oven 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.199
 What we do is stretch it out 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.910
 more or less a little more than double to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.289
 that remain with the stick in cross stick 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.420
 for a little flour ballast so that 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.449
 well finite and with a ring of 5 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.649
 centimeters approximately we are going 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.019
 making the circles calabrese the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.819
 tapitas is to clarify by means of the static 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.979
 for this that uses every pore and is 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:48.989
 terrific is great in favor of 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.170
 fork is very important and pricking 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.909
 the covers there look back and forth and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.069
 we 're going to take this to an oven with 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.709
 a plate with just barely in butter 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:01.379
 gives an average oven approximately 

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:04.609
 five minutes so that they are browned so that 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.609
 barely gild 100 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.369
 the idea is that it is well crispy not 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.170
 have to pass point in the oven 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.810
 has to stay there you do not have to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.119
 last too long and it was very very easy very 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.720
 easy with a sleeve I have a use of 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:27.210
 confectioner's milk you make a good one 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:33.210
 good amount of milk that actually 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.369
 they are populations that sometimes go to eat 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.619
 something sweet and it's great but it's already 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.020
 pita and to the diet I have a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.020
 ricky penguin and prepare a cee that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.810
 It tastes great with 200 grams of sugar 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.209
 impalpable and 50 cubic centimeters of 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.459
 orange what I did was adding the 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.649
 impalpable sugar orange juice 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.990
 and I was mixed with a beater hand 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.549
 and even achieve this texture but with the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.590
 amount there looks good 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.270
 with the amount that has just 200 of 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.340
 sugar impalpable and 50 centimeters 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.770
 cubic orange you have this class 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.399
 awesome and the gases go and then 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.259
 look forward or a dulce de leche and with 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.959
 this graphic with these caps that are 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.920
 super crunchy criollas I do not know I hope 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.200
 work 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.890
 for everything that I put together another and another and 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:28.730
 another and it was awesome 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.730
 the same with spectacular chocolate 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.300
 until it returns spectacular 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.580
 spectacular and it takes you out of trouble and they are 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.410
 very rich then and more you grab a 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.600
 determined or a certain type of 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.680
 cap to power for the new criolla 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.910
 squad because in one area then the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.610
 parents are going to break you are going to 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.380
 recognize all at leisure if you take away the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.019
 criollas the six strips that remain 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.120
 infinite and with a sharp 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.540
 approximately five centimeters or 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.370
 maracas you take the forms look and lazaro 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.830
 baked that diamond exactly 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.360
 plate enmantecada makes click with the 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.819
 fork you prick them well so you do not 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.170
 they influence you and about five minutes to oven 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.459
 moderate do not have to last 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.220
 too much if they are not going to break 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.350
 then the idea is you just see how 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.090
 they are scarcely marked in the oven 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.100
 perfect and with a desire for sweet milk 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.570
 pastry air were three tap and 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.570
 also more a triple please 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:33.170
 and we are very good we go for a cap 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.170
 generous has been a little 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.580
 a little 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.450
 a trifecta 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.140
 we are going to place first that space that is 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.720
 very simple you make an orange juice from 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.450
 50 cubic centimeters of orange beams 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.580
 a juice and you use 200 grams of 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.590
 sugar impalpable places the sugar 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.330
 impalpable in the bowl and you are adding 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.250
 the orange juice and with a shake if 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.770
 You take mixing by commenting until you achieve 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.780
 this texture that runs well well fine 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.420
 well with the amounts you have left 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.700
 perfect and you achieve this texture and that 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.650
 They fit perfectly in the bathroom then 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.040
 is the case ready all this bathroom to scale 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.880
 and spectacular you have some populations 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.150
 impressive for today in the afternoon to 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.500
 take some mates 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.870
 and how long I take you anything fast 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.610
 as quick as the cortecito and after 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.130
 of the court Mr. Juan Race was not going to 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:42.030
 be a pair of chocolate or we go with the 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.030
 cut and if we win why not 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.769
