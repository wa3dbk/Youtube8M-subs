 that they will be well firm basil 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.820
 parmesan cheese 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.410
 slack salt olive oil 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.380
 to heat and cook pasta 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:25.380
 and if you want we can add pepper 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.820
 very well then we start with what we 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.940
 start to heat the water put the salt 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.610
 and boil to be able to put 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.000
 after the pasta and cook them al 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.130

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.940
 we will take the tomatoes and we will 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.940
 cut into small pieces in ti 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.350
 a little kamel and in small cubes a 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.710
 once you have done in fine 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.220
 strips 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.280
 we group them all together and we 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.490
 cut them then small slats 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.530
 ok here and have done the four of the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.820
 same way the small square of what 1.8 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.350
 cm everyone knows well that we are too 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.479
 fat or too small ah yes small 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.400
 lamellae here it is smaller and better 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.510
 it's because after we go masters we 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.100
 do not cook 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.570
 I think lolo is ready we're going 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.770

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:25.920
 so we're reverse donates includes the 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.230
 basil that is washed we will take it 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.150
 several leaves at the same time 4 5 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.590
 leaves and cut into small pieces 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.220
 as we cut the tomatoes and still 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.989
 finer thin slats and then 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.450
 that's good smell 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.989
 good then jeanine pasta are almost 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.120
 cooked 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.470
 here I have a preparation with mini 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.040
 tomatoes and basil that is 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.870
 you still have to do 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.350
 it remains to add more oil 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.540
 olive how much I agree 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.980
 do not know the quantity but here we are 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.400
 already 5 tablespoons 6 spoons to 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.010
 soup 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.239
 no no no there are three generations ah 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.900
 yes so nice tablespoon when 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.310
 even to the authorities to me I love the oil 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.610
 olive salt did not miss a small 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.770
 little salt yeah so 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.380
 I would put half a spoon 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.660
 coffee here I would put there and mix 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.080
 we mix so we look a little bit 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.920
 if you have enough olive oil and after 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.260
 what is left to the expenses or 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.790
 by no we let the crow's feet 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.280
 retreat and put it after the mix 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.990
 on the pacts on the not agree well 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.830

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.290

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.230
 inside the one way map it's 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.870
 important here it is very important 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.910
 why she sticks okay everything from 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.640
 afterwards we put the mixture 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.120
 yeah the sauce and so we mix quickly 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.030
 do it quickly so as not always as 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.959

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.160
