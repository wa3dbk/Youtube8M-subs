well this is the finished product we

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.120 
well this is the finished product we
have<00:00:19.949> some<00:00:20.130> high-temperature<00:00:20.640> paint<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.570> here

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
have some high-temperature paint on here

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.640 
have some high-temperature paint on here
we're<00:00:23.130> gonna<00:00:23.249> fire<00:00:23.609> her<00:00:23.849> up<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.300> see<00:00:24.539> if<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.499> can

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
we're gonna fire her up to see if it can

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.819 
we're gonna fire her up to see if it can
withstand<00:00:26.749> if<00:00:27.749> the<00:00:27.929> paint<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.289> withstand<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
withstand if the paint can withstand the

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.120 
withstand if the paint can withstand the
temperature<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.900> not<00:00:31.019> blister<00:00:31.409> off<00:00:31.650> our<00:00:31.949> boar

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
temperature and not blister off our boar

temperature and not blister off our boar
burned<00:00:32.730> off<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.579> we're<00:00:36.210> gonna<00:00:36.300> fight<00:00:36.540> her<00:00:36.660> up

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:47.260 

all<00:00:40.080> right<00:00:40.350> let's<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:41.280> if<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:43.710> paint<00:00:43.980> branch

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.710 

I<00:00:47.300> surely<00:00:48.110> hope<00:00:48.380> not

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.840 

a<00:00:55.360> little<00:00:56.360> bit<00:00:56.450> of<00:00:56.540> cardboard<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.370> some<00:00:58.370> wood

a little bit of cardboard and some wood

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.630 
a little bit of cardboard and some wood
let's<00:01:02.920> see<00:01:03.920> if<00:01:03.980> we're<00:01:04.070> gonna<00:01:04.160> reverse<00:01:04.460> the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
let's see if we're gonna reverse the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
let's see if we're gonna reverse the
draft<00:01:04.910> on<00:01:05.150> it

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.850 

right<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.280> Draft<00:01:17.579> reversed

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.640 

well<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:22.100> would<00:01:22.220> appear<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.650> high

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
well it would appear that the high

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.530 
well it would appear that the high
temperature<00:01:25.220> paint<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.700> not<00:01:25.730> working<00:01:26.390> it's

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
temperature paint is not working it's

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.860 
temperature paint is not working it's
blistering<00:01:27.190> smoking<00:01:28.190> off<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:33.130> don't<00:01:34.130> paint

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
blistering smoking off so don't paint

your mini qeg this paint supposed to
withstand<00:01:39.970> 1500<00:01:42.700> degrees<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.840> looks<00:01:48.020> like

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
withstand 1500 degrees and it looks like

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.420 
withstand 1500 degrees and it looks like
it's<00:01:48.260> unable<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.710> do<00:01:48.950> so

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
it's unable to do so

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.170 
it's unable to do so
I<00:01:50.350> think<00:01:51.350> it'll<00:01:51.470> offer<00:01:51.680> some<00:01:52.070> protection<00:01:52.220> I

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
I think it'll offer some protection I

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.340 
I think it'll offer some protection I
don't<00:01:53.660> think<00:01:53.780> it's<00:01:53.900> going<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.110> completely

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
don't think it's going to completely

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.760 
don't think it's going to completely

burn off the cane so it'll help with

there<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.739> no<00:03:04.890> question<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.579> will<00:03:05.819> heat

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
there is no question that this will heat

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
the paint on the outside I think

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.089 
the paint on the outside I think
there'll<00:03:16.709> be<00:03:16.739> some<00:03:16.859> residual<00:03:18.290> layers<00:03:19.290> and

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
there'll be some residual layers and

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.869 
there'll be some residual layers and
there<00:03:20.310> might<00:03:20.459> be<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.639> benefit<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.450> but

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
there might be a benefit to it but

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.030 
there might be a benefit to it but
certainly<00:03:23.879> the<00:03:24.450> venting<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.049> chimney<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
certainly the venting the chimney the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.759 
certainly the venting the chimney the
capacity<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.639> will<00:03:27.379> probably<00:03:28.379> get<00:03:28.439> a<00:03:28.500> couple

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
capacity this will probably get a couple

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:29.839 
capacity this will probably get a couple

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
be a small finish on it still that will

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.560 
be a small finish on it still that will
help<00:04:40.210> protect<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:40.720> this<00:04:41.290> thing<00:04:41.500> heats<00:04:41.680> like

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
help protect it this thing heats like

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.980 
help protect it this thing heats like
absolutely<00:04:43.570> insane<00:04:45.150> alright<00:04:46.150> so<00:04:46.480> if<00:04:46.930> you

and<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:55.600> half<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:58.090> if<00:04:58.660> you<00:04:58.840> close<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.940> bottom

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450

halfway run for two and a half hours so

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.080 
halfway run for two and a half hours so
I<00:05:08.200> mean<00:05:08.560> it's<00:05:08.710> very<00:05:08.770> hot<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.550> just<00:05:09.730> burns

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
I mean it's very hot and it just burns

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.340 
I mean it's very hot and it just burns
pretty<00:05:10.420> much<00:05:10.570> completely<00:05:10.930> there's<00:05:11.140> very

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
pretty much completely there's very

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.910 
pretty much completely there's very
little<00:05:11.470> ash<00:05:11.680> on<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.860> bottom<00:05:12.360> so<00:05:13.740> if<00:05:14.740> you're

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
little ash on the bottom so if you're

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.630 
little ash on the bottom so if you're
not<00:05:15.010> eating<00:05:15.280> up<00:05:15.520> any<00:05:16.180> water<00:05:16.890> with<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:18.040> warming

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
not eating up any water with the warming

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.120 
not eating up any water with the warming
tray<00:05:19.140> you<00:05:20.140> can<00:05:20.260> put<00:05:20.410> a<00:05:20.440> couple<00:05:20.680> of<00:05:20.740> rocks<00:05:20.920> up

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
tray you can put a couple of rocks up

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.000 
tray you can put a couple of rocks up
here<00:05:21.370> just<00:05:21.670> to<00:05:21.790> retain<00:05:22.380> some<00:05:23.380> of<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.500> heat<00:05:23.560> so

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
here just to retain some of the heat so

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.130 
here just to retain some of the heat so
that<00:05:24.040> it's<00:05:24.280> not<00:05:24.820> all<00:05:24.880> flying<00:05:25.330> out<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.810> flue

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
that it's not all flying out the flue

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:33.000 
that it's not all flying out the flue
and<00:05:27.030> works<00:05:28.030> great<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:31.300> this<00:05:31.690> is<00:05:31.750> a<00:05:31.960> final<00:05:32.860> look

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
and works great and this is a final look

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.540 
and works great and this is a final look
at<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:34.660> stove<00:05:34.900> after<00:05:35.350> it<00:05:35.710> was<00:05:35.830> burned<00:05:36.130> with

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
at the stove after it was burned with

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.500 
at the stove after it was burned with
the<00:05:36.700> paint<00:05:36.940> on<00:05:37.120> it<00:05:39.030> patched<00:05:40.030> little<00:05:40.300> steel

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
the paint on it patched little steel

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.500 
the paint on it patched little steel
wool<00:05:40.720> over<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:41.080> I<00:05:41.290> would<00:05:42.250> say<00:05:42.460> 80%<00:05:43.000> of<00:05:43.450> the

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
wool over it I would say 80% of the

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.560 
wool over it I would say 80% of the
paint<00:05:43.720> is<00:05:43.780> still<00:05:43.930> on<00:05:44.580> so<00:05:45.580> it's<00:05:46.240> worth<00:05:46.420> putting

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
paint is still on so it's worth putting

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.830 
paint is still on so it's worth putting
on<00:05:46.780> you're<00:05:47.110> gonna<00:05:47.200> get<00:05:47.380> some<00:05:48.750> protection<00:05:49.750> from

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
on you're gonna get some protection from

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.180 
on you're gonna get some protection from
the<00:05:50.020> elements<00:05:50.110> with<00:05:50.830> it

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
the elements with it

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.600 
the elements with it
of<00:05:51.640> course<00:05:51.880> the<00:05:51.970> legs<00:05:52.180> are<00:05:53.370> fully<00:05:54.370> painted

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
of course the legs are fully painted

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.920 
of course the legs are fully painted
still<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:56.310> completely<00:05:57.310> intact<00:05:57.840> works<00:05:58.840> great

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
still and completely intact works great

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.300 
still and completely intact works great
I've<00:06:01.930> got<00:06:01.990> about<00:06:02.170> ten<00:06:02.470> hours<00:06:02.500> on<00:06:02.950> it<00:06:03.720> seems<00:06:04.720> to

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
I've got about ten hours on it seems to

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.020 
I've got about ten hours on it seems to
have<00:06:06.310> full<00:06:06.760> structural<00:06:07.540> integrity<00:06:09.030> aside

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
have full structural integrity aside

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.000

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
from the cosmetic got the paint there's

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.770 
from the cosmetic got the paint there's
been<00:06:12.310> nothing<00:06:12.610> else<00:06:12.850> wrong<00:06:13.030> with<00:06:13.090> it<00:06:13.360> works

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.300 
been nothing else wrong with it works
100%<00:06:14.350> as<00:06:14.800> a<00:06:14.830> heater<00:06:15.750> I<00:06:16.890> wouldn't<00:06:17.890> advise

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
100% as a heater I wouldn't advise

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.030 
100% as a heater I wouldn't advise
planning<00:06:19.240> on<00:06:19.300> cooking<00:06:19.570> on<00:06:19.840> it<00:06:20.110> you<00:06:20.830> certainly

planning on cooking on it you certainly

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.740 
planning on cooking on it you certainly
can<00:06:22.920> pasteurized<00:06:23.920> water<00:06:24.190> oil<00:06:24.550> water<00:06:25.330> on<00:06:25.630> your

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
first light up when you have you have

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.810 
first light up when you have you have
about<00:06:28.990> 25<00:06:29.440> percent<00:06:29.800> wood<00:06:30.010> in<00:06:30.250> it<00:06:30.400> and<00:06:30.580> you're

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
about 25 percent wood in it and you're

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.760 
about 25 percent wood in it and you're
letting<00:06:31.090> the<00:06:31.180> flames<00:06:31.480> hit<00:06:31.750> the<00:06:31.840> top<00:06:32.050> you'll

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
letting the flames hit the top you'll

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.260 
letting the flames hit the top you'll
get<00:06:32.980> a<00:06:33.010> boil<00:06:33.280> if<00:06:34.180> you<00:06:34.330> load<00:06:34.540> up<00:06:34.690> the<00:06:34.810> wood<00:06:35.190> and

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
get a boil if you load up the wood and

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.940 
get a boil if you load up the wood and
you<00:06:37.270> kind<00:06:37.480> of<00:06:37.600> Stoke<00:06:37.930> down<00:06:38.110> the<00:06:38.230> flame<00:06:38.500> it'll

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
you kind of Stoke down the flame it'll

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.680
