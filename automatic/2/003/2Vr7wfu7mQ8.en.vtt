enormity of what well it was truly
shocking<00:06:44.110> to<00:06:44.470> see<00:06:44.650> it<00:06:44.740> first<00:06:45.040> of<00:06:45.220> all<00:06:45.370> with

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
shocking to see it first of all with

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.780 
shocking to see it first of all with
thousands<00:06:46.450> of<00:06:46.600> trees<00:06:46.900> laid<00:06:47.560> low<00:06:47.890> by<00:06:48.220> the<00:06:48.460> wind

it<00:06:49.450> was<00:06:49.570> just<00:06:49.780> going<00:06:49.990> to<00:06:50.050> be<00:06:50.170> a<00:06:50.200> huge<00:06:50.530> project

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890 
it was just going to be a huge project

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.490 
it was just going to be a huge project
to<00:06:51.250> decide<00:06:51.640> what<00:06:52.030> to<00:06:52.210> do<00:06:52.420> and<00:06:52.720> how<00:06:52.750> to<00:06:53.020> do<00:06:53.380> it

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
to decide what to do and how to do it

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.590 
to decide what to do and how to do it
the<00:06:54.220> trees<00:06:54.490> fell<00:06:54.760> over<00:06:55.030> were<00:06:55.150> their<00:06:55.330> roots

the trees fell over were their roots

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.440 
the trees fell over were their roots
still<00:06:55.840> attached<00:06:56.260> so<00:06:56.710> there<00:06:56.950> this<00:06:57.790> species<00:06:58.120> in

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
still attached so there this species in

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.390 
still attached so there this species in
particular<00:06:58.750> sweet<00:06:59.230> chestnut<00:06:59.680> is<00:06:59.860> very<00:07:00.160> good

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
particular sweet chestnut is very good

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.430 
particular sweet chestnut is very good
at<00:07:00.520> regenerating<00:07:01.240> from<00:07:01.510> adventitious<00:07:01.990> buds

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 
at regenerating from adventitious buds

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.490 
at regenerating from adventitious buds
so<00:07:03.190> we<00:07:03.310> get<00:07:03.460> all<00:07:03.670> this<00:07:03.850> regrowth<00:07:04.440> elsewhere<00:07:05.440> in

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500 
so we get all this regrowth elsewhere in

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.800 
so we get all this regrowth elsewhere in
the<00:07:05.710> wood<00:07:05.890> the<00:07:06.340> decision<00:07:06.760> was<00:07:06.910> made<00:07:06.940> to<00:07:07.360> clear

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
the wood the decision was made to clear

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.110 
the wood the decision was made to clear
and<00:07:08.110> in<00:07:08.890> hindsight<00:07:09.220> I<00:07:09.520> think<00:07:09.850> that<00:07:09.970> was<00:07:10.090> a

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
and in hindsight I think that was a

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.210 
and in hindsight I think that was a
great<00:07:10.270> mistake<00:07:10.540> because<00:07:11.050> now<00:07:11.380> we<00:07:11.440> have<00:07:11.620> areas

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:12.220 
great mistake because now we have areas

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.310 
great mistake because now we have areas
where<00:07:12.460> there's<00:07:12.670> no<00:07:12.880> dead<00:07:13.180> wood<00:07:13.480> where<00:07:14.200> we

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320 
where there's no dead wood where we

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.750 
where there's no dead wood where we
haven't<00:07:14.530> got<00:07:14.800> the<00:07:15.010> habitat<00:07:15.460> for

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
haven't got the habitat for

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.610 
haven't got the habitat for
invertebrates<00:07:16.240> and<00:07:16.720> so<00:07:16.900> on<00:07:17.050> that<00:07:17.200> we<00:07:17.320> have<00:07:17.500> in

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
invertebrates and so on that we have in

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.130 
invertebrates and so on that we have in
this<00:07:17.740> very<00:07:18.040> rich<00:07:18.310> environment<00:07:19.000> here<00:07:19.270> I<00:07:19.510> think

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.140 
this very rich environment here I think

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.930 
this very rich environment here I think
the<00:07:20.200> big<00:07:20.380> lesson<00:07:20.710> we<00:07:20.830> have<00:07:20.860> learnt<00:07:21.280> is<00:07:21.520> that<00:07:21.550> we

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940 
the big lesson we have learnt is that we

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.790 
the big lesson we have learnt is that we
have<00:07:22.150> been<00:07:22.330> in<00:07:22.570> too<00:07:22.720> much<00:07:22.840> for<00:07:23.050> her<00:07:23.170> to<00:07:23.200> tidy<00:07:23.650> up

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
have been in too much for her to tidy up

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.860 
have been in too much for her to tidy up
