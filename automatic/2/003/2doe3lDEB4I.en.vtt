hey<00:00:06.930> scattering<00:00:07.710> 013<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.090> that

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
hey scattering 013 and this is that

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.940 
hey scattering 013 and this is that
enough<00:00:09.690> youth<00:00:10.170> level<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:12.290> this<00:00:13.290> level<00:00:13.349> was

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
enough youth level to this level was

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.769 
enough youth level to this level was
actually<00:00:14.460> kind<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.910> long<00:00:15.379> um<00:00:17.060> just<00:00:18.060> because<00:00:18.420> I

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
actually kind of long um just because I

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.689 
actually kind of long um just because I
was<00:00:19.020> trying<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.350> break<00:00:19.800> everything<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.580> get

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
was trying to break everything and get

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.230 
was trying to break everything and get
all<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> points<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:22.100> it's<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:24.000> one<00:00:24.150> of

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
all the points but it's just it's one of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.400 
all the points but it's just it's one of
those<00:00:24.330> levels<00:00:24.779> where<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.019> kind<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.199> have<00:00:25.380> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
those levels where you kind of have to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.080 
those levels where you kind of have to
go<00:00:25.949> back<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.340> forth<00:00:26.490> between<00:00:26.789> things<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:29.090> you

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
go back and forth between things so you

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.269 
go back and forth between things so you
know<00:00:30.240> he<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.349> need<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.679> patient<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
know he just need to be patient with it

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.970 
know he just need to be patient with it
which<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:33.079> honestly<00:00:34.079> get<00:00:34.320> kind<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.559> tired<00:00:34.800> of

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.679 
was in case you couldn't find it here is
me<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> duck<00:01:25.439> cannon<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:27.330> looks<00:01:27.600> like

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
me in the duck cannon and it looks like

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.020 
me in the duck cannon and it looks like
I<00:01:27.840> did<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.200> well<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.070> did<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:29.759> bad

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
I did really well but I did really bad

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.539 
I did really well but I did really bad
on<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.509> different<00:01:30.869> part<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.890> after<00:01:32.159> you'd<00:01:32.369> flip

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
on a different part so after you'd flip

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.920 
on a different part so after you'd flip
this<00:01:32.729> over<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.210> duck<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.780> come

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this over with the duck can and you come

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.250 
this over with the duck can and you come
jump<00:01:34.229> across<00:01:34.409> them<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.770> get<00:01:34.860> your<00:01:34.979> bottle

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
jump across them and get your bottle

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.400 
jump across them and get your bottle
so<00:01:36.830> this<00:01:37.010> is<00:01:37.130> where<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.400> lowered<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.600> mines

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
so this is where you lowered the mines

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.790 
so this is where you lowered the mines
earlier<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.310> there's<00:01:41.030> just<00:01:41.300> a<00:01:41.800> bottle

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
earlier and there's just a bottle

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.440 
earlier and there's just a bottle
hanging<00:01:43.130> out<00:01:43.370> in<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:44.030> water<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:47.270> was

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
hanging out in the water so that was

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.480 
hanging out in the water so that was
kind<00:01:47.660> of<00:01:47.690> surprised<00:01:48.680> here's<00:01:49.220> your<00:01:49.280> bottle

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
kind of surprised here's your bottle

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.130 
kind of surprised here's your bottle
it's<00:01:50.030> totally<00:01:50.420> obvious<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:50.870> you'll<00:01:51.020> probably

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
it's totally obvious so you'll probably

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.590 
it's totally obvious so you'll probably
miss<00:01:51.620> it<00:01:51.860> because<00:01:52.040> it's<00:01:52.910> easy<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.270> miss<00:01:53.390> things

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
miss it because it's easy to miss things

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.130 
miss it because it's easy to miss things
in<00:01:53.810> plain<00:01:53.990> sight<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:56.090> keys<00:01:56.300> just<00:01:56.630> back<00:01:56.840> in

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
in plain sight the keys just back in

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.600 
in plain sight the keys just back in
that<00:01:57.500> little<00:01:57.740> area<00:01:57.860> you're<00:01:58.190> going<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.370> have<00:01:58.460> to

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
that little area you're going to have to

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.490 
that little area you're going to have to
be<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.910> zombie<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.630> take<00:01:59.780> it<00:01:59.900> under<00:02:00.050> water<00:02:00.260> where

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
be a zombie to take it under water where

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.740 
be a zombie to take it under water where
the<00:02:00.650> chest<00:02:01.550> is<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.180> if<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.050> stay<00:02:03.230> a<00:02:03.260> zombie<00:02:03.680> i

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
the chest is so if you stay a zombie i
