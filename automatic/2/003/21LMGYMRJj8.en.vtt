what<00:01:57.459> year<00:01:57.729> started<00:01:58.209> under<00:01:58.539> nines<00:01:58.810> played<00:01:59.470> a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
what year started under nines played a

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.730 
what year started under nines played a
good<00:02:00.119> 127<00:02:01.119> games<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.479> think<00:02:01.660> so<00:02:01.810> far<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.200> couple

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
good 127 games I think so far a couple

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.770 
good 127 games I think so far a couple
of<00:02:02.860> seniors<00:02:03.250> but<00:02:03.459> mostly<00:02:04.119> just<00:02:04.300> through<00:02:04.660> the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
of seniors but mostly just through the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.109 
of seniors but mostly just through the
grades<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.110> stuff<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.530> guess<00:02:06.369> no<00:02:06.819> one<00:02:06.910> really

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
grades and stuff I guess no one really

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.059 
grades and stuff I guess no one really
encourages<00:02:07.720> me<00:02:07.840> but<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.319> see<00:02:08.500> other<00:02:08.800> people

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069
