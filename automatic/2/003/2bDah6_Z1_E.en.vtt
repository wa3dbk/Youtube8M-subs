we test all different styles and sizes
of<00:00:02.820> ATVs<00:00:03.449> here<00:00:03.780> on<00:00:03.899> dirt<00:00:04.110> tracks<00:00:04.290> but<00:00:04.890> there's

of ATVs here on dirt tracks but there's

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.089 
of ATVs here on dirt tracks but there's
no<00:00:05.400> question<00:00:05.970> we<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.629> most<00:00:07.020> fun<00:00:07.350> testing

part of the reason we like testing these

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.740 
part of the reason we like testing these
bikes<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.550> because<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:11.940> get<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.210> ride<00:00:12.450> them<00:00:12.630> on

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
bikes is because we get to ride them on
