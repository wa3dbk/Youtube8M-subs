00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and view and my opinion I think the four

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.390 
and view and my opinion I think the four
thousand<00:01:39.240> dollar<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:39.659> has<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.710> best<00:01:40.920> view

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
thousand dollar one has the best view

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.580 
thousand dollar one has the best view
but<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.270> depends<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.380> want<00:01:43.530> to
