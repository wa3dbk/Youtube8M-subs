the very cool thing about these sensors

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.539 
the very cool thing about these sensors
are<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.290> connect<00:01:46.649> wires<00:01:47.009> into

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
are is that you can connect wires into

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.280 
are is that you can connect wires into
the<00:01:48.270> sensor<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.189> triggered

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
the sensor here and have it be triggered

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.940 
the sensor here and have it be triggered
in<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> back<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.689> alert<00:01:54.950> receiver

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
in the back here of the alert receiver

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.539 
in the back here of the alert receiver
you'll<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.090> there's<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.509> those<00:01:57.719> little

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
you'll see that there's all those little

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.179 
you'll see that there's all those little
contacts<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.790> there<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.180> when<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.320> receiver

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
contacts in there and when this receiver

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.789 
contacts in there and when this receiver
gets<00:02:02.630> emotional<00:02:03.630> eart<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.560> send

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
gets emotional eart it's going to send

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.889 
gets emotional eart it's going to send
it's<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.909> send<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.299> signal<00:02:06.479> through<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
it's going to send a signal through the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.410 
it's going to send a signal through the
wire<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:07.979> door<00:02:08.190> sensor<00:02:08.610> which<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.270> going

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
wire to this door sensor which is going

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.999 
wire to this door sensor which is going
to<00:02:09.509> trigger<00:02:09.720> an<00:02:10.619> event

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
to trigger an event

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.460 
to trigger an event
and<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:12.510> cool<00:02:12.659> thing<00:02:12.810> about<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and the cool thing about this is it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.990 
and the cool thing about this is it
actually<00:02:13.500> comes<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.129> batteries<00:02:14.670> which<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:14.970> a

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
actually comes with batteries which is a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.869 
actually comes with batteries which is a
big<00:02:15.209> plus<00:02:15.420> it's<00:02:15.780> always<00:02:15.989> nice<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.200> see<00:02:16.349> that

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
big plus it's always nice to see that

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.550 
big plus it's always nice to see that
okay<00:02:17.879> step<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.930> be<00:02:19.049> setting<00:02:19.439> up

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
okay step one is going to be setting up

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.250 
okay step one is going to be setting up
the<00:02:19.709> transmitters<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.810> for<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.959> you're

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
the transmitters and for this you're

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.539

is<00:03:02.069> channel<00:03:02.459> one<00:03:02.639> and<00:03:03.500> we<00:03:04.500> look<00:03:04.680> at<00:03:04.799> my<00:03:04.920> second

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
is channel one and we look at my second

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.849 
is channel one and we look at my second
one<00:03:05.430> over<00:03:05.670> here<00:03:05.909> if<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.599> first<00:03:06.840> ones<00:03:07.079> off<00:03:07.290> and

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
one over here if the first ones off and

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.770 
one over here if the first ones off and
the<00:03:08.310> second<00:03:08.670> ones<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.209> would<00:03:09.299> be<00:03:09.420> channel

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
the second ones on that would be channel

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.220 
the second ones on that would be channel
two

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
two

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.440 
two
now<00:03:10.829> there's<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.549> couple<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.180> other<00:03:12.359> different

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
now there's a couple of other different

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.309 
now there's a couple of other different
things<00:03:12.959> on<00:03:13.440> here<00:03:13.889> some<00:03:14.730> jumpers<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.319> the

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
things on here some jumpers and the

things on here some jumpers and the
first<00:03:16.560> one<00:03:16.879> right<00:03:17.879> here<00:03:18.150> reset<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.859> set

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
first one right here reset you can set

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.900 
first one right here reset you can set
it<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.690> reset<00:03:21.690> after<00:03:21.900> 10<00:03:22.470> seconds<00:03:22.919> or<00:03:23.040> 120<00:03:23.790> I

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
it to reset after 10 seconds or 120 I

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.379 
it to reset after 10 seconds or 120 I
have<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.299> set<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.720> 10<00:03:25.139> the<00:03:26.099> second<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.549> is<00:03:26.699> the

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
have it set to 10 the second one is the

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.430 
have it set to 10 the second one is the
important<00:03:27.780> one<00:03:27.870> you're<00:03:27.989> going<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.139> have<00:03:28.230> to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
important one you're going to have to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.490 
important one you're going to have to
change<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.919> it<00:03:29.099> came<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.760> off<00:03:29.910> position

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
change this it came in the off position

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.259 
change this it came in the off position
you<00:03:31.500> need<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.709> change<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.129> to<00:03:32.280> on<00:03:32.519> when<00:03:33.120> this

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
you need to change that to on when this

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.890 
you need to change that to on when this
is<00:03:33.449> on<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:34.109> means<00:03:34.379> that<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:35.900> motion

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
is on that means that this motion

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.589 
is on that means that this motion
detector<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.650> set<00:03:37.889> up<00:03:38.040> for<00:03:38.310> outside<00:03:38.790> when<00:03:39.449> it's

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
detector is set up for outside when it's

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.839 
detector is set up for outside when it's
off<00:03:39.900> its<00:03:40.319> supposed<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.919> be<00:03:41.069> set<00:03:41.250> up<00:03:41.280> for<00:03:41.400> inside

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
off its supposed to be set up for inside

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.629 
off its supposed to be set up for inside
so<00:03:42.209> make<00:03:42.359> sure<00:03:42.389> you<00:03:42.569> do<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:42.810> on<00:03:43.019> an<00:03:43.430> LED<00:03:44.430> you

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
so make sure you do that on an LED you

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.729 
so make sure you do that on an LED you
can<00:03:45.180> turn<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:45.480> on<00:03:45.540> or<00:03:45.720> off<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.260> have<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.590> on

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
can turn that on or off I have it on

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.800 
can turn that on or off I have it on
what<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.549> means<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.940> every<00:03:48.120> time<00:03:48.299> motion<00:03:48.720> is

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
what that means is every time motion is

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.680 
what that means is every time motion is
detected<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:50.250> tiny<00:03:50.579> little<00:03:50.819> LED<00:03:51.419> right

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
detected this tiny little LED right

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.979 
detected this tiny little LED right
there<00:03:51.959> will<00:03:52.560> turn<00:03:52.799> on<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.419> the<00:03:54.419> last<00:03:54.720> thing

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
there will turn on and the last thing

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.369 
there will turn on and the last thing
right<00:03:55.169> here<00:03:55.379> is<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.639> the<00:03:57.209> range<00:03:57.750> jumper

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
right here is this is the range jumper

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.330 
right here is this is the range jumper
you<00:03:58.980> have<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.159> low<00:03:59.579> medium<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.720> high<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.340> if

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
you have a low medium and a high and if

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.000 
you have a low medium and a high and if
you<00:04:02.579> set<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:02.849> too<00:04:03.060> high<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.569> means<00:04:04.530> that

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
you set it too high that means that

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.589 
you set it too high that means that
it'll<00:04:05.579> detect<00:04:06.000> motion

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
it'll detect motion

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.879 
it'll detect motion
you<00:04:06.959> know<00:04:07.079> from<00:04:07.409> 50<00:04:07.949> feet<00:04:08.549> or<00:04:08.760> further<00:04:09.889> medium

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
you know from 50 feet or further medium

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.219 
you know from 50 feet or further medium
I<00:04:11.010> think<00:04:11.250> is<00:04:11.400> 20<00:04:11.879> to<00:04:12.060> 50<00:04:12.449> which<00:04:12.659> is<00:04:12.690> what<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:12.989> have

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
I think is 20 to 50 which is what I have

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.490 
I think is 20 to 50 which is what I have
it<00:04:13.379> set<00:04:13.590> on<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.010> low<00:04:14.729> is

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.990 

according<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.650> documents<00:04:19.220> low<00:04:19.459> is<00:04:19.729> less

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
according to the documents low is less

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.360 
according to the documents low is less
than<00:04:20.239> 20<00:04:20.630> feet<00:04:20.660> so<00:04:21.590> that's<00:04:21.949> what<00:04:22.099> you<00:04:22.190> have<00:04:22.280> to

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
than 20 feet so that's what you have to

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.059 
than 20 feet so that's what you have to
do<00:04:22.490> for<00:04:22.610> step<00:04:22.849> one<00:04:23.060> step<00:04:24.020> two<00:04:24.259> we<00:04:24.590> want<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.800> open

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:25.069 
do for step one step two we want to open

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.150 
do for step one step two we want to open
up<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.340> receiver<00:04:26.060> here<00:04:26.419> and<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.800> first<00:04:28.009> thing

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
up the receiver here and the first thing

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.559 
up the receiver here and the first thing
we<00:04:28.250> want<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.430> check<00:04:28.490> is<00:04:28.819> to<00:04:28.849> make<00:04:29.000> sure<00:04:29.150> that

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
we want to check is to make sure that

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.330 
we want to check is to make sure that
our<00:04:29.630> dip<00:04:30.050> switch<00:04:30.289> is<00:04:30.500> one<00:04:30.680> through<00:04:30.889> eight<00:04:31.069> are

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
our dip switch is one through eight are

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.760 
our dip switch is one through eight are
the<00:04:31.849> same<00:04:32.120> as<00:04:32.360> on<00:04:32.539> our<00:04:32.569> motion<00:04:33.229> detector

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
the same as on our motion detector

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.029 
the same as on our motion detector
transmitters<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:35.020> as<00:04:36.020> you<00:04:36.440> can<00:04:36.530> see<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.740> have

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
transmitters and as you can see I have

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.740 
transmitters and as you can see I have
them<00:04:37.220> all<00:04:37.400> in<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.639> off<00:04:37.789> position<00:04:38.030> which<00:04:38.569> is

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
them all in the off position which is

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.129 
them all in the off position which is
the<00:04:38.780> same<00:04:39.699> so<00:04:40.699> with<00:04:40.849> that<00:04:40.970> said<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:42.110> only

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
the same so with that said the only

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.900 
the same so with that said the only
thing<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.620> we<00:04:42.830> have<00:04:42.949> to<00:04:42.979> do<00:04:43.160> now<00:04:43.340> is<00:04:43.580> we<00:04:43.880> have

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
thing that we have to do now is we have

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.589 
thing that we have to do now is we have
to<00:04:44.210> run<00:04:44.630> some<00:04:44.870> wire<00:04:45.130> into<00:04:46.130> these<00:04:46.280> little<00:04:46.669> ports

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
to run some wire into these little ports

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.800 
to run some wire into these little ports
right<00:04:47.840> here<00:04:48.080> I<00:04:48.340> just<00:04:49.340> have<00:04:49.520> some<00:04:49.759> regular<00:04:49.940> 16

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
right here I just have some regular 16

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.649 
right here I just have some regular 16

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
normally open one right there so we'll

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.070 
normally open one right there so we'll
do<00:05:19.130> that<00:05:19.159> we'll<00:05:19.550> tighten<00:05:19.759> it<00:05:19.909> up<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.630> I<00:05:20.900> have

tightened in there now I have two

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.339 
tightened in there now I have two
sensors<00:05:26.120> here<00:05:26.300> so<00:05:26.360> I'm<00:05:26.599> taking<00:05:26.750> advantage<00:05:27.229> of

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
sensors here so I'm taking advantage of

these sensors to work

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:31.519 
these sensors to work
and<00:06:30.269> you<00:06:30.449> get<00:06:30.569> triggered<00:06:30.899> properly<00:06:31.259> you<00:06:31.379> need

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 
and you get triggered properly you need

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:34.699 
and you get triggered properly you need
to<00:06:31.619> have<00:06:31.739> the<00:06:31.860> cover<00:06:32.099> on<00:06:32.369> them<00:06:32.579> these<00:06:33.539> covers<00:06:34.289> I

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:34.709 
to have the cover on them these covers I

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:37.279 
to have the cover on them these covers I
kind<00:06:35.219> of<00:06:35.339> had<00:06:35.519> to<00:06:35.549> cut<00:06:36.059> open<00:06:36.269> to<00:06:36.749> get<00:06:36.959> the<00:06:36.989> wires

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
kind of had to cut open to get the wires

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.469 
kind of had to cut open to get the wires
through<00:06:38.719> seemed<00:06:39.719> to<00:06:39.839> work<00:06:39.929> pretty<00:06:40.019> good<00:06:40.409> so<00:06:41.479> if

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 
through seemed to work pretty good so if

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.509 
through seemed to work pretty good so if
I<00:06:42.599> trigger<00:06:42.899> some<00:06:43.199> motion<00:06:43.559> right<00:06:43.739> here<00:06:43.799> you

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:44.519 
I trigger some motion right here you

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:45.739 
I trigger some motion right here you
should<00:06:44.549> keep<00:06:44.909> an<00:06:45.089> eye<00:06:45.179> right<00:06:45.389> there<00:06:45.449> you'll

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:45.749 
should keep an eye right there you'll

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:47.659 
should keep an eye right there you'll
see<00:06:45.929> that<00:06:46.049> light<00:06:46.319> flash<00:06:46.919> right<00:06:47.189> there<00:06:47.429> and

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
see that light flash right there and

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.639 
see that light flash right there and
then<00:06:47.969> you'll<00:06:48.089> hear<00:06:48.239> this<00:06:48.419> box<00:06:48.749> as<00:06:49.110> the<00:06:49.289> relay

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:49.649 
then you'll hear this box as the relay

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:54.319 
then you'll hear this box as the relay
clicks<00:06:50.129> so<00:06:50.519> let's<00:06:50.969> try<00:06:51.269> it<00:06:51.389> out<00:06:51.539> it<00:06:53.239> there<00:06:54.239> we

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:54.329 
clicks so let's try it out it there we

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:58.359 
clicks so let's try it out it there we
go<00:06:54.479> it<00:06:54.809> works

00:06:58.359 --> 00:06:58.369 

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.979 

keep<00:06:59.369> an<00:06:59.519> eye<00:06:59.639> down<00:06:59.699> right<00:07:00.389> down<00:07:00.569> there<00:07:00.809> for

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:00.989 
keep an eye down right down there for

00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:08.239 
keep an eye down right down there for
that<00:07:01.169> led<00:07:02.029> as<00:07:03.029> we<00:07:03.269> trigger<00:07:03.569> it<00:07:05.209> there<00:07:06.209> we<00:07:06.360> go<00:07:07.249> we

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:08.249 
that led as we trigger it there we go we

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:12.559 
that led as we trigger it there we go we
have<00:07:08.279> ourselves<00:07:08.610> a<00:07:09.269> z-wave<00:07:10.189> Drive<00:07:11.189> way<00:07:11.569> to
