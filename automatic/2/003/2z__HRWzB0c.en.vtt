00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
these are these in particular are a very

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.879 
these are these in particular are a very
thin<00:04:49.190> material<00:04:49.340> so<00:04:50.120> they've<00:04:50.780> kind<00:04:51.139> of<00:04:51.229> taken<00:04:51.290> a

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
thin material so they've kind of taken a

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.439 
thin material so they've kind of taken a
bit<00:04:52.760> of<00:04:52.880> like<00:04:53.240> wear<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.320> tear<00:04:54.590> at<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:55.760> sole<00:04:56.060> I

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
can't really show that here but um

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.300 
can't really show that here but um
that's<00:04:59.270> probably<00:04:59.660> because<00:04:59.930> I<00:05:00.199> don't<00:05:00.560> properly

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
that's probably because I don't properly

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.300
