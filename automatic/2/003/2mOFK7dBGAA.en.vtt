 hi friends today I will talk about animals 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.879

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.010
 let's start the brown bear lives in the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.290
 communities of asturias castilla and león 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.570
 cantabria and galicia and the scarce 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.130

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.500
 the Pyrenees are located 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.359
 sporadically in Aragon and Navarre in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.180
 Currently there are three populations 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.490
 two in the Cantabrian mountain range with 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 100 bears and another one in the Pyrenees with 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.429
 around 15 17 copies the causes 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.590

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.719
 the damage to the livestock sector the hunting and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.120
