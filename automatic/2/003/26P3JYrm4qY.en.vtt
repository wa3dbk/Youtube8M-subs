00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
just roll your mouse over and see them

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.639 
just roll your mouse over and see them
before<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:02.320> after<00:01:02.680> example<00:01:03.579> there<00:01:04.440> also<00:01:05.440> we

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
before and after example there also we

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.010 
before and after example there also we
have<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.979> ability<00:01:06.399> with<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.000> two<00:01:07.479> steps<00:01:07.810> that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
have the ability with the two steps that

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.230 
have the ability with the two steps that
you<00:01:08.050> see<00:01:08.290> here<00:01:08.649> to<00:01:08.890> click<00:01:09.430> on<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.970> steps

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
you see here to click on the steps

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.350 
you see here to click on the steps
multiple<00:01:10.690> times<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.110> add<00:01:11.560> extra<00:01:12.280> intensity<00:01:13.149> to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
multiple times to add extra intensity to

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.690 
multiple times to add extra intensity to
the<00:01:13.390> effect<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:14.830> first<00:01:15.130> step<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.550> we

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
the effect so the first step that we

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.430 
the effect so the first step that we
have<00:01:15.910> here<00:01:16.210> is<00:01:16.330> cross<00:01:16.600> processing<00:01:16.900> that

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
have here is cross processing that

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.590 
have here is cross processing that
changes<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.010> color<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.610> image<00:01:18.880> so<00:01:19.510> I'm

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
changes the color of the image so I'm

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.120 
changes the color of the image so I'm
going<00:01:19.750> to<00:01:19.780> click<00:01:19.960> it<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.229> couple<00:01:20.440> of<00:01:20.590> times<00:01:20.860> to

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
going to click it a couple of times to

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.090 
going to click it a couple of times to
increase<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:22.049> intensity<00:01:23.049> of<00:01:23.320> this<00:01:23.650> effect

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
increase the intensity of this effect

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.670 
increase the intensity of this effect
and<00:01:24.400> then<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.420> second<00:01:25.810> step<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.380> apply<00:01:26.470> a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
and then the second step is to apply a

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.679 
and then the second step is to apply a
vignette<00:01:27.190> that's<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:27.970> darkening<00:01:28.479> of<00:01:28.659> the

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
vignette that's the darkening of the

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.520 
vignette that's the darkening of the
edges<00:01:29.200> around<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.330> sides<00:01:31.330> of<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.960> photo<00:01:32.200> and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
edges around the sides of the photo and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.899 
edges around the sides of the photo and
I'm<00:01:32.710> going<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:32.920> hit<00:01:33.010> that<00:01:33.159> a<00:01:33.220> couple<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.610> times

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
I'm going to hit that a couple of times

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.060 
I'm going to hit that a couple of times
as<00:01:34.119> well<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:34.540> then<00:01:34.990> just<00:01:35.200> go<00:01:35.350> down<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.590> click

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
as well and then just go down and click

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.270 
as well and then just go down and click
on<00:01:36.220> done<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:37.000> complete<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.570> process<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.979> we<00:01:39.159> go

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
on done to complete the process if we go

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.580 
on done to complete the process if we go
and<00:01:39.460> look<00:01:39.520> at<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.790> full<00:01:40.060> photo<00:01:40.409> version<00:01:41.409> now

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
and look at the full photo version now

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.190 
and look at the full photo version now
you'll<00:01:41.920> see<00:01:42.310> that<00:01:42.549> we<00:01:42.759> have<00:01:43.170> three<00:01:44.170> different

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
you'll see that we have three different

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.249 
you'll see that we have three different
layers<00:01:45.030> associated<00:01:46.030> with<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.360> image<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
layers associated with the image and the

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.109 
layers associated with the image and the
good<00:01:47.500> thing<00:01:47.680> about<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:48.159> is<00:01:48.369> that<00:01:48.670> we<00:01:48.970> can

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
good thing about that is that we can

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.940 
good thing about that is that we can
actually<00:01:49.270> come<00:01:49.659> through<00:01:49.689> and<00:01:50.200> select<00:01:50.470> those

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
actually come through and select those

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.230 
actually come through and select those
layers<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.900> adjust<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.259> opacity<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.759> each<00:01:55.090> of

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
layers and adjust the opacity of each of

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.830 
layers and adjust the opacity of each of
those<00:01:55.329> layers<00:01:55.630> or<00:01:56.250> keeping<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.400> mind<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:58.030> we

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
those layers or keeping in mind that we

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.460 
those layers or keeping in mind that we
have<00:01:59.350> some<00:02:00.310> new<00:02:00.659> masking<00:02:01.659> options<00:02:02.110> available

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
have some new masking options available

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.370 
have some new masking options available
in<00:02:02.860> photoshop<00:02:03.400> elements<00:02:03.579> 9<00:02:03.970> we<00:02:04.509> can<00:02:04.689> add<00:02:04.990> in<00:02:05.290> a

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
in photoshop elements 9 we can add in a

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.770 
in photoshop elements 9 we can add in a
mask<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:07.240> fill<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:07.720> mask<00:02:08.019> with<00:02:08.530> black

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.980 

and<00:02:14.650> then<00:02:15.010> we<00:02:15.190> can<00:02:15.340> go<00:02:15.520> ahead<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.090> select<00:02:16.660> a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
and then we can go ahead and select a

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.130 
and then we can go ahead and select a
brush<00:02:17.200> tool<00:02:17.530> make<00:02:18.340> sure<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.730> brush<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.330> set<00:02:19.959> to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
brush tool make sure the brush is set to

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.290 
brush tool make sure the brush is set to
white<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:22.720> can<00:02:22.900> actually<00:02:23.310> brush<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.640> some

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
white and we can actually brush in some

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.449 
white and we can actually brush in some
of<00:02:25.420> those<00:02:25.510> effects<00:02:25.959> where<00:02:26.800> we<00:02:27.010> want<00:02:27.250> them<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
of those effects where we want them to

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.330 
of those effects where we want them to
be<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:28.000> choose<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.959> leave<00:02:29.260> them<00:02:29.590> or<00:02:29.830> minimize

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
be and choose to leave them or minimize

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.420 
be and choose to leave them or minimize
them<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.850> other<00:02:31.510> parts<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.140> photo<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:33.280> we

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
them in other parts of the photo so we

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.400 
them in other parts of the photo so we
have<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.610> lot<00:02:33.819> more<00:02:33.940> control<00:02:34.270> over<00:02:34.600> what's

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
have a lot more control over what's

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.580 
have a lot more control over what's
going<00:02:35.770> on<00:02:35.950> with<00:02:36.370> those<00:02:36.580> effects<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.140> try<00:02:38.350> using

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
going on with those effects so try using

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.330 
going on with those effects so try using
the<00:02:38.950> lomo<00:02:39.760> effect<00:02:40.209> or<00:02:40.530> toy<00:02:41.530> camera<00:02:41.950> effect

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
the lomo effect or toy camera effect

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.390 
the lomo effect or toy camera effect
guided<00:02:42.850> edit<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.300> then<00:02:43.330> go<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.739> edit<00:02:44.980> some

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
guided edit and then go in and edit some

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.300 
guided edit and then go in and edit some
of<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.760> layers<00:02:46.420> for<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.410> effect<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:48.130> get<00:02:48.280> a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
of the layers for that effect to get a

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.920 
of the layers for that effect to get a
little<00:02:48.430> bit<00:02:48.640> more<00:02:48.790> control<00:02:49.120> over<00:02:49.420> what's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
little bit more control over what's

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.000 
little bit more control over what's
happening<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.950> actual<00:02:51.250> image<00:02:51.610> itself
