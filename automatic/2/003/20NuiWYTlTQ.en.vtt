00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.689
 if one fails the other is acting 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.060

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.080
 capivara capacity and autonomy of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.930
 liters of gasoline 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.509
 are 96 liters of gasoline is enough 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.640
 for an autonomy of a 195 hp engine 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.290
 also it has a dumpster that affects one 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.899
 I did the test now, it does not move and it does not 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.750
 her 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.960
 the hull has a wide bottom area and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.670
 this provides you with a stable 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.079
 differentiated capacity of 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.270

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.960
 a 175 hp engine 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.479

 You do not know that piece that it goes up and 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.200
 down in the case of picking up low and also 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.510
 to provide stability in navigation 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.459

 de polozzi some curves are you tava 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.910
 commenting with me also that you 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.170
 to suddenly stop one is that the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.730
 others even get water inside 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.890
 they do not have a small splash 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.260
 exactly one boat was designed to 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.390
 do not make famous the famous pec 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.130
 then you can cut the engine to 60 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.620
 miles for example if you have a 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.480
 electric fault the problem of lack of 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.590
 you will not have any problem with 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.299
 rear deck pirate if flooded 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.400
 You can see that the boat is 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.800
 always in a stable situation 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.080
 You have the steering wheel always soft you. 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.669
 can navigate with tranquility because 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.070
 you need not be placing the hand 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.960
 steering wheel to be correcting 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.070
 often the Baptist's ability 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.920
 always stable 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.810
 you can make sharp turns and can 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.810
 see that I'm using only the old 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.290
 to make the turn and the boat will make the 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.560
 Curve was not playing you have a 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.140
 reasonable position of scrambled water 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.770
 Even so, the most I can turn 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.750
 all the steering wheel 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.970
 I do not even need to put it before 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.120
 there were curves choose the touch the boat did not 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.889
 It's playing but not only do I shoot badass. 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.889
 it already stabilizes itself 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.660
 Good people, it's good to sail with this one. 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.540
 boat a lot of stability mainly 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.460
 in the curves it's worth you to make a 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.160
 test drive if you take a test drive 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.750
