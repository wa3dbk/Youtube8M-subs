00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.910
 add in playstation plus so much for 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.480
 way of playstation 4 playstation3 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.489

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.679

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.099
 remove will be the binding of isaac 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.269
 revive the playstation 4 ips avoids 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:39.300
 steam world digital force raf ps night 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:41.460
 prime club phrases of hungry heart and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.109
 mom script is to say everyone change the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.520
 last month they take us this month there's no 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.190
 no novelty that the logical 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.580
 and the chosen ones are the games that go to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.950
 Add 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.330
 well then we started with the additions to 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:59.470
 playstation 4 1 is the iniesta bots among 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.450
 us ultimate edition that is the version 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.840
 full of iniesta is good I already the 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.970
 I have acquired it some time ago 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.550
 is what you wanted a fighting game 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.910
 I had to go for years 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.990
 because there was little variety at the beginning 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.660
 well we're good I do not know if there are any 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.000
 more the truth if there will be few of 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.980
 I do not know many fight but good 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.040
 is one of the add-ons this game 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.630
 fights of the universe of warner good then 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.159
 with batman superman 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.869
 arrow the joker and so on 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.130
 it's such a recognized game so I 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.749
 I think it goes without saying much more 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.550
 of this game was simply added to 

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.590
 pepsi are 4 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.350
 the next added game will be secret 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.690
 ponchos 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.410
 It is a good game for 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.290
 action game in action principle 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.140
 from the west is a game a track 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.680
 perspective from above let's say a 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.680
 third person perspective 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 graphically 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.100
 it's pretty good let's say you have a 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.520
 paints a pretty cool design and such 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.520
 but good 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.120
 in 3d 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.530
 a hack and slash I would say too 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.380
 shots you have to have 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.550
 Well, a little skill and so on 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.200
 the game seems not bad but there will be 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.670
 that seeing it the truth is that it is not a 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.030
 simple to not much less but good 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.640
 the Indian are you for much of what 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.380
 are giving lately the truth is that 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.700
 It is not all bad, although it is also 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.250
 obvious that many people who have this 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.780
 game but obviously also where 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.690
 they are going to give one of the last ones is also 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.730
 logical good with abs 3 we have two 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.239
 games one is the darling prize start 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.100
 live cut and the other old film and 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.200
 well the first one I said the dead 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.410
 free ammo is a game a little 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.780
 I miss the truth is that it is a game that 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.370
 it's similar to resident evil styles but 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.530
 it's not like that either, it's a game 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.940
 let's say of survival horror I think there will be 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.010
 that try to give it a chance to 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.840
 lending this game looks like having 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.180
 an interesting plot but they have not given 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.060
 very good notes to this type of games 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.400
 no to this game in general I do not know why 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.410
 the truth will have to be tested and see what 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.300
 such is 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.970
 the next title is the chosen one 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.560
 maintained today and good hd and mandrill today 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.960
 and what it has is a remastering 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.270
 of the first hitman in hd for the 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.780
 consoles then 7 in quotes let's go 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.010
 talk about playstation 3 and playstation 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.430
 mono and xbox 360 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.560
 Well, that's a game 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.980
 mastered of the first hitman in hd 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.740
 which is pretty good makes you 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.450
 relive the previous games the 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.970
 Previous games added in 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.450
 playstation 2 for example 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.170
 and has a whole trilogy with the 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.240
 minigame of sniper challenge also the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.590
 true that good are some games that 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.870
 they are pretty good in general if you 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.840
 like stealth and so on is a game that 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.610
 I am highly recommended and it does not appear bad 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.170
 this 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.440
 this game won by the precision that 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.330
 it's in the looks pretty good 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.500
 and good to finish we have the 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.810
 precision games 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.850
 These games are 2 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.180
 no two is a triple fairy game 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.010
 are less well known games in this 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.740
 month the attraction for ps vita is 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.660
 pretty bad and we have the final 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.100
 horizon of your games strategies that 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.990
 we have to build defenses and so on 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.330
 to try not to kill us 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.330
 typical aliens possession game 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.810
 try to survive and the other 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.730
 access is alive of good as the page 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.980
 invaders that come salts too 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.969
 do the two are more or less the same 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.089
 thematic 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:57.860
 is the typical matamarcianos 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.839
 that you are looking down on the 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.909
 Martians and where equipping up 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:04.039
 then it does not have many mysteries to the 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.529
 games are games that we anti-employees 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.639
 they are games 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:12.789
 indicates out games that good after 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.549
 to spend a while is fine but not what 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:18.639
 I see the truth for a long time 

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:20.289
 that the other cycle in conclusion is a 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.749
 different update a station that 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.569
 one that does not bring so many indies is something 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:27.009
 positive for users of 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.020
 playstation plus that were on top of 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.729
 the Indians for example for 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.440
 for playstation 4 we have the 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.379
 opportunity to try the new style 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.479
 those who do not have it and give a game of 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.879
 fights and being able to play also online 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:43.080
 this will also create a greater attractiveness 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.080
 to play with friends and others 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.080
 you think ponchos for good is a game yes 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.520
 that is destitute out is not a game 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.020
 triple to but supposedly good 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.030
 it can be entertaining but I have 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.500
 one of each have to leave a little me 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.410
 I referred earlier also then 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.759
 we have the dalÃ­ premonition and the hitman 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.139
 treelogic that also seems to me a 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.820
 good application for the part of 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.699
 playstation 3 a survival game 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.130
 horror and one that good is a classic one 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:07.389
 trilogy and then while avoiding so 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.039
 the truth is that burned a little bit 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.050
 cut with our two games a little 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.270
 index a little plan to hang out 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.960
 but it's usually an authorization 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:19.689
 very good in quotes good not going 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.699
 to say very good in its good for 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:24.110
 those with several platforms carry 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.600
 one case I have 3 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.790
 surely, yes, give him a chance 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.850
 to which struck the new star I already have it and 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.430
 company 63 and check that daily 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.260
 premonition and the hitman of today and nothing 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.550
 remember that as I said on day 3 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.170
 December is when they do the 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.480
 change the games this past month will 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.940
 will be eliminated and included will include
