00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello guys welcome to a new one 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.560
 watercolor episode for beginners 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.000
 in this video we will see how to make it 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.519
 the lights and shadows in a very manner 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.049
 simple and we will use 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.049
 the classic example of the sphere 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.650
 so if you want to know how it's done 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.650
 follow this tutorial 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.109
 but before we go on to color we see 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.149
 with pencils draw a circle 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.920
 decide which side will come to light 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.550
 I get it from the left in 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.079
 tall and oblique, then take three 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.180
 gray tones a lighter one 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.320
 intermediate and a darker one tending to 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.019
 black and start creating the 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.480
 chiaroscuro the dark ker and indicates the 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.550
 graphic representation of the report 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.680
 between lights and shadows and values 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.320
 chromatic so the chiaroscuro depends 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.949
 from the light that illuminates the object the more it is 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.049
 direct is strong plus there is contrast of 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.939
 usually we start learning to modulate 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.040
 different shades of gray as you see 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.170
 precisely in the example in this video ve 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.180
 I want to make it simple and simplified 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.950
 therefore we will not analyze the whole of it 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.610
 question because I want to talk more about it 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.390
 specifically in an upcoming tutorial 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.000
 in any case, then made with the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.340
 various shades of gray the own shadow 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.740
 of the object or the one that is 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.030
 produces on the body of the object itself e 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.369
 if you want you can also add 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.009
 the shadow brought to projected ie 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.689
 the one that the body throws projects onto 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.590
 surface as for example on the plane 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.590
 on which supported 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.909
 and this guys is the result and vi 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.860
 I repeat is a very long example 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.610
 simplified to make you understand at large 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.740
 lines how it works at this point later 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.610
 be exercised with the pencil and with the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.890
 various shades of gray 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.840
 let's move on to the color you have to draw a 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.930
 circle on the sheet by watercolor and then 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.549
 start preparing your colors 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.590
 I chose to start with blue 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.569
 you can choose any color 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.160
 the important thing is that you prepare three or 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.930
 four different tones of the same color 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.319
 for this operation you can decide to 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.940
 darken a blue tone using 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.340
 different amounts of bistros and therefore 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.920
 creating different shades of the same 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.160
 color or modulate different shades 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.160
 of blue 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.890
 and this is the result 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.590
 at this point I decide which side 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.140
 far.pro come to light 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.360
 after which I take clean water e 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.990
 began to wet the part where I have 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.360
 drawn my circle because I will go to 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.730
 make a wet on wet because 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.060
 wet on wet is the best way 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:04.370
 to create soft shades and 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.350
 homogeneous then I go to spread the first one 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.410
 color than the lightest one after that 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.810
 to immediately follow the darker e 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.430
 the one then darker still up 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.950
 the last color is the darkest of 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.290
 all that will represent the true shadow e 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.690
 own of our sphere therefore I will create 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.350
 this gradation of color from one color 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.300
 lighter towards a darker color than 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.120
 precisely to create chiaroscuro 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.540
 shading is the effect of volume 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.540
 of the sphere 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.730
 in this video guys I wanted to 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.970
 keep me very simple and basic 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.260
 without going to talk much 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.660
 technique of everything related to i 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.820
 there would be relationships between lights and shadows 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.980
 much more to say and I will do it 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.870
 coming soon in a video in which 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.490
 we will address this talk we will talk about 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.190
 also of the reflected light than in this one 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:05.360
 case I didn't want to introduce own 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.280
 because I wanted it to be simply a 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.400
 video so we tell you about starting to 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.920
 start experimenting with volumes 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.080
 lights , shadows and shadows with 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.210
 the watercolor was then tuned 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.390
 because soon we will deepen 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.390
 the topic 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.250
 at this point when I consider myself 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.180
 satisfied using my friend 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.430
 phone 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.480
 I'm going to dry the painting and here it is 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.480
 this is the result 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.550
 now you can decide to try 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.560
 also represent the shadow brought to the 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.440
 projected shadow or that shadow that 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.630
 the body the object projects onto 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.490
 surfaces in this case I will go to 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.930
 represent only the shadow that 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.000
 projects on the floor because they are not there 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.100
 other objects otherwise I should 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.560
 also represent the interaction with 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.220
 near objects and with other planes 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.660
 on which the object always projects 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.990
 other shadows in this case precisely 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.490
 the shadow only one and then I go to 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.100
 represent using more color 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.250
 dark I used for the most part 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:15.510
 dark of the object itself and going to 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.690
 accentuate it at the base of the object where 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.890
 the object can already create an accent that 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.890
 also defines the figure 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.879
 but now let's review together all the 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:38.129
 newly made passages using a 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.469
 other color not to color another 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.319
 sphere in this case decided to use the 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:45.269
 red color which is a very color 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:47.789
 intense brilliant of which also thick 

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:50.669
 difficult to create different shades 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:54.029
 modular tones in this case I am 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.819
 started from a very orange red to 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:59.009
 which added yellow and then ho 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.319
 repeated the same red recreated it 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.449
 same red to which however from time to 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.759
 time I went to add the 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.379
 more and more bistros per 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.999
 create precisely the different tones then 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.999
 different tones of the same color 

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:20.899
 and now we repeat the same steps as 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.059
 first let's go first to wet the 

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:30.109
 sheet very well with clean water 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:32.119
 in this way and then to add the 

00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:34.489
 first color that in our case will be 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:38.179
 precisely the brightest red among 

00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:40.669
 quotes created to add then the 

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:43.719
 according to red the darker and the 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:46.189
 third, thus creating shading 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:49.459
 going then to create the most part 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:53.989
 light the penumbra and the shadow part then 

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:56.419
 then at the bottom of our sphere I go 

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:58.849
 to add the darkest tone of all 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:01.419
 on the bottom to create the most in 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.859
 shadow of my sphere in this way 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:05.389
 then tilt the sheet to let you know that i 

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:07.849
 colors mix well and then to di 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:10.099
 help the colors blend together with 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:12.669
 the brush is right here and there in 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:12.669
 this way 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.520
 and this is the added result also 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.770
 the shadow of the last sphere of the 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.600
 red sphere and this is what I have 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.250
 obtained in a very basic way very much 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.550
 simple there would be much more to say 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.710
 to do and we'll see it in future videos 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.510
 tutorials dedicated to this 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.520
 topic the topic of lights and shadows 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.070
 so I hope this video is there 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.630
 was still useful and that I gave you 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.490
 some ideas let me know here 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:45.080
 below with lots of comments and I'll see you 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.080
 in the next video hello
