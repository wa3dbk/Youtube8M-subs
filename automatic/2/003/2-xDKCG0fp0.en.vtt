since<00:03:48.290> i<00:03:48.410> haven't<00:03:48.560> played<00:03:48.739> them<00:03:49.040> all<00:03:49.220> i've

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
since i haven't played them all i've

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.250 
since i haven't played them all i've
only<00:03:49.640> seen<00:03:49.970> different<00:03:50.569> parts<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.900> them<00:03:51.080> all

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
well that's fair so how is this

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.360 
well that's fair so how is this
different<00:03:53.810> from<00:03:54.080> say<00:03:54.500> writing<00:03:54.920> for<00:03:55.130> a

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
different from say writing for a

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.040 
different from say writing for a
television<00:03:55.700> show<00:03:55.910> something<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.569> are<00:03:56.720> has

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
television show something that are has

television show something that are has
already<00:03:57.200> been<00:03:57.470> filmed<00:03:58.069> as<00:03:59.060> opposed<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.780> your

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
already been filmed as opposed to your

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.259 
already been filmed as opposed to your
writing<00:04:00.230> loops<00:04:00.560> or<00:04:00.980> things<00:04:01.730> for<00:04:02.000> an

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
writing loops or things for an

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.449 
writing loops or things for an
interactive<00:04:03.110> experience<00:04:03.200> how<00:04:03.950> has<00:04:03.980> this<00:04:04.130> been

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
interactive experience how has this been

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.420 
interactive experience how has this been
different<00:04:04.970> than<00:04:05.120> what<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.569> usually<00:04:05.600> work<00:04:06.110> on

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
different than what you usually work on

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.500 
different than what you usually work on
well<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:07.519> interesting<00:04:07.670> that<00:04:08.090> I'm<00:04:08.330> not

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.060 
off and I'm just listening to music and
and<00:04:26.240> working<00:04:26.810> on<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.110> music<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:27.650> that<00:04:27.830> that's

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
and working on the music and that that's

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.940 
and working on the music and that that's
kind<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.430> fun<00:04:28.760> that's<00:04:29.570> more<00:04:29.810> like<00:04:29.870> how<00:04:30.710> i<00:04:30.770> came

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
kind of fun that's more like how i came

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.580 
kind of fun that's more like how i came
into<00:04:31.310> music<00:04:31.700> was<00:04:31.850> just<00:04:32.180> doing<00:04:32.510> music<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.229> not

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
into music was just doing music and not

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.890 
into music was just doing music and not
looking<00:04:33.950> at<00:04:34.190> visual<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:34.970> that's<00:04:35.450> kind<00:04:35.690> of<00:04:35.720> cool

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
looking at visual so that's kind of cool

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.810 
looking at visual so that's kind of cool
that<00:04:35.960> I'm<00:04:36.229> really<00:04:36.410> thinking<00:04:36.919> about<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.400> form

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
that I'm really thinking about the form

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.290 
that I'm really thinking about the form
of<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.210> music<00:04:38.890> since<00:04:39.890> it's<00:04:40.130> for<00:04:40.340> gameplay<00:04:40.580> it

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
of the music since it's for gameplay it

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.240 
of the music since it's for gameplay it
doesn't<00:04:41.750> always<00:04:41.900> have<00:04:42.140> to<00:04:42.169> fit<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.680> form<00:04:43.010> of

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
doesn't always have to fit the form of

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.270 
doesn't always have to fit the form of
the<00:04:43.550> visuals<00:04:44.229> so<00:04:45.229> if<00:04:45.470> it's<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:46.130> know<00:04:46.220> if

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
the visuals so if it's you know if

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.880 
the visuals so if it's you know if
something<00:04:46.610> wants<00:04:46.729> to<00:04:47.030> be<00:04:47.210> you<00:04:47.990> know<00:04:48.140> two

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
something wants to be you know two

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.620 
something wants to be you know two
minutes<00:04:49.220> long<00:04:49.430> and<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.940> feels<00:04:50.150> right<00:04:50.360> that's

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
minutes long and it feels right that's

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.090 
minutes long and it feels right that's
right<00:04:50.870> if<00:04:51.050> something<00:04:51.380> wants<00:04:51.470> to<00:04:51.680> be<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.770> minute

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
right if something wants to be a minute

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.480 
right if something wants to be a minute
long<00:04:52.250> it'll<00:04:52.490> be<00:04:52.640> that<00:04:52.789> long<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.990> as<00:04:54.200> usual

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
long it'll be that long and as usual

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.110 
long it'll be that long and as usual

nothing definite has been discussed but
I<00:05:11.480> I<00:05:11.510> mean<00:05:11.960> I've<00:05:12.110> had<00:05:12.290> a<00:05:12.320> few<00:05:12.730> record<00:05:13.730> labels
