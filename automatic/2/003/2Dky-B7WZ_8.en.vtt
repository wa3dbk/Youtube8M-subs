00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.759 
all of CDC fibers for the body and head
so<00:03:40.389> we're<00:03:40.510> going<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.690> start<00:03:40.870> off<00:03:41.019> by<00:03:41.260> tying<00:03:41.590> on

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
so we're going to start off by tying on

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.289 
so we're going to start off by tying on
a<00:03:41.799> nice<00:03:42.090> face<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.389> thread<00:03:44.319> onto<00:03:44.859> our<00:03:45.069> hook<00:03:45.299> and

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
a nice face of thread onto our hook and

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.910 
a nice face of thread onto our hook and
tie<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.780> back<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.230> lay<00:03:47.319> that<00:03:47.500> down<00:03:47.560> that

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
tie that back and lay that down that

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.129 
tie that back and lay that down that
helps<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:49.120> stop<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.510> wing<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.930> tail

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
helps the to stop the wing and the tail

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.800 
helps the to stop the wing and the tail
from<00:03:50.319> slipping<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:52.000> what<00:03:52.120> I've<00:03:52.239> done<00:03:52.269> is<00:03:52.450> stack

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
from slipping so what I've done is stack

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.050 
from slipping so what I've done is stack
