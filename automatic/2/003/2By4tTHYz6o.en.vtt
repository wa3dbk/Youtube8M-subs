00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.780 

so<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:00.960> next<00:00:01.140> thing<00:00:01.319> we're<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.650> do<00:00:01.800> is

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
so the next thing we're going to do is

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.720 
so the next thing we're going to do is
we'll<00:00:03.000> run<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.179> glue<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:04.319> led<00:00:04.859> with<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.520> wires

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
we'll run a glue the led with the wires

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.290 
we'll run a glue the led with the wires
into<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.839> hole<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.259> we<00:00:07.379> drilled<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:08.300> the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
into the hole that we drilled in the

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.390 
into the hole that we drilled in the
front<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.900> carton<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.010> front<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.340> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
front of the carton in front of the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.370 
front of the carton in front of the
truck<00:00:11.639> I've<00:00:12.210> already<00:00:12.570> done<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:12.870> one<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.230> I'll

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
truck I've already done this one so I'll

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.829 
truck I've already done this one so I'll
show<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.590> how<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:13.860> do<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.099> one<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.780> want<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
show you how we do this one I want to

I'm<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> take<00:00:39.030> us<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.989> drop<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.850> my

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
I'm going to take us just a drop of my

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.060 
I'm going to take us just a drop of my
super<00:00:42.239> jet<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.140> drop<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:45.770> which<00:00:46.770> will

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
super jet and drop it in here which will

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.590 
super jet and drop it in here which will
hold<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.960> LED<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.289> place<00:00:50.930> now<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
hold the LED in place now what I do is I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.260 
hold the LED in place now what I do is I
like<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> use<00:00:54.899> accelerator<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> did

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
like to use accelerator so what I did

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630 
like to use accelerator so what I did
was<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.629> took<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.870> piece<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.140> wire<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.430> made<00:00:59.609> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
was I took a piece of wire and I made a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.130 
was I took a piece of wire and I made a
little<00:00:59.789> loop<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> end<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> wire<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
little loop on the end of the wire and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.619 
little loop on the end of the wire and
then<00:01:01.230> I'll<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.620> drop<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.699> wire<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
then I'll just drop this wire with the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.440 
then I'll just drop this wire with the
loop<00:01:03.840> into<00:01:04.260> my<00:01:04.379> accelerator<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:06.180> loop

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
loop into my accelerator and the loop

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.770 
loop into my accelerator and the loop
holds<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.320> enough<00:01:07.520> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.210> accelerator

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
holds just enough of the accelerator

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.359 
holds just enough of the accelerator
just<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.650> give<00:01:10.950> me<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:13.409> accelerator<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
just to give me the accelerator on the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.170 
just to give me the accelerator on the
end<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.140> glue<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.700> either<00:01:18.000> do

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
end of at the glue you can either do

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.700 
end of at the glue you can either do
that<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> little<00:01:19.229> sprayer

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that or you can use a little sprayer

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.969 
that or you can use a little sprayer
that<00:01:20.070> comes<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.600> makes<00:01:22.110> puts

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that comes with it but that makes puts

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.800 
that comes with it but that makes puts
accelerator<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.939> place<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.479> I'm<00:01:24.570> not

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
accelerator all in place and I'm not

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.270 
accelerator all in place and I'm not
crazy<00:01:24.990> about<00:01:25.140> having<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.530> accelerator<00:01:26.130> all

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
crazy about having that accelerator all

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.070 
crazy about having that accelerator all
over<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> place<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.970> made<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.930> little

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
over the place so I made that little

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.480 
over the place so I made that little
loop<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:28.979> works<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.250> pretty

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
loop and I think that works out pretty

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.640 
loop and I think that works out pretty
well<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:33.229> once<00:01:34.229> that's<00:01:34.409> done<00:01:36.500> what<00:01:37.500> we're

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
well so once that's done what we're

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.740 
well so once that's done what we're
going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.950> next<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.640> we're<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.540> take

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
going to do next is we're going to take

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.499 
going to do next is we're going to take
the<00:01:39.900> youth<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.650> unit<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:42.240> we're<00:01:42.390> going

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the youth this this unit and we're going

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
the youth this this unit and we're going
to<00:01:42.570> epoxy<00:01:43.490> everything<00:01:44.490> all<00:01:44.759> around<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.590> LED

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
to epoxy everything all around the LED

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.190 
to epoxy everything all around the LED
alright<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> mix<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.540> together<00:01:48.750> really

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
alright so I mix this together really

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.730 
alright so I mix this together really
well<00:01:49.759> now<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.180> take<00:01:51.299> this

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
well now I'm going to take this

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.450 
well now I'm going to take this
toothpick<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.130> cover

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
toothpick and I'm going to really cover

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.719 
toothpick and I'm going to really cover
this<00:01:56.880> around<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:58.100> now<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> do

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
this around here now this is going to do

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.810 
this around here now this is going to do
two<00:01:59.909> different<00:02:00.090> things<00:02:00.890> first<00:02:01.890> obviously

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
two different things first obviously

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.389 
two different things first obviously
it's<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.360> hold<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:05.430> LEDs<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.180> place<00:02:07.399> but

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it's going to hold the LEDs in place but

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.320 
it's going to hold the LEDs in place but
it's<00:02:08.520> also<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> give<00:02:09.209> me<00:02:11.330> something

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
it's also going to give me something

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.110 
it's also going to give me something
that<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.870> can<00:02:12.959> paint

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
that I can paint

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.450 
that I can paint
now<00:02:15.120> I'm<00:02:15.330> going<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.570> paint<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.040> later<00:02:19.460> with

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
now I'm going to paint this later with

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.730 
now I'm going to paint this later with
black<00:02:20.730> paint

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
black paint

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.600 
black paint
okay<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.950> epoxy<00:02:23.940> has<00:02:24.000> been<00:02:24.450> set<00:02:25.260> now<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.740> what

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
okay the epoxy has been set now and what

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.230 
okay the epoxy has been set now and what
I<00:02:26.640> did<00:02:27.060> was<00:02:27.810> after<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.830> foxy<00:02:29.280> got<00:02:29.490> all<00:02:29.730> set<00:02:30.030> I

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
I did was after the foxy got all set I

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.560 
I did was after the foxy got all set I
painted<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.290> epoxy<00:02:31.860> with<00:02:32.550> some<00:02:32.790> black<00:02:33.030> gloss

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
painted the epoxy with some black gloss

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.630 
painted the epoxy with some black gloss
paint<00:02:34.080> now<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.700> reason<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.120> do<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.360> is

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
paint now the reason I do that is

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.600 
paint now the reason I do that is
because<00:02:38.640> any<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.250> LED<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.430> may<00:02:41.550> be

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
because any of the LED that may be

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.150 
because any of the LED that may be
sticking<00:02:41.970> out<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:42.450> underneath<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.050> cab<00:02:43.290> may

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
sticking out in underneath the cab may

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.970 
sticking out in underneath the cab may
show<00:02:44.460> some<00:02:44.790> light<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:46.410> don't<00:02:46.620> want<00:02:46.830> any

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
show some light and I don't want any

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.740 
show some light and I don't want any
light<00:02:47.220> coming<00:02:47.610> down<00:02:47.760> underneath<00:02:48.240> my<00:02:48.540> top

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
light coming down underneath my top

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.870 
light coming down underneath my top
underneath<00:02:49.230> my<00:02:49.470> wheels<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.370> if<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.580> paint<00:02:50.820> that

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
underneath my wheels so if I paint that

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.330 
underneath my wheels so if I paint that
with<00:02:51.120> some<00:02:51.270> black<00:02:51.480> paint<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.800> did<00:02:52.980> here

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
with some black paint like I did here

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.680 
with some black paint like I did here
that'll<00:02:54.150> stop<00:02:54.540> probably<00:02:55.500> 95%<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.640> any<00:02:56.850> ambient

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
that'll stop probably 95% of any ambient

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.390 
that'll stop probably 95% of any ambient
light<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:57.990> gets<00:02:58.350> out<00:02:58.500> through<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.190> back<00:02:59.370> of

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
light that gets out through the back of

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.730 
light that gets out through the back of
the<00:02:59.580> LED<00:03:00.060> okay<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:00.780> now<00:03:01.020> what<00:03:01.140> I'm<00:03:01.260> also<00:03:01.440> going

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
the LED okay so now what I'm also going

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.820 
the LED okay so now what I'm also going
to<00:03:01.830> go<00:03:02.010> ahead<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.490> is<00:03:03.590> put<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.680> other

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
to go ahead and do is put the other

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.380 
to go ahead and do is put the other
headlight<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:06.950> obviously<00:03:08.120> took<00:03:09.120> that

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
headlight in I obviously took that

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.530 
headlight in I obviously took that
little<00:03:09.600> pin<00:03:10.110> off<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.640> back<00:03:11.880> here<00:03:12.180> there<00:03:12.360> used

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
little pin off the back here there used

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.180 
little pin off the back here there used
to<00:03:12.600> be<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.750> pin<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.200> would<00:03:13.320> stuck<00:03:13.710> out<00:03:13.890> here

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
to be a pin that would stuck out here

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.890 
to be a pin that would stuck out here
oops<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:17.090> that's<00:03:18.090> what<00:03:18.450> went<00:03:18.630> through<00:03:18.720> the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
oops and that's what went through the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.650 
oops and that's what went through the
original<00:03:19.560> hole<00:03:19.800> here<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:21.000> front<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
original hole here on the front of the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.280 
original hole here on the front of the
cab<00:03:22.459> so<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.520> cut<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.090> off<00:03:24.150> with<00:03:24.480> my<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.959> pair<00:03:25.260> of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
cab so I cut that off with my a pair of

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.290 
cab so I cut that off with my a pair of
cutters<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.950> then<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.250> trimmed<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.880> with<00:03:27.120> an

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
cutters and then I trimmed it with an

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.430 
cutters and then I trimmed it with an
exacto<00:03:28.100> knife<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.670> now<00:03:30.600> I'm<00:03:30.780> gonna<00:03:30.900> place

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
exacto knife and now I'm gonna place

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.890 
exacto knife and now I'm gonna place
that<00:03:31.470> in<00:03:31.830> there<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.390> get<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:33.690> there

that in there just get that in there
just<00:03:34.050> enough<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.620> hold<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.490> just<00:03:35.670> covers

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
just enough to hold so it just covers

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.860 
just enough to hold so it just covers
that<00:03:36.150> hole<00:03:36.360> here<00:03:37.580> take<00:03:38.580> my<00:03:38.730> super<00:03:39.300> jet

and<00:03:44.379> just<00:03:45.069> catch<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.700> corner<00:03:46.379> and<00:03:47.379> catch<00:03:48.280> the

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
and just catch the corner and catch the

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.619 
and just catch the corner and catch the
corner<00:03:48.760> in<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.030> back<00:03:49.209> here<00:03:49.510> all<00:03:49.720> right<00:03:50.319> now

corner in the back here all right now
capillary<00:03:52.629> action<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:53.050> going<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.290> pull<00:03:53.470> all

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
capillary action is going to pull all

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.180 
capillary action is going to pull all

old<00:05:20.390> computer<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:21.110> really<00:05:21.770> old<00:05:21.980> computer<00:05:22.430> and

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
old computer a really old computer and

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.110 
old computer a really old computer and
when<00:05:24.290> it<00:05:24.410> went<00:05:24.500> bad<00:05:24.770> I<00:05:24.980> seen<00:05:25.340> the<00:05:25.520> power<00:05:25.730> supply

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
when it went bad I seen the power supply

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.740 
when it went bad I seen the power supply
out<00:05:26.330> of<00:05:26.510> it

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
out of it

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.430 
out of it
the<00:05:26.840> power<00:05:27.050> supply<00:05:27.320> in<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.830> computer<00:05:28.340> is

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
the power supply in a computer is

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.000 
the power supply in a computer is
regulated<00:05:30.440> 12<00:05:30.680> volts<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:31.310> 5<00:05:32.650> volts<00:05:33.650> and

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
regulated 12 volts and 5 volts and

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.800 
regulated 12 volts and 5 volts and
that's<00:05:34.310> used<00:05:34.640> in<00:05:34.820> a<00:05:34.940> lot<00:05:35.180> of<00:05:36.310> electronic<00:05:37.310> stuff

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
that's used in a lot of electronic stuff

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:45.250 
that's used in a lot of electronic stuff
so<00:05:38.810> I<00:05:39.110> have<00:05:39.770> my<00:05:42.130> trouble<00:05:43.130> wires<00:05:43.490> here<00:05:43.850> I<00:05:44.230> got<00:05:45.230> my
