00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
ice beam more than Thunderbolt it won't

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.050 
ice beam more than Thunderbolt it won't
be<00:02:01.290> doing<00:02:01.470> too<00:02:02.070> much<00:02:02.220> damage<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.640> me<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:02.970> it

reason why I don't want to bring in my

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.910 
reason why I don't want to bring in my
Sharpedo<00:04:17.640> is<00:04:17.910> because<00:04:18.480> he<00:04:18.959> can<00:04:19.140> easily<00:04:19.560> go<00:04:19.739> for

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
Sharpedo is because he can easily go for

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.710 
Sharpedo is because he can easily go for
the<00:04:19.980> substitute<00:04:20.430> predicting<00:04:20.880> me<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.209> go<00:04:21.450> for

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
the substitute predicting me to go for

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.540 
the substitute predicting me to go for
the<00:04:21.750> protect<00:04:22.110> and<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.380> could<00:04:22.590> lose<00:04:22.860> after<00:04:23.250> that

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
the protect and I could lose after that

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.250 
the protect and I could lose after that
once<00:04:24.150> he<00:04:24.210> takes<00:04:24.360> out<00:04:24.570> my<00:04:24.690> slurpee<00:04:24.990> know<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.230> I

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
once he takes out my slurpee know so I

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.420 
once he takes out my slurpee know so I
thought<00:04:25.470> right<00:04:25.530> code<00:04:25.860> would<00:04:26.010> be<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.280> better

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
thought right code would be the better

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.250 
thought right code would be the better
play<00:04:26.700> because<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.210> want<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.690> be<00:04:27.810> able<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:28.080> bring

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
play because I want to be able to bring

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.660 
play because I want to be able to bring
him<00:04:28.410> down<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.800> point<00:04:29.040> where<00:04:29.100> he<00:04:29.340> can't

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
him down to a point where he can't

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.180 
him down to a point where he can't
substitute<00:04:30.270> anymore<00:04:30.930> but<00:04:31.440> I'm<00:04:31.620> nicely<00:04:32.040> going

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
substitute anymore but I'm nicely going

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.010 
substitute anymore but I'm nicely going
to<00:04:32.250> get<00:04:32.370> pretty<00:04:32.580> lucky<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.150> then<00:04:33.390> when<00:04:33.870> the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
to get pretty lucky and then when the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.690 
to get pretty lucky and then when the
last<00:04:34.260> beat<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.710> allowed<00:04:35.070> me<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.340> knock<00:04:35.490> him<00:04:35.640> out

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
last beat I allowed me to knock him out

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.250 
last beat I allowed me to knock him out
what<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:35.970> Thunderbolt<00:04:36.360> but<00:04:36.510> in<00:04:36.600> return<00:04:36.690> I'm

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
going to be knocked out because of the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.580 
going to be knocked out because of the

fabulous<00:04:49.020> is<00:04:49.110> that<00:04:49.140> I<00:04:49.320> know<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.710> crunch<00:04:50.100> will<00:04:50.370> be

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
fabulous is that I know a crunch will be

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.250 
fabulous is that I know a crunch will be
able<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:50.730> take<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:51.030> out<00:04:51.150> but<00:04:51.690> due<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.110> fact

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
able to take it out but due to the fact

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.320 
able to take it out but due to the fact
that<00:04:52.410> kept<00:04:52.860> arrogance<00:04:53.220> has<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.490> mobility<00:04:54.120> if

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
that kept arrogance has the mobility if

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.180 
that kept arrogance has the mobility if
i<00:04:54.690> did<00:04:54.930> go<00:04:54.960> straight<00:04:55.320> for<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.500> crunch<00:04:55.770> that

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
i did go straight for the crunch that

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.710 
i did go straight for the crunch that
means<00:04:56.430> i<00:04:56.610> wouldn't<00:04:56.970> have<00:04:57.060> gone<00:04:57.240> my<00:04:57.450> speed

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
means i wouldn't have gone my speed

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.210 
means i wouldn't have gone my speed
boost<00:04:57.930> so<00:04:58.410> what<00:04:58.620> does<00:04:58.740> that<00:04:58.860> i<00:04:58.890> do<00:04:59.070> was

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
boost so what does that i do was

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.740 
boost so what does that i do was
government<00:04:59.490> protect<00:04:59.880> give<00:05:00.150> my<00:05:00.270> speed<00:05:00.540> boost

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
government protect give my speed boost

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.510 
government protect give my speed boost
and<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:00.960> Fallen<00:05:01.680> turn<00:05:01.800> even<00:05:02.100> though<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.250> have

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
and the Fallen turn even though I have
