00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.000
 indescribable so we have now 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.730
 Already got the museum we have 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.639
 the company that gave birth to this 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.330
 stickers are made 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.439
 It's great feeling you see what you do 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.560
 sees something has again produced 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.680
 is what you are buying is seen also tell 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.300
 so I also collect objects on the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.449
 You can see it here the most 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.540
 access because the still missing and so was 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.960
 for me it is still missing the album 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:42.629
 from 1996 I have seen here 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:46.370
 preferably the showcase euro reinforced 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.370
 the dream after that 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:58.000
 it will eventually come back to 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:01:00.910
 was positive surprised 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.369
 by sharing the experiences of 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.080
 2006, for example, that obviously this 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.740
 sorting these out and watching so 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.780
 say that not so many anymore 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.590
 the same of a series I say so 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.570
 or wise 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.020
 In 2006, for example, these were the stickers 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.990
 from italy no the sticker of the usa 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.490
 and from the netherlands the 20 times 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.009
 felt more often than there 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:35.289
 italian or as a german sticker 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:37.630
 or below seems clear this time 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.100
 to be better after doing so now 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.869
 also these again process again 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.979
 is selected as the sticker too 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:49.090
 be sorted 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:51.340
 that seems to have gotten better though 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.350
 one counts it together one has also 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:00.840
 then bought over ebay and so 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:10.840
 it's from 1985 so now panini yes of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:12.970
 1985 to 2009 then yes 24 years plus 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.380
 then from these new ones of trox I will 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.769
 but somehow not so important 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.610
 If you aim at the 30 then you will arrive 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.269
 few wm about it i think so 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.860
 the 40 are all that for the moment 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.860
 fully have or where I am still in the process
