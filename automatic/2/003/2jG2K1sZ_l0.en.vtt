00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
thought that might make a good next x-l

interesting leg designed there just
trying<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.469> come<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.770> something<00:00:38.340> good

I'll<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.620> grab<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:49.370> show<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.670> guys<00:00:51.829> how

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
I'll just grab it here show you guys how

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.580 
I'll just grab it here show you guys how
I<00:00:52.860> did<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:55.070> is<00:00:56.070> attached<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
I did it so this is attached and that

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.340 
I did it so this is attached and that
looks<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.640> did<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.350> let's

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
looks like that how did I do this let's

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.980 
looks like that how did I do this let's
just<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:04.220> which<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.400> take<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.760> off<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.750> see

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
just see which we take this off and see

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.370 
just see which we take this off and see
all<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.799> inner<00:01:08.100> workings<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.990> just

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
all the inner workings and so you just

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.399 
all the inner workings and so you just
take<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.950> kickstand<00:01:11.520> off<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> frontal<00:01:12.810> bike<00:01:13.020> in

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
take the kickstand off a frontal bike in

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.770 
take the kickstand off a frontal bike in
the<00:01:13.530> line<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.159> ball<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.710> blue<00:01:16.710> part

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
the line of the ball with the blue part

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.230 
the line of the ball with the blue part
so<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.049> pole<00:01:19.259> will<00:01:19.439> stick<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
so the pole will stick like that but it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.920 
so the pole will stick like that but it
doesn't<00:01:21.420> look<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.170> bad<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.680> pop<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.610> on

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
doesn't look so bad and pop that on

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.840 
doesn't look so bad and pop that on
voila<00:01:24.960> you're<00:01:25.290> done<00:01:25.470> other<00:01:26.130> interesting

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
voila you're done other interesting

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.539 
voila you're done other interesting

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.670 
I built this fairly simple stuck this
piece<00:02:56.710> which<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.070> can<00:02:57.250> find<00:02:57.400> on<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.700> Firelord

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
piece which you can find on the Firelord

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.510 
piece which you can find on the Firelord
shoved<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.040> there<00:03:01.410> actually<00:03:03.390> then<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.810> just

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
shoved it in there actually then I just

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.440 
shoved it in there actually then I just
cut<00:03:06.520> this<00:03:06.760> around<00:03:07.600> here<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.580> fit<00:03:09.580> around<00:03:10.180> there

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
cut this around here so fit around there

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.900 
cut this around here so fit around there
so<00:03:10.960> it<00:03:11.110> would<00:03:11.170> be<00:03:11.380> sort<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.040> like<00:03:12.100> that

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
so it would be sort of like that

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.260 
so it would be sort of like that
and<00:03:13.060> then<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.570> just<00:03:14.350> snapped<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:15.310> whole<00:03:15.580> thing

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
and then I just snapped the whole thing

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.229 
and then I just snapped the whole thing
together<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.930> get<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.320> right<00:03:20.440> angle<00:03:20.860> and

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
together just get the right angle and

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.410 
together just get the right angle and
there<00:03:22.239> we<00:03:22.360> go<00:03:22.680> now<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.709> have<00:03:24.310> his<00:03:24.640> tower<00:03:24.970> of

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
there we go now you have his tower of

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.850 
there we go now you have his tower of
defense<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.489> easily<00:03:28.390> just<00:03:28.720> plugs<00:03:29.620> in

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
defense and so that easily just plugs in

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.790 
defense and so that easily just plugs in
to<00:03:30.070> that<00:03:31.890> just<00:03:32.890> like<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:35.410> have<00:03:35.620> to

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
to that just like so and you have to

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.910 
to that just like so and you have to
admit<00:03:36.130> it's<00:03:36.340> pretty<00:03:37.060> huge<00:03:37.480> now<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.320> figure

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
admit it's pretty huge now the figure

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.630 
admit it's pretty huge now the figure
next<00:03:39.459> himself<00:03:40.000> next<00:03:40.840> XL<00:03:41.260> himself<00:03:41.769> isn't

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
next himself next XL himself isn't

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.340 
next himself next XL himself isn't
especially<00:03:42.880> huge<00:03:43.630> but<00:03:44.350> for<00:03:45.070> his<00:03:45.310> size<00:03:45.900> he<00:03:46.900> has

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
especially huge but for his size he has

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
especially huge but for his size he has
a<00:03:48.090> quite<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.120> few<00:03:49.330> parts<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:49.980> don't<00:03:50.980> know<00:03:51.190> exactly

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
a quite a few parts I don't know exactly

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.090 
a quite a few parts I don't know exactly
how<00:03:51.820> many<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.300> didn't<00:03:52.750> count<00:03:52.959> them<00:03:53.140> out<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.980> I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
how many I didn't count them out and I

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.160 
how many I didn't count them out and I
will<00:03:54.459> not<00:03:54.670> go<00:03:54.940> ahead<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.269> count<00:03:55.720> them<00:03:55.900> out<00:03:56.190> but

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
will not go ahead and count them out but

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.750 
will not go ahead and count them out but
he's<00:03:59.170> pretty<00:03:59.590> bulky<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:02.830> this<00:04:03.250> concludes

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
he's pretty bulky and so this concludes

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.160 
he's pretty bulky and so this concludes
