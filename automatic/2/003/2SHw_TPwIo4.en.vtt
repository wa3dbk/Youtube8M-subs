00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.010
 January will be supplemented with the bio 33 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.660
 Program 1 0 would have an enlarged 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.809
 Cabin is just one feature of the new 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.019
 mini excavators for nordbau 2011 settled 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.449
 also from 24 all details of the 3.3 of 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.430
 explain this to lina 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.279
 furthermore, the organic farmer is called 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.050
 the Kurspaket principle big biggest 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.390
 salient advantage is that the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.880
 rear section when turning 63 degrees 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.239
 not beyond the width of the chains 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.880
 the interview moves 33 the 33 stands for 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.160
 about 33 tons operating weight for it 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.860
 that the excavator is a bankrupt short 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.579
 series is the bio 33 replaces the old one 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.390
 bio 30 he is a bit heavier he is 3,3 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.410
 up to 3.4 tons heavy depending on equipment 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.860
 is within the scope of the entire renewal 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.870
 our series a chain dredger one 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.520
 The larger cabin has the cabin 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.950
 the five-door because that's one of us 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.570
 big problem in the short area 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.100
 space for the driver to ensure 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.259
 that he has enough space because of the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.299
 driver old big grown 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.950
 furthermore, the engine is new in the frame 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.840
 regulate the emission levels of pollutants 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.609
 we have to renew our engines that 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.700
 an essential main criterion for this 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:17.649
 Both criteria are essential in the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.439
 renew these machines the victor's 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.630
 chain system is a patent that mixes 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.270
 between bridgestone and jan o 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.979
 it includes the fact that the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.630
 chains run asymmetrically and piece 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.179
 so do not run in the middle of the roll 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.919
 chain except with me that is in the 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.380
 At the end we keep the clear width 

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:37.329
 but our chains are standing in the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.789
 chains wider that in turn leads to it 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.189
 that we latte rey so to the side 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.259
 can generate better stroke forces than 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.090
 The competition of design is something 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.079
 more curved and the side surface are 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.669
 pulled down 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.169
 if you look at them you will see 

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:51.520
 that pull that down 

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:53.499
 page area gives us the opportunity 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.329
 the working lighting in the middle 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.840
 to arrange and from the side to 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.669
 protect 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.380
 digging in trenches is common 

00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:00.639
 the workload demolished 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.700
 it can not happen here anymore 

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:06.039
 second criterion is the salvaged 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.500
 more born outrigger gives us one 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.630
 possibility of greater force even 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.590
 achieve a short spoonful 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.180
 maintain 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.040
 the short spoonful gives us the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.620
 opportunity to break out better 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.209
 on the spoon handle too 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.099
 and that the driver stood her 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.110
 Speak in the cabin the door is new 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.090
 So she is a shared door stable 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.040
 doubly framed split door itself 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.810
 this video concept from this rounding 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.909
 the second is the cabin the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.950
 Cabin is a cabin of five tons 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.450
 bagger gives us more space has 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.459
 a higher noise reduction we have 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.409
 the decibels deciblible by four could 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.540
 reduce loudness on fao 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.299
 one says so three decibels means 50 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.620
 percent reduction of the noise level at the ear 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.620
 that in various criteria 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.890
