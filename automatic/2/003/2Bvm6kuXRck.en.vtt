00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.490
 unusual for my style 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.649

 strangely thought it out yes no doubt 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.130
 conclusion in general then let's move on 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.289

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.380
 and here we have baths too and here we are 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:10.140
 Here, too, the window even pass us a 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.349
 space of affairs there may be there 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.819
 lockers different different llama well here 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.230

 there is a player available and booklets 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.120
 and of course also a kind of view 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.170
 become a good gadget should the station 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.970
 so let's principle I now 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.920
 we'll see the rest of the apartments, although why? 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.239
 look because they are all the same 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.819
 by the way 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.469
 balcony is also here 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.989
 Now that is the way they are arranged 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.969
 Together I â€™ll conclude right now on the stairs let's go 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.980
 By the way, this 7th floor to that village is inferior 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.079
 five-story building the way 7 floor to although no I 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.819
 I planned another house after all 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.920
 it turned into a five-story building and then already 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.790
 in the 7th floor how strangely all this 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.650
 goes so let's go up to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.319
 top of the exit to the roof there is an opinion 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.000

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.310
 cards we have protection so as not to 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.139
 fall down on and yet weird and 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.459
 what let's see next 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.450
 update they are in principle very 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.700
 small turned out and that's the principle 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.760
 on just such prospectuses couch was not 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.010
 lanterns I put everything as a lantern and 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.599
 for lighting after all now at 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.810

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.450

 that's 1428 people live well and in 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.480
