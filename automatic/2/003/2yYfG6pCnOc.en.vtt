00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.979
 extreme fuel treatment a small dose of treatment 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:09.059
 for fuel with great affection there is petrol or diesel engines 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:12.899
 but what this product actually does on the ground 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.429
 significantly extends the life of your engine 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.429
 improves fuel economy 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.109
 reduce emissions up to the third 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.930
 it's a 20 horsepower your engine now you could ask yourself if 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.250
 the treatment for fuels squeezed into all these things 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.559
 because he has never heard of it before 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.620
 and why others don't use it 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.650
 it seems to be one of those things too good to be true right 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 in fact it is not so 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.110
 let me explain and treatment for the fuel first is not a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.810
 man 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.360
 for more than 20 years, large industrial companies from around the world have been 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.360
 using saving large amounts of money 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 what is new is that sintel got balls has arrived 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 and that is available to all the public 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.530
 before it was sold only in large quantities packed in barilla 55 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.260
 impractical hot gallons for most people 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.970
 for the first time and offers small containers 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.430
 which I use them very easy for personal use 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 which simply 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 they open and poured into your fuel tank 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.310
 probably heard of other fuel additives but this one 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.210
 it is one of a kind 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.260
 here is why 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.680
 xtreme fuel treatment is not a single adjective 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.960
 and complete fuel treatment 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.960
 with proven data on its effectiveness 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.530
 in fact the fuel cover treatment expresses will do you 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 save some red used 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.880
 and various components for the treatment of exhausted fuel 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.520
 who work together to get you exceptional benefits 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.260
 allow me to list quickly 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.530
 what is probably the most important component of this fantastic product 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.070
 the combustion catalyst 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.310
 work low fuel combustion point 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.149
 of hundreds of degrees 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.600
 assuming that fuel starts to burn first 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.630
 thus causing a more complete combustion 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.249
 to better understand how 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.449
 let's take this example 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.169
 think when he is informing a cake 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.909
 if you put it in the oven at a high temperature what happens 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.789
 keylogger keylogger for the mind 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.789
 however internally remains - culture - 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:38.589
 well the same happens in our fuel starts combustion a 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.589
 so high temperatures that burn only part of the fuel 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:46.979
 but let's leave aside that comes out of the engine like the one that doesn't love me while 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.299
 we call emissions 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.299
 ebay - even if it's not our engine 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.160
 lowering the temperature to what you really are doing 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.499
 and that you are using fuels instead of losing it 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:03.269
 this will give you more economy and reduce the emissions that you normally do 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.299
 they produce cheese and you go 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.409
 don't even like stickers that fill the engine because everything turns out 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.729
 burned and polished 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:16.079
 furthermore stein fuel treatment contains temples, dreams cards 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.830
 meaning and pistons 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.489
 to the pump and fuel to the injectors 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.980
 thus reducing friction that can be your vehicle's worst enemy 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.269
 there is also a fuel stabilizer 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.049
 in fact fuel like any other oil based product tends to 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.059
 break up with 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.109
 and this makes him lose the grind 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.209
 the treatment for the ultimate fuel established fuels 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.430
 making sure that this separation does not occur for long periods of time 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.989
 thus prolonging the life of fuel, perhaps renato 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.889
 this 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.959
 it is very important especially for boats 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.349
 formatting 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.899
 snowmobiles 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:04.049
 gardening tools and any other means not used 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.769
 frequently 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.689
 you are also me when I put liquid metal in contact it creates oxidation 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.809
 heating and with cabbage 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:15.400
 in this way corrosion oxidation is being produced 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.169
 this is what happens inside the conservatory 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.479
 the treatment for cream fuel contains oxidation inhibitors 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.250
 and corrosion to minimize the phenomenon of tank corrosion 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.559
 and fusion systems 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:33.360
 observe only difference between these valves 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.360
 pure silk treatment and the other with milk 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.879
 how will you know modern technology 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:44.389
 re precise and compact engines so that there are no escape routes even for i 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.210
 minimum quantities of roast chicken 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.879
 the treatment of for extrem fuels 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.749
 contains detergents 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.050
 that keep the engine clean 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.460
 for the special moments that are harmful to the fuel pump 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.870
 and to the injectors 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.570
 thus obtaining that motor sisley completely 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.599
 even when your tanks are closed between the condensation process 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:10.879
 oxidation 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.889
 you cannot prevent the formation of combustible waters 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.229
 water can be very harmful and expensive for the engine 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.620
 and this is the biggest cause of the injector malfunction 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.139
 the processing of extrema fuel 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.129
 It contains 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:30.309
 a democity cator 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:33.779
 which helps remove water from the fuel 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:37.539
 as you can see the x3max fuel treatment 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.249
 produces an enormous result 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:43.389
 because you can get the same benefits 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.280
 you should buy liters of products worth around 50 euros 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.810
 however with extrema you only need 10 centimeters for a total of 76 liters of 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.110
 fuel 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.960
 and they speak only for you 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.339
 and 4 dollars 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:01.410
 extrema 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.110
 registered hair hey certified by the environmental protection agency 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.110
 known by the initials e 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.090
 and to give you one more reason to try it, this product comes to you

 we think you'll be surprised how I could go further with a full tank 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.409
 of fuel 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:35.650
