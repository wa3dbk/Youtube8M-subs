then<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.070> want<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> continue<00:02:47.700> repeating

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
then you just want to continue repeating

onto it so we come to the stage of
assembling<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.620> here<00:03:07.620> I'm<00:03:07.830> folding<00:03:08.130> in

side pointing down then stack up at

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
depending on how full the presses and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.800 
depending on how full the presses and
I'm<00:03:29.040> going<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> use<00:03:29.490> three<00:03:29.820> because<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.420> know

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
I'm going to use three because I know

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.220 
I'm going to use three because I know
with<00:03:31.470> all<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.430> compression<00:03:33.060> though<00:03:33.450> they're

with all the compression though they're

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.080 
with all the compression though they're
going<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.650> go<00:03:34.770> down<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.700> saves<00:03:35.940> me<00:03:36.060> having

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
going to go down and it saves me having

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.520 
going to go down and it saves me having
to<00:03:36.740> unwind<00:03:38.090> unwind<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.180> handle<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:40.350> in

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
to unwind unwind the handle and that in

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.590 
to unwind unwind the handle and that in
another<00:03:41.120> level<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:47.520> finally<00:03:47.850> after<00:03:48.360> that

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
another level and finally after that

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.470 
another level and finally after that
adds<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.590> large<00:03:49.860> metal<00:03:50.160> circle<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.000> a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
adds the large metal circle and a

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.020 
adds the large metal circle and a
plastic<00:03:51.720> washer<00:03:52.170> over<00:03:53.070> that<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.459> then<00:03:53.640> screw

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
plastic washer over that and then screw

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.600 
plastic washer over that and then screw
on<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.330> handle<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:54.870> then<00:03:55.200> we'll<00:03:55.380> come<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.490> the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
on the handle and then we'll come to the

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.180 
on the handle and then we'll come to the
time<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:57.030> make<00:03:57.180> juice<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.560> time<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:59.040> make

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190

the<00:03:59.250> juice<00:03:59.400> it's<00:03:59.910> easy<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.570> turn<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.930> handle

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
the juice it's easy to turn the handle

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.290 
the juice it's easy to turn the handle
at<00:04:01.470> first<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.340> second<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.030> will<00:04:03.150> observe

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
at first and the second you will observe

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.600 
at first and the second you will observe
a<00:04:03.570> lot<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.990> juice<00:04:04.200> coming<00:04:04.620> out<00:04:04.740> from<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.130> mash
