over<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.590> next<00:01:13.830> joke<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:15.930> even

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
over this next joke so it's not even

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.070 
over this next joke so it's not even
what<00:01:16.580> mr.<00:01:17.580> Harvey<00:01:18.000> showed<00:01:18.360> me<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:18.720> told<00:01:18.930> me

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
what mr. Harvey showed me or told me

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.100 
what mr. Harvey showed me or told me
about<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:20.189> uh<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.790> actually<00:01:21.150> misread<00:01:21.900> his

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
about but uh I actually misread his

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.370 
about but uh I actually misread his
tweet<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.710> thought<00:01:23.220> he<00:01:23.520> said<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.390> hold<00:01:24.720> hold

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
tweet and thought he said to hold hold

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
tweet and thought he said to hold hold
on<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> left<00:01:25.950> bumper<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.520> let<00:01:26.790> go<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.090> left<00:01:27.330> so

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
on the left bumper not let go of left so

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
on the left bumper not let go of left so
that's<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.680> caused<00:01:28.890> me<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.310> do

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that's actually what caused me to do

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.999 
that's actually what caused me to do
that<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.229> uh<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.619> thought

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that for the first time and uh I thought

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:32.990 
that for the first time and uh I thought
it<00:01:32.070> was<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.280> interesting<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> know<00:01:32.909> if

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
it was really interesting you know if

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.399 
it was really interesting you know if
you're<00:01:33.119> jumping<00:01:33.299> off<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> track<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you're jumping off the track here and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.690 
you're jumping off the track here and
you<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.770> you're<00:01:34.890> quick<00:01:35.130> enough<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.490> think

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you and you're quick enough to think

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
you and you're quick enough to think
about<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.840> actually<00:01:37.170> navigate<00:01:37.470> your

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
about it you can actually navigate your

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.950 
about it you can actually navigate your
rider<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:38.369> onto<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> track<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.450> don't

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
rider back onto the track and I don't

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
rider back onto the track and I don't
know<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.579> used

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
know if it's if you can really be used

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.179 
know if it's if you can really be used
in<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.270> race<00:01:42.509> type<00:01:42.780> situation<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:44.040> it

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
in a race type situation just because it

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.179 
in a race type situation just because it
is<00:01:44.340> uh<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.659> kind<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> awkward<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.590> both<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
is uh it is kind of awkward to both to

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.310 
is uh it is kind of awkward to both to
push<00:01:47.430> both<00:01:47.670> sticks<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> side<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.110> in

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
push both sticks to the side like to in

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.380 
push both sticks to the side like to in
towards<00:01:50.009> each<00:01:50.070> other<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.670> away<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.299> each

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
towards each other out away from each

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.999 
towards each other out away from each
other<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.840> kind<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.049> strange<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.770> that

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
other it's kind of strange to do that

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.069 
other it's kind of strange to do that
and<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> remember<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.990> know

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and you have to remember you know

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.069 
and you have to remember you know
pushing<00:01:55.640> outwards<00:01:56.640> turns<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> left<00:01:57.899> or

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
pushing outwards turns it to the left or

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:58.680 
pushing outwards turns it to the left or
whatever<00:01:58.259> that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
whatever that

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.540 
whatever that
I<00:01:58.720> even<00:01:58.990> be<00:01:59.200> right<00:01:59.440> honestly<00:01:59.860> don't<00:02:00.190> even<00:02:00.280> know

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
I even be right honestly don't even know

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.430 
I even be right honestly don't even know
but<00:02:01.360> one<00:02:01.780> more<00:02:01.930> time<00:02:02.080> here<00:02:02.260> I'm<00:02:02.350> actually

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
but one more time here I'm actually

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.680 
but one more time here I'm actually
going<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.740> do<00:02:02.890> what<00:02:03.040> mr.<00:02:03.250> Harvey<00:02:03.910> suggested

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
going to do what mr. Harvey suggested

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.780 
going to do what mr. Harvey suggested
which<00:02:04.870> is<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.080> letting<00:02:06.010> go<00:02:06.160> of<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.370> left<00:02:06.550> stick

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
which is a letting go of the left stick

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.000 
which is a letting go of the left stick
so<00:02:06.970> outward<00:02:07.600> let<00:02:08.170> go<00:02:08.320> of<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.500> left<00:02:08.650> stick<00:02:08.830> so

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
so outward let go of the left stick so

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.380 
so outward let go of the left stick so
you<00:02:09.070> at<00:02:09.190> least<00:02:09.250> can<00:02:09.520> get<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.760> back<00:02:09.940> end<00:02:10.210> out

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
you at least can get the back end out

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.540 
you at least can get the back end out
and<00:02:10.720> yeah<00:02:10.990> that's<00:02:11.230> it's<00:02:11.830> not<00:02:11.890> really<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> clean

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
and yeah that's it's not really a clean

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.270 
and yeah that's it's not really a clean
whip<00:02:12.820> but<00:02:13.330> um<00:02:13.570> it's<00:02:14.470> more<00:02:14.740> of<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.830> whip<00:02:15.010> than<00:02:15.160> I

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
whip but um it's more of a whip than I

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.000 
whip but um it's more of a whip than I
knew<00:02:15.430> how<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.610> do<00:02:15.760> like<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.060> already<00:02:16.270> said<00:02:16.600> so

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
knew how to do like I already said so

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
guys what I've noticed is if you do the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.230 
guys what I've noticed is if you do the
preload<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.460> showed<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.820> where<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.030> lean

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
preload I showed you where you lean

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.660 
preload I showed you where you lean
forward<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.960> can<00:02:32.470> control<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.010> bike<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.340> lot

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
forward you can control the bike a lot

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.240 
forward you can control the bike a lot
better<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.150> air<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.570> I'm<00:02:34.660> going<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.900> lean<00:02:35.140> back

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
better in air so I'm going to lean back

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.890 
better in air so I'm going to lean back
pop<00:02:36.250> forward<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.880> look<00:02:37.510> at<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.780> can

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
pop forward and look at that you can

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.650 
pop forward and look at that you can
bring<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.260> front<00:02:38.530> end<00:02:38.680> back<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.940> know<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.480> lot

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
bring the front end back up I know a lot

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.150 
bring the front end back up I know a lot
of<00:02:40.690> people<00:02:40.960> have<00:02:41.080> problems<00:02:41.470> with<00:02:41.500> nose-diving

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
of people have problems with nose-diving

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.310 
of people have problems with nose-diving
in<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.550> game<00:02:42.790> doing<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.660> doing<00:02:44.200> that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
in this game doing this doing that

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.720 
in this game doing this doing that
really<00:02:44.770> helps<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.130> but<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.340> problem<00:02:45.610> is

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
really helps it but the problem is

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.280 
really helps it but the problem is
whoops<00:02:46.000> guess<00:02:46.570> I'm<00:02:46.690> not<00:02:46.810> hitting<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.050> triple

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
whoops guess I'm not hitting the triple

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.740 
whoops guess I'm not hitting the triple
this<00:02:47.410> lap<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.010> problem<00:02:48.310> with<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.430> is

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
this lap the problem with that is

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.600 
this lap the problem with that is
usually<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.990> nosedive<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.680> after<00:02:51.070> you<00:02:51.160> scrub

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
usually the nosedive is after you scrub

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.780 
usually the nosedive is after you scrub
and<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.120> don't<00:02:52.180> know<00:02:52.450> how<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.980> how<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.010> scrub<00:02:54.580> and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220

still get the front end back up like you
can<00:02:57.430> scrub<00:02:57.850> here<00:02:58.390> but<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.620> can't<00:03:00.100> recover<00:03:00.490> the

can scrub here but you can't recover the

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.150 
can scrub here but you can't recover the
front<00:03:01.000> end<00:03:01.150> but<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:02.410> yeah<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.650> is<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.860> little

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
if you if you preload a jump which is
