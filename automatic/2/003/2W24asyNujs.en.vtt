know<00:00:25.540> about<00:00:25.600> the<00:00:25.840> master<00:00:26.170> cylinders<00:00:26.530> when

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
know about the master cylinders when

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.020 
know about the master cylinders when
you're<00:00:26.800> buying<00:00:27.010> one<00:00:27.250> of<00:00:27.280> these<00:00:27.430> and<00:00:27.790> if<00:00:27.880> you're

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
you're buying one of these and if you're

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.120 
you're buying one of these and if you're
buying<00:00:28.180> one<00:00:28.330> used<00:00:28.720> off<00:00:29.620> eBay<00:00:29.980> or<00:00:30.040> something

always<00:00:30.910> ask<00:00:31.150> if<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:32.529> piston<00:00:33.219> in<00:00:33.340> here<00:00:33.579> has

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
always ask if the piston in here has

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.509 
always ask if the piston in here has
some<00:00:34.180> movement<00:00:34.600> in<00:00:34.690> it<00:00:35.070> take<00:00:36.070> off<00:00:36.219> the<00:00:36.339> brake

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
some movement in it take off the brake

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.209 
some movement in it take off the brake
lever<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:37.620> push<00:00:38.620> your<00:00:38.769> finger<00:00:38.980> up<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.129> down

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
if it's got movement it means it's not

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.270 
if it's got movement it means it's not
seized<00:00:40.929> most<00:00:41.350> of<00:00:41.499> the<00:00:41.559> top<00:00:41.769> will<00:00:41.949> not<00:00:42.070> most

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
seized most of the top will not most

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.829 
seized most of the top will not most
time<00:00:42.489> but<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.670> lot<00:00:42.909> of<00:00:43.089> time<00:00:43.269> these<00:00:43.449> guys<00:00:43.480> are

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
time but a lot of time these guys are

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.229 
time but a lot of time these guys are
seized<00:00:44.079> up<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:45.100> it's<00:00:45.579> kind<00:00:45.820> of<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:45.940> pain<00:00:46.120> in<00:00:46.210> the

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
seized up and it's kind of a pain in the

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.079 
seized up and it's kind of a pain in the
ass<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.420> get<00:00:46.719> them<00:00:46.870> on<00:00:47.079> seized<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.879> way<00:00:49.030> you

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
ass to get them on seized one way you

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.970 
ass to get them on seized one way you
can<00:00:49.390> do<00:00:49.690> it<00:00:49.839> which<00:00:50.079> I<00:00:50.199> did<00:00:50.379> do<00:00:50.559> with<00:00:50.710> mine

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
can do it which I did do with mine

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.639 
can do it which I did do with mine
because<00:00:51.519> it<00:00:51.730> was<00:00:51.819> pretty<00:00:51.969> seized<00:00:52.499> just<00:00:53.499> so<00:00:53.559> you

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
because it was pretty seized just so you

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.450 
because it was pretty seized just so you
know<00:00:53.679> brake<00:00:54.039> fluid<00:00:54.460> is<00:00:54.640> soluble<00:00:55.239> with<00:00:55.390> water

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
know brake fluid is soluble with water

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.610 
know brake fluid is soluble with water
which<00:00:57.460> is<00:00:57.489> also<00:00:57.760> another<00:00:58.030> big<00:00:58.719> pointer<00:00:59.079> do<00:00:59.409> not

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
which is also another big pointer do not

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.739 
which is also another big pointer do not
get<00:00:59.769> brake<00:01:00.010> fluid<00:01:00.280> on<00:01:00.370> your<00:01:00.550> hands<00:01:01.179> it<00:01:01.359> goes

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
get brake fluid on your hands it goes

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.270 
get brake fluid on your hands it goes
directly<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.409> your<00:01:02.530> skin<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:02.949> straight<00:01:03.249> to

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:09.219 
brake fluid make sure that you wear

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.240 
brake fluid make sure that you wear
rubber<00:01:09.460> gloves<00:01:09.719> anyway<00:01:10.719> um<00:01:11.079> you<00:01:11.740> can<00:01:11.890> take<00:01:12.070> the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
rubber gloves anyway um you can take the

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.889 
rubber gloves anyway um you can take the
whole<00:01:12.430> master<00:01:12.670> cylinder<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.390> boil<00:01:13.600> it<00:01:13.630> out

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
whole master cylinder and boil it out

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.090 
whole master cylinder and boil it out
like<00:01:14.140> they<00:01:14.259> used<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.469> do<00:01:14.530> with<00:01:14.649> carburetors

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
like they used to do with carburetors

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.170 
like they used to do with carburetors
it's<00:01:15.219> up<00:01:15.310> in<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:15.460> old<00:01:15.579> day<00:01:15.700> because<00:01:15.969> it<00:01:16.090> is

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
it's up in the old day because it is

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.260 
it's up in the old day because it is
soluble<00:01:16.450> with<00:01:16.990> water<00:01:17.829> I<00:01:18.130> took<00:01:18.460> my<00:01:18.700> whole<00:01:18.939> mouth

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
soluble with water I took my whole mouth

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.490 
soluble with water I took my whole mouth
cylinder<00:01:19.750> put<00:01:19.899> it<00:01:19.990> in<00:01:20.079> a<00:01:20.140> pot<00:01:20.289> of<00:01:20.350> boiling

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
cylinder put it in a pot of boiling

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.870 
cylinder put it in a pot of boiling
water<00:01:20.710> left<00:01:21.100> it<00:01:21.219> there<00:01:21.310> for<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.549> couple<00:01:21.670> hours

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
water left it there for a couple hours

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.090 
water left it there for a couple hours
kept<00:01:22.240> adding<00:01:22.390> water<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:23.590> let<00:01:23.710> it<00:01:23.799> boil<00:01:23.920> out

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
kept adding water just let it boil out

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.859 
kept adding water just let it boil out
and<00:01:24.369> slowly<00:01:24.670> got<00:01:24.939> some<00:01:25.149> movement<00:01:25.329> out<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.750> this

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
and slowly got some movement out of this

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.139 
and slowly got some movement out of this
you<00:01:26.680> if<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.100> have<00:01:27.189> another<00:01:27.399> master<00:01:27.820> cylinder

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
you if you have another master cylinder

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.999 
you if you have another master cylinder
you<00:01:28.240> can<00:01:28.390> hook<00:01:28.509> them<00:01:28.630> together<00:01:28.890> pump<00:01:29.890> them

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
you can hook them together pump them

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.649 
you can hook them together pump them
back<00:01:30.189> and<00:01:30.399> forth<00:01:30.610> until<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:31.030> one's<00:01:31.270> slow

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
back and forth until this one's slow

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.929 
back and forth until this one's slow
it'll<00:01:32.049> slowly<00:01:32.380> kind<00:01:32.680> of<00:01:32.799> let<00:01:32.950> up<00:01:33.070> let<00:01:33.909> me

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
it'll slowly kind of let up let me

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.490 
it'll slowly kind of let up let me
definitely<00:01:34.180> I<00:01:34.420> want<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.659> force<00:01:34.899> it<00:01:35.109> because<00:01:35.259> if

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
definitely I want to force it because if

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.749 
definitely I want to force it because if
you<00:01:35.560> scratch<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:35.920> inside<00:01:36.399> of<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.579> cylinder

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
you scratch the inside of the cylinder

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.880 
you scratch the inside of the cylinder
inside<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.750> housing<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:38.439> becomes<00:01:38.710> pretty

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
inside the housing it becomes pretty

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.399 
inside the housing it becomes pretty

rubber<00:02:02.090> sheet<00:02:02.539> cheating<00:02:03.229> around<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.679> piston

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
rubber sheet cheating around the piston

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.290 
rubber sheet cheating around the piston
I<00:02:04.990> generally<00:02:05.990> just<00:02:06.140> kind<00:02:06.289> of<00:02:06.319> pull<00:02:06.530> that<00:02:06.679> off

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
I generally just kind of pull that off

I generally just kind of pull that off
sometimes<00:02:08.300> they<00:02:08.390> come<00:02:08.509> out<00:02:08.660> really<00:02:08.690> easy

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
sometimes they come out really easy

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.330 
sometimes they come out really easy
sometimes<00:02:09.289> they're<00:02:09.590> rotten<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.099> got<00:02:10.220> to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
sometimes they're rotten and you got to

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.800 
sometimes they're rotten and you got to
kind<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.580> yank<00:02:10.819> them<00:02:10.970> off<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.330> stuff<00:02:11.540> so

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
kind of yank them off and stuff so

that's<00:02:12.620> good<00:02:12.890> usually<00:02:13.280> around<00:02:13.370> those<00:02:13.670> there

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
that's good usually around those there

is<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.269> little<00:02:15.340> little<00:02:16.340> retaining<00:02:16.910> ring<00:02:17.090> that

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
is a little little retaining ring that

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.860 
is a little little retaining ring that
holds<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.660> on<00:02:18.790> next<00:02:19.790> thing<00:02:19.940> then<00:02:20.090> you'll<00:02:20.599> see

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
holds it on next thing then you'll see

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.210 
holds it on next thing then you'll see
if<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:21.110> look<00:02:21.290> down<00:02:21.470> in<00:02:21.650> there<00:02:21.799> there's<00:02:22.040> going

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
to be a little clamp you got to get one

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.380 
to be a little clamp you got to get one
of<00:02:26.030> these<00:02:26.090> guys<00:02:26.269> in<00:02:26.510> there<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.900> get<00:02:27.019> it<00:02:27.140> out

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.559 

mine<00:02:32.390> wasn't<00:02:33.049> long<00:02:33.349> enough<00:02:33.620> for<00:02:33.829> this<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:35.420> can

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
mine wasn't long enough for this you can

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.300 
mine wasn't long enough for this you can
get<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.750> couple<00:02:35.900> all's<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.650> struggle<00:02:37.069> all<00:02:37.160> day

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
get a couple all's and struggle all day

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.250 
get a couple all's and struggle all day
long<00:02:37.489> which<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.150> kind<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.390> did<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:38.599> pre<00:02:38.989> did<00:02:39.170> this

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
long which I kind of did I pre did this

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.050 
long which I kind of did I pre did this
one<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.799> didn't<00:02:40.099> waste<00:02:40.190> all<00:02:40.370> your<00:02:40.430> time<00:02:40.579> but

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
one so I didn't waste all your time but

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.819 
one so I didn't waste all your time but
looks<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.049> little<00:02:42.260> guy<00:02:42.380> it's<00:02:42.709> got

looks like that little guy it's got
little<00:02:42.950> holes<00:02:43.190> on<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.579> ends<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.200> can<00:02:45.410> get

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
little holes on the ends so you can get

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.660 
little holes on the ends so you can get
that<00:02:45.530> out<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:47.930> your<00:02:48.079> piston<00:02:48.670> should

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
that out and then your piston should

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.670 
that out and then your piston should
just<00:02:49.880> slide<00:02:50.450> right<00:02:50.510> out<00:02:50.720> especially<00:02:51.530> if<00:02:51.590> it's

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
just slide right out especially if it's

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.229 
just slide right out especially if it's
Nazis<00:02:52.130> that's<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.730> first<00:02:52.940> part<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.180> your

Nazis that's the first part of your

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.539 
Nazis that's the first part of your
piston<00:02:53.690> on<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.799> end<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.160> there's<00:02:55.340> going<00:02:55.489> to

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
piston on the end of it there's going to

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.360 
piston on the end of it there's going to
be<00:02:55.579> a<00:02:55.670> piece<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:55.910> rubber<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:59.660> spring<00:03:00.370> kind

pretty straightforward first there's a

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.380 
pretty straightforward first there's a
spring<00:04:10.490> it's<00:04:11.480> got<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.630> little<00:04:11.720> cap<00:04:11.990> on<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.290> and

spring it's got a little cap on it and
then<00:04:14.390> there's<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:15.400> kind<00:04:16.400> of<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.550> little<00:04:16.730> valve

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
then there's a kind of a little valve

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.520 
then there's a kind of a little valve
piece<00:04:17.360> you've<00:04:17.600> got<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.840> put<00:04:17.959> on<00:04:18.050> the<00:04:18.110> back<00:04:18.260> end

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
piece you've got to put on the back end

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.729 
piece you've got to put on the back end
of<00:04:18.680> it<00:04:19.570> that<00:04:20.570> slides<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:20.959> first<00:04:21.230> little<00:04:21.560> valve

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
of it that slides in first little valve

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.450 
of it that slides in first little valve
piece<00:04:22.010> goes<00:04:22.220> in<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.610> bottom<00:04:24.280> when<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:25.340> get

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
piece goes in the bottom when you get

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.190 
piece goes in the bottom when you get
the<00:04:25.580> kit<00:04:25.790> that<00:04:25.970> valve<00:04:26.180> piece<00:04:26.420> might<00:04:26.720> not<00:04:26.900> be<00:04:27.050> on

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
the kit that valve piece might not be on

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.520 
the kit that valve piece might not be on
there<00:04:27.440> your<00:04:27.800> next<00:04:27.950> piece<00:04:28.220> is<00:04:29.380> going<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.470> be

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
there your next piece is going to be

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.680 
there your next piece is going to be
this<00:04:30.620> little<00:04:30.740> rubber<00:04:31.840> plunger<00:04:33.550> this<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:35.510> open

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
this little rubber plunger this the open

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.670 
this little rubber plunger this the open
end<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.200> it<00:04:36.320> sits<00:04:36.740> on<00:04:36.950> top<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.610> spring

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
end of it sits on top of that a spring

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.750 
end of it sits on top of that a spring
it's<00:04:39.680> really<00:04:39.830> easy<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.190> get<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.460> upside<00:04:40.730> down

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
it's really easy to get it upside down

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.020 
it's really easy to get it upside down
so<00:04:42.130> make<00:04:43.130> sure<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.340> get<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.550> in<00:04:43.580> right<00:04:43.760> side<00:04:44.000> up

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
so make sure you get it in right side up

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.120 
so make sure you get it in right side up
again<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:47.170> open<00:04:48.170> end<00:04:48.320> goes<00:04:48.500> towards<00:04:49.010> the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
again the open end goes towards the

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.080 
again the open end goes towards the
spring<00:04:51.490> sometimes<00:04:52.490> when<00:04:52.670> you're<00:04:52.790> doing<00:04:53.000> this

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
spring sometimes when you're doing this

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.730 
spring sometimes when you're doing this
it's<00:04:53.330> good<00:04:53.810> idea<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.200> put<00:04:54.350> a<00:04:54.410> little<00:04:54.560> bit<00:04:54.680> of

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
it's good idea to put a little bit of

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.380 
it's good idea to put a little bit of
brake<00:04:55.280> fluid<00:04:55.310> on<00:04:55.640> I'm<00:04:55.820> gonna<00:04:55.940> try<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.120> do<00:04:56.270> it

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
brake fluid on I'm gonna try to do it

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.870 
brake fluid on I'm gonna try to do it
dry<00:04:56.600> but<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:56.990> can<00:04:57.170> put<00:04:58.160> a<00:04:58.190> little<00:04:58.340> brake<00:04:58.580> fluid

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
dry but you can put a little brake fluid

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.210 
dry but you can put a little brake fluid
in<00:04:59.000> here<00:04:59.240> or<00:04:59.510> coat<00:05:00.290> the<00:05:00.410> rubber<00:05:00.620> pieces<00:05:00.860> up

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
in here or coat the rubber pieces up

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.690 
in here or coat the rubber pieces up
with<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.370> little<00:05:01.580> brake<00:05:01.730> fluid<00:05:02.140> to<00:05:03.140> uh<00:05:03.700> he's

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
with a little brake fluid to uh he's

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.690 
with a little brake fluid to uh he's
kind<00:05:04.730> of<00:05:05.090> loop<00:05:05.270> putting<00:05:05.570> everything<00:05:05.750> together

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
kind of loop putting everything together

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.520 
kind of loop putting everything together
but<00:05:07.700> again<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:07.940> suggest<00:05:08.240> if<00:05:08.720> you<00:05:08.840> do<00:05:08.990> that<00:05:09.170> make

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
but again I suggest if you do that make

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.470 
but again I suggest if you do that make
sure<00:05:09.560> you<00:05:10.010> wear<00:05:10.160> rubber<00:05:10.370> gloves<00:05:10.460> again<00:05:11.120> break

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
sure you wear rubber gloves again break

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.230 
sure you wear rubber gloves again break

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.430 
dollar tool bin or whatever so I'm
probably<00:06:44.270> gonna<00:06:44.510> invest<00:06:44.840> in<00:06:44.960> a<00:06:45.050> better<00:06:45.169> one

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
probably gonna invest in a better one

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.930 
probably gonna invest in a better one
maybe<00:06:45.770> one<00:06:45.889> was<00:06:46.010> a<00:06:46.070> little<00:06:46.250> bit<00:06:46.340> longer<00:06:46.520> a

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
maybe one was a little bit longer a

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.730 
maybe one was a little bit longer a
little<00:06:47.900> bit<00:06:48.229> more<00:06:48.350> strength<00:06:48.710> but<00:06:50.530> so<00:06:51.530> you<00:06:51.620> get

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
little bit more strength but so you get

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.140 
little bit more strength but so you get
that<00:06:51.830> rubber<00:06:52.039> boot<00:06:52.250> last<00:06:52.789> thing<00:06:52.910> you<00:06:53.000> got<00:06:53.060> to

that rubber boot last thing you got to

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.200 
that rubber boot last thing you got to
do<00:06:53.270> is<00:06:53.300> drop<00:06:53.570> the<00:06:53.780> little<00:06:54.430> clamp<00:06:55.430> right<00:06:55.610> this

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
do is drop the little clamp right this

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.610 
do is drop the little clamp right this
kit<00:06:56.479> did<00:06:56.660> come<00:06:56.840> with<00:06:56.990> it<00:06:57.080> so<00:06:57.200> you<00:06:57.289> don't<00:06:57.470> have

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
kit did come with it so you don't have

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.070 
kit did come with it so you don't have
to<00:06:57.800> salvage<00:06:58.010> that<00:06:58.310> obviously<00:06:58.880> so<00:06:59.750> I<00:06:59.810> got<00:06:59.960> that
