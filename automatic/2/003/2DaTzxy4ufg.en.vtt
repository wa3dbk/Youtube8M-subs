because if you use the striker you
really<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.390> within<00:01:54.630> range<00:01:54.990> until<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
really have to be within range until you

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.030 
really have to be within range until you
unlock<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.430> damage<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.329> range<00:01:58.079> etc<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
unlock like damage and range etc and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.730 
unlock like damage and range etc and
then<00:01:59.159> there's<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.549> whole<00:01:59.939> um<00:02:00.469> little<00:02:01.469> glitch

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
then there's this whole um little glitch

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.469 
then there's this whole um little glitch
now<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.549> wouldn't<00:02:02.790> consider<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.270> glitch

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
now and I wouldn't consider it a glitch

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.810 
now and I wouldn't consider it a glitch
because<00:02:03.659> Infinity<00:02:04.619> Ward<00:02:04.890> has<00:02:05.130> done<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.520> for

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
because Infinity Ward has done this for

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.900 
because Infinity Ward has done this for
forever<00:02:07.039> depending<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.550> they

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
forever depending on what you have they

that has like extended mags on them when

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.839 
that has like extended mags on them when
it<00:02:48.599> comes<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.900> shotguns<00:02:49.379> then<00:02:50.099> they<00:02:50.340> get<00:02:50.549> an

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
it comes to shotguns then they get an

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.530 
it comes to shotguns then they get an
increase<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.890> power<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.340> guess<00:02:53.640> by<00:02:54.090> fifty

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
increase in power I guess by fifty

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.099 
increase in power I guess by fifty
percent<00:02:54.890> but<00:02:55.890> that's<00:02:56.099> it<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.870> really

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
percent but that's it and it really

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.690 
percent but that's it and it really
doesn't<00:02:58.410> help<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.890> if<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.160> don't<00:02:59.340> play<00:02:59.549> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
well you play the kit so let's say for

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.400 
well you play the kit so let's say for

example you're using a shotgun you have
to<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:09.120> have<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.329> be<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.690> close<00:03:09.930> quarters<00:03:10.379> and

to you have to be in close quarters and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.580 
to you have to be in close quarters and
another<00:03:11.519> issue<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.090> striker<00:03:12.359> has<00:03:12.629> is<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.440> it

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
another issue the striker has is that it

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.729 
another issue the striker has is that it
takes<00:03:13.769> forever<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.370> reload<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.180> can't

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
takes forever to reload and you can't

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.860 
takes forever to reload and you can't
that<00:03:16.739> reload<00:03:17.130> animation<00:03:17.459> for<00:03:18.209> some<00:03:18.419> reason<00:03:18.750> i

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
that reload animation for some reason i

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.210

just helps you on your reload it makes

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.809 
just helps you on your reload it makes
you<00:03:36.660> reload<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.290> little<00:03:37.530> bit<00:03:37.650> faster<00:03:37.859> because

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
you reload a little bit faster because

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.500 
you reload a little bit faster because
it<00:03:39.120> cuts<00:03:39.299> back<00:03:39.599> it<00:03:39.900> cuts<00:03:40.109> out<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.500> animation

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
it cuts back it cuts out that animation

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.199 
it cuts back it cuts out that animation
so<00:03:42.799> striker<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.980> me<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.190> not<00:03:44.280> overpowered<00:03:45.030> man

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
so striker to me is not overpowered man

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.300 
so striker to me is not overpowered man
I've<00:03:45.419> have<00:03:45.660> gotten<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.440> many<00:03:46.560> hit<00:03:46.799> markers<00:03:47.160> and

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
I've have gotten so many hit markers and

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.759 
I've have gotten so many hit markers and
you<00:03:47.400> use<00:03:47.579> range<00:03:48.000> get<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.049> many<00:03:49.230> hip<00:03:49.410> Marcus

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
you use range get so many hip Marcus

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.830 
you use range get so many hip Marcus
with<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.209> that's<00:03:51.209> why<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.419> doesn't<00:03:51.720> make<00:03:51.780> any

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
with it that's why it doesn't make any

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.140 
with it that's why it doesn't make any
sense<00:03:52.230> i<00:03:52.440> would<00:03:52.560> use<00:03:52.709> damage<00:03:53.160> which<00:03:53.730> i've<00:03:53.910> been

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
sense i would use damage which i've been

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.720 
sense i would use damage which i've been
using<00:03:54.329> i<00:03:54.629> think<00:03:54.870> i<00:03:54.959> have<00:03:54.989> damage<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.709> here<00:03:56.579> as
