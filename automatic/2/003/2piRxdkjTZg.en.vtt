00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
last one comes out soon so you get the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.100 
last one comes out soon so you get the
whole<00:03:26.460> series<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.970> three<00:03:27.360> long<00:03:27.540> collections

omniverse<00:03:29.850> volumes<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.870> I'd<00:03:30.990> be<00:03:31.080> much<00:03:31.260> much

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
omniverse volumes and I'd be much much

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.020 
omniverse volumes and I'd be much much
cheaper<00:03:31.500> each<00:03:31.980> one<00:03:32.160> of<00:03:32.250> those<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.670> about<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
cheaper each one of those is about the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.490

cost<00:03:33.240> of<00:03:33.390> one<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.660> half<00:03:33.690> volume<00:03:34.080> so<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.410> was

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
cost of one and a half volume so it was

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.260 
cost of one and a half volume so it was
about<00:03:34.680> half<00:03:34.890> price<00:03:35.100> so<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.670> know<00:03:35.850> if<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.090> if
