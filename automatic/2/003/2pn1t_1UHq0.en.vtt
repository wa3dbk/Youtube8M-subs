and<00:02:29.660> hopefully<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.750> turns<00:02:30.960> out<00:02:31.110> well<00:02:31.290> what

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
and hopefully that turns out well what

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.990 
and hopefully that turns out well what
I'm<00:02:31.590> going<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.800> do<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.250> because<00:02:32.700> they're<00:02:32.880> all

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
I'm going to do is because they're all

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.090 
I'm going to do is because they're all
shiny<00:02:33.270> now<00:02:33.630> I'm<00:02:33.900> going<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.200> put<00:02:34.320> permanent<00:02:34.890> pen

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
shiny now I'm going to put permanent pen

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.730 
shiny now I'm going to put permanent pen
around<00:02:35.520> their<00:02:35.960> permanent<00:02:36.960> pen<00:02:37.200> around<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
around their permanent pen around the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.140 
around their permanent pen around the
valve<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.630> then<00:02:39.630> I'll<00:02:40.230> lap<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.370> with<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
valve and then I'll lap it with the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.220 
valve and then I'll lap it with the
grade<00:02:42.750> two<00:02:43.670> because<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.940> gritty<00:02:45.330> stuff<00:02:45.720> and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
grade two because the gritty stuff and

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.820 
grade two because the gritty stuff and
then<00:02:47.160> what<00:02:48.150> I'll<00:02:48.270> do<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.510> take<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.720> out<00:02:48.960> wipe<00:02:49.650> it

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
then what I'll do is take it out wipe it

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.380 
then what I'll do is take it out wipe it
off<00:02:49.980> wipe<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.490> off<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.640> valve<00:02:50.850> if<00:02:51.060> there's<00:02:51.270> any

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
off wipe it off the valve if there's any

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.260 
off wipe it off the valve if there's any
pendant<00:02:51.750> pen<00:02:52.020> left<00:02:52.320> then<00:02:53.310> I'll<00:02:53.580> keep<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:53.970> going

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
pendant pen left then I'll keep on going

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.610 
pendant pen left then I'll keep on going
I'll<00:02:54.660> keep<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:54.900> going<00:02:55.110> until<00:02:55.200> there's<00:02:55.440> no

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
I'll keep on going until there's no

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
I'll keep on going until there's no
permanent<00:02:55.860> pen<00:02:56.130> left<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.420> then<00:02:58.490> yeah<00:02:59.490> it

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
permanent pen left and then yeah it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.000 
permanent pen left and then yeah it
should<00:02:59.880> be<00:02:59.910> good<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.660> then<00:03:01.410> I've<00:03:01.620> got<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:01.890> get

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
should be good and then I've got to get

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.220 
should be good and then I've got to get
a<00:03:02.070> fire<00:03:02.400> or<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.940> dremel<00:03:03.360> I'm<00:03:03.510> not<00:03:03.750> for<00:03:03.900> file<00:03:04.050> will

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
a fire or a dremel I'm not for file will

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.630 
a fire or a dremel I'm not for file will
work<00:03:04.260> actually<00:03:04.590> because<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:05.250> would<00:03:05.520> take

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
work actually because it would take

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.030 
work actually because it would take
forever<00:03:05.850> with<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.240> file<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:07.500> shave<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
forever with the file and I shave the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.220 
forever with the file and I shave the
eyebrows<00:03:08.520> on<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.750> what<00:03:09.900> I'm<00:03:09.959> going<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.110> do

eyebrows on this so what I'm going to do

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.260 
eyebrows on this so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:10.350> shave<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.709> from<00:03:11.480> there<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:13.290> there<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.880> talk

we work in metric I'm trying to learn
all<00:03:40.410> these<00:03:40.500> imperial<00:03:40.980> measurements<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:41.850> it's

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
all these imperial measurements and it's

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.310 
all these imperial measurements and it's
pre<00:03:42.660> hard<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:44.040> due<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.989> awesomeness<00:03:45.989> of

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
and I have left me valves with this

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.720 
and I have left me valves with this
valve<00:04:06.060> lapping<00:04:06.390> compound<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:07.280> further<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.519> did

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
valve lapping compound I further I did

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.320 
valve lapping compound I further I did
the<00:04:08.820> exhaust<00:04:09.090> valve<00:04:09.330> first<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:10.080> I<00:04:11.060> use<00:04:12.060> the

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
the exhaust valve first and I use the

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.810 
the exhaust valve first and I use the
first<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.320> all<00:04:13.440> use<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.709> grade<00:04:13.980> 2<00:04:14.340> which<00:04:14.610> is

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
first of all use the grade 2 which is

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.110 
first of all use the grade 2 which is
the<00:04:15.030> gritty<00:04:15.810> sort<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:16.320> stuff

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
the gritty sort of stuff

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.199 
the gritty sort of stuff
of<00:04:18.120> course<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.959> then<00:04:19.080> I<00:04:19.109> used<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:20.160> Greig<00:04:20.910> one

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
of course and then I used the Greig one

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.900 
of course and then I used the Greig one
which<00:04:21.419> is<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.780> end<00:04:21.989> finish<00:04:22.919> like<00:04:23.580> it's<00:04:23.729> like<00:04:23.850> a

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
which is the end finish like it's like a

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.390 
which is the end finish like it's like a
fine<00:04:24.210> one<00:04:24.600> it's<00:04:24.900> like<00:04:25.020> almost<00:04:25.310> hardly<00:04:26.310> any

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
fine one it's like almost hardly any

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.709 
fine one it's like almost hardly any
grit<00:04:26.640> in<00:04:26.760> it

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:27.719 
grit in it

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:30.170 
grit in it
and<00:04:27.930> then<00:04:28.530> for<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.919> intake<00:04:29.460> valve<00:04:29.699> because<00:04:30.090> I

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
and then for the intake valve because I

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.659 
and then for the intake valve because I
grind<00:04:30.479> it<00:04:30.629> for<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:30.960> long<00:04:30.990> we<00:04:31.919> degrade<00:04:32.099> to<00:04:32.400> I

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
grind it for so long we degrade to I

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.219 
grind it for so long we degrade to I
didn't<00:04:33.090> really<00:04:33.270> want<00:04:33.449> to<00:04:33.509> grind<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.020> anymore

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
didn't really want to grind it anymore

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.179 
didn't really want to grind it anymore
with<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.650> grade<00:04:34.830> one<00:04:36.770> silly<00:04:37.770> me<00:04:37.889> put<00:04:38.099> the

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:38.189 
with the grade one silly me put the

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.040 
with the grade one silly me put the
valves<00:04:38.520> back<00:04:38.699> in<00:04:38.879> I'll<00:04:39.120> take<00:04:39.389> them<00:04:39.569> out<00:04:42.050> and

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
valves back in I'll take them out and

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.790 
valves back in I'll take them out and
I'll<00:04:43.199> show<00:04:43.379> you<00:04:43.439> the<00:04:43.949> seats<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.580> all<00:04:44.759> that

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
I'll show you the seats and all that

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.029 
I'll show you the seats and all that
originally<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:46.860> was<00:04:47.039> going<00:04:47.159> to<00:04:47.250> use<00:04:47.430> permit<00:04:47.819> pen

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
originally I was going to use permit pen

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.230 
originally I was going to use permit pen
to<00:04:50.039> put<00:04:50.189> around<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.490> valve<00:04:50.669> seats<00:04:50.969> in<00:04:51.120> the

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
to put around the valve seats in the

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.600 
to put around the valve seats in the
valves<00:04:51.689> and<00:04:51.900> then<00:04:52.500> once<00:04:52.770> I've<00:04:52.979> wiped<00:04:53.219> off<00:04:53.460> the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
valves and then once I've wiped off the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.550 
valves and then once I've wiped off the
valve<00:04:53.819> stuff<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.569> would<00:04:54.689> tell<00:04:54.960> me<00:04:55.110> like<00:04:55.319> where

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
valve stuff it would tell me like where

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.270 
valve stuff it would tell me like where
the<00:04:55.889> little<00:04:56.310> black<00:04:56.550> bits<00:04:58.009> where<00:04:59.009> it's<00:04:59.129> not

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
the little black bits where it's not

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.790 
the little black bits where it's not
grinded<00:04:59.789> but<00:05:00.150> so<00:05:00.599> that<00:05:00.810> did<00:05:00.960> not<00:05:01.110> work<00:05:01.379> as<00:05:01.620> the

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
grinded but so that did not work as the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.149 
grinded but so that did not work as the
pen<00:05:02.129> and<00:05:02.250> pen<00:05:02.400> does<00:05:02.550> not<00:05:02.729> bond<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.479> comes<00:05:03.840> off

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
pen and pen does not bond it comes off

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.080 
pen and pen does not bond it comes off
even<00:05:05.159> though<00:05:05.250> it's<00:05:05.340> permanent<00:05:05.669> pen<00:05:05.849> it<00:05:05.939> does

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
even though it's permanent pen it does

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.309 
even though it's permanent pen it does
not<00:05:06.270> bond<00:05:07.080> well<00:05:07.819> comes<00:05:08.819> right<00:05:09.210> off<00:05:09.240> must<00:05:10.080> just

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
not bond well comes right off must just

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.040 
not bond well comes right off must just
because<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.949> grease<00:05:11.610> and<00:05:11.879> stuff<00:05:12.479> I<00:05:12.599> mean

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
because of the grease and stuff I mean

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.010 
because of the grease and stuff I mean
if<00:05:13.199> you<00:05:13.289> do<00:05:13.409> your<00:05:13.650> eases<00:05:13.949> then<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:14.849> might<00:05:15.060> be

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
if you do your eases then you might be

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.719 
if you do your eases then you might be
able<00:05:16.169> to<00:05:16.289> do<00:05:16.409> the<00:05:16.529> pen<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:16.830> pen<00:05:16.979> way<00:05:17.129> but<00:05:17.400> I

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
able to do the pen and pen way but I

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.610 
able to do the pen and pen way but I
didn't<00:05:18.330> have<00:05:18.389> any<00:05:18.539> degrees<00:05:18.930> uh<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.289> I<00:05:19.409> wasn't

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
didn't have any degrees uh so I wasn't

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.059 
didn't have any degrees uh so I wasn't
going<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.830> worry<00:05:19.979> about<00:05:20.159> it<00:05:21.560> okay<00:05:22.560> this

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:25.069 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.170

way around these seats it's not saying
they're<00:05:39.180> all<00:05:39.210> shiny<00:05:39.539> and<00:05:41.479> no<00:05:42.680> discolored<00:05:43.680> bits

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
they're all shiny and no discolored bits

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.249 
they're all shiny and no discolored bits
at<00:05:44.520> all<00:05:44.759> on<00:05:45.000> them<00:05:45.180> they're<00:05:45.419> shiny<00:05:45.870> all<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.199> way

really really well now so yeah basically

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.790 
really really well now so yeah basically
just<00:05:55.949> like<00:05:56.339> the<00:05:56.550> valving<00:05:57.500> obviously<00:05:58.500> put<00:05:58.680> on

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
just like the valving obviously put on

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.760 
just like the valving obviously put on
TDC<00:05:59.449> if<00:06:00.449> you<00:06:00.569> don't<00:06:00.750> know<00:06:00.839> what<00:06:00.930> TDC<00:06:01.409> means<00:06:01.650> it

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
TDC if you don't know what TDC means it

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.119 
TDC if you don't know what TDC means it
means<00:06:01.919> top<00:06:02.250> dead<00:06:02.490> center<00:06:03.620> what<00:06:04.620> top<00:06:04.889> dead

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
means top dead center what top dead

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.519 
means top dead center what top dead
center<00:06:05.580> means<00:06:05.819> is<00:06:06.180> when<00:06:06.839> both<00:06:07.080> valves<00:06:07.349> are

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:07.529 
center means is when both valves are

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.089 
center means is when both valves are
closed<00:06:07.830> now<00:06:08.159> the<00:06:09.560> so<00:06:10.560> when<00:06:10.710> it's<00:06:10.860> on<00:06:10.949> it's

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
closed now the so when it's on it's

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.309 
closed now the so when it's on it's
compression<00:06:11.460> stroke<00:06:11.909> and<00:06:12.150> exploding<00:06:13.050> a<00:06:13.110> few

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
compression stroke and exploding a few

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.209 
compression stroke and exploding a few
let's<00:06:13.740> top<00:06:13.949> dead<00:06:14.129> center<00:06:14.870> so<00:06:15.870> if<00:06:16.589> you've<00:06:16.860> ever

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
let's top dead center so if you've ever

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.820 
let's top dead center so if you've ever
heard<00:06:17.389> TDC<00:06:18.389> now<00:06:18.930> you<00:06:18.990> know<00:06:19.199> what<00:06:19.319> it<00:06:19.409> means<00:06:19.560> so

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
heard TDC now you know what it means so

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.159 
heard TDC now you know what it means so
you<00:06:20.490> get<00:06:20.669> this<00:06:20.789> little<00:06:21.000> first<00:06:21.870> of<00:06:21.960> all<00:06:22.050> we<00:06:22.110> put

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
you get this little first of all we put

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.559 
you get this little first of all we put
lapping<00:06:22.589> compound<00:06:22.620> around<00:06:23.400> that<00:06:24.270> greasy

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
lapping compound around that greasy

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.709 
lapping compound around that greasy
stuff<00:06:24.960> and<00:06:25.279> then<00:06:26.279> you<00:06:27.180> put<00:06:27.419> this<00:06:27.509> little

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:27.719 
stuff and then you put this little

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:29.929 
stuff and then you put this little
plunger<00:06:28.259> stick<00:06:28.319> on<00:06:28.919> which<00:06:29.159> is<00:06:29.370> called<00:06:29.699> the

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:29.939 
plunger stick on which is called the

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.649 
plunger stick on which is called the
leper<00:06:31.009> and<00:06:32.009> you<00:06:32.189> just<00:06:32.400> basically<00:06:32.879> turn<00:06:33.449> it

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
leper and you just basically turn it

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.279 
leper and you just basically turn it
like<00:06:33.750> that<00:06:33.810> but<00:06:34.379> with<00:06:34.650> both<00:06:35.550> hands<00:06:35.959> we<00:06:36.959> see<00:06:37.139> our

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
like that but with both hands we see our

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.680 
like that but with both hands we see our
holding<00:06:38.190> hands<00:06:38.399> we've<00:06:38.669> done<00:06:38.789> them<00:06:38.909> so<00:06:39.630> you

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
holding hands we've done them so you

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.980 
holding hands we've done them so you
just<00:06:39.899> got<00:06:40.080> that

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
just got that

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.310 
just got that
jebel<00:06:41.320> turn<00:06:41.590> and<00:06:41.950> then<00:06:42.100> do<00:06:42.880> it<00:06:43.140> do<00:06:44.140> that<00:06:44.260> for

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
jebel turn and then do it do that for

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.660 
jebel turn and then do it do that for
about<00:06:44.530> five<00:06:44.890> minutes<00:06:45.640> maybe<00:06:46.630> ten<00:06:46.990> minutes<00:06:47.140> and

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
about five minutes maybe ten minutes and

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.940 
about five minutes maybe ten minutes and
then<00:06:48.720> take<00:06:49.720> it<00:06:49.780> off<00:06:50.020> wipe<00:06:50.350> all<00:06:50.470> the<00:06:50.560> stuff<00:06:50.770> out

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
then take it off wipe all the stuff out

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.460 
then take it off wipe all the stuff out
if<00:06:51.100> it's<00:06:51.250> not<00:06:51.670> good<00:06:51.940> it<00:06:52.750> should<00:06:52.930> be<00:06:53.050> good<00:06:53.200> after

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
if it's not good it should be good after

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.220 
if it's not good it should be good after
five<00:06:53.680> minutes<00:06:53.890> and<00:06:54.570> then<00:06:55.570> yeah<00:06:55.750> then<00:06:56.080> your

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
five minutes and then yeah then your

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.810 
five minutes and then yeah then your
valves<00:06:56.530> are<00:06:56.620> lapped<00:06:56.830> and<00:06:57.100> they're<00:06:57.370> seated

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
valves are lapped and they're seated

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.460 
valves are lapped and they're seated
really<00:06:58.690> really<00:06:59.170> well<00:06:59.410> I<00:07:00.960> think<00:07:01.960> this<00:07:02.200> is<00:07:02.320> going

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
really really well I think this is going

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.160 
really really well I think this is going
to<00:07:02.560> be<00:07:02.650> very<00:07:03.070> good<00:07:03.280> compression<00:07:03.640> before<00:07:04.170> there

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.170 
to be very good compression before there

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.020 
to be very good compression before there
was<00:07:05.290> so<00:07:05.470> much<00:07:05.560> carbon<00:07:06.160> on<00:07:06.280> the<00:07:06.310> actual<00:07:06.670> seat

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
was so much carbon on the actual seat

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.600 
was so much carbon on the actual seat
that<00:07:07.930> when<00:07:08.650> you<00:07:08.740> look<00:07:08.890> closely<00:07:09.190> at<00:07:09.430> the

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
that when you look closely at the

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.370 
that when you look closely at the
exhaust<00:07:09.940> valve<00:07:10.240> you<00:07:10.360> could<00:07:10.510> actually<00:07:10.630> see<00:07:11.140> an

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
exhaust valve you could actually see an

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.370 
exhaust valve you could actually see an
opening<00:07:11.950> that's<00:07:12.550> how<00:07:12.700> bad<00:07:12.910> it<00:07:13.060> was<00:07:13.170> so<00:07:14.170> this

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:14.380 
opening that's how bad it was so this

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.650 
opening that's how bad it was so this
person<00:07:15.280> who<00:07:15.490> had<00:07:15.640> this<00:07:15.790> must<00:07:16.120> have<00:07:16.270> had<00:07:16.390> no

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660 
person who had this must have had no

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.380 
person who had this must have had no
compression<00:07:17.080> at<00:07:17.320> all<00:07:17.670> which<00:07:18.670> is<00:07:18.700> probably<00:07:19.150> why

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390 
compression at all which is probably why

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.170 
compression at all which is probably why
he<00:07:19.420> dismantled<00:07:20.050> it<00:07:20.140> I<00:07:20.350> mean<00:07:20.950> what<00:07:21.670> this<00:07:22.060> is

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180 
he dismantled it I mean what this is

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.820 
he dismantled it I mean what this is
what<00:07:22.330> it<00:07:22.390> was<00:07:22.450> normally<00:07:23.490> it's<00:07:24.490> about<00:07:24.580> like

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830 
what it was normally it's about like

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:31.650 
what it was normally it's about like
like<00:07:26.830> that<00:07:29.130> probably<00:07:30.130> like<00:07:30.280> that<00:07:30.520> it<00:07:31.420> was<00:07:31.540> open

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660 
like that probably like that it was open

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.960 
like that probably like that it was open
quite<00:07:32.080> a<00:07:32.140> lot<00:07:32.380> for<00:07:33.190> his<00:07:33.310> thousands<00:07:33.670> of<00:07:33.760> an<00:07:33.880> inch

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970 
quite a lot for his thousands of an inch

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.700 
quite a lot for his thousands of an inch
it<00:07:34.600> was<00:07:34.780> open<00:07:35.340> she's<00:07:36.340> not<00:07:36.490> good
