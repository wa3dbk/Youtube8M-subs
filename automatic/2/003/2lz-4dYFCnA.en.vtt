00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
crosshairs settled here for a head shot

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.370 
crosshairs settled here for a head shot
when<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> magpie<00:02:05.130> decides<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.729> fly<00:02:05.970> off<00:02:06.380> not

when the magpie decides to fly off not
allowing<00:02:07.740> me<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> pull<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> trigger<00:02:11.000> another

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
allowing me to pull the trigger another

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.710 
allowing me to pull the trigger another
short<00:02:12.300> wait

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
short wait

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.780 
short wait
and<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.050> magpie<00:02:13.500> pitches<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.040> here<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:14.430> 60

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and this magpie pitches in here at 60

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.449 
and this magpie pitches in here at 60
yards<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:16.170> settle<00:02:16.530> across<00:02:16.830> as<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> head

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
yards and I settle across as for a head

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:26.680 
yards and I settle across as for a head
shot<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.410> fell<00:02:19.650> down<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.280> goes<00:02:20.459> nicely

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.750 

and<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.780> bounces<00:02:28.170> around<00:02:28.230> there<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.980> little<00:02:29.489> bit

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
and it bounces around there a little bit

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.030 
and it bounces around there a little bit
typical<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.450> head<00:02:30.630> shot<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.620> that's<00:02:31.769> just

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
typical of a head shot but that's just

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.170 
typical of a head shot but that's just

is<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.330> good<00:02:39.600> hour<00:02:39.810> or<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.230> later<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.970> third

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
is a good hour or so later and the third

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.570 
is a good hour or so later and the third

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
magpie the day lands up here this again

magpie the day lands up here this again
is<00:02:44.760> at<00:02:44.880> 60<00:02:45.269> yards<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.319> Magpies<00:02:46.709> facing

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
is at 60 yards and as the Magpies facing

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.280 
is at 60 yards and as the Magpies facing
me<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.549> decided<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.269> go<00:02:48.390> for<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.600> heart<00:02:48.900> shot<00:02:49.110> on

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
me I decided to go for a heart shot on

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.360 
me I decided to go for a heart shot on
this<00:02:49.440> one<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:53.280> once<00:02:53.489> I'm<00:02:53.670> settled<00:02:55.370> squeeze

this one and once I'm settled squeeze

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.220 
this one and once I'm settled squeeze
the<00:02:56.519> trigger<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.090> take<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.390> perfectly<00:02:58.019> placed

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
the trigger and take a perfectly placed

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.430 
the trigger and take a perfectly placed
shot<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:59.190> down<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.239> magpie<00:03:00.600> goes

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.760 

and<00:03:06.070> again<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.940> magpie<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.450> dead<00:03:07.960> it's<00:03:08.620> just

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
and again this magpie is dead it's just

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.920 
and again this magpie is dead it's just
the<00:03:09.070> Magpies<00:03:09.490> nervous<00:03:09.940> system<00:03:10.300> shutting<00:03:10.720> down

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
the Magpies nervous system shutting down

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.030 
the Magpies nervous system shutting down
that's<00:03:11.290> making<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.770> bird<00:03:11.950> react<00:03:12.310> like<00:03:12.490> that
