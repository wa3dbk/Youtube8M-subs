00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
just running the board's from the bottom

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.650 
just running the board's from the bottom
because<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.770> definitely<00:00:58.920> holes<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> top<00:01:00.530> to

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
because I definitely holes in the top to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.500 
because I definitely holes in the top to
get<00:01:03.660> food<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.799> piece<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> bottom<00:01:09.330> here

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510

this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> full<00:01:10.350> before<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.390> cut<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
this is a full before and I cut the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.530 
this is a full before and I cut the
radius<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.710> five-gallon<00:01:14.369> bucket<00:01:14.400> back<00:01:15.390> an

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
radius of a five-gallon bucket back an

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.469 
radius of a five-gallon bucket back an
inch<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> quarter<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:17.180> 37<00:01:18.180> inches<00:01:18.270> long

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
inch and a quarter is 37 inches long

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.550 
inch and a quarter is 37 inches long
pretty<00:01:21.479> much<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> same<00:01:21.869> thing<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> bottom

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
pretty much the same thing on the bottom

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.219 
pretty much the same thing on the bottom
here<00:01:26.479> overall<00:01:27.479> hot<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:30.229> 30

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
here overall hot it's going to be 30

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.539 
here overall hot it's going to be 30
inches<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> inch<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> half<00:01:33.450> here

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
inches so I got a inch and a half here

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.260 
inches so I got a inch and a half here
three<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.790> half<00:01:36.060> three<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.960> half<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:38.270> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
three and a half three and a half and I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.870 
three and a half three and a half and I
cut<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.960> rest<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.530> too<00:01:41.659> they<00:01:42.659> look<00:01:43.880> like

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
cut the rest of this too they look like

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.359 
cut the rest of this too they look like
it<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.210> twenty-two<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.020> half<00:01:46.189> when<00:01:47.189> one

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
it was twenty-two and a half when one

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.179 
it was twenty-two and a half when one
half<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:49.320> that's<00:01:49.560> kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.799> where<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.070> at

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
half so that's kind of where I'm at

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.130 
half so that's kind of where I'm at
right<00:01:50.250> now<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.110> to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
right now and it's like it's going to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.039 
right now and it's like it's going to
eventually<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.649> some<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.899> braces<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
eventually have some little braces that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.870 
eventually have some little braces that
come<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:58.159> try<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.189> show<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.640> what

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
come out here and try to show you what

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.760 
come out here and try to show you what
will<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.420> now<00:02:01.229> what<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.469> gonna<00:02:01.590> try<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
do is attach the table to the legs all

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
do is attach the table to the legs all
right<00:02:09.569> after<00:02:09.780> quite<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> bit<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.739> work<00:02:11.690> put<00:02:12.690> two

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
right after quite a bit of work put two

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.890 
right after quite a bit of work put two
I guess<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:13.860> call<00:02:14.040> them<00:02:14.130> pocket<00:02:14.430> screws<00:02:14.900> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
I guess you call them pocket screws and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.570 
I guess you call them pocket screws and
and<00:02:17.720> they<00:02:18.720> hold<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.140> real<00:02:19.500> well<00:02:19.680> there's<00:02:20.190> four

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
and they hold it real well there's four

and they hold it real well there's four
only<00:02:21.890> next<00:02:22.890> thing<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.160> gonna<00:02:23.340> be<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.980> guess

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
only next thing is gonna be the I guess

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.440 
only next thing is gonna be the I guess
you<00:02:26.160> call<00:02:26.310> X<00:02:26.640> braces<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.420> go<00:02:27.600> right<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:29.450> all

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you call X braces that go right here all

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.580 
you call X braces that go right here all
right<00:02:30.810> after<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:33.020> trimmed<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.110> edge<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.500> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
right after I trimmed the edge of the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.760 
right after I trimmed the edge of the
table<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.190> discovered<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.360> had<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.780> that

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770

it's<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.040> leg<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.580> crooked<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.360> had<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.600> take

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
it's the leg on crooked so I had to take

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.230 
it's the leg on crooked so I had to take
it<00:02:40.020> loose<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.820> redo<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:43.820> if<00:02:44.820> you're<00:02:45.030> trying

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.490 
it loose and redo it so if you're trying
to<00:02:45.330> build<00:02:45.570> one<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.780> them<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.080> want<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.290> trim

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
to build one of them you want to trim

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.350 
to build one of them you want to trim
the<00:02:46.680> trim<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> edge<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.850> table<00:02:48.060> before
