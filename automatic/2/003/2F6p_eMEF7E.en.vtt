00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
void areas because we have some void

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.190 
void areas because we have some void
babies<00:02:45.030> coming<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:45.630> let's<00:02:45.840> go<00:02:45.959> get<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
babies coming in so let's go get a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.100 
babies coming in so let's go get a
habitat<00:02:46.709> right<00:02:47.010> right<00:02:47.910> now<00:02:48.060> let's<00:02:48.540> get<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.750> void

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
habitat right right now let's get a void

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.040 
habitat right right now let's get a void
habitat<00:02:49.709> where<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.459> there<00:02:50.760> we<00:02:51.030> go<00:02:51.540> we

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
habitat where is it there we go we

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.979 
habitat where is it there we go we
actually<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.500> have<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> lot<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.040> void<00:02:53.370> habitats

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
actually can have a lot of void habitats

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.240 
actually can have a lot of void habitats
we're<00:02:54.989> gonna<00:02:55.080> speed<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.620> up<00:02:55.650> because<00:02:56.100> you

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
we're gonna speed that up because you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.420 
we're gonna speed that up because you
really<00:02:56.489> need<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.760> space<00:02:57.060> right<00:02:57.390> now<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:58.430> okay

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
really need the space right now is okay

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.930 
really need the space right now is okay
so<00:03:00.390> we<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:01.200> have<00:03:01.410> two<00:03:01.680> dragons<00:03:02.010> if<00:03:02.489> we<00:03:02.610> speed

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
so we can have two dragons if we speed

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.360 
so we can have two dragons if we speed
it<00:03:03.030> up

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.340 

okay<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.670> there's<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.030> void<00:03:07.270> habitat<00:03:07.810> must<00:03:08.110> be

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
okay so there's a void habitat must be

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.040 
okay so there's a void habitat must be
the<00:03:08.410> bad<00:03:08.820> again<00:03:09.820> okay<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:10.450> that's<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.900> point

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
the bad again okay so that's the point

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.230 
the bad again okay so that's the point
habitat<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.130> let's<00:03:12.280> go<00:03:12.430> ahead<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:12.700> hatch<00:03:12.970> our

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
habitat so let's go ahead and hatch our

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.480 
habitat so let's go ahead and hatch our

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
that's right a hatch so the next ones

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.480 
that's right a hatch so the next ones
that<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:24.400> bred<00:04:24.730> were<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.750> energy<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.220> void

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
that I bred were the energy and the void

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.280 
that I bred were the energy and the void
so<00:04:27.850> there's<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.150> char<00:04:28.330> dragon<00:04:28.780> my<00:04:28.900> bread<00:04:29.110> these

that's kind of cool so I would like to
try<00:06:42.250> the<00:06:42.310> radiant<00:06:43.000> and<00:06:43.150> agave<00:06:43.420> I'm<00:06:44.020> hearing

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
interesting combinations there are some

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.310 
interesting combinations there are some
dragons<00:06:49.420> that<00:06:49.450> you<00:06:49.570> can<00:06:49.750> use<00:06:49.900> that<00:06:50.020> give<00:06:50.200> you

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
dragons that you can use that give you

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.740 
dragons that you can use that give you
some<00:06:50.500> interesting<00:06:50.680> combinations<00:06:51.490> I

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
some interesting combinations I

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.360 
some interesting combinations I
generally<00:06:52.750> try<00:06:52.960> to<00:06:52.990> use<00:06:53.230> my<00:06:53.410> epic<00:06:53.740> dragons<00:06:54.220> and

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
generally try to use my epic dragons and

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.240 
generally try to use my epic dragons and
have<00:06:54.520> all<00:06:54.670> these<00:06:54.820> different<00:06:56.130> elements<00:06:57.130> like

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
have all these different elements like

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.510 
have all these different elements like
three<00:06:57.520> elements<00:06:57.970> and<00:06:58.620> they're<00:06:59.620> grossly

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
three elements and they're grossly

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.710 
three elements and they're grossly
different<00:07:00.880> from<00:07:01.150> each<00:07:01.240> other<00:07:01.420> so<00:07:01.570> you<00:07:01.600> have

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
different from each other so you have

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.240 
different from each other so you have
one<00:07:01.870> with<00:07:02.020> water<00:07:02.230> energy<00:07:02.500> and<00:07:02.830> void<00:07:03.010> another

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
one with water energy and void another

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.040 
one with water energy and void another
with<00:07:03.430> fire<00:07:03.670> earth<00:07:04.030> and<00:07:04.300> wind<00:07:04.540> or<00:07:04.750> something

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
with fire earth and wind or something

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.720 
with fire earth and wind or something
like<00:07:05.140> that<00:07:05.320> and<00:07:05.680> see<00:07:06.100> what<00:07:06.220> you<00:07:06.370> come<00:07:06.520> up<00:07:06.580> with

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.730 
like that and see what you come up with

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.850 
like that and see what you come up with
because<00:07:07.150> the<00:07:07.810> vac<00:07:07.960> of<00:07:08.110> matter<00:07:08.320> is<00:07:08.500> there's<00:07:08.650> so

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860 
because the vac of matter is there's so

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.930 
because the vac of matter is there's so
many<00:07:08.980> different<00:07:09.070> combinations<00:07:09.430> that<00:07:09.760> can

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
many different combinations that can

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.070 
many different combinations that can
come<00:07:10.090> out<00:07:10.180> of<00:07:10.300> that<00:07:10.390> and<00:07:10.540> because<00:07:10.900> they're

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
come out of that and because they're

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.140 
come out of that and because they're
epic<00:07:11.320> because<00:07:11.860> both<00:07:12.190> the<00:07:12.370> parents<00:07:12.700> are<00:07:12.790> epic

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 
epic because both the parents are epic

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.140 
epic because both the parents are epic
it's<00:07:13.540> actually<00:07:13.900> easier<00:07:14.320> for<00:07:14.350> you<00:07:14.740> so<00:07:15.430> let's<00:07:15.910> go

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150 
it's actually easier for you so let's go

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.750 
it's actually easier for you so let's go
ahead<00:07:16.300> and<00:07:16.990> and<00:07:17.620> try<00:07:17.950> the<00:07:18.010> radiant<00:07:18.550> with<00:07:18.670> the

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:18.760 
ahead and and try the radiant with the

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.250 
ahead and and try the radiant with the
agave<00:07:19.030> again

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:20.260 
agave again

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.170 
agave again
I've<00:07:21.160> already<00:07:21.310> tried<00:07:21.580> the<00:07:21.760> radiate<00:07:22.000> with<00:07:22.090> the

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180 
I've already tried the radiate with the

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.330 
I've already tried the radiate with the
agave<00:07:22.360> but<00:07:22.750> I<00:07:22.780> will<00:07:23.050> go<00:07:23.170> ahead<00:07:23.290> and<00:07:23.470> try<00:07:24.100> again

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.340 
agave but I will go ahead and try again

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.560 
agave but I will go ahead and try again
it<00:07:25.330> doesn't<00:07:25.660> hurt<00:07:25.780> to<00:07:25.870> try<00:07:25.960> a<00:07:26.200> second<00:07:26.740> time<00:07:27.570> so

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.570 
it doesn't hurt to try a second time so

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.080 
it doesn't hurt to try a second time so
the<00:07:28.690> area<00:07:28.960> is<00:07:28.990> they're<00:07:29.200> both<00:07:29.350> over<00:07:30.070> level<00:07:30.850> 50

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.090 
the area is they're both over level 50

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.500 
the area is they're both over level 50
level<00:07:31.360> 15<00:07:31.600> or<00:07:31.690> over<00:07:32.020> so<00:07:32.230> let's<00:07:32.410> breed<00:07:32.650> them<00:07:32.860> and

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.510 
level 15 or over so let's breed them and

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.370
