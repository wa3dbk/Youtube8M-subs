00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.760
 this damage today first come in 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.050
 horses yes well that's fine I had to do 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.330
 several takes so it's not blinking 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.340
 good eyes here we talk more 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.340
 so that's my head at the beginning 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.500
 then a nice summer day I decided to 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.820
 to make me a tie and dye so here 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.820
 discoloration of spikes 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.020
 and it was rather successful renewing it 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.739
 from time to time we go there and for a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.270
 year and a half 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.699
 everything was going for the best in the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.610
 best of all worlds and then it has 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.399
 started coming such urine flowing 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.489
 along the sidewalk and I looked like a 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.220
 pony so hop color change 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.470
 direct chestnut coloring at normal 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.470
 and I became green 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.890
 unfortunately it was not so 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.270
 trend that the gray on the hair of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.500
 it was a bit catastrophic all 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.750
 the days I was entitled to the question 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.920
 but it's done on purpose low kind because 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.320
 that it's still eating anyway 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.700
 something is the problem is that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.920
 to get rid of the green color 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.119
 it's really not easy 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 red colors will make a 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.080
 chestnut with a touch of red aura 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.760
 cage or something like that it's me 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.320
 was drunk I'm fed up because that 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.740
 did not leave I still had color 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.900
 green 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.900
 foul but he was still jouanno 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.320
 my pau had my hair too 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.840
 long so not this glue of 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 discoloration and it ended like that 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.270
 the big panic so we went in 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.130
 buy back again I got 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.350
 redone this time 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.490
 everywhere we have bought what he 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.530
 needed but I think we had 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.240
 too much in the end but I never wanted 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.800
 to have locks like that on all sides 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.979
 blonde other brown side to it was 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.360
 horrible gold he would have unfortunately hair 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.670
 yellow everywhere but yellow I push it back 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.740
 a horrible I do not know what it was 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.740
 as color but it was disgusting 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.950
 yes because at the time no one 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.290
 talked about toners or shampoos 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.989
 blue these wonderful things that 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.459
 would have me summit said this is good in itself 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.680
 I admit it was not the most 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.140
 serious of the world it's going well and what is safe 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.319
 the stone but it's annoying anyway 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.319
 the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.850
 so in the end my hair was 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.310
 literally become size 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.200
 so the only solution was everything 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.010
 cut the only thing to do it was 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 gave red 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.200
 I ended up with red hair 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.680
 and oddly it totally changed me 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.270
 ample after with the champions it is 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.130
 become a little pink and everything and I 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.930
 loved it's going to be hostile and it was 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.800
 weird was very good but it was 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.390
 too cool conclusion i'm going to clearly 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.830
 not tell you do not bleach yourselves 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.209
 hair because I know that in these 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.530
 case when we want to do it 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.820
 is a little stubborn and we still want 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.650
 to do it one says oneself but anyway 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.380
 it will happen to me by month 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.030
 although that might be when 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.530
 even stop you now that I 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.910
 know that you have to do the toners that 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.920
 you do the blue shampoos and all 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.600
 there is no more reason to do it 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.430
 embarrassment by a release the hair 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.380
