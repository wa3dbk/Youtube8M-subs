 hello people or enjoyed the wing and drinks more 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.509
 a strong politician but he started to 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.490
 victim left a message for you 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.740
 You already know how to explain notes on the networks. 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.510
 we have a facebook account 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.550
 You can also get on twitter the 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.740
 instagram and to close we have a group 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.900
 open will see the links of our networks 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.160
 social with is in good description today 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.870
 I'm going to talk about science. 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.190
 in today's show I'm going to make one more 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.350
 test for you 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.999
 after the test key test for 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.859
 know which dominant side of your brain 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:37.789
 and test to know if you have the mind 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.320
 polluted 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.659
 Now I want to know if you are 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.949
 prone to false memories 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.620
 before explaining how this test 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.019
 It works, I'll give it to you because it's 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.449
 logical that if I explain it first 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.879
 it will not work, well then let's go 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.920
 First I'll say some rules. 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.120
 if you do not follow to the letter will in 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.159
 validate the test 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.440
 if you to use the video is already over the 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.719
 test for you and do not even show 15 words 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.329
 and you will have 15 seconds to memorize 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.369
 as many words as possible 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.590
 then the law plus 20 seconds to 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.469
 you remember more words 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.689
 Get prepared right 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.689
 so I'll put the words on the screen now 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.680
 You will now have 20 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.840
 seconds to try to remember the maximum of 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.840
 words that can start now 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.640
 well now closed thing now 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.500
 of these words you are sure that 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.800
 were among the 15 words I 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.800
 I showed 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.900
 if you answered steal you're from 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.269
 congratulations 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.090
 your good memory now if you too 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.819
 answered prison you got caught in the test 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.860
 that is, by inserting a suggestion 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.959
 a fake memory in your head 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.790
 this is because the world you see 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.409
 well it actually only exists in your 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.239
 head all around one 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.370
 interpretation of the world built in its 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.290
 mind that creates everything if in your head and 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.959
 your brain the things that the system 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.849
 sensory receive as the colors sounds and 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.440
 certain of them are notified by their 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.359
 because he did not register the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.459
 fact it is possible to suggest 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.530
 some things for him that finishes 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.280
 confusing and creating memories 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.170
 false 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.150
 the study of fake memories or memories 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.659
 illusory began with the work the beach 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.090
 in France in 1960 in the forgery of 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.250
 memories made by children the use of 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.440
 memory is in the areas of 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.489
 of testimony in the legal area and even in 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.049
 autobiographies 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.260
 a curious fact is that neurotic people 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.819
 the contrast of anxiety or depression 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.870
 tend to be more likely to create 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.060
 false memories 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.430
 summarizing once again the message of the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.380
 video is never 100% confident in what your 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.970
 eyes and ears that speak the world is a 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.709
 interpretation of what your brain does 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.480
 send the campaign to you if you 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.010
 I was not listening to music down here. 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.200
 and that's it naldo explained getting by 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.340
 here I expect you in the next video a 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.340
 Big hug and this one.
