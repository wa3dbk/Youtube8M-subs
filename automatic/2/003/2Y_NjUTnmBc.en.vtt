00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.720 
that gave her new focus tonight oh yeah
defense<00:00:52.170> as<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> whole<00:00:52.520> stopping<00:00:53.520> them<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.699> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
defense as a whole stopping them in a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.660 
defense as a whole stopping them in a
half<00:00:53.910> court<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.329> definitely<00:00:55.670> transition

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
half court and definitely transition

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
half court and definitely transition
because<00:00:56.760> left<00:00:57.059> team<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> run

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
because left team get out and run

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
because left team get out and run
against<00:00:58.770> us<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> good<00:00:59.070> point<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.370> transition<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
against us a good point of transition it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.880 
against us a good point of transition it
makes<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> harder<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.960> us<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.559> able<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
makes it harder for us to be able to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.020 
makes it harder for us to be able to
stop<00:01:02.070> them<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.280> half<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> course<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.850> don't

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
stop them in half of course so we don't

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.570 
stop them in half of course so we don't
focus<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.510> maybe<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.350> got<00:01:04.500> Jeff<00:01:04.860> Jeff

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580

gore or two guard as far as running
their<00:01:26.250> sets<00:01:26.549> were<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.380> 19<00:01:28.380> 18<00:01:28.950> seconds<00:01:29.220> I'm

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
their sets were like 19 18 seconds I'm

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
their sets were like 19 18 seconds I'm
clocks<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.729> try<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> 16<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.960> below
