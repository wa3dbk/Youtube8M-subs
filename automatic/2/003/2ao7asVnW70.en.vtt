today so in our game right now in our
horror<00:00:17.100> game<00:00:17.430> when<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.029> walk<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.869> aren't

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
horror game when you walk you aren't

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.189 
horror game when you walk you aren't
really<00:00:20.039> walking<00:00:21.029> you're<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.510> gliding

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
really walking you're like gliding

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.859 
really walking you're like gliding
across<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.769> ground<00:00:23.119> however<00:00:24.119> we're<00:00:24.689> never

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
across the ground however we're never

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.019 
across the ground however we're never
really<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.470> get<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> real<00:00:26.279> walking

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
really going to get the real walking

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.960 
really going to get the real walking
feel<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.260> real<00:00:28.650> character<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.550> if<00:00:29.820> you're

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
feel of a real character as if you're

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.450 
feel of a real character as if you're
really<00:00:30.269> walking<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.869> real<00:00:31.080> life<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:32.250> that's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
really walking in real life so that's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.639 
really walking in real life so that's
why<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.120> create<00:00:33.420> head-bobbing<00:00:34.290> so

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
why we have to create head-bobbing so

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.580 
why we have to create head-bobbing so
the<00:00:34.980> camera<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.960> moving<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.500> down

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the camera is moving up and down

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.830 
the camera is moving up and down
slightly<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.910> gives<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> feel<00:00:39.570> that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
slightly so it gives it the feel that

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.530 
slightly so it gives it the feel that
the<00:00:39.960> character<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.530> actually<00:00:40.710> walking<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the character is actually walking so the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.610 
the character is actually walking so the
first<00:00:42.780> thing<00:00:42.899> we're<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.440> create

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
first thing we're going to do is create

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.260 
first thing we're going to do is create
a<00:00:43.770> new<00:00:43.800> JavaScript<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:46.590> name<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.910> head

all up um let's go ahead and see what it
does<00:01:22.380> let's<00:01:22.680> save<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.479> minimize<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.689> down

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
does let's save it minimize this down

all right so we're gonna have to attach
this<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.960> camera<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.729> first

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
this to the camera and not the first

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.389 
this to the camera and not the first
person<00:01:30.210> controller<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> camera<00:01:31.920> itself

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
person controller but the camera itself

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.190 
person controller but the camera itself
so<00:01:33.030> go<00:01:33.149> to<00:01:33.210> your<00:01:33.299> first<00:01:33.479> person<00:01:33.869> controller

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.249 
so I've I've set these uh these things
to<00:01:44.429> what<00:01:44.579> works<00:01:44.789> with<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> default<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:46.049> me

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
to what works with the default for me

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.199 
to what works with the default for me
however<00:01:47.130> go<00:01:47.340> ahead<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.700> change<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
however go ahead and change it up to

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.139 
however go ahead and change it up to
what<00:01:48.539> you<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.459> midpoint<00:01:51.030> is

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
what you think you like the midpoint is

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.340 
what you think you like the midpoint is
something<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.509> guys<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.959> take<00:01:52.110> note<00:01:52.319> of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
something you guys got to take note of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.859 
something you guys got to take note of
the<00:01:52.619> midpoint<00:01:52.830> is<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.729> height<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.209> the<00:01:54.390> camera

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the midpoint is the height of the camera

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
the midpoint is the height of the camera
from<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.140> ground<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.459> if<00:01:56.670> you've<00:01:56.880> got<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
from the ground so if you've got a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.389 
from the ground so if you've got a
really<00:01:57.420> big<00:01:57.539> character<00:01:58.140> your<00:01:58.590> midpoint<00:01:58.830> might

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
really big character your midpoint might

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.570 
really big character your midpoint might
be<00:01:59.640> three<00:02:00.090> or<00:02:00.119> eight<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:01.080> forty-eight<00:02:01.799> but

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
be three or eight or forty-eight but

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.699 
be three or eight or forty-eight but
mine<00:02:02.789> is<00:02:02.970> one<00:02:03.209> because<00:02:03.599> my<00:02:03.780> character<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.409> one

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
mine is one because my character is one

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.059 
mine is one because my character is one
unit<00:02:05.039> tall<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:07.020> set<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> bobbing<00:02:07.799> amount

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
unit tall and I set the bobbing amount

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.820 
unit tall and I set the bobbing amount
I'm<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.729> change<00:02:09.299> this<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:12.170> one<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.680> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
I'm going to change this to one so that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.080 
I'm going to change this to one so that
you<00:02:13.950> can<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> little<00:02:14.580> bit<00:02:14.760> more<00:02:14.910> visual

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
you can have a little bit more visual

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.940 
you can have a little bit more visual
for<00:02:15.480> YouTube<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.080> when<00:02:16.799> I<00:02:16.830> hit<00:02:17.069> play<00:02:18.890> all<00:02:19.890> right

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950
