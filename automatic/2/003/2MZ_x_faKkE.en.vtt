00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
want to do is you want to click down a

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.109 
want to do is you want to click down a
couple<00:01:10.630> clicks<00:01:10.899> past<00:01:11.640> tops<00:01:12.640> where<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:12.939> hits

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
couple clicks past tops where it hits

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.569 
couple clicks past tops where it hits
you<00:01:13.360> hit<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:13.840> then<00:01:14.409> it'll<00:01:14.590> click<00:01:14.860> like<00:01:15.039> three

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
you hit and then it'll click like three

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.859 
you hit and then it'll click like three
times<00:01:15.820> maybe<00:01:16.119> so<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:16.539> might<00:01:16.689> do<00:01:16.840> that

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
times maybe so you might do that

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.270 
times maybe so you might do that
so<00:01:19.869> there's<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.229> couple<00:01:20.409> extra<00:01:20.740> clicks<00:01:21.040> there

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
so there's a couple extra clicks there

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.609 
so there's a couple extra clicks there
that's<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.640> good<00:01:21.820> thing<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.840> puts<00:01:23.409> it<00:01:23.530> a

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
that's a good thing that puts it a

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.620 
that's a good thing that puts it a
little<00:01:23.860> past<00:01:24.159> top<00:01:24.520> dead<00:01:24.729> center<00:01:25.150> so<00:01:25.360> it's<00:01:25.479> like

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
little past top dead center so it's like

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.730 
little past top dead center so it's like
ready<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.380> go<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:27.009> then<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:29.170> it's<00:01:29.320> cold<00:01:29.590> you

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
ready to go and then if it's cold you

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.170 
ready to go and then if it's cold you
might<00:01:29.860> have<00:01:29.979> to<00:01:30.100> do<00:01:30.220> this<00:01:30.340> more<00:01:30.549> times<00:01:30.790> on<00:01:31.090> the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
might have to do this more times on the

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.700 
might have to do this more times on the
mill<00:01:31.360> but<00:01:31.570> right<00:01:31.780> now<00:01:31.930> it's<00:01:32.080> pretty<00:01:32.229> warm<00:01:32.500> out

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
mill but right now it's pretty warm out

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.870 
mill but right now it's pretty warm out
that's<00:01:33.250> why<00:01:33.430> I'm<00:01:33.490> wearing<00:01:33.729> shorts<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:35.320> now<00:01:36.190> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
that's why I'm wearing shorts so now the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.310 
that's why I'm wearing shorts so now the
second<00:01:37.270> trick<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.509> you<00:01:37.750> don't<00:01:37.899> want<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.080> rest

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320
