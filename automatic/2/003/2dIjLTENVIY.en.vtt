00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.430 

so<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> thought<00:01:54.420> I'd<00:01:54.719> oh<00:01:54.930> yes<00:01:55.289> two<00:01:55.590> heads

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
so I thought I'd oh yes two heads

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.390 
so I thought I'd oh yes two heads
yeah<00:01:58.440> he<00:01:58.620> should<00:01:58.860> go<00:01:59.130> down<00:01:59.790> pretty<00:02:00.090> quickly

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400

yeah he should go down pretty quickly
yeah<00:02:02.400> again<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.270> problem<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.900> guys

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
yeah again the problem with the guys

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.530 
yeah again the problem with the guys
that<00:02:09.350> yeah<00:02:10.350> is<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.280> can't<00:02:12.060> really<00:02:12.209> hit

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that yeah is that you can't really hit

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.670 
that yeah is that you can't really hit
him<00:02:12.690> until<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.370> open<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.530> yeah<00:02:16.530> until

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:53.709 
certain amount of force metal energy

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:56.799 
certain amount of force metal energy
which<00:06:54.709> you<00:06:54.860> get<00:06:55.039> now<00:06:55.219> from<00:06:55.550> battles<00:06:55.909> and<00:06:56.599> you
