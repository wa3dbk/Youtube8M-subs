00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
just break it apart a little masking my

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.430 
just break it apart a little masking my
knife<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:47.960> break<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.079> apart<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.350> little

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
knife out here break it apart a little

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.709 
knife out here break it apart a little
bit<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> Ferro<00:00:51.989> rod<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:56.719> it's

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
bit and you get the Ferro rod out it's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.360 
bit and you get the Ferro rod out it's
one<00:00:57.899> part<00:00:58.140> problem<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.770> technique<00:00:59.100> i<00:00:59.219> have

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
one part problem the technique i have

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.939 
one part problem the technique i have
now<00:00:59.899> pull<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.960> around<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> get

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
now pull it around it's not like to get

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
would say that's a pretty successful

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:33.480 
would say that's a pretty successful
test<00:04:29.610> so<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.760> piece<00:04:30.970> did<00:04:31.180> go<00:04:31.360> out<00:04:32.190> see<00:04:33.190> if<00:04:33.220> how

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
test so this piece did go out see if how

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:55.870 
test so this piece did go out see if how
long<00:04:33.670> it<00:04:33.760> takes<00:04:33.970> for<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:35.070> light<00:04:36.070> back<00:04:36.280> up

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.570 

Oh<00:04:56.000> slit

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.390 

so<00:06:06.020> just<00:06:06.320> conclude<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.710> test<00:06:06.950> guys<00:06:07.130> we're

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
so just conclude the test guys we're
