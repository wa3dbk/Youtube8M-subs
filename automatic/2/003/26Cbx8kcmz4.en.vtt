00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.179
 What is this that we are seeing? 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:14.009
 here are the plastic packaging 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:15.960
 ground white washed and dried 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.180
 he has the other things are the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.730
 colorful same thing 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:27.119
 colorful because there is a difference or 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.199
 white I can make color profiles 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.529
 clear 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.910
 the pigment data are color profiles 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:41.000
 Darkness here, shredded material goes to 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.000
 there it enters the structure is stocked 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 automatically 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.720
 or is going to be our cattle from here 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.240
 in the machine 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.190
 and on the machine what happens the machine is 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:00.670
 mixed and this extruder and then 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.390
 it in here only when the mixture that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.180
 has formula leaves here 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.040
 eighty percent of the plastic wood is 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.770
 the high-speed platinum 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.580
 the other 20% that mix in this machine 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.440
 They are the load we follow it and 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.350
 That's what happens here. 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:26.290
 Go here and enter here and just enter 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:31.810
 Ice cold bota boot it to a 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:35.590
 it was hot compression or 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.619
 There is a jéci and jéci crime and turns way 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.750
 next and then on the road she has a 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.750
 Puller gets there. 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:52.310
 that's here here again get hot 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:56.649
 but the whole body is cold 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.829
 and passing from this tank to yours already 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:08.899
 he has a machine pulling 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:23.000
 continuously and here and here the wood 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:26.360
 general plastic surgery looks and swears that 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.840
 the wood to the hardware seems the noise 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.060
 with noise from the hardware and 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.370
 what is the advantage in this way in 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.849
 relation to conventional wood 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.599
 it can be implemented in a by 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:46.040
 wood is in color that it is not just for itself 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:48.590
 the action of end-type pests has been 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.799
 it absorbs the moisture it can be 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.160
 she may be charged she may 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:58.180
 serrated and a great advantage is this 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.220
 here to the hardware 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.549
 You do not do anything to her, this one. 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.150
 I enjoy it and do it the other way I do not lose 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:12.200
 nothing here in the real presence back there 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.230
 for the beginning of the year the return service is 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.930
 a problem is a recycled product and 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.520
 this clear 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.520

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.739
