00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
experience the eyes of a probe who's the

experience the eyes of a probe who's the
third<00:00:44.789> one<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.120> gas<00:00:46.610> hmm

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
third one on gas hmm

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.590 
third one on gas hmm
can<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.329> imagine<00:00:48.590> what<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:50.600> we're

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
can you imagine what that's like we're

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
can you imagine what that's like we're
probes<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.110> all<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.530> hold<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:52.949> sec<00:00:53.280> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
probes like all right hold on one sec I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.819 
probes like all right hold on one sec I
problem<00:00:53.969> uh<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.149> got<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> lighter<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.620> I'll<00:00:55.739> be

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
problem uh I got a lighter but I'll be

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:56.270 
problem uh I got a lighter but I'll be
right<00:00:55.949> back

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
right back

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.979
