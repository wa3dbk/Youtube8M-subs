00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 the first part of the control the people 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.830
 with the darkest base in the region that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.320
 we want to get around and leave our faces 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.679
 thinner 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.199
 then put a droplet with the brush 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:24.869
 making light patches around the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:28.160
 apple one more droplet and then I do not need 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.160
 spread for now 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:43.510
 Then we'll get the end of the eyebrow 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.510
 with the brush and do the lateral of the nose 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.210
 in rare archa 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:01.860
 in the root of the hair with a base of a tone 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.190
 much more clearly than in the skin we go 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.190
 make the center points 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.060
 throughout the region of dark circles 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.520
 early button 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.860
 Here I used a base to check the y 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.840
 that it has a brightness effect and 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.640
 gives a more natural finish 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.890
 there is no danger of getting that mass 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.140
 running there are some bases some 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.890
 markers prefers to use that 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.810
 creole 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.940
 But that one works a lot for her. 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.040
 photo on a daily basis she gets a little 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.140
 then this problem has a 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.650
 finishing a medium coverage and a 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.690
 natural finish and bright reminds 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.700
 centers and lighter ends 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.729
 darker contours with a sponge 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.350
 blender we will spread this basis 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.930
 to give a natural effect 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:10.209
 so we'll start from the center to 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:12.820
 beating and spreading 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.260
 you will see that the risk and marking of the 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.700
 Contour goes away 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.700
 but the shadow is getting 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.780
 who to draw 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.469
 I know that you have 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.110
 and then the cool thing is that afterwards he already has 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.390
 two natural effect 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.070
 those dogs that do not like to seem 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.350
 what is makeup 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.610
 this is a great technique and this basis 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.610
 also a perfect finish 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.870
 and the interesting thing is that I have not yet 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.540
 I know concealer because without the collective by 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.700
 last are the makeup gets heavy with 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.140
 this contour effect and the skin 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.060
 illuminated 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.110
 the collective it will be used only to give 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.659
 a finish 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.159
 but on a daily basis he already looks beautiful and 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:13.799
 natural and counted nothing of this health 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.750
 as if you had applied a blush and 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.609
 pay attention to the nose as it stays 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.220
 more contoured because the skin prepared 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.709
 with the base that I 'm going to make choose one 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.200
 cultivation tone in the case chose the x 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.389
 made it a collective of the psychologist he 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.940
 goes for all skin tone and for 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.799
 any kind of fix it helps 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.659
 brighten the dark circles of 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.730
 adapt with skin tone 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.530
 I do not put a routine in the brush 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.159
 collective 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.900
 Look up and beating people. 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:48.239
 will leave this region more 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.829
 you realize that when you put 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.200
 it turns yellowish 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:57.169
 There you go, spreading it. 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.169
 shape and the desired skin tone 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.230
 look at the difference from one side to the other 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.849
 the midfielder dominates and brings a sense of 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.530
 rest always with a beat 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.030
 analyzing why this is a region that 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.709
 sometimes people have links 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.519
 So we do not want to score and do not want to. 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.590
 leaving is that sweaty collective 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.539
 perspiring what happens then this 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.729
 Mark I really liked what I feel 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.949
 a collective that lasts and has no danger of 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.509
 not dry or very dry 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.509
 obeying perspiring 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.370
 the heat 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.110
 it is noticed that there is a luminosity of 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.870
 Natural makeup is not only the makeup 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.370
 girls for what day-to-day college 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.080
 work and everything else 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.900
 at night you may be using the same 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.030
 with corrective instead of you 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.050
 use a dark base tone with 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.550
 clear base 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.250
 You can use a little concealer. 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.490
 more consistent dark and light to give 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.949
 a more uniform finish and stay 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.199
 more with makeup glamor face 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.380
 but in the day to day I prefer it so stays 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.090
 a light makeup a beautiful skin 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.570
 luminous as if she had woken up food 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.570
 did not sleep 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.850
 the House
