make a pass at the end of the game that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.130 
make a pass at the end of the game that
maybe<00:01:27.290> I<00:01:27.440> should<00:01:27.710> have<00:01:27.830> shot<00:01:28.009> we<00:01:28.700> lost<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:29.990> then

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
maybe I should have shot we lost so then

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.930 
maybe I should have shot we lost so then
I<00:01:30.259> come<00:01:30.470> back<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.770> next<00:01:30.800> game<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.670> I<00:01:31.759> go

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
I come back the next game and I go

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.960 
I come back the next game and I go
straight<00:01:32.000> ball<00:01:32.720> hog<00:01:33.020> mode<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.830> we<00:01:34.340> lose<00:01:34.520> again

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
straight ball hog mode and we lose again

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.050 
straight ball hog mode and we lose again

so I gotta find the perfect mix of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.150 
so I gotta find the perfect mix of
knowing<00:01:38.360> when<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.630> shoot<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.560> win<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.920> past
