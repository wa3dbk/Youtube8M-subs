00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.710
 hi to all and maihedine gaming and we 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.039
 is today for a small 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.289
 glitch and on gt5 since it is in 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.000
 to win 200 thousand dollars with 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.320
 a race then to the floor so that's 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.820
 the kursk era star game 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.470
 so it's available in the list of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.380
 activities so she is available 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.119
 since rank 18 so launch of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.949
 assignment so to do this is very 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.200
 simple when you press confirmed 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.100
 sail continued the puts ten thousand euros 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.790
 on his head 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.129
 so at 2000 euros so you see your 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.410
 total cost 12:30 the euro option but 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.879
 also ten thousand euros on the head of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.440
 someone else everyone will have 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.180
 chosen otherwise it does not work so 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.800
 we put all 10,000 euros on his head to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.219
 him for example and we can start to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.219
 to play 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.299
 so once 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.950
 that's so we end up on the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.320
 race and the goal is very simple 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.450
 because it's about smashing the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.369
 mouth on the rock and then you go 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.030
 see the money that will appear in 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.450
 top right 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.080
 once the reappearance actually 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.080
 look 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.740
 So here we could see the money 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:52.490
 two hundred thousand appear so it takes 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:55.190
 deduce them so read them the bets and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.120
 so everyone dr should be smashed 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.860
 against the rock 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.270
 and then once everyone has 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.270
 finished it we can run the race 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.000
 so that's the end of everyone 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.650
 smashed so we can start the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.240
 race there is more problem so this is 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.490
 the same system as the race 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.070
 doc and roll available on another 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.920
 race but hey it only wins 5000 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.240
 euros went so excellent 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.760
 won just under 1 100 000 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.760
 it's not bad we're fast to millions 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.470
 so I have this the end of the race 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.030
 until then these short anyway but 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.580
 that you will see that we have won 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.880
 a little near 180 8 min sik and no 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.880
 victims 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.430
 so we will see winner and then 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.980
 look look at the case of paris she 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.460
 180000 euros so to win on this 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.020
 race 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.910
 look at it pretty much the same for everything 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.720
 the world except other bombs nothing that 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.760

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.810
