00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.400
 east of the coast of mexico to 

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:06.170
 the beginning of the 70s became a 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.480
 discovery that contradicted a 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.080
 concept held for a long time 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.690
 about the behavior of sharks 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.000
 a diver was exploring some 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.000
 underwater caves in search of a prey 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.250
 and found sharks 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.720
 They seemed healthy but they were lethargic 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.739
 showed little inclination to attack a 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.390
 report on his amazing 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:39.070
 behavior reach a project 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.739
 we scientists thought that that 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.260
 variety of shark swam without stopping that 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.910
 I had to do it to survive but 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.520
 Here we find this interesting 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.220
 phenomenon of a species if the shark 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.960
 aerodynamic has adapted to enter 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.809
 a cave and stay motionless during 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.330
 some time maybe for several hours 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.019
 according to valve one of the divers 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.890
 that entered the cave the question is 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.890
 what goes in there 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.600
 looking first for verification and 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.930
 after the explanation of the call 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.940
 Sleeping shark and new and clear headed 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.940
 a series of expeditions to Mexico 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.520
 the first attempts are marked by 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.159
 Skepticism and tension 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.159
 if the sharks are in the cave it will be 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.710
 a big surprise and if you get to see them 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.020
 nobody can be sure of how 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.070
 will behave when located in the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.070
 corners of the cave 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.200
 it is true and also enigmatic these 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.960
 sharks belong to species 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.550
 considered as perpetual washers and 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.550
 they are dangerous for man 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.140
 the fish remnants found with 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.480
 often in the company of sharks 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.069
 they clean most sharks 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.069
 sleepers 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.290
 the parasites are removed from the body by 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.780
 first time the domestic work of the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.700
 remoras for your host can be 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.790
 observed and filmed in their habitat 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.790
 natural 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.900
 the divers acquire such 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.349
 trust in sleeping sharks 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.450
 that even dare to touch them this 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.650
 would be considered crazy in 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.650
 other circumstances 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.440
 the heart is paralyzed when a shark 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.640
 tiger is surprised and has to choose 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.640
 between attack or flight 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.080
 and jim clark discovered that here the water 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.900
 of the sea is mixed with fresh water that 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.090
 flows from the background 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.370
 this can cause parasites that 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.410
 harass the sharks decline and 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.540
 allow hinds to work better 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.400
 the state of lethargy can be 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.890
 consequence of the high content in 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.930
 oxygen from these waters making it 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.110
 easier for sharks to breathe 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.780
 without swimming it can also produce a 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.420
 narcotic effect enjoyed by the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.890
 fish the shark phenomenon 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.650
 sleepers remains a mystery 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.530
 fascinating is likely that many 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.170
 sharks behave like this and doing in 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.620
 Huge marine bedrooms still down 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.620
 discover
