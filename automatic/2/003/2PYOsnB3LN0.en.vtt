machine ever built is finally going to
turn<00:00:33.240> on<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:34.110> take<00:00:34.260> two<00:00:34.440> things<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
turn on you take two things and you

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.190 
turn on you take two things and you
smash<00:00:35.700> them<00:00:35.790> together<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.900> a<00:00:36.960> lot<00:00:37.170> of

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
smash them together you get a lot of

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.990 
smash them together you get a lot of
stuff<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.070> collision<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.730> try

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
stuff out of that collision and you try

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
stuff out of that collision and you try
to<00:00:39.050> understand<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.350> stuff<00:00:40.620> could<00:00:41.190> be

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
to understand that stuff could be

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.460 
to understand that stuff could be
nothing<00:00:41.580> other<00:00:42.090> than<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.470> understanding

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
nothing other than just understanding

nothing other than just understanding
everything<00:00:45.230> little<00:00:46.230> did<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.650> and<00:00:47.160> I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
everything little did I know and I

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.220 
everything little did I know and I
started<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.240> experiments<00:00:48.900> would<00:00:49.020> take

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
started that the experiments would take

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.130 
started that the experiments would take
30<00:00:49.560> years<00:00:49.740> and<00:00:50.220> Here<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> am<00:00:50.760> still<00:00:51.480> not<00:00:51.840> knowing

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
30 years and Here I am still not knowing

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.060 
30 years and Here I am still not knowing
I<00:00:52.530> really<00:00:52.950> want<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.580> truth<00:00:55.070> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
I really want to know the truth the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.470 
I really want to know the truth the
first<00:00:56.280> time<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.460> ever<00:00:56.550> saw<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.790> I<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.300> remember

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
first time I ever saw it I can remember
