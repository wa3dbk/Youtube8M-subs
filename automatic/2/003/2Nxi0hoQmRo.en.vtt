just came from behind the net and he

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.039

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
stuck his leg oh and tripped me so I

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.339 
stuck his leg oh and tripped me so I
would<00:00:17.010> talk<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.610> him<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.060> he<00:00:18.509> asked<00:00:19.080> me<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.230> go

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
would talk to him and he asked me to go

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:52.680 
would talk to him and he asked me to go
he<00:00:19.650> squared<00:00:20.609> off

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.300 

I<00:00:52.720> think<00:00:53.560> it<00:00:53.650> was<00:00:53.740> seven<00:00:54.040> -<00:00:54.190> he's<00:00:56.220> after<00:00:57.220> you

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
I think it was seven - he's after you

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.190 
I think it was seven - he's after you
fought<00:00:57.490> with<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.760> goalie<00:00:57.970> he<00:00:58.630> was<00:00:58.780> replaced

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
fought with the goalie he was replaced

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.310 
fought with the goalie he was replaced
by<00:00:59.500> our<00:00:59.950> very<00:01:00.250> own<00:01:00.370> only<00:01:00.880> pick<00:01:01.240> oh<00:01:01.420> he<00:01:01.990> came<00:01:02.170> in

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
by our very own only pick oh he came in

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.290 
by our very own only pick oh he came in
and<00:01:02.410> played<00:01:02.560> really<00:01:02.770> well<00:01:02.860> there<00:01:03.310> I<00:01:03.850> think

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
and played really well there I think

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.120 
and played really well there I think
they're<00:01:04.420> backups<00:01:04.809> hurt<00:01:05.320> or<00:01:05.590> sick<00:01:05.920> or

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130
