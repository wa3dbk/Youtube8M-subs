00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.700
 among you it has 7 inches and is the main competitor of ipv very hard 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.099

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:36.790
 flash and reader 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.700
 this part is all done in a white plastic that looks very resistant 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.120
 but in my opinion they should have made silver metal 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.249
 give more security 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.540
 Driving us to the left. 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.440

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.549

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.960
 bit the 'performance' 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.580
 flex and 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.640
 As it is a battery eater it is always good to have 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.520
 their last update 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.270
 since with the improvement of performance and the processor works - it consumes less 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.139
 drums 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.240
 leaving more time to play with us 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.300

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.970
 Now I'm going to show you here the galaxy s just for you guys to have 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.529
 an idea of ​​the size 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:08.270
 cala tcs is 4 inches if I wanted to try to demonstrate that unlike the 

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:11.389
 things but I think I saw that it did not work very well 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.549
 we do not need you lactase s then dacca 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.360
 now let's discuss it directly 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.409
 the job and income show you a little 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.400
 from the game to those who do not know 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.590
 and also shows the unique volume at the affected site 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.830
 you can see that it is not a very good powerful property for when 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.240
 we do not have the bluetooth headset with music 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.590
 Yes, here too, when you give a demonstration, it was quick. 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.590
 details just so you have an idea of ​​what it's like to drive 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.699
 he meant he stays 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.330
 they are great and of course it's nothing like the 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.620
 gala sanctioned it is se but it is very good anyway 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.330
 giving one last glimpse now at his gyro that makes the transition 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:02.969
 of the screen 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.610
 you can hold screen to any side and the transition will be made 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.279
 very fast as you can see 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:14.499
 then this is it folks are in the hand 4 8 the samsung galaxy tab of 7 inches
