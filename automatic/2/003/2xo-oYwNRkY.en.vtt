zombies and how we as a community have
influenced<00:00:38.910> its<00:00:39.120> development<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.960> how<00:00:40.170> its

basically<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.739> saw<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.160> screenshot

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
basically and we saw this screenshot

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.090 
basically and we saw this screenshot
here<00:00:44.789> which<00:00:45.539> showed<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.050> chalk<00:00:46.350> drawing<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
here which showed a chalk drawing on the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.910 
here which showed a chalk drawing on the
wall<00:00:47.489> outlining<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.450> gun<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.960> an<00:00:49.079> area<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.680> map

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
wall outlining a gun in an area of a map

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.920 
wall outlining a gun in an area of a map
that<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.309> didn't<00:00:50.730> recognize<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:51.629> still

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that we didn't recognize and we still

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.380 
that we didn't recognize and we still
don't<00:00:52.110> recognize<00:00:52.320> where<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.280> still<00:00:53.820> we

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
don't recognize where this is still we

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.840 
don't recognize where this is still we
can<00:00:54.570> guess<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.350> perhaps<00:00:55.770> might<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.550> set

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
can guess that it perhaps might be set

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.500 
can guess that it perhaps might be set
in<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.660> previous<00:00:58.530> time<00:00:59.070> period<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.789> what<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
in a previous time period to what the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.150 
in a previous time period to what the
black<00:01:00.660> ops<00:01:00.809> 2<00:01:01.020> zombies<00:01:01.050> tour<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
future this could be going back in the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.329 
future this could be going back in the
past<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.320> had<00:01:04.409> no<00:01:04.589> idea<00:01:04.920> what<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.280> war

this<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> futuristic<00:01:57.149> weapon<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.380> may

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
this is a futuristic weapon so that may

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
this is a futuristic weapon so that may
have<00:01:59.369> an<00:01:59.490> influence<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.570> time<00:02:00.810> period

have an influence on the time period

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.020 
have an influence on the time period
that<00:02:01.320> we're<00:02:01.530> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.850> map

that<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.689> could<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.500> some<00:02:04.740> sort<00:02:04.950> of

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that this is on could be some sort of

that this is on could be some sort of
futuristic<00:02:05.640> map<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.570> does<00:02:06.960> make<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> lot<00:02:07.409> of

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
futuristic map it does make a lot of

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.680 
futuristic map it does make a lot of
sense<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.099> think<00:02:08.129> about<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.479> you

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
sense when you think about it but if you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.809 
sense when you think about it but if you
think<00:02:09.959> back<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.830> black<00:02:11.009> ops<00:02:11.190> 1<00:02:11.280> zombies

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
think back in like black ops 1 zombies

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.730 
think back in like black ops 1 zombies
or<00:02:11.970> black<00:02:12.120> ops<00:02:12.330> 2<00:02:12.540> zombies<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:13.470> go

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
or black ops 2 zombies we go

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.940 
or black ops 2 zombies we go
Alice<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.190> when<00:02:14.730> OH<00:02:15.030> exactly<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:16.320> time<00:02:16.560> frame

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
Alice of when OH exactly the time frame

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.400 
Alice of when OH exactly the time frame
of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.460> maps<00:02:17.730> they<00:02:18.360> still<00:02:18.690> had<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.050> exact

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
of the maps they still had the exact

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.560 
of the maps they still had the exact
same<00:02:19.440> war<00:02:19.950> weapons<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.640> them<00:02:20.820> throughout<00:02:21.210> all

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
same war weapons on them throughout all

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.780 
same war weapons on them throughout all
of<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.870> maps<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.920> me<00:02:23.070> it<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:23.280> feels<00:02:23.640> like

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
of the maps but to me it just feels like

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.540 
of the maps but to me it just feels like
because<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> futuristic<00:02:25.500> weapon<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.100> may

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
because it is a futuristic weapon it may

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.460 
because it is a futuristic weapon it may
have<00:02:26.730> an<00:02:26.910> influence<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.720> could<00:02:27.990> be<00:02:28.230> in

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
have an influence that it could be in

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.160 
have an influence that it could be in
the<00:02:28.590> future<00:02:28.770> but<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.670> being<00:02:29.700> said<00:02:30.030> from<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
the future but that being said from the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.100 
the future but that being said from the
very<00:02:31.470> very<00:02:32.010> small<00:02:32.850> snippet<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.510> zombies<00:02:33.930> that

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
very very small snippet of zombies that

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.260 
very very small snippet of zombies that
we<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.500> seen<00:02:34.800> which<00:02:35.070> wasn't<00:02:35.340> even<00:02:35.640> gameplay

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
we have seen which wasn't even gameplay

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.780 
we have seen which wasn't even gameplay
itself<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:37.200> me<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.470> suggests<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.160> map

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
itself to me it suggests that that map

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.090 
itself to me it suggests that that map
is<00:02:39.000> going<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.300> be<00:02:39.420> set<00:02:39.750> further<00:02:40.590> back<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.070> time

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
is going to be set further back in time

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.220 
is going to be set further back in time
than<00:02:41.580> we<00:02:41.700> are<00:02:41.850> currently<00:02:42.180> which<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.810> very<00:02:43.050> very

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
than we are currently which is very very

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.800 
than we are currently which is very very
exciting<00:02:43.800> i<00:02:43.920> love<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.300> old-school

of<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.690> time<00:02:49.020> frame<00:02:49.350> but<00:02:49.950> futuristic

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
of that time frame but futuristic

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.640 
of that time frame but futuristic
zombies<00:02:50.940> would<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.270> definitely<00:02:51.450> cool<00:02:52.020> too<00:02:52.260> it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
zombies would be definitely cool too it

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.170 
zombies would be definitely cool too it
was<00:02:52.860> something<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.250> will<00:02:53.550> have<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.970> get<00:02:54.120> used

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
was something that will have to get used

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.210 
was something that will have to get used
to<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.200> don't<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:55.650> truck<00:02:55.980> you're<00:02:56.130> gonna

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
to but I don't think truck you're gonna

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.850 
to but I don't think truck you're gonna
go<00:02:56.490> down<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.970> route<00:02:57.240> just<00:02:57.630> yet<00:02:58.050> maybe<00:02:58.650> they

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
go down that route just yet maybe they

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.220 
go down that route just yet maybe they
will<00:02:59.070> I'm<00:02:59.430> not<00:02:59.670> too<00:02:59.850> sure<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.750> me<00:03:00.900> anyway

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
will I'm not too sure but to me anyway

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.420 
will I'm not too sure but to me anyway
that<00:03:01.470> looked<00:03:01.800> like<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.520> kind<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.380> 1960s

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
that looked like a kind of like 1960s

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.580 
that looked like a kind of like 1960s
1950s<00:03:05.430> kind<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.670> like<00:03:05.790> World<00:03:06.060> War<00:03:06.180> two<00:03:06.570> ask<00:03:07.050> now

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
1950s kind of like World War two ask now

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.290 
1950s kind of like World War two ask now
I<00:03:07.620> say<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.130> because<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.610> hat<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
I say that because of the hat that the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.940 
I say that because of the hat that the
zombies<00:03:09.660> wearing<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.110> falls<00:03:10.380> off<00:03:10.560> his<00:03:10.590> head

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
zombies wearing that falls off his head

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.980 
zombies wearing that falls off his head
but<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.910> mean<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.270> could<00:03:12.390> go<00:03:12.600> ahead<00:03:12.810> down

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
but it I mean it could go ahead down

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.230 
but it I mean it could go ahead down
anywhere<00:03:13.620> but<00:03:13.950> maybe<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.640> could<00:03:14.730> expect<00:03:15.060> to

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
anywhere but maybe you could expect to

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.540 
anywhere but maybe you could expect to
see<00:03:15.420> more<00:03:15.690> futuristic<00:03:16.350> weapons<00:03:16.920> on<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.340> walls

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
see more futuristic weapons on the walls

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.780 
see more futuristic weapons on the walls
as<00:03:17.790> well<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.750> by<00:03:19.350> seeing<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:20.310> gun<00:03:20.580> on<00:03:20.700> the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
as well so by seeing that gun on the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.670 
as well so by seeing that gun on the
wall<00:03:20.970> I'm<00:03:21.180> assuming<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.960> weapons<00:03:22.590> that

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
wall I'm assuming that the weapons that

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.230 
wall I'm assuming that the weapons that
we're<00:03:22.830> gonna<00:03:22.920> get<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.280> mystery<00:03:23.580> box<00:03:23.760> are<00:03:24.000> also

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
going to be quite futuristic which is

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.580 
going to be quite futuristic which is
going<00:03:26.460> to<00:03:26.520> be<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:27.150> could<00:03:27.390> be<00:03:27.540> cool<00:03:27.750> but<00:03:28.230> again

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590
