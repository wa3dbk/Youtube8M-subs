00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.549
 I and today we will do a review on 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.549
 lego star wars 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:15.910
 article 779 29 title 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.430
 battle for foot so he and age from 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.890
 7 to 12 years old 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.000
 above we see no article god 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.890
 excuse me 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.990
 the name of lego star wars 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.500
 also on the right we see 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.760
 captain rex 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:38.079
 and the action itself stagger the set itself 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.809
 and let's collect it and because the figures in 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.609
 set here we have new like 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.329
 ja ja binks and kukans 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:48.359
 but new for 2012 since this set 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.539
 produced in 2013 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:56.469
 Now 13 if I have salt from life well 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.929
 of course no, take your lips on the plan 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.440
 bingo add up two pilot droids 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.949
 and 8 battle droids i.e. it can't 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.220
 not happy 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.049
 such addition to the set for her with us 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.250
 children my videos are all bad what is that worth 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.259
 this is a bet bet that is here 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.610
 run away because it sees 10 droids 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.250
 some kind of tin 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.369
 and here I do not understand why here 4 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.680
 Jar Jar Binks I do not understand here 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.560
 look yourself some kind of 4 fried 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.570
 favorite probably from they showed how 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.530
 he looks with different questions that is 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.630
 before a little god god for 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.380
 here are the rest of 2012 set 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.170
 article and again titles and x also 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.149
 advertising year in the left. 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.770
 and now let's look at everyone 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.009
 minifigures that are present in this 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.810
 I also take this pilot and 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.429
 this droid since they weren't 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.710
 set here set oh well all the same 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.249
 let's start and 1 minifigure in this 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.429
 the set will be ja binx 

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:05.649
 very good foot on it seals 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:08.759
 You see, there are no things on the floor but 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.950
 still very cool done chapter 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.000
 here, too, such mini print and back on 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.400
 ears too and let's see from behind 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.530
 print on 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.680
 I mean and yes here and here with us 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.810
 jar-jar binks from the first episode next 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.150
 us gungans 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.140
 sorry please have made 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.420
 triple somersault forward and this in 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.609
 minifigur will be the end of the gungan soldiers 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.239
 there is such a very beautiful transparent 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:45.359
 shield as it were like a plasma film they with 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.849
 they ran there and crashed the droids very 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.760
 Zdorovskaya work done that is it is not 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.220
 the sticker is a seal too and here it is 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.099
 there is such 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:01.260
 the staff as if with an electric plasma 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:03.299
 like a spear but usually in the movie he 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.840
 just ran with this thing and and 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:11.959
 fired plasma nuclei up also here 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.579
 him on the torso and on the head a little 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.209
 slightly different from jar jar binks 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.389
 here it is 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.349
 Ja-ja Binks and he seems to have such 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:26.010
 Muscovite and back in the same same 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:30.560
 print on the ears and behind is also such 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.169
 as a strap, let's move the droid 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.109
 we have 10 droids here 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:40.319
 two pilots I'll show you just one 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.780
 two droids is a pilot and one 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.680
 usual android and since they are absolutely 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.329
 are identical 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.250
 Here we have a very pretty pilot all 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.010
 very cool printed 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.459
 and now let's look at the usual 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.069
 android 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.519
 they can as you know take shape 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.879
 such here the cheek line boxes don't know how 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.099
 it's called droid 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.139
 probably everyone has known him for a long time 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.909
 Nothing special about it I do not like 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:17.579
 a little chicken and here they sit 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:20.639
 they are waiting for instructions concert in concert 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.099
 boot or the rest of the separatists well 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.960
 let's look at the set with the set 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:30.850
 presents autumn as a small hand 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.520
 m t m t m t and I said mnt 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.020
 This is the largest droid carrier 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.470
 so huge if you know there 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.680
 was placed in this set was droid 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.590
 so 20 in my opinion somewhere 22 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.750
 Well, there is action as less than the moment 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.349
 I don't know why the battle is called 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.930
 on nabu 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:55.150
 because the nabu battle was massive 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:58.810
 and there were a lot of these small tanks. 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.770
 Well, I do not know in general, here is a front view 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.050
 same 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.580
 also there are lights like that I donâ€™t know 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:11.979
 what is it to light the way further we have left 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:16.620
 side of me before even on country design 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:20.380
 very beautiful and behind and behind us 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.740
 she herself is such a platform where everyone sits 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.500
 droid though probably strangely said 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.990
 Sit droids just have no hard so here 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.639
 and there is a bass next to each droid 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:36.729
 that can not but rejoice and so yes we 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.580
 continue here we have such here 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.940
 as the details of the atlas sword actually 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.740
 is not 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.639
 details of the laser sword simpletons 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.009
 sticks and so on the shoulder what and what is he 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.550
 does firstly here this back 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:55.990
 platforochka not unfastened removed 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:59.530
 and there are such small clips right now 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.240
 you just need to send yes that's a minus 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.699
 recruitment that they are detached 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.479
 but no matter how you see this clip 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:09.300
 small either it's a clip or it's some 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.330
 The part that connects to this and 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.340
 just you take 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:19.860
 something to me today everything is falling apart 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:23.669
 and thats just another shoulder that 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.099
 such a board is removed here a mold from here 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:28.139
 to make it easier to get droids from below 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.550
 but I don't know why they did it from above 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.740
 because from the top it is easier 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.310
 before your droids than just shoot them 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:38.849
 so simple set understands and not convenient 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:41.610
 then fold it here we will see 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:44.460
 such as a hollow space because 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:50.069
 that fall baby water or another Jedi 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.759
 although it is unlikely to happen further we see 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:53.219
 here 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:55.800
 controllers such levers which 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:57.930
 govern the droid although the countries did the league 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.169
 designers that these levers even him in 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.830
 hands don't fit yes that's strange leverage 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.190
 separately 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.870
 hands-draw is separate here too 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.449
 there is such a small hole where 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.460
 can I add three more droids to me 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:14.969
 fit another pilot and another 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:17.159
 usually take behind with butter as i already 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:19.349
 said these droids who are there two loungers 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:23.340
 I do not enter the set, I just put it 

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:25.289
 so I don't know that all the droids were in 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.949
 one together because when the droid 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:33.319
 in different places lying around it well, not very 

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:38.490
 good food and dan think on this all and 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:40.259
 by review on a set of 7 929 battles on a set 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.750
 although it seems to me that the name is a bit 

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:45.990
 strange because they could call 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.560
 differently write the name of this one 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.529
 the most 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.270
 transportation carriage tank could 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:53.639
 make some name come up a 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:57.020
 so the battle of naba is just weird somehow 

00:07:53.639 --> 00:08:00.659
 one such machine and 2 

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:04.090
 Gungan and this when the battle does not seem 

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:05.770
 just some kind of joint well, in general, that is 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.720
 my review do not forget to put the likes 

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:11.169
 and subscribe to my channel and was with you 

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:13.600
 Dameoz Pace and year are given droids 

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:15.780
 all these guys here and good luck everyone 

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.780
 until
