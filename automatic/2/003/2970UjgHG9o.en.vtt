00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.730 
Ronaldo I don't think in the history of
fief<00:01:38.579> altima<00:01:39.090> team<00:01:39.299> has<00:01:39.810> taken<00:01:40.290> him<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.680> long

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
fief altima team has taken him this long

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.580 
fief altima team has taken him this long
to<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.729> form<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.270> can't<00:01:42.899> remember<00:01:43.350> any<00:01:43.500> time

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to get in form I can't remember any time

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.230 
to get in form I can't remember any time
I<00:01:43.799> played<00:01:44.130> ultimate<00:01:44.549> team<00:01:44.700> where<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.970> took<00:01:45.119> him

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
I played ultimate team where it took him

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.810 
I played ultimate team where it took him
this<00:01:45.270> long<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:46.200> get<00:01:46.320> an<00:01:46.409> actual<00:01:46.619> inform<00:01:47.310> so

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
this long to get an actual inform so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.730 
this long to get an actual inform so
maybe<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> these<00:01:49.200> weakest

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
maybe this is one of these weakest

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.069 
maybe this is one of these weakest
seasons<00:01:50.280> even<00:01:50.700> though<00:01:51.030> obviously<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.810> it

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
seasons even though obviously it it

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.139 
seasons even though obviously it it
really<00:01:52.439> ain't<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:53.220> he<00:01:53.369> has<00:01:53.520> been<00:01:53.729> scoring

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149

goals in the hat trick is a penalty I'm

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.890 
goals in the hat trick is a penalty I'm
not<00:02:23.400> sure<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:23.820> gonna<00:02:24.090> be<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.510> hundred

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
not sure if it's gonna be a hundred

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.810 
not sure if it's gonna be a hundred
percent<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.920> he<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.130> going<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.460> impacts

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
percent that he is going to be impacts

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.180 
percent that he is going to be impacts
this<00:02:27.060> week<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.990> I'm<00:02:28.110> hoping<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.620> he<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:28.920> and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
this week but I'm hoping that he is and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.300 
this week but I'm hoping that he is and
another<00:02:29.910> thing<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.480> Sergio<00:02:31.290> Ramos<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:32.070> going

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
another thing is Sergio Ramos is going

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.280 
another thing is Sergio Ramos is going
to<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.490> impacts<00:02:32.940> hopefully<00:02:33.450> because<00:02:33.720> he<00:02:33.840> has<00:02:34.020> I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
to be impacts hopefully because he has I

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.260 
to be impacts hopefully because he has I
think<00:02:34.800> he<00:02:35.130> got<00:02:35.310> man<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.790> match<00:02:35.970> and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
think he got man of the match and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.200 
think he got man of the match and
assists<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.440> even<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.040> goal<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.520> think<00:02:38.790> I'm<00:02:38.970> not

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
assists and even a goal I think I'm not

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.990 
assists and even a goal I think I'm not
entirely<00:02:39.690> sure<00:02:39.960> that's<00:02:40.320> exactly<00:02:40.590> how<00:02:41.000> he

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
entirely sure that's exactly how he

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.060 
entirely sure that's exactly how he
performed<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.960> correct<00:02:43.320> me<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.590> I'm<00:02:43.740> wrong<00:02:43.770> in

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
performed to correct me if I'm wrong in

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.410 
performed to correct me if I'm wrong in
the<00:02:44.160> comments<00:02:44.490> section<00:02:44.520> below<00:02:44.820> but<00:02:45.120> that's

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the comments section below but that's

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.380 
the comments section below but that's
why<00:02:45.660> I'm<00:02:45.780> assuming<00:02:46.290> he<00:02:46.440> did<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:47.490> think<00:02:48.210> that's

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
why I'm assuming he did I think that's

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.000 
why I'm assuming he did I think that's
why<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.600> read<00:02:48.840> somewhere<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.440> he's<00:02:49.770> got<00:02:49.980> a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
why I read somewhere that he's got a

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.590 
why I read somewhere that he's got a
goal<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.460> assist<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.030> man<00:02:51.210> of<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> match

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600
