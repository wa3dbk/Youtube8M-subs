00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.080 
practice a lot but they don't play
enough<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.039> they<00:04:20.130> don't<00:04:20.160> know<00:04:20.430> what<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.880> do

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
enough so they don't know what to do

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.670 
enough so they don't know what to do
even<00:04:21.450> though

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
even though

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.350 
even though
have<00:04:21.799> skills<00:04:22.160> then<00:04:22.729> you<00:04:22.820> got<00:04:22.970> players<00:04:23.180> who
