00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.830 
when it does you're like ready for it
and<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:55.069> builds<00:03:55.549> up<00:03:55.700> just<00:03:56.090> right<00:03:56.329> and<00:03:56.629> then<00:03:56.750> he

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
and it builds up just right and then he

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.099 
and it builds up just right and then he
just<00:03:57.019> like<00:03:57.340> explodes<00:03:58.389> onto<00:03:59.389> the<00:03:59.660> scene<00:03:59.930> with

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
just like explodes onto the scene with

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.190 
just like explodes onto the scene with
like<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.579> legendary<00:04:01.579> tear<00:04:02.060> scream<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:03.019> was<00:04:03.049> a

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
like a legendary tear scream it was a

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.619 
like a legendary tear scream it was a
great<00:04:03.379> build<00:04:03.709> up<00:04:03.859> in<00:04:04.010> payoff<00:04:04.400> moment<00:04:04.970> but

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
great build up in payoff moment but

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.750 
great build up in payoff moment but
again<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.109> payoff<00:04:06.349> is<00:04:06.650> somewhat<00:04:07.040> undercut<00:04:07.340> by

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
again the payoff is somewhat undercut by

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.659 
again the payoff is somewhat undercut by
the<00:04:07.819> unfunny<00:04:08.419> delivery<00:04:08.989> yeah<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:10.160> strategy

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
the unfunny delivery yeah the strategy

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.009 
the unfunny delivery yeah the strategy
game<00:04:10.849> itself<00:04:11.269> I<00:04:11.480> thought<00:04:11.690> was<00:04:11.840> interesting

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
game itself I thought was interesting

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.170 
game itself I thought was interesting
how<00:04:12.590> it<00:04:12.769> you<00:04:13.010> know<00:04:13.069> it<00:04:13.340> starts<00:04:13.609> off<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:13.970> being

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
how it you know it starts off of being

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.420 
how it you know it starts off of being
chess<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:14.870> then<00:04:15.349> not<00:04:15.739> only<00:04:15.769> is<00:04:15.949> the<00:04:16.160> charisma

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
chess and then not only is the charisma

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.069 
chess and then not only is the charisma
thing<00:04:16.820> but<00:04:16.970> then<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.120> also<00:04:17.359> realize<00:04:17.840> that

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
thing but then you also realize that

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.270 
thing but then you also realize that
it's<00:04:18.229> just<00:04:18.320> not<00:04:18.650> even<00:04:18.979> chess<00:04:19.250> it's<00:04:19.489> yeah

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.310 

okay<00:04:22.610> so<00:04:23.030> it's<00:04:23.180> not<00:04:23.330> just<00:04:23.390> say<00:04:23.660> bullshit<00:04:24.080> chess

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
okay so it's not just say bullshit chess

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.110 
okay so it's not just say bullshit chess
game<00:04:24.500> it's<00:04:24.710> just<00:04:24.860> not<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.220> chess<00:04:25.580> game<00:04:25.910> it's

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
game it's just not a chess game it's

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.360 
game it's just not a chess game it's
just<00:04:26.360> outright<00:04:26.780> chaos<00:04:27.170> it's<00:04:27.560> completed<00:04:27.950> yeah

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
just outright chaos it's completed yeah

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.310 
just outright chaos it's completed yeah
I<00:04:28.580> mean<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:28.940> was<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.480> was<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:29.630> clever<00:04:29.930> enough

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
I mean it was it was a clever enough

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.770 
I mean it was it was a clever enough
idea<00:04:30.740> I<00:04:31.010> won't<00:04:31.250> say<00:04:31.400> it's<00:04:31.550> like<00:04:31.700> brilliant<00:04:32.060> but

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
idea I won't say it's like brilliant but

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.770 
idea I won't say it's like brilliant but
it's<00:04:33.020> clever<00:04:33.530> it's<00:04:34.220> fun<00:04:34.580> if<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.360> keeps<00:04:35.570> being

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
it's clever it's fun if it keeps being

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.690 
it's clever it's fun if it keeps being
at<00:04:36.230> least<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.590> clever<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:37.100> could<00:04:37.250> be<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.430> great

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
at least this clever it could be a great

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.670 
at least this clever it could be a great
show<00:04:38.000> if<00:04:38.270> they<00:04:38.450> can<00:04:38.630> keep<00:04:38.840> coming<00:04:39.050> up<00:04:39.260> with<00:04:39.320> fun

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
show if they can keep coming up with fun

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.890 
show if they can keep coming up with fun
ways<00:04:39.920> to<00:04:40.190> make<00:04:40.340> each<00:04:40.460> game<00:04:40.670> if<00:04:40.850> they<00:04:41.300> are<00:04:41.330> funny

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900

ways to make each game if they are funny
like<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.590> this<00:04:42.710> case<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.550> game<00:04:43.820> itself<00:04:44.240> was

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
like in this case the game itself was

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.450
