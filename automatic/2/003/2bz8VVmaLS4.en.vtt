00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
the new one there is a notch that will

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.690 
the new one there is a notch that will
guide<00:02:05.710> you<00:02:05.860> in<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.069> direction<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.490> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.740 

noticed<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.220> everything<00:02:21.549> was<00:02:21.819> fine<00:02:21.849> for<00:02:22.630> the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
gearbox except for the motor shaft so

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.770 
gearbox except for the motor shaft so

now all I had to do is slide in the new

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.229 
now all I had to do is slide in the new
motor<00:02:50.080> shaft<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:50.650> attach<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.220> nut<00:02:51.430> remember

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
motor shaft and attach the nut remember

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.899 
motor shaft and attach the nut remember
that<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> threads<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.349> shaft<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.040> for

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
that the threads on the shaft and for

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.000 
that the threads on the shaft and for
the<00:02:55.030> nut<00:02:55.239> are<00:02:55.690> opposite<00:02:56.349> of<00:02:56.500> what<00:02:56.650> they<00:02:56.769> should

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
the nut are opposite of what they should

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.360 
the nut are opposite of what they should
be

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
be

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.180

and<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:12.650> attach<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.130> cowling<00:03:13.520> simply<00:03:13.910> put<00:03:14.120> dab

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
and to attach the cowling simply put dab

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.750 
and to attach the cowling simply put dab
of<00:03:14.510> hot<00:03:14.630> glue<00:03:14.690> on<00:03:14.990> the<00:03:15.020> inside<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.650> press<00:03:16.550> it

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
of hot glue on the inside and press it

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.140 
of hot glue on the inside and press it
on<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.300> propeller<00:03:20.950> then<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.280> reinforced<00:03:23.030> it

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
on to the propeller then I reinforced it

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.300 
on to the propeller then I reinforced it
with<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.300> little<00:03:23.570> bit<00:03:23.690> more<00:03:23.840> hot<00:03:23.990> glue<00:03:26.590> okay<00:03:27.590> so

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
with a little bit more hot glue okay so

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.490 
with a little bit more hot glue okay so
there<00:03:28.790> you<00:03:28.910> go<00:03:29.060> nice<00:03:29.480> quick<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:29.900> easy<00:03:30.020> fix<00:03:30.350> and
