you<00:01:57.119> women<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.539> sneaky<00:01:57.929> peek<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.320> Matthew

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
you women of a sneaky peek of Matthew

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.950 
you women of a sneaky peek of Matthew
Smith<00:01:59.039> and<00:01:59.340> overall<00:01:59.909> I'd<00:02:00.119> give<00:02:00.149> bedrooms<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
Smith and overall I'd give bedrooms to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.440 
Smith and overall I'd give bedrooms to
billions<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.799> enough<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.369> ten<00:02:02.670> kick<00:02:03.329> you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
billions not enough at ten kick you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.809 
billions not enough at ten kick you
goblins<00:02:03.659> dry<00:02:04.140> wonder<00:02:05.479> yes

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.030 

it<00:02:10.819> was<00:02:11.360> shitty<00:02:12.230> we're<00:02:12.500> thinking<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.890> ways<00:02:12.980> to

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
it was shitty we're thinking of ways to

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.520 
it was shitty we're thinking of ways to
make<00:02:13.280> decent<00:02:13.730> memory<00:02:14.329> but<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:15.019> then<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.349> news

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
make decent memory but but then the news

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.250 
make decent memory but but then the news
came<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.670> 48<00:02:17.209> k<00:02:17.510> spectrums<00:02:18.079> are

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
came in that that 48 k spectrums are

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.000 
came in that that 48 k spectrums are
outselling<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.799> 16k<00:02:19.599> some<00:02:20.599> like<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:21.110> 204<00:02:21.829> to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
outselling the 16k some like to 204 to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.420 
outselling the 16k some like to 204 to
run<00:02:22.159> and<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.989> all<00:02:27.140> new<00:02:27.349> games<00:02:27.560> could<00:02:27.859> be<00:02:27.890> 48

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
run and so so all new games could be 48

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.780 
run and so so all new games could be 48
k<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.849> was<00:02:29.359> saving<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:29.989> on<00:02:30.170> tape<00:02:30.680> inspection<00:02:31.519> for

k I was saving it on tape inspection for

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.809 
k I was saving it on tape inspection for
math<00:02:32.829> at<00:02:33.829> that<00:02:34.099> time<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.400> hadn't<00:02:34.849> made<00:02:35.030> thee<00:02:35.650> I

math at that time I hadn't made thee I

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.280 
math at that time I hadn't made thee I
