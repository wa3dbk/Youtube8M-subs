think<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.419> del<00:04:41.570> Evans<00:04:41.840> can<00:04:41.990> be<00:04:42.080> proud<00:04:42.290> of<00:04:42.500> the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
think the del Evans can be proud of the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.430 
think the del Evans can be proud of the
way<00:04:42.710> he<00:04:43.240> defended<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.270> World<00:04:44.440> Championship

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
way he defended the World Championship

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.860 
way he defended the World Championship
and<00:04:46.220> of<00:04:46.340> course<00:04:46.580> that<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.450> end<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.720> day

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
and of course that the end of the day

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.520 
and of course that the end of the day
really<00:04:48.169> didn't<00:04:48.680> suit<00:04:48.910> his<00:04:49.910> stature<00:04:50.360> you<00:04:51.350> know

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
really didn't suit his stature you know
