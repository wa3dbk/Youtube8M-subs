take it back with us to our yard or

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.670 
take it back with us to our yard or
sometimes<00:01:07.390> we<00:01:07.540> have<00:01:07.690> deliveries<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.380> our<00:01:08.500> yard

sometimes we have deliveries to our yard

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.190 
sometimes we have deliveries to our yard
of<00:01:08.890> those<00:01:09.040> logs<00:01:09.280> so<00:01:10.060> all<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.360> wood<00:01:10.479> we<00:01:10.540> we<00:01:11.020> have

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
of those logs so all the wood we we have

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.440 
of those logs so all the wood we we have
now<00:01:11.470> in<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.890> yard<00:01:12.250> is<00:01:12.430> actually<00:01:12.729> all<00:01:12.909> still

from Hurricane sandy and probably will

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.450 
from Hurricane sandy and probably will
we<00:01:16.270> will<00:01:16.420> still<00:01:16.690> be<00:01:16.810> producing<00:01:17.350> lumber<00:01:18.250> from

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
we will still be producing lumber from

Hurricane sandy tree is probably for the

Hurricane sandy tree is probably for the
next<00:01:20.680> two<00:01:20.860> years<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:22.030> generally<00:01:22.659> don't<00:01:22.810> pay

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
next two years we generally don't pay

next two years we generally don't pay
for<00:01:23.500> logs<00:01:23.710> if<00:01:24.130> we<00:01:24.400> do<00:01:24.549> pay<00:01:24.790> anything<00:01:25.120> it's<00:01:25.540> for

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
for logs if we do pay anything it's for

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.930 
for logs if we do pay anything it's for
transportation<00:01:26.530> once<00:01:27.310> it's<00:01:27.490> in<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.729> yard

transportation once it's in the yard

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.360 
transportation once it's in the yard
it's<00:01:28.330> stacked<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:29.080> when<00:01:29.560> we're<00:01:29.710> ready<00:01:29.740> we

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
it's stacked and when we're ready we

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.149 
it's stacked and when we're ready we
pull<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.670> off<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.940> pile<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:31.690> we<00:01:32.170> lay<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.040> in

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
pull it off the pile and we lay it in

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.910 
pull it off the pile and we lay it in
our<00:01:33.280> mill<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.760> then<00:01:34.210> we<00:01:34.479> we<00:01:34.990> mill<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.320> you<00:01:35.830> know

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
our mill and then we we mill it you know

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.760 
our mill and then we we mill it you know
into<00:01:36.400> mostly<00:01:37.119> live<00:01:37.330> inch<00:01:37.540> slabs<00:01:37.840> those<00:01:38.530> are

into mostly live inch slabs those are

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.710 
into mostly live inch slabs those are
the<00:01:39.070> big<00:01:39.280> wide<00:01:39.490> slabs<00:01:39.909> of<00:01:40.090> wood<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.479> full

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
length of the log and we retained the

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.630 
length of the log and we retained the
live<00:01:43.690> edge<00:01:43.960> of<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.229> tree<00:01:44.530> this<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.190> face

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
live edge of the tree this is the face

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.090 
live edge of the tree this is the face

of the tree that is exposed to the world

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.730

so<00:01:48.700> we<00:01:49.060> throw<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:49.299> in<00:01:49.390> our<00:01:49.540> kiln<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:50.080> in<00:01:50.409> six<00:01:50.680> to

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
so we throw it in our kiln and in six to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.560 
so we throw it in our kiln and in six to
eight<00:01:50.830> weeks<00:01:50.890> we<00:01:51.729> bring<00:01:52.119> that<00:01:52.270> moisture

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
eight weeks we bring that moisture

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.250 
eight weeks we bring that moisture
content<00:01:53.290> down<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.799> around<00:01:54.280> 8%<00:01:54.900> at<00:01:55.900> that<00:01:56.049> point

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
content down to around 8% at that point

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.050 
content down to around 8% at that point
it's<00:01:56.409> stable<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:57.159> be<00:01:57.280> used<00:01:57.490> for<00:01:57.670> furniture

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
it's stable to be used for furniture

from<00:01:58.540> there<00:01:58.750> we<00:01:58.930> can<00:01:59.140> either<00:01:59.290> go<00:01:59.920> on<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.340> just

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
from there we can either go on to just

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.789 
from there we can either go on to just
flattening<00:02:01.240> them<00:02:01.420> out<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.840> sanding<00:02:02.710> them

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
flattening them out and sanding them

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.289 
flattening them out and sanding them
down<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.340> that's<00:02:03.490> something<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:03.880> we<00:02:04.090> do

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
down and that's something that we do

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.749 
down and that's something that we do
more<00:02:04.659> than<00:02:04.900> 50%<00:02:05.229> of<00:02:05.650> our<00:02:05.740> sales<00:02:05.979> in<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.580> lot<00:02:06.729> of

then once we actually set that log up to
the<00:03:04.890> mill<00:03:05.100> we're<00:03:06.200> creatively<00:03:07.200> looking<00:03:07.530> at<00:03:07.680> it

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
the mill we're creatively looking at it

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.010 
the mill we're creatively looking at it
we're<00:03:08.220> trying<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.240> figure<00:03:09.510> out<00:03:09.540> how<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:09.840> we

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
we're trying to figure out how can we

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.750 
we're trying to figure out how can we
position<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.160> we<00:03:11.280> can<00:03:11.430> make<00:03:11.610> sure<00:03:11.640> it

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
position this so we can make sure it

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.060 
position this so we can make sure it
will<00:03:11.910> make<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.330> cut<00:03:12.600> we're<00:03:13.170> gonna<00:03:13.320> capture

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
will make this cut we're gonna capture

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.290 
will make this cut we're gonna capture
all<00:03:14.190> those<00:03:14.340> characteristics<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.180> we're

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
all those characteristics and we're

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.510 
all those characteristics and we're
gonna<00:03:15.390> get<00:03:15.990> that<00:03:16.170> shape<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.740> we're<00:03:17.370> always

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
gonna get that shape so we're always

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.430 
gonna get that shape so we're always
making<00:03:17.700> creative<00:03:18.150> decisions<00:03:18.600> trying<00:03:19.200> to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
making creative decisions trying to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.830 
making creative decisions trying to
honor<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:20.100> tree<00:03:20.450> aesthetically<00:03:21.450> as<00:03:21.540> best<00:03:21.780> we

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
honor the tree aesthetically as best we

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.080 
honor the tree aesthetically as best we
can
