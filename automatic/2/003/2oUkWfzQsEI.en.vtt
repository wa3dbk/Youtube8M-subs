together no base in there so want to put
a<00:03:54.489> glue<00:03:54.879> just<00:03:55.510> around<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:56.019> edge<00:03:56.199> of<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.739> glass

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
a glue just around the edge of the glass

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.330 
a glue just around the edge of the glass
not<00:03:58.060> too<00:03:58.419> close<00:03:58.870> because<00:03:59.290> once<00:03:59.680> you<00:03:59.829> put<00:03:59.859> a<00:04:00.040> box

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
not too close because once you put a box

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.210 
not too close because once you put a box
in<00:04:00.609> there<00:04:00.879> you'll<00:04:01.720> actually<00:04:02.349> push<00:04:02.650> all<00:04:02.949> the

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
in there you'll actually push all the

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.719 
in there you'll actually push all the
way<00:04:03.370> against<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.150> edge<00:04:04.799> just<00:04:05.799> very<00:04:06.280> quickly

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
way against the edge just very quickly

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.179 
way against the edge just very quickly
go<00:04:07.120> around<00:04:07.540> there<00:04:07.750> like<00:04:07.930> there<00:04:08.199> because<00:04:09.099> you

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
go around there like there because you

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.240 
go around there like there because you
know<00:04:09.340> everything<00:04:09.760> will<00:04:10.090> be<00:04:10.239> covered<00:04:10.780> by<00:04:10.810> the

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
know everything will be covered by the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.170 
know everything will be covered by the
boxes<00:04:12.840> all<00:04:13.840> right<00:04:14.169> and<00:04:14.799> honestly<00:04:15.400> any<00:04:15.729> tighter

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
boxes all right and honestly any tighter

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.770 
boxes all right and honestly any tighter
glue<00:04:16.599> should<00:04:16.659> be<00:04:17.079> fine<00:04:18.120> take<00:04:19.120> someone<00:04:19.750> like

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
glue should be fine take someone like

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.830 
glue should be fine take someone like
this<00:04:20.519> then<00:04:21.519> to<00:04:21.820> make<00:04:22.030> sure<00:04:22.210> that<00:04:22.360> everything

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
this then to make sure that everything

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.260 
this then to make sure that everything
would<00:04:22.990> really<00:04:23.530> glue<00:04:23.889> well<00:04:24.130> you<00:04:24.699> can<00:04:24.909> put<00:04:25.120> some

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
would really glue well you can put some

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.860 
would really glue well you can put some
glue<00:04:25.509> on<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.750> edge<00:04:26.020> too

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
glue on the edge too

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.020 
glue on the edge too
just<00:04:28.500> like<00:04:28.710> this<00:04:28.919> little<00:04:29.280> bus<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.610> can<00:04:29.760> see

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
just like this little bus you can see

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.250 
just like this little bus you can see
that<00:04:31.760> if<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:33.030> have<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.270> little<00:04:33.570> ol<00:04:33.810> makeup

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
that if you have a little ol makeup

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.980 
that if you have a little ol makeup
brushes<00:04:34.590> which<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.400> may<00:04:35.669> have<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.510> can<00:04:36.690> brush

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
brushes which you may have you can brush

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.740 
brushes which you may have you can brush

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
the glue dry he dries clear so it

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.730 
the glue dry he dries clear so it
doesn't<00:04:57.449> really<00:04:57.540> matter<00:04:57.840> that<00:04:58.020> if<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:58.530> went

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
doesn't really matter that if you went

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.890 
doesn't really matter that if you went
outside<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:59.160> little<00:04:59.340> bit<00:04:59.550> or<00:04:59.729> not<00:05:05.120> okay<00:05:06.120> so<00:05:06.840> you

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
want to place this in here and it takes

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.230 
want to place this in here and it takes
about<00:05:09.630> 2<00:05:10.139> hour<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.710> dry<00:05:10.979> so<00:05:11.310> once<00:05:11.520> you<00:05:11.669> place<00:05:12.000> in

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
about 2 hour to dry so once you place in

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.830 
about 2 hour to dry so once you place in

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
the top box I just tightened really

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.520 
the top box I just tightened really
tight<00:05:18.090> so<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.419> shouldn't<00:05:18.780> move<00:05:18.960> at<00:05:19.139> all<00:05:19.199> you

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
tight so you shouldn't move at all you

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.890 
tight so you shouldn't move at all you
should<00:05:19.560> be<00:05:19.800> fine<00:05:20.070> so<00:05:21.030> we<00:05:21.150> put<00:05:21.389> more<00:05:21.570> glue<00:05:21.870> in

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
should be fine so we put more glue in

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.270 
should be fine so we put more glue in
here<00:05:22.289> just<00:05:22.470> in<00:05:22.680> case<00:05:23.990> yes<00:05:25.020> glue<00:05:25.680> is<00:05:25.800> my<00:05:25.949> best

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
here just in case yes glue is my best

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.260 
here just in case yes glue is my best
friend<00:05:28.160> so<00:05:29.160> we're<00:05:29.250> gonna<00:05:29.340> place<00:05:29.639> this<00:05:29.850> right

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
friend so we're gonna place this right

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.310 
friend so we're gonna place this right
in<00:05:30.630> here<00:05:31.370> see<00:05:32.370> it's<00:05:33.090> easier<00:05:33.720> than<00:05:33.900> cooking

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
in here see it's easier than cooking

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.230 
in here see it's easier than cooking
right<00:05:34.530> that's<00:05:35.280> what<00:05:35.520> I<00:05:35.550> don't<00:05:35.820> do<00:05:35.940> cooking

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
right that's what I don't do cooking

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.469 
right that's what I don't do cooking
show<00:05:36.450> because<00:05:36.870> me<00:05:37.229> no<00:05:37.410> cook<00:05:37.710> I<00:05:37.919> can<00:05:38.250> cook<00:05:38.479> some

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
show because me no cook I can cook some

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.029 
show because me no cook I can cook some
measures<00:05:39.780> like<00:05:40.020> that

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
measures like that

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.790 
measures like that
so<00:05:42.639> that's<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.449> so<00:05:43.779> we<00:05:43.990> don't<00:05:44.169> touch<00:05:44.379> this<00:05:44.619> foot

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
so that's it so we don't touch this foot

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.399 
so that's it so we don't touch this foot
to<00:05:44.949> our<00:05:45.129> batch<00:05:45.699> of<00:05:45.879> our<00:05:45.999> work<00:05:46.270> put<00:05:46.779> on<00:05:46.869> the<00:05:47.020> wall

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
to our batch of our work put on the wall

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.699 
to our batch of our work put on the wall
you<00:05:48.279> like<00:05:48.460> it
