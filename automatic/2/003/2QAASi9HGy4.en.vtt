gonna<00:03:44.549> make<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:45.660> happens<00:03:46.109> that<00:03:46.170> it

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
gonna make it just so happens that it

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.379 
gonna make it just so happens that it
didn't<00:03:46.739> at<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.310> time<00:03:47.609> I<00:03:47.670> was<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:48.090> don't<00:03:48.150> have

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
didn't at that time I was I don't have

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.720 
didn't at that time I was I don't have
time<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:49.319> think<00:03:49.590> about<00:03:49.889> what<00:03:50.130> what<00:03:50.489> went

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
time to to think about what what went

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.520 
time to to think about what what went
wrong<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:51.150> gotta<00:03:51.480> get<00:03:51.630> on<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> defensive<00:03:52.350> end

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
wrong I gotta get on the defensive end

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.140 
wrong I gotta get on the defensive end
because<00:03:52.859> this<00:03:53.010> man<00:03:53.190> has<00:03:53.370> less<00:03:53.639> than<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.880> minute

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
because this man has less than a minute

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.960
