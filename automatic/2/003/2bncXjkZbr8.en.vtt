00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 a lower body with you anton to the site he 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.549
 gaming app. 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.170
 and today I will tell you very much 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.589
 interesting story very interesting 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.050
 chips 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.389
 but generally how to properly trade 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.030
 in minecraft as you can buy 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.250
 do not use anything in minecraft 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.080
 no mods you will not believe but that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.820
 you can do absolutely on default 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.369
 minecraft and no wonder I'm right now 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.170
 village first we need to find this 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.800
 village how to do it you can 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.170
 see the review on our channel there 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.660
 a kind of video tutorial video lesson 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.730
 the link will be shorter in the description also 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.440
 will be in the form of annotation here now 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.250
 here it is here on the screen you can 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.770
 click on it duck here further when we 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.289
 we find we are just looking for a resident after which 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.559
 we right click on it 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.480
 he is looking right at us waiting for us 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.890
 click on it and we are on it 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.500
 Click so here and he offers us 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.660
 for example for emerald buy four bread 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.409
 for me it is not very profitable 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.229
 position so we move on there 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.640
 the dragon died down 10 arrows 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.860
 also disadvantaged too here in 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.689
 Basically here and over 18 wheat 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.020
 whole world from out amir al then into 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.439
 principle, as it were for free, can be 3 easier 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.770
 To craft in general as for me duck trade 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.780
 with residents a little bit so not very 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.420
 private year not to me crowd 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.970
 What a you do not sell not even 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.970
 trying to sell engines at all 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.040
 trade with these residents 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.270
 how much more I don't know not that she doesn't 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.220
 actually it is unprofitable absolutely like 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.110
 let me show you now 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.200
 you see a wonderful picture on the screen 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:53.030
 screenshot in which you can see 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.240
 how and what can you buy because of how so 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.510
 say the amount here for example you see 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.740
 the amount of for example wheat too and that 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.260
 you will get it 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.510
 for example for mirold and quantity too 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.050
 besides wheat and how much you get and 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.480
 also hit frequency meet 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.430
 Met so to speak here and precisely such 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.880
 sales options they are sometimes rare 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.070
 sometimes very frequent sometimes there are none 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.720
 very hard to find like very 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.510
 such are the most rare that are highlighted 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.030
 blue These arrows do well 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.030
 duck here and now we pursue 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.870
 let's see at all we are the people of Kenya themselves 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.760
 we are in principle they are not very 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.410
 same type but they differ for the most 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.600
 degree only the appearance of a goal from them 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.250
 all equally all also wrinkled forehead 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.260
 but of course it's not that bad 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.459
 visible green eyes and and monobrow and 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.280
 walking around like hands in a clutch 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.950
 tucked duck here now there is such 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.350
 a resident he is very busy 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.450
 there is aprons here miss ping 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.840
 in so far as we also baryzhit 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.880
 there's a violet here weird 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.350
 Of course it seems to me but still well in 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.690
 principle, there is more or less adequate 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.549
 he has prices like this 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.530
 again it is more related to 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.959
 ready those who have partaki not like 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.420
 degree related to cooking well and there are 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.090
 a pure white in here as for me I 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.580
 it seems he is the most choppy 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.590
 potsyk which really saves you 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.360
 unnecessary situation right moment but to 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.950
 regret this is all you could 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.220
 tell about it basically exist 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.980
 various other mods for example 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.739
 various stores on the economy for example 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.540
 savings and you can download them in 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.340
