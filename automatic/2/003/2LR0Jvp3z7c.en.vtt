00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.230 
going to alternate that every curl and
I'm<00:01:28.350> also<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> use<00:01:29.040> some<00:01:29.220> small<00:01:29.790> pieces

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
I'm also going to use some small pieces

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
I'm also going to use some small pieces
and<00:01:30.540> some<00:01:30.750> big<00:01:31.020> pieces<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> make<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:31.979> look

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and some big pieces just to make it look

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.249 
and some big pieces just to make it look
a<00:01:32.400> little<00:01:32.549> different<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.170> I'm

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
a little different so that's what I'm

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.749 
a little different so that's what I'm
gonna<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.650> all<00:01:34.680> around<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.280> head<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.640> I'm

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
gonna do all around my head and I'm

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.410 
gonna do all around my head and I'm
going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.180> speed<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.180> see

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
going to speed this up now you can see

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.910 
going to speed this up now you can see
I'm<00:01:39.509> changing<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> way<00:01:40.229> I'm<00:01:40.350> curling<00:01:40.799> I'm

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
I'm changing the way I'm curling I'm

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.149 
I'm changing the way I'm curling I'm
using<00:01:41.130> different<00:01:41.610> techniques<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.540> curl<00:01:43.159> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
using different techniques as I curl you

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.770 
using different techniques as I curl you
can<00:01:44.280> even<00:01:44.430> use<00:01:44.640> different<00:01:44.909> sized<00:01:45.119> barrels<00:01:45.570> if

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
can even use different sized barrels if

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.020 
can even use different sized barrels if
you<00:01:45.930> want<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.009> find<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.790> works

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you want to but I find that this works

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.840 
you want to but I find that this works
just<00:01:48.329> fine

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
just fine

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.120 
just fine
so<00:01:50.630> now<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:50.870> I<00:01:50.930> have<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.320> bottom<00:01:51.650> half<00:01:51.680> done

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
so now that I have the bottom half done

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.760 
so now that I have the bottom half done
I'm<00:01:52.400> just<00:01:52.430> going<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.090> click<00:01:53.930> that<00:01:54.170> back<00:01:54.440> and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
I'm just going to click that back and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.200 
I'm just going to click that back and
take<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:56.000> front<00:01:56.450> part<00:01:56.600> down<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.700> I'm<00:01:58.940> just

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
take the front part down and I'm just

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.350 
take the front part down and I'm just
going<00:01:59.690> to<00:02:00.080> section<00:02:00.800> my<00:02:01.010> hair<00:02:01.160> or<00:02:01.729> part<00:02:02.240> it

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
going to section my hair or part it

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.460 
going to section my hair or part it
however<00:02:02.720> I<00:02:02.840> want<00:02:02.869> it

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.990 

now<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.679> I'm<00:02:09.800> on<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.039> top<00:02:10.250> layer<00:02:10.459> I'm<00:02:10.729> trying

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
now that I'm on the top layer I'm trying

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.760 
now that I'm on the top layer I'm trying
to<00:02:11.060> get<00:02:11.180> as<00:02:11.270> close<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.720> my<00:02:11.840> roots<00:02:12.050> as<00:02:12.230> possible

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
to get as close to my roots as possible

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.860 
to get as close to my roots as possible
so<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.099> quick<00:02:13.340> curls<00:02:13.670> will<00:02:13.880> start<00:02:14.300> closer<00:02:14.660> to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
so the quick curls will start closer to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.839 
so the quick curls will start closer to
the<00:02:15.170> top<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.500> my<00:02:15.650> head<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.430> I'm<00:02:16.519> doing<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
the top of my head and I'm doing the

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.550 
the top of my head and I'm doing the
same<00:02:16.880> thing<00:02:17.060> I'm<00:02:17.420> alternating<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.230> way<00:02:18.349> that

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
same thing I'm alternating the way that

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.470 
same thing I'm alternating the way that
I'm<00:02:18.680> curling<00:02:19.040> my<00:02:19.099> hair<00:02:19.250> either<00:02:19.730> towards<00:02:20.360> my

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
I'm curling my hair either towards my

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.259 
I'm curling my hair either towards my
face<00:02:20.690> or<00:02:20.930> away<00:02:21.110> from<00:02:21.349> my<00:02:21.470> face<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:23.090> when

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
face or away from my face and then when

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.820 
face or away from my face and then when
I<00:02:23.300> get<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> pieces<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.319> are<00:02:24.440> actually

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
I get to the pieces that are actually

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.470 
I get to the pieces that are actually
framing<00:02:25.310> my<00:02:25.400> face<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.819> want<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.030> make<00:02:26.150> sure<00:02:26.180> that

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
framing my face I want to make sure that

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.410 
framing my face I want to make sure that
however<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.410> do<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.250> end<00:02:28.489> up<00:02:28.790> where<00:02:29.120> they<00:02:29.269> are

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
however I do it I end up where they are

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.420 
however I do it I end up where they are
away<00:02:29.690> from<00:02:29.930> my<00:02:30.080> face<00:02:30.230> because<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.890> don't<00:02:31.130> like

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
away from my face because I don't like

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.100 
away from my face because I don't like
the<00:02:31.550> pieces<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:32.150> frame<00:02:32.420> my<00:02:32.630> face<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.080> be

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
the pieces that frame my face to be

making<00:03:14.060> them<00:03:14.209> more<00:03:14.239> messy<00:03:16.209> so<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.239> just<00:03:17.420> flip<00:03:17.600> my

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
making them more messy so I just flip my

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.210 
making them more messy so I just flip my
head<00:03:17.900> upside<00:03:18.049> down<00:03:18.410> scrunch<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.069> all
