00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:08.099
 in our advice preview videos to the throne 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.290
 of the thunder from patch 5.2 we are today 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.849
 arrived at the endboss at least in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.280
 normal mode of irony is yes 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.080
 another extra opponent but so too 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.060
 story moderate for the patch is everything 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.670
 the thunder king seems so big 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.710
 big giant and the main mechanics of 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.630
 You see some of the fight already on 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.289
 right picture edge there you have these four 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.330
 generators the lidl asian on top of it 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.130
 to be said which must be near 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.260
 be reduced by these generators 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.120
 because otherwise he causes so much 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.450
 damage to the surface that you can no longer 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.020
 purely may have to diligently as a generator 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.610
 recorded 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.219
 a generator but not infinite 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 Charge owns in the at the objects 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.510
 even there they have so little things 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.789
 which indicate the charge and also on the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.890
 right side at least in the standard raid 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.559
 interface with these extra units 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.949
 Portraits can be seen even then the charge 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.590
 Display a maximum of three levels per conductor 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.840
 it is important to know how 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.299
 Well charged a generator is because 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.189
 the highest is always turned off 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.930
 now live as there are and this 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.270
 generators have different 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.530
 effects that trigger them 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.119
 For example, we have when I am 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.720
 right in are at the northern generator 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.689
 started 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.880
 which makes sure that an electric shock 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.619
 is always worked that means there 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.060
 then the group together with the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 the damage can be divided 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.500
 is caused in the east there are the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.290
 diffusion chain that is then a chain 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.900
 lightning is said to be too close to each other 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.009
 only gets proper cargo chains 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.810
 lightning off then we will be in the south 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.560
 a random thunderstorm character then 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.299
 unable to move I believe 25 13 for 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.610
 some time with a the baw and 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.500
 then a wave comes from the character 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.020
 and all the characters are still in 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.009
 this wave will also exist 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.299
 may be stunned incapacitated 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.219
 Of course, nothing does that either 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.590
 quite as practical especially when 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.770
 that then stacks if you then three of 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.170
 this has gotten the bass and in the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.939
 west there is the leap of lightning the must 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.469
 to be caught by a character 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.190
 because otherwise arise net and wants to 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.030
 you do not have either 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.610
 at least when it gets too many 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.500
 quite problematic yes so alone in 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.150
 the phase already a very moving 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.250
 intense fight even where you have to know 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.140
 in which effect you have to stand like 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.310
 one together and wander apart and one 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.280
 when do you have to help him ? 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.709
 that was just the crack of lightning one 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.540
 Of course you still have seen 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.400
 self-skills here in the first 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.750
 He phase once the thundering ax the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.300
 is an effect the vip tower 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.770
 on the ground that announces that 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.600
 Circle attract and there wants to animal 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.010
 as far as possible from the distance because 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.380
 the closer is that we more 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.820
 take damage and then try 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.880
 he causes with the girlfriend donna 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.110
 still relatively regular area damage 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.390
 all over the world that was just the ax in 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.550
 enter europe and then comes the first 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.340
 interphase as the boss goes in the 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.280
 middle and makes any unhealthy 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.980
 things with his protest and then 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.830
 is just after this phase of the am 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.569
 Highest charged ladder switched off 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.390
 and in the interim phase gets neat 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.340
 coach he also sees everyone 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.230
 generators are electrified 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.180
 means all the effects of the generators 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.850
 can grip you have it at just 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.860
 seen in my character that was the is 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.269
 then then of course you can fly too 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.420
 the flashes through the area can 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.799
 then accordingly summoned 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.810
 if nobody picks up there 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.120
 we run in it so no nice 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.410
 that can make me feel pretty good 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.390
 quickly the councils and various others 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.359
 fun thing so all the skills that 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.579
 The generators will then become active 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.680
 then the phase is over after 45 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.930
 seconds and you see it a field 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.070
 overloaded and that's the generator 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.160
 which is switched off 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.750
 yes, on the one hand, it's good because the generator 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.850
 turned off on the other hand then 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.040
 also the part of the combat area not too 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.400
 use because of the completely under power 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.109
 stands 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.880
 I really did not want to stand there then 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.320
 we are now in a second phase 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.900
 leighton has its own skills 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.299
 changed next to the tank important 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.829
 skills of course you see here 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.609
 once those bullet flashes jump 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.519
 funny around 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.680
 you want to go away and then you 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.400
 whip whip there you want too 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.230
 it does not stink then it causes that 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.360
 you can do a lot of damage 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.590
 smooch ground 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.720
 especially the extremely annoying 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.100
 constantly jumping back and forth as 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.600
 misfits look a bit silly 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.010
 of course you have to take care 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.930
 that she is a real generator 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.540
 So one of those where you are together 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.190
 can stand around the opponents then with 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.620
 to take damage from the fight 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.390
 because now, for example, in the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.910
 lightning in the chains lightning 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.030
 generator stands can also completely 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.130
 are getting pretty nasty, right now 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.450
 meanwhile live is always on that 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.250
 interaction ability relative 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.680
 On the one hand, there are also mild ones 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.120
 the danger of chain lightning ours 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.560
 Group here, for example, has time 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.070
 Well, yes, yes, that's the slaughter 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.290
 browser 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.080
 because you can indeed determined the chain lightning 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.550
 Keep away and kill the enns 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.530
 with the much easier we all have on 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.330
 a stain ended up with that 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.170
 this transitional phase after two seconds 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.690
 was over 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.710
 because yes, all in the dirt I believe 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.240
 that he also played a big part 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.130
 not just the candles captain lightning 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.450
 pure but also because that 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.550
 not the whole device over the complete 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.490
 There was, of course, a distributed platform 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.290
 Also, many of them flash 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.030
 just landed and so on 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.240
 have called that is unnecessary too much 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.860
 There was a lot of ruster, be careful because of 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.210
 the chain flash not too far 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.590
 but put together well 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.560
 on the other hand also distribute 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.080
 can intervene if players then 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.820
 this explosive effect have the man 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.740
 The field has to be characterized by several characteristics 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.690
 is really a lot of attention 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.580
 requires at least on the testserver 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.580
 also in the battle browser mode 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.800
 we are now in the third phase 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.680
 jumped you see already the council is 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.610
 considerably decimated the numbers in the 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.170
 Generators are now all 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.820
 turned off the ability you have to 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.250
 So do not be afraid but for that 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.900
 all skills like fans and these 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.490
 pretty think yes you will sometimes 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.670
 which is tapered as if the 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.750
 Do not fight already chaotic enough 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.190
 very entertaining we have it 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.110
 on the test server also failed 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.600
 as I said a shotgun browser 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.940
 mode even with ten buffs quite 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.380
 still crisp and you really have to 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.700
 pay attention to what you do especially 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.380
 guaranteed even in normal and first 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.390
 becomes pretty heroic mode 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.280
 certainly a very exciting competition 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.460
 I would say but generally 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.460
 mood
