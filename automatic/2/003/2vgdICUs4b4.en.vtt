00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello and recently in one of 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.970
 Comments I was asked to make out 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.179
 song group alice sky slavs 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.160
 I first wanted to completely disassemble this 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.010
 electric guitar song 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.770
 but when I began to disassemble, I realized that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.210
 except reef and losing 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.840
 which is the same reef in this 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.320
 the song 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.570
 especially there is nothing interesting for electro 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.989
 guitars 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.880
 so in this video we will learn to play 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.170
 only opening reef on 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.129
 electric guitar 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.550
 in the next video i'm the whole song 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.480
 I'll pick up the acoustic guitar so I 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.660
 I think it will be better arif we sound here 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.660
 So 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.880
 but 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:27.860
 that is, in this reef we have only three 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:33.670
 clients, but then a chord em or e5 then 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:36.579
 again on the fifth fret and c5 on the eighth fret 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:41.539
 and then as if 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:45.939
 vibrate on the sixth string and then we beat 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.939
 all three 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.940
 they 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.630
 the sixth is necessarily deafening and when the volume 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.630
 all three 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:05.830
 like that this reef is shorter I think 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.990
 rhythm you caught here basically and that's it 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.470
 the following video is a complete analysis of this 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.130
 a song but already on an acoustic guitar to everyone 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.130
 good luck bye
