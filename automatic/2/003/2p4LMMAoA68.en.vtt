will require the materials were going to
use<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> fairly<00:00:33.420> straightforward

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
use for this a fairly straightforward

this is four ply brown nylon wool we're
not<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> use<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> four<00:00:39.149> ply<00:00:39.360> what

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
not going to use it as a four ply what

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.369 
not going to use it as a four ply what
we<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:40.980> split<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.489> into<00:00:41.899> two<00:00:42.899> lots<00:00:43.170> of

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
we do if we split it into two lots of

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.209 
we do if we split it into two lots of
two<00:00:43.950> ply<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:46.500> use<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
two ply and that is what we will use to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.850 
two ply and that is what we will use to

welcome to pinch of luck just no ma'am
certain<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:39.740> like<00:04:39.950> to<00:04:40.100> separate<00:04:40.520> them<00:04:40.760> because

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
certain I like to separate them because

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.330 
certain I like to separate them because
you<00:04:41.420> never<00:04:41.630> see<00:04:41.870> them<00:04:42.020> together<00:04:42.200> it's<00:04:43.010> real<00:04:43.310> a

you never see them together it's real a
bit<00:04:43.580> awkward<00:04:44.710> normally<00:04:45.710> does<00:04:45.920> it

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
bit awkward normally does it

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.070 
bit awkward normally does it
automatically<00:04:47.620> here<00:04:48.620> we<00:04:48.770> go<00:04:49.660> just<00:04:50.660> like<00:04:50.930> to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
automatically here we go just like to

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.600 
automatically here we go just like to
put<00:04:51.230> one<00:04:52.180> two<00:04:53.180> just<00:04:53.720> between<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.110> two<00:04:54.400> so<00:04:55.400> the

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
put one two just between the two so the

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.080 
put one two just between the two so the
separator

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:07.909 

then<00:05:01.090> we<00:05:01.210> get<00:05:01.330> our<00:05:01.539> hackle<00:05:04.650> tire<00:05:05.650> Huckle<00:05:06.099> him

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
then we get our hackle tire Huckle him

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.279 
then we get our hackle tire Huckle him
you<00:05:08.340> have<00:05:08.460> nice<00:05:08.669> long<00:05:08.879> run<00:05:09.090> under<00:05:09.659> wine<00:05:10.050> this
