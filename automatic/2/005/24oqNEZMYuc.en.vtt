00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.040
 An a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:22.199
 do not look and see today's story 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.199
 angels in the mist 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.840
 dear friends and brothers 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.920
 Sometimes people's lives seem like this. 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.430
 mist 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.950
 We do not see anything, we do not see any 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:52.310
 Output in my life in my life 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.950
 wife to my children for a moment when 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.230
 we are facing a lot of difficulty and I want 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.670
 share with you a little of our 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.190
 story 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.630
 I worked in a company where 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.860
 people knew that I was an Adventist 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.229
 seventh day and always respected me 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.290
 You know what I kept on Saturday? 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.229
 there was a time when they made a 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.119
 meeting on Saturday at 9 am was 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.170
 mandatory all staff 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.170
 to attend this meeting 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.740
 really is going through a moment 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.630
 very difficult we had ended up in the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.240
 hospital with our little girl in cbb nÃ© 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.009
 had spent all of it after the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.970
 people had been going through a 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.950
 very difficult time even 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.979
 colleagues commented that the one who 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.880
 were not at the meeting on Saturday would be 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.190
 fired 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.100
 and I would tell him to worry 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.410
 This fight is not ours and we just need it. 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.080
 faithful to God and a part of the Lord the Lord 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:55.819
 lord, who then sends the scusa 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.429
 moment of prayer between accessories 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.880
 I asked for the brothers so by 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:05.030
 me for my family for God to 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.460
 help because we were without anything 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.030
 to eat and would not even know if my 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.030
 employment also 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.000
 when we left the church and came back 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.069
 for home 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.430
 I started to think will this 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.430
 mist 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:35.680
 it will never pass but to my surprise 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.959
 when we got home was the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.580
 brother of the church waiting for us with two 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.750
 baskets to deliver 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.440
 that Saturday I never imagined that 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.110
 We would have such a delicious lunch. 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.720
 My wife used the basket products 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.360
 basic report the brother had brought and 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.430
 prepared a special lunch and invited 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.459
 brother because he was an angel of god 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.610
 at that time used by God to 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.170
 supply our need on that Sabbath 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.050
 at 3 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.420
 My boss came home and I stayed. 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.040
 very distressed I was worried 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:19.830
 afraid terrible anguish when I saw 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.830
 He thought I came to resign. 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.060
 he knew of my difficulty in 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.090
 problems it has been experiencing with 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.570
 my family and he came with a new 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.160
 proposed work for me in that 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.300
 Late he did not tell me what the proposal was. 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.490
 because he knew it was a subject that 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.520
 should not be treated on that day 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.090
 from the Lord but on Sunday morning 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.600
 The next time he came home. 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:51.360
 then he sues me to this 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.000
 Wonderful house to live in 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.190
 I live until today and it has been a blessing. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.360
 in the life of my wife my children in 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.750
 my life 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.600
 we have been very grateful to God for 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.640
 everything God has done in this place 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.310
 on Monday the company 's owners me 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.530
 called to confirm the proposal and I 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.930
 they gave a motorcycle zero kilometers from the place 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.580
 where he lived in the farm was a 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.010
 not far from the company where 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.370
 I worked and raised my salary in 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.650
 30% and made a new journey of 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.920
 I work from Monday to Thursday 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.050
 and would have Friday free for me. 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.710
 to prepare for the Lord's Sabbath 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.630
 today there is fog of uncertainty in doubt 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.580
 do not exist anymore 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:44.310
 surrender your way to the trust you 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:48.050
 in him and most of all he will sing 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:52.210
 now a lord with tithes and offerings 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.210
 both our recognition and gratitude
