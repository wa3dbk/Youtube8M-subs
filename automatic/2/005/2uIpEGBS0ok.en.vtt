00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.020
 ah 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.389
 they are no longer I am bow and welcome to 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.340
 top 7 goals of week 1 on fifa 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.510
 fifteen 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.510
 at number 7 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.780
 the number 7 we have a very play 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.690
 powerful as you see for that one who finishes off 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.280
 Chilean but not this ritz and tops off 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.520
 head from there I can see it in the 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.420
 repeat from there a globito golazo 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.420
 good beautiful goal 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.570
 number 6 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.200
 the number 6 we have sturridge again 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.120
 but nothing more 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.190
 free kick shot the truth I do not 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.250
 I usually hit free-throw goals that's why 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.920
 I put it had at best another better goal 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.710
 but I do not put free kick goals ever 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.640
 I have been good and this I got it I liked it 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 a lot because it came in quite angled without 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.140
 be totally totally to the fork 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.140
 but but see 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.210
 did not jump the eye barrier did not jump to the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.940
 barrier but in any case with a 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.170
 I loved the goal I love the goal so 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.170
 that for me this is number 6 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.260
 number 5 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.400
 in one of the five we have a pass 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.740
 long long long for jano square 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.329
 for sterling sterling 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.630
 yellow as it is called thing olé and olé 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.710
 cup again we are going to see her the pass 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.960
 very long and perfect at the foot 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.210
 they should do it and very quickly that where 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.869
 puts the two shots that I'm going to throw 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.869
 not here or the golazo golazo golazo 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.440
 number 4 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.709
 it's a great goal you know registered trademark 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.500
 of the house I am the king of Vaseline 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.440
 give us certain standards and be king but I am 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.730
 good putting the goals well this sea and 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.130
 ten is another wave also suddenly not 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.890
 It has a lot of speed but I say 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.530
 five interviews 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.200
 and very intense as they see the repetition 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.240
 gets between everyone and when it takes 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.850
 out the angle puch 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.540
 almost almost to the angle I love the 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.690
 neighbors back to that the doorman does not 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:47.490
 can do anything by rubbing the crossbar 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.490
 almost the angle a goal number 3 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.540
 we reached the last three goals and here 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.620
 is of major and it was a bullet a bullet 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.120
 of adebayor will say that it was not so so so 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.460
 spectacular but I loved this goal not 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.360
 I know why there is something that I loved seeing 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.990
 see the size of lukaku and from afar and 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.110
 at the angle that is, I enter the angle 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.380
 I loved it and I was fascinated by this goal 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.670
 I really loved it 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.670
 number 2 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.240
 the golazo that golazo 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.830
 emenike up the excitement again these 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.420
 soles in the previous one and this one got them 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.700
 they would do in a game that he was 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.060
 when with pure bronzes but of all 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.790
 the days an impressive goal or 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.850
 really see the repetition that forms 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.650
 to hit him from botepronto he did not think 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.220
 and you see the repetition the bullet that 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.600
 let loose see that repeat of 600 in 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.690
 beautiful 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.120
 as a super currado I loved it and I 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.570
 fascinated this goal imagine how is the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.570
 number one 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.580
 number 1 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.690
 and see nothing else that returns better goal 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.370
 fifa maybe I got it as I put it 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.319
 when we find subscriber that 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.280

 I got with Mr. Ibarbo you 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.420
 see the move went up the 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.390
 filigree and three-finger volley 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.520
 it's a perfect maybe it would have been more 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.490
 perfect that he did not vote before entering 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:38.430
 let's see if he voted before entering but 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.420
 it was a great goal to see how beautiful he hit 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.310
 It really has been one of the best 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.680
 goals that I have put in fifa of all my 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.480
 life an insane equal with the goalkeeper 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.200
 from my own court but good not 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.900
