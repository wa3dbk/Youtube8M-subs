 the room would be let go is okay 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.040
 same 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.399
 we don't care about anything then first 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.969
 of all this this mode called 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.140
 order point is used by 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.750
 experts to be able to restore i 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:50.719
 phones and went brik data index 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.030
 by bric is like saying a phone 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.850
 practically that you can use like 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.949
 paperweight paperweight or brick of 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.550
 iron to say to say that it does not serve to 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.229
 nothing because obviously it has become 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.630
 useless because we broke it 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.040
 we broke some internal components 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.510
 which does not allow ignition in you in 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.310
 some cases when your own 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.150
 phone the device cannot be 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.170
 recovered the vending jockey made 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.830
 replace the motherboard la 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.299
 motherboard in other cases when the turn 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.979
 it is recoverable precisely is used 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.400
 this mode is called ales 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:34.110
 where we will go I will go to illustrate this 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:41.040
 mode then I finished the video after 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:43.229
 I will leave you link in in description of 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.259
 the ones I downloaded then you 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.280
 I explain 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.229
 this procedure can be used 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.219
 also to install a recovery 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:59.509
 modified or simply clockworkmod 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:02:01.929
 to install everything on the phone ok 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:08.440
 Let's check 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:10.849
 sony generated message but we care 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.940
 let's go to download because I already have it 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:20.030
 downloaded then we go to look for or 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.950
 preferably the ps3 version that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.780
 I have but then you can use any 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.780
 so indifferent version 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:35.629
 almost exactly or the ruth auto roth files 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:38.060
 cf routes I use c is more comfortable sorry 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.470
 for these these noises but I can't 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.470
 do nothing the phone ringtone 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:52.480
 I will try to use minimum space for it 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:56.510
 let me see the files better not trio here 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:02.000
 of any iPhone 5 phones 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:06.319
 restore you're almost or three or 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.180
 in three point pour 3.0.4 I use this 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.639
 because they advised me with being 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.010
 to use this then list for us 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.150
 as soon as you download it you will download this 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.730
 archive 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.790
 you have to download winrar this 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.120
 program you can find it on softonic 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.660
 orobie of the genus unloads of this 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.500
 program and open it open the folder 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.950
 with this program, yes, yes 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.989
 will open several pages 3 or three 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:42.130
 then you have to go to oden tre.il 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.510
 select click twice and then 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.950
 close it because it will make you some kind of 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.030
 installation do not know what they are for 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:55.790
 however you have to do it now you do or 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.830
 trevi 3.0.4 will open this window 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.040
 of user account control you 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.330
 it simply crushes you yes 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.730
 will open the program or dintra then 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.070
 as soon as you read it, it's surely how you know 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.320
 the first time it happened to me tea but 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.160
 what is this stuff? 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.970
 then I 'll explain all these boxes to you 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.380
 mainly they don't serve practically 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.350
 nothing if you do n't have to do something 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.540
 particular or that the only thing that can 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.160
 serve you for what you do 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.630
 naturally ruth must be modified 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.880
 anything software installation 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.630
 also the Teflon does not retrieves the 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.570
 recoverable or other things you owe 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.150
 just enter every time pd then 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.110
 you need to connect the phone first 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.730
 in download mode 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.850
 if the phone does not enter mode 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.310
 download you can do it 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.050
 restore it in case it was in brik with 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.460
 recovery if it does not enter any of them 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.290
 these two modalities means that 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.120
 right clicked and there is to scarcera 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.500
 change the motherboard then 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.260
 unfortunately for you 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:05.360
 I don't know what to tell you well you have to go up 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.730
 pda and select the package that 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.040
 you have to install wait for it here 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.720
 here in this case I am a 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.450
 connects Lecce 3 because I don't need it 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.360
 just for nothing 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:25.340
 for example I can do so look ccf 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.230
 ruth samsung galaxy s3 opened eve vi 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.830
 a tar format will be what I was a 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:34.190
 what the tar format is that of 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.870
 hate so it is correct then before 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.820
 all then you also have to check that 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.479
 there are no outs 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.610
 no check beyond af reset time e 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:48.620
 author boot because if it does not happen a 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:51.020
 great mess if you check other options on 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.910
 pete for now that is what 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.220
 normally you do not have to put 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.560
 nothing csc either phone either 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.030
 bootloader not even much attention to the 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.220
 boot loader box because if 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.140
 insert some strange crap files 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.330
 the phone is worth merging so you do 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.200
 very careful when you enter the 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.750
 phone download mode 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.210
 computer or start to arrive there a 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.920
 message with the message that the phone 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.950
 ordering the phone recognized 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.110
 therefore it will be written type inserted in 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.660
 english now i don't remember is one 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.690
 blue bar will come here like this 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.190
 it will turn blue and after you are done 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.950
 the update if everything is born to good 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.800
 end the bar here will become all green 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:35.080
 and there will be written pass and then there 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.390
 you can unplug the phone and you can 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.980
 the phone will switch on not there 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.540
 5 worry if there's no phone there 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.120
 puts a lot to light and normal 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.490
 you have just made a software change 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:51.040
 perfect 15 percent of ten percent 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:52.440
 of battery and what to say first 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.170
 another thing 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:07:00.310
 after you've flashed almost 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:05.220
 surely with or of whom will increase 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:09.670
 the counter of the Roma 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:13.960
 what the singer is practically though 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:15.580
 if you increase this counter and those 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.800
 of assistance if you bring the 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.080
 broken phone will break enough 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.350
 the balls because they say exists 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.920
 changed the phone 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.420
 and to break the balls so me after that 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.230
 I do these operations if you have the 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.330
 root 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:35.750
 I'd rather let you download triangle 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:39.840
 away that makes you take all away from that 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:41.750
 all counter reset and not 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.420
 have more problems with the warranty 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:47.400
 all here nothing of that 

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:51.120
 or very easy to use, just don't 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.460
 shit cold boot loader with phon e 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.590
 with these tips because they really are 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:08:02.010
 merge the phone and I'm not 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:02.910
 responsible or has explained to you the 

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.440
 procedure 

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:08.010
 do your risk and danger because 

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.990
 these are assembly operations and there 

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.430
 want a little you have to be daring for 

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.820
 do these things 

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:18.170
 so at your own risk, bye 

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.170
 to all from matt and galaxy s3
