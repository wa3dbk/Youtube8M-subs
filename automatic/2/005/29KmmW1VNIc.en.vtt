 It is a god , it is expensive already from about one million 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:29.510
 Would be 30 million Once was I shed it is also probably due So 30 million is the strongest 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.550
 I didn't get in 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.470

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.650
 The 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.040
 Time cast 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:46.909
 I had to come about fireworks over there and say why bought 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.570
 But it's most different to say I eight I 30 million yen slow 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.200
 Yes it is the fourth 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.890
 Anyway also I have been found would be useless 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.430
 Why do I have to prepare about 3 fireworks 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.760
 This scratcher 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.930

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:11.130
 Already 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.980
 It is not short-bore diagonal sideways, and it is not good if it is not aligned side by side with abc ground row this time 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.710
 Hmmm 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.520
 It is cute 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.010

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.010
 I do not get excited 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.010

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.390

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.189
 At any rate I salvaged 200 yen 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.290

 You can also get Arthur videos, and it's not too bad to give up 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:12.280
 Since I returned 100 yen, I would like to teach you what kind of formula this fun for a while 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:14.990

 Again 1000000 or 2000000 or because always go to the fireworks gold there almost have I mean 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.040

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:33.250
 I have prepared two of these fireworks in a certain manner 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:39.060
 It might be pretty good in the sense that went so 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.060
 It may be the fun there is just absolute 3000 because not hit most 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:49.570
