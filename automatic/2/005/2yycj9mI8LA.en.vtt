00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.879
 telling me such a map and its duration is worth 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 because more or less I'm doing a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.770
 idea of ​​how you can make the video or if 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 I can put them together although I decided to separate 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 the videos because I want everyone to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.920

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.130
 greeting for barceló he gave his name on 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.950
 blog that jump call see is play in

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.420
 thanks for using your time when 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.369
 build a good player map very peaceful 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.189
 I'm going to change this, it's so peaceful 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.969
 so let's go there get the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.539
 key to open the door to the 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:45.060
 key level 1 is here is not worth it puts 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.369
 tell him not to forget the yes that I 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.819
 it stays and decides that there are people who 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.009
 It has gone very well and the program fell 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.659
 this one is to sprint more and I eat 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.060
 the truth is that I do not have time nor 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.759
 since I come from class right now 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.039
 is studying all day I do not have 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.229
 time nor stop to look at the mods 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:08.100
 so I'm going to start falling pretty 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.000
 and that this map is level bears gamer 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.000
 and there we are 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.080
 if we go to this the key the lever yes 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.790
 which is called sprint or something like that so 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.860
 if you see this video number has gone down 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.150
 let's thank and filter the matrix 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.610
 by private message telling me this is 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.130
 the program to sprint more 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.390
 We are very sparing a medium level not you 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.010
 forget to use the 6 for the jumps 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.380
 so that we are towards the base and not 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.080
 to fall this already you have put it to me with the 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.080
 is going to betray god my god 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.390
 yes yes yes I already have it to the siff man this 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.740
 this pact is easier it knows well which one 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.940
 I was like this kind of maps to me 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.100
 I love 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.620
 this wall this memory is like as 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.360
 egypt things and I then we go for 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.420
 there to place the wool is this 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.620
 dodgy only with multiple stairs 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.270
 the truth is that I'm opening a lot 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.950
 of minecraft from opening many here 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.930
 all many things no longer follow 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.760
 totally not to suffer so much 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.100
 I recommend going jumping and fortis balls 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.110
 to that yes that I control it as it says 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.730
 the east jump of the lizard I do not know if 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.830
 you saw it in the video of kids from 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.510
 that then the command message my son 's 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.130
 he put it wrong because he had to leave 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.200
 three jumping blocks and luck of that 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.590
 one or none agreement as it was but not 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.510
 can jump and here I will die though 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.850
 I'm going to die I know I know I know I'm 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.220
 making a dent in the entire program designed 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.800
 by half the key sprints to 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.330
 final level we go to the final level 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.930
 Boyacá took a few hours to make 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.350
 to live this this does not inspire me anything 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.580
 but nothing of confidence 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.640
 this is going to fall more help at night 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.680
 the times &amp; night 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.540
 this thing about the set night the truth is that I 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.880
 you have said many times is to the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.610
 lever and look up 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.220
 now we are done here a fleeting stop and 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:10.890
 there is as proposed the time 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.890
 times &amp; night 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.680
 I speak well 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.480
 we have done of not being like this now yes it is worth 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.530
 Well, I have the other one 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.889
 I believe 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.889
 or almost all of this what is 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.639
 how have you done this I like it or almost 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.890

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.080
 you that I am from in a city 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.910
 worth of value in which there are 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.260
 failures the courageous departures are very 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.450
 famous have a lot of tourism are separated 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.130

 you search for it by google and you will see how 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.850
 they are giant movements in which 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.620
 millions of dollars are spent and then 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.390
 what hits a fire most is something 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.130
 illogical but it 's like that and they have many 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.420
 rockets of these and it's all very well 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.160
