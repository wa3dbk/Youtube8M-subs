had bits of that bike for a long time

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.800 
had bits of that bike for a long time
but<00:02:03.430> I've<00:02:03.520> also<00:02:03.640> had<00:02:03.850> bits<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.330> that<00:02:04.420> bike<00:02:04.659> for

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
but I've also had bits of that bike for

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.359 
but I've also had bits of that bike for
only<00:02:05.049> days<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.500> tank<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.799> lent<00:02:06.040> from<00:02:06.159> a<00:02:06.220> guy

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
only days the tank I lent from a guy

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.040 
only days the tank I lent from a guy
from<00:02:06.400> Tasmania<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.240> came<00:02:07.390> up<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.659> this<00:02:07.750> event

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
from Tasmania that came up to this event

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.990 
from Tasmania that came up to this event
so<00:02:08.319> it's<00:02:08.800> yeah<00:02:09.369> it's<00:02:09.610> something<00:02:09.729> borrowed

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
so it's yeah it's something borrowed

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.430 
so it's yeah it's something borrowed
something<00:02:10.090> blue<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.539> however<00:02:11.230> it's<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
something blue and however it's the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.380 
something blue and however it's the
story<00:02:11.680> goes<00:02:11.920> yeah<00:02:12.580> proves<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.090> can<00:02:13.209> just

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
story goes yeah proves that you can just

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.940 
story goes yeah proves that you can just
cover<00:02:13.750> some<00:02:13.900> stuff<00:02:14.170> together<00:02:14.290> sometimes<00:02:14.800> and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
cover some stuff together sometimes and

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.590 
cover some stuff together sometimes and
I<00:02:15.100> was<00:02:15.250> looking<00:02:15.459> at<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.580> boat<00:02:15.760> for<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.390> is

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
I was looking at the boat for and it is

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.210 
I was looking at the boat for and it is
very<00:02:16.989> very<00:02:17.110> unusual<00:02:17.830> because<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.069> actually

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
very very unusual because it actually

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.090 
very very unusual because it actually
has<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.910> right<00:02:19.420> hand<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:20.319> left<00:02:20.350> hand<00:02:20.680> gear

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
has a right hand and a left hand gear

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.949 
has a right hand and a left hand gear
option<00:02:21.610> my<00:02:21.910> understanding<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.450> perhaps<00:02:22.780> in

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
option my understanding is perhaps in

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.540 
option my understanding is perhaps in
the<00:02:23.080> early<00:02:23.380> days<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.800> 69<00:02:24.190> when<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.400> model

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
the early days in the 69 when this model

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.820 
the early days in the 69 when this model
came<00:02:24.790> out<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.270> road<00:02:25.450> trail<00:02:25.750> bike<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:26.200> lot<00:02:26.739> of

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
came out it's a road trail bike a lot of

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.110 
came out it's a road trail bike a lot of
the<00:02:26.890> Japanese<00:02:27.400> are<00:02:27.700> turning<00:02:27.940> into<00:02:28.030> the

the Japanese are turning into the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.610 
the Japanese are turning into the
European<00:02:28.540> market<00:02:28.569> in<00:02:28.930> American<00:02:29.260> market<00:02:29.530> and
