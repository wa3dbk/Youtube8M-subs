00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.730
 how nice that you are there again 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 I am a huge flower fan I have to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.820
 I always look forward to flowers at home 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.380
 me whenever you blümchen me 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.990
 bring along and I bring myself 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.060
 happy with flowers and clear you can there 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.760
 Unbelievably spend a lot of money 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.080
 but there are also quite cheap flowers 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.460
 For example, in a supermarket can 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.230
 you always for 23 euros already 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.180
 buy cut flowers and if you want 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.040
 the mummy bows or what to bring 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.910
 eat invited then bring 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.769
 nothing you just not a few 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.620
 cut flowers with but also to 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.620
 fitting a nice flower bit 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.500
 For that you need the following things high 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.040
 class a scissors double-sided 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.829
 tape ribbon cut development 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.199
 straws and a rubber band which means 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.430
 need a first is klaus you can 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.470
 yes soon if the jam all 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.330
 goes or that mustard Kläschen in like all 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.460
 is not throwing the glasses off but 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.020
 Rinse and keep it beautiful and exactly 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.040
 for such things come namely 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.630
 great for use 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.720
 I have an old one here now I think 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.920
 mustard glass of the company who and what we 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.259
 then you need it in the first step 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.940
 double sided tape once 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.940
 beautiful around come around the glass 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.579
 in the second step you need the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.070
 straws unfortunately I'm just so fine 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.479
 colored black but found if you 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.619
 Let's have a look and have some time 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.469
 you can find them in the most colorful as well 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.179
 colors either in pink or white 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.950
 or maybe also overstretched 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.799
 We just buy the funny time 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 straws that fit and then you go 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.069
 actually sticks and sticks to every straw 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.520
 one by one around the glass 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.520
 a little bit weird 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.660
 best then again 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.220
 Help a little with your hands and 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.110
 Press the straws a bit tight 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.430
 to the whole still a little better 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.900
 maybe that's the way to fix it 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.850
 Clever another rubber band around 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.840
 do 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.940
 then you go to number sure 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.830
 and in the next step he needs 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.240
 just a gift ribbon I have here 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.050
 but nice pinkls because that fits too 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.370
 to my flower 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.990
 Of course you can also paint there 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.740
 Choose the ones that are better suited to a flower 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.740
 or to your taste 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.050
 tara and that's how it looks 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.560
 Of course, all that is missing now is the 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.610
 floret just make pure and then 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.170
 just either your apartment 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.880
 embellish or the vision further 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.880
 for example give me away
