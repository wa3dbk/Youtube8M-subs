00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
have stress okay so where do we get this

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.630 
have stress okay so where do we get this
skill<00:01:24.720> set<00:01:24.990> where<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.530> learn<00:01:26.100> how<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
skill set where do we learn how to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
skill set where do we learn how to
interact<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.270> mean<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.900> at<00:01:28.049> home

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

well<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.280> great<00:01:29.460> question<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.450> think

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
well it's a great question and I think

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.850 
well it's a great question and I think
you<00:01:30.780> touched<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.439> earlier

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
you touched on it earlier

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.640 
you touched on it earlier
initially<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:33.090> learn<00:01:33.329> skills<00:01:33.689> from<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
initially we learn skills from the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.420 
initially we learn skills from the
family<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.189> grew<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.790> yeah<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.720> difficult

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
family we grew up in yeah the difficult

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.880 
family we grew up in yeah the difficult
you<00:01:38.430> got<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:39.930> parents<00:01:40.500> had<00:01:40.650> good
