00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.560 
the past I have disliked these quite a
lot<00:01:38.280> because<00:01:38.610> they're<00:01:38.760> only<00:01:38.880> 5k<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.480> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
lot because they're only 5k at the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.330 
lot because they're only 5k at the
moment<00:01:39.930> they're<00:01:40.260> incredibly<00:01:40.860> good<00:01:41.100> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
moment they're incredibly good and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.640 
moment they're incredibly good and
definitely<00:01:41.490> worth<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.270> coins<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.840> basically

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
definitely worth the coins so basically

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.930 
definitely worth the coins so basically
