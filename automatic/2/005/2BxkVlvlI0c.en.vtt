00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
effectively I believe using the mstr

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.760 
effectively I believe using the mstr
with<00:02:21.190> all<00:02:21.370> ages<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.970> appropriate<00:02:22.510> because

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
with all ages is appropriate because

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.990 
with all ages is appropriate because

some students especially the teens can

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.490 
some students especially the teens can

into the Msgr room the first thing that

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.230 
into the Msgr room the first thing that
I<00:02:50.080> have<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.470> youth<00:02:50.650> do<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.130> pick<00:02:51.790> up<00:02:51.970> our

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
I have the youth do is pick up our

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.120 
I have the youth do is pick up our
tunnels<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:52.960> pull<00:02:53.230> out<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.620> tubes<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.040> are

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
tunnels and pull out the tubes that are

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.490 
tunnels and pull out the tubes that are
inside<00:02:54.490> what<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.330> does<00:02:55.570> is<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.020> releases<00:02:56.170> a

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
inside what that does is it releases a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.650 
inside what that does is it releases a
lot<00:02:56.770> of<00:02:56.800> energy<00:02:57.280> because<00:02:57.430> there's<00:02:57.790> weight<00:02:58.060> to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
lot of energy because there's weight to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.930 
lot of energy because there's weight to
that<00:02:58.810> those<00:02:59.080> pieces<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.530> equipment

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
that those pieces of equipment

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.100 
that those pieces of equipment
separating<00:03:00.940> them<00:03:01.120> putting<00:03:01.690> them<00:03:01.900> together

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
separating them putting them together

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.020 
separating them putting them together
making<00:03:02.800> them<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.040> fun<00:03:03.250> place<00:03:03.520> for<00:03:03.550> them<00:03:03.880> to

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
making them a fun place for them to

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.180 
making them a fun place for them to
either<00:03:04.180> hide<00:03:04.570> or<00:03:04.600> crawl<00:03:05.110> through<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.680> as<00:03:05.950> they

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
either hide or crawl through and as they

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.920 
either hide or crawl through and as they
work<00:03:06.460> more<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.120> more<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.510> see<00:03:07.750> that

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
work more and more and I see that

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.750 
work more and more and I see that
they're<00:03:08.110> becoming<00:03:08.620> more<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.040> more<00:03:09.250> relaxed

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
they're becoming more and more relaxed

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.670 
they're becoming more and more relaxed
then<00:03:10.270> I<00:03:10.390> have<00:03:10.570> them<00:03:10.690> sit<00:03:10.930> down<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.470> they<00:03:11.650> are

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
want to go on to the spinning swing that

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.220 
want to go on to the spinning swing that
we<00:03:18.310> have<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.670> lot<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.180> youth<00:03:19.360> like<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.930> spin

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
we have a lot of the youth like to spin

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.440 
we have a lot of the youth like to spin
and<00:03:20.500> what<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:20.980> does<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.520> it<00:03:21.880> offers<00:03:22.240> their

seaville<00:04:29.710> would<00:04:30.160> be<00:04:30.340> useful<00:04:30.669> in<00:04:31.240> every<00:04:31.630> public

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
seaville would be useful in every public

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.930 
seaville would be useful in every public
school<00:04:32.020> there<00:04:32.770> are<00:04:32.800> always<00:04:33.130> behavior

problems that Public Schools experience

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.760 
problems that Public Schools experience
so<00:04:36.850> if<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.090> student<00:04:37.330> has<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.990> be<00:04:38.140> excused

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
so if a student has to be excused

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.350 
so if a student has to be excused
they're<00:04:38.979> able<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.370> come<00:04:39.610> back<00:04:39.940> into<00:04:40.180> the

classroom with that intervention much
more<00:04:42.669> quickly<00:04:42.970> than<00:04:43.240> they<00:04:43.390> would<00:04:43.600> be<00:04:43.810> if<00:04:44.050> they

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
more quickly than they would be if they

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.070 
more quickly than they would be if they
were<00:04:44.260> just<00:04:44.590> asked<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.160> sit<00:04:45.940> in<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.180> hall<00:04:46.390> this

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
were just asked to sit in the hall this

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.080 
were just asked to sit in the hall this
intervention<00:04:47.590> could<00:04:47.979> be<00:04:48.130> scaled<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.610> any
