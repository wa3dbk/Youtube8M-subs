00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.319 
I thought mostly the reason why I bought
more<00:00:37.110> stuff<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.620> because<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> saw<00:00:38.250> that

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
more stuff was because I saw that

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.880 
more stuff was because I saw that
Petsmart<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.480> having<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.050> sale<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.870> I<00:00:42.890> wanted

Petsmart was having a sale and I wanted

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.560 
Petsmart was having a sale and I wanted

think this was 1049 I'm not sure the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
think this was 1049 I'm not sure the
receipts<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.940> really<00:00:57.180> showing<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.690> too<00:00:57.840> well

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
um but basically this is supposed to be

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.880 
um but basically this is supposed to be
formulated<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:03.570> aquatic<00:01:03.930> reptiles<00:01:04.530> and

really<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> turtle<00:01:23.159> tank<00:01:23.390> lately<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> have

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
really for the turtle tank lately I have

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.990 
really for the turtle tank lately I have
been<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.290> probably<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
been but probably it's because of the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.359 
been but probably it's because of the
shrimp<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.500> I've<00:01:28.680> been<00:01:28.860> feeding<00:01:29.040> her<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
dry freeze dried shrimp which I'll

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.149 
dry freeze dried shrimp which I'll
probably<00:01:32.939> lessen<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> amount<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.890> haven't

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.960 
probably lessen the amount but I haven't
tried<00:01:35.460> things<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.299> before<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.900> um<00:01:37.290> I

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that would help with that weird gunk

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.050 
that would help with that weird gunk
eNOS<00:02:19.330> that's<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.200> tank<00:02:20.530> or<00:02:20.950> hanging<00:02:21.849> off

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
eNOS that's in the tank or hanging off

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.390 
eNOS that's in the tank or hanging off
of<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.420> filter<00:02:22.780> this<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.319> supposed<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.830> be<00:02:23.950> a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
of the filter this is supposed to be a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.539 
of the filter this is supposed to be a
disinfectant<00:02:25.330> cleaner<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:25.989> deodorizer<00:02:26.560> um

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
disinfectant cleaner and deodorizer um

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.339 
disinfectant cleaner and deodorizer um
so<00:02:27.819> I'm<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.090> mainly<00:02:28.569> hoping<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:29.170> this

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
so I'm just mainly hoping that this

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.699 
so I'm just mainly hoping that this
helps<00:02:29.680> with<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.129> weird<00:02:30.940> moldy<00:02:31.810> bulkiness

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
helps with the weird moldy bulkiness

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.500 
helps with the weird moldy bulkiness
that's<00:02:32.980> around<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.489> tank<00:02:33.730> because<00:02:34.269> that's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
that's around the tank because that's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.600 
that's around the tank because that's
very<00:02:34.599> hard<00:02:35.049> to<00:02:35.200> get<00:02:35.379> off<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.829> just<00:02:35.890> plain

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
very hard to get off with just plain

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.240 
very hard to get off with just plain
water<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:38.349> I<00:02:38.440> don't<00:02:38.620> want<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.829> use<00:02:38.920> soap

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
water and I don't want to use soap

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.890 
water and I don't want to use soap
because<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.760> don't<00:02:39.970> want<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.420> affect<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
because I don't want to affect the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.530 
because I don't want to affect the
bacteria<00:02:41.620> or<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.920> good<00:02:42.430> bacteria<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.360> in

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
bacteria or the good bacteria that is in

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.270 
bacteria or the good bacteria that is in
her<00:02:43.720> tank<00:02:43.959> um

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
her tank um

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.330 
her tank um
I<00:02:45.310> am<00:02:46.209> not<00:02:46.420> sure<00:02:46.750> how<00:02:47.260> much<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.890> because

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
I am not sure how much this is because

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.150 
I am not sure how much this is because
Petsmart<00:02:48.849> didn't<00:02:49.209> seem<00:02:49.359> to<00:02:49.540> label<00:02:50.160> properly

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
Petsmart didn't seem to label properly

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.630 
Petsmart didn't seem to label properly
on<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.459> receipt<00:02:51.849> um<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.660> think<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:54.099> this<00:02:54.400> is

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
on the receipt um I think that this is

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.440 
on the receipt um I think that this is
six<00:02:55.180> 39<00:02:56.640> or<00:02:58.140> 479<00:02:59.140> I'm<00:02:59.440> not<00:02:59.709> sure<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:00.459> but<00:03:01.150> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
six 39 or 479 I'm not sure and but the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.110 
six 39 or 479 I'm not sure and but the
thing<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.019> bought<00:03:02.349> these<00:03:02.650> on<00:03:02.920> all<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
thing is that I bought these on all the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.569 
thing is that I bought these on all the
items<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.569> bought<00:03:04.870> were<00:03:05.079> on<00:03:05.290> sale<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:05.950> they

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
items I bought were on sale so they

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.039 
items I bought were on sale so they
might<00:03:06.790> be<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.940> little<00:03:07.180> bit<00:03:07.359> cheaper<00:03:07.569> than<00:03:07.750> what

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
might be a little bit cheaper than what

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.559 
might be a little bit cheaper than what
they<00:03:08.170> normally<00:03:08.319> are<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.030> mean<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.269> think

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
they normally are but I mean I think

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.640 
they normally are but I mean I think
that<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.109> is<00:03:11.290> 479<00:03:12.129> that's<00:03:12.430> discounted<00:03:13.299> price

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
that this is 479 that's discounted price

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.309 
that this is 479 that's discounted price
next<00:03:14.650> thing<00:03:14.919> I<00:03:15.010> got<00:03:15.040> her<00:03:15.459> was<00:03:16.209> more<00:03:16.690> aquatic

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
next thing I got her was more aquatic

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.220 
next thing I got her was more aquatic
turtle<00:03:17.919> blocks<00:03:19.530> bankais<00:03:20.530> blocks<00:03:20.859> um<00:03:22.079> this<00:03:23.079> is

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
turtle blocks bankais blocks um this is

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.650 
turtle blocks bankais blocks um this is
just<00:03:23.349> for<00:03:23.560> your<00:03:23.650> future<00:03:24.069> use<00:03:24.549> because<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.120> do

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
just for your future use because I do

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.900 
just for your future use because I do
have<00:03:25.690> some<00:03:26.079> now<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:27.190> usually<00:03:27.549> feed<00:03:27.760> her

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910

once every two weeks um depends on how

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.640 
once every two weeks um depends on how
fast<00:03:33.970> she<00:03:34.209> goes<00:03:34.419> through<00:03:34.690> them<00:03:34.840> because

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
fast she goes through them because

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.860 
fast she goes through them because

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
sometimes she won't eat them all at once

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.589 
sometimes she won't eat them all at once
or<00:03:38.230> sometimes<00:03:38.709> she'll<00:03:38.889> just<00:03:39.069> yeah<00:03:39.849> every<00:03:40.480> now

whenever you feel like it you can also

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.430 
whenever you feel like it you can also
choose<00:04:23.790> a<00:04:23.820> variety<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.540> foods<00:04:24.810> I<00:04:24.990> can<00:04:25.170> go<00:04:25.290> in

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
choose a variety of foods I can go in

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.740

here<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:25.650> can<00:04:25.950> put<00:04:25.980> protein<00:04:26.880> freeze-dried

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
here you can put protein freeze-dried

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.520 
here you can put protein freeze-dried

I<00:04:32.570> think<00:04:33.570> that's<00:04:33.750> about<00:04:33.870> every<00:04:34.380> kind<00:04:34.830> of

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
I think that's about every kind of

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.370 
I think that's about every kind of
aquatic<00:04:35.970> turtle<00:04:36.300> food<00:04:36.450> that<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.840> can<00:04:37.020> put<00:04:37.260> in

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
aquatic turtle food that you can put in

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.060 
aquatic turtle food that you can put in
here<00:04:37.410> um<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:39.120> can<00:04:39.330> portion<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.800> think

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
here um you can portion it and I think

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.860 
here um you can portion it and I think
this<00:04:41.250> comes<00:04:41.460> with<00:04:41.640> batteries<00:04:41.880> I'm<00:04:42.720> not<00:04:43.050> sure

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
this comes with batteries I'm not sure

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.450 
this comes with batteries I'm not sure
but<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:45.900> guess<00:04:46.140> I<00:04:46.260> can<00:04:46.530> read<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:46.980> a<00:04:47.010> little<00:04:47.220> bit

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
but I guess I can read you a little bit

feeding volume is about six weeks of

feeding volume is about six weeks of

anyone to feed your turtle or aquatic
pet<00:05:15.990> so<00:05:16.680> this<00:05:17.040> can<00:05:17.310> do<00:05:17.490> about<00:05:17.760> six<00:05:18.120> weeks<00:05:18.330> of

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.770 
pet so this can do about six weeks of
feeding<00:05:18.840> which<00:05:18.990> is<00:05:19.140> great<00:05:19.700> and<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:21.300> amount<00:05:21.600> of

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
feeding which is great and the amount of

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.930 
feeding which is great and the amount of
food<00:05:22.260> remaining<00:05:22.980> can<00:05:23.130> easily<00:05:23.520> be<00:05:23.700> seen

food remaining can easily be seen

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.720

through<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.570> transparent<00:05:25.530> container<00:05:26.130> that

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
through the transparent container that

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.800 
through the transparent container that
holds<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.180> food<00:05:27.420> so<00:05:28.050> um<00:05:28.440> I<00:05:29.810> definitely

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
holds the food so um I definitely

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.060 
holds the food so um I definitely
considered<00:05:31.680> this<00:05:31.890> because<00:05:33.050> it<00:05:34.050> was<00:05:34.320> on<00:05:34.500> sale<00:05:34.740> I

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
considered this because it was on sale I

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.340 
considered this because it was on sale I
think<00:05:35.370> before<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.790> saw<00:05:36.150> it<00:05:36.300> at<00:05:36.420> Petco<00:05:36.660> for<00:05:37.080> forty

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
think before I saw it at Petco for forty

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.070 
think before I saw it at Petco for forty
dollars<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:37.980> then<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:38.700> Petsmart<00:05:39.240> it<00:05:39.390> was<00:05:39.570> also

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
dollars and then I Petsmart it was also

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.490 
dollars and then I Petsmart it was also
40<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:40.830> then<00:05:41.340> at<00:05:41.460> one<00:05:41.700> point<00:05:41.730> it<00:05:42.150> was<00:05:42.200> 23<00:05:43.200> and

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
40 and then at one point it was 23 and

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.280 
40 and then at one point it was 23 and
then<00:05:44.040> at<00:05:44.250> another<00:05:44.400> point<00:05:44.910> it<00:05:45.210> was<00:05:45.540> 21<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:46.080> I

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
then at another point it was 21 so I

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.540 
then at another point it was 21 so I
thought<00:05:46.650> like<00:05:46.890> you<00:05:47.040> know<00:05:47.070> what<00:05:47.280> was<00:05:47.400> already

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
thought like you know what was already

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.420 
thought like you know what was already
50%<00:05:48.420> off<00:05:48.570> pretty<00:05:48.930> much<00:05:49.170> so<00:05:49.680> I<00:05:49.710> decided<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:50.310> get

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
50% off pretty much so I decided to get

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.880 
50% off pretty much so I decided to get
it<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.640> try<00:05:50.820> it<00:05:52.100> it<00:05:53.100> also<00:05:53.310> comes<00:05:53.790> with<00:05:53.970> the

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
it and try it it also comes with the

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.340 
it and try it it also comes with the
holder<00:05:55.890> for<00:05:56.730> this<00:05:56.970> so<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.480> hangs<00:05:57.750> off<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.020> tank

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
holder for this so it hangs off the tank

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.450 
holder for this so it hangs off the tank
in<00:05:58.500> a<00:05:58.530> certain<00:05:58.860> way<00:05:59.040> you<00:05:59.100> don't<00:05:59.280> have<00:05:59.310> to

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
in a certain way you don't have to

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.910 
in a certain way you don't have to
figure<00:05:59.640> out<00:05:59.850> how<00:06:00.120> to<00:06:00.150> hang<00:06:00.480> it<00:06:00.630> on<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.810> tank<00:06:01.110> it

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
figure out how to hang it on the tank it

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.670 
figure out how to hang it on the tank it
comes<00:06:02.130> with<00:06:02.460> the<00:06:03.030> feeder<00:06:03.450> holder<00:06:03.900> that's<00:06:04.530> what

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
comes with the feeder holder that's what

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.010 
comes with the feeder holder that's what
they<00:06:04.980> call<00:06:05.220> it<00:06:05.250> and<00:06:05.520> obviously<00:06:06.330> this<00:06:06.510> also<00:06:06.570> can

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
they call it and obviously this also can

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.390 
they call it and obviously this also can
work<00:06:07.170> for<00:06:07.470> anything<00:06:07.800> other<00:06:08.100> than<00:06:08.340> just

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
work for anything other than just

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.240 
work for anything other than just
turtles<00:06:08.970> it<00:06:09.180> comes<00:06:09.390> it<00:06:09.660> can<00:06:09.870> help<00:06:10.020> with<00:06:10.290> fish

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
turtles it comes it can help with fish

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.450 
turtles it comes it can help with fish
or<00:06:12.560> frogs<00:06:13.560> or<00:06:14.190> newts<00:06:14.940> or<00:06:15.420> anything<00:06:15.720> that<00:06:15.930> I

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
or frogs or newts or anything that I

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.540 
or frogs or newts or anything that I
guess<00:06:17.460> lives<00:06:17.790> in<00:06:17.940> aquatic<00:06:18.630> environment<00:06:19.320> um<00:06:19.560> I

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
guess lives in aquatic environment um I

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.540 
guess lives in aquatic environment um I
know<00:06:20.790> that<00:06:20.910> they<00:06:21.240> already<00:06:21.390> have<00:06:21.690> automatic

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
know that they already have automatic

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.300 
know that they already have automatic
fish<00:06:23.550> feeder<00:06:23.580> of<00:06:24.360> different<00:06:25.320> brands<00:06:25.560> but<00:06:25.920> this

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
fish feeder of different brands but this

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.720 
fish feeder of different brands but this
is<00:06:26.490> apparently<00:06:26.970> for<00:06:27.600> I<00:06:28.080> guess<00:06:28.230> reptiles<00:06:28.950> so<00:06:29.700> I

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
is apparently for I guess reptiles so I

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.690 
is apparently for I guess reptiles so I
decided<00:06:30.300> to<00:06:30.420> try<00:06:30.630> this<00:06:30.750> out<00:06:31.020> and<00:06:31.200> I<00:06:31.740> guess<00:06:32.520> I'll

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.700 
decided to try this out and I guess I'll
