00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.079

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.240
 seijas look for the folder as part of 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.690
 downloaded game 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.290
 in my case be together with the torrent

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.180
 jockey 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.720
 and start checking the percentage already 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.210

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.130

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.030
 open the folder that contains the game 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.420

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.420
 holder 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.299
 and the discharge time is between two 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.250
 hours considering that it weighs like 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.959
 two gigas that you're just downloading 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.700
