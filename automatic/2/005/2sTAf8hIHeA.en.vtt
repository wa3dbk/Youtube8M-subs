these<00:00:13.830> little<00:00:13.950> corner<00:00:14.370> rails<00:00:14.519> down<00:00:14.730> here<00:00:15.000> with

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
these little corner rails down here with

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.700 
these little corner rails down here with
a<00:00:15.179> bunch<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.420> bobs<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.809> them<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.560> got<00:00:16.680> a

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
a bunch of bobs on them we just got a

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.680 
a bunch of bobs on them we just got a
couple's<00:00:17.010> test<00:00:17.279> set<00:00:17.640> up<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.119> make<00:00:18.240> sure<00:00:18.449> that

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
couple's test set up to make sure that

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.320 
couple's test set up to make sure that
you<00:00:19.170> guys<00:00:19.289> know<00:00:19.560> for<00:00:19.770> sure<00:00:19.830> what's<00:00:20.220> happening

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
just to let you guys know the corner

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.500 
just to let you guys know the corner
rails<00:00:22.859> here<00:00:23.160> are<00:00:23.340> actually<00:00:23.519> much<00:00:23.910> faster<00:00:23.939> than

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
rails here are actually much faster than

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.420 
rails here are actually much faster than
these<00:00:24.779> straight<00:00:25.019> powered<00:00:25.320> rails<00:00:25.500> and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
these straight powered rails and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.120 
these straight powered rails and
obviously<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.000> lot<00:00:27.090> cheaper<00:00:27.650> we<00:00:28.650> got<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> test

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
obviously a lot cheaper we got a test

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.710 
obviously a lot cheaper we got a test
set<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.460> right<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.359> show<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> guys<00:00:30.660> that

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
set up right now to show you guys that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.299 
set up right now to show you guys that
it<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.050> actually<00:00:31.320> go<00:00:31.439> through<00:00:31.470> mobs<00:00:31.830> unlike

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it can actually go through mobs unlike

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.970 
it can actually go through mobs unlike
the<00:00:32.489> regular<00:00:32.640> rails<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.210> if<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.450> guys<00:00:33.600> want<00:00:33.840> to

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
the regular rails so if you guys want to

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.150 
the regular rails so if you guys want to
start<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.010> off<00:00:38.690> yep<00:00:39.690> Nova's<00:00:40.110> stuck<00:00:40.410> jails

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
start that off yep Nova's stuck jails

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.270 
start that off yep Nova's stuck jails
going<00:00:41.489> right<00:00:41.670> through<00:00:42.680> slow<00:00:43.680> down<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.250> bit

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
going right through slow down just a bit

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.510 
going right through slow down just a bit
from<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.700> mobs<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.420> okay<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.489> yeah<00:00:47.489> I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
from the mobs but that's okay and yeah I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.740 
from the mobs but that's okay and yeah I
think<00:00:47.730> that's<00:00:47.969> pretty<00:00:48.120> conclusive<00:00:48.690> evidence

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
think that's pretty conclusive evidence

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.020 
think that's pretty conclusive evidence
right<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.610> now<00:00:50.610> we'll<00:00:50.760> show<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.879> guys

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
right there and now we'll show you guys

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.299 
right there and now we'll show you guys
the<00:00:51.180> speed<00:00:51.360> test<00:00:51.629> okay<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.800> got<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> speed

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the speed test okay so we got the speed

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.189 
the speed test okay so we got the speed
test<00:00:53.610> set<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.149> actually<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.809> want<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> let

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
test set up and actually I want to let

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.420 
test set up and actually I want to let
you<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.410> items<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:56.010> well<00:00:56.039> you'll<00:00:56.399> just

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you know that items as well you'll just

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.860 
you know that items as well you'll just
straight<00:00:56.910> pick<00:00:57.090> them<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.570> there's<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
straight pick them up and there's a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.420 
straight pick them up and there's a
chance<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.260> items<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> stop<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.980> mine<00:00:59.160> cart

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
chance for items to stop your mine cart

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.430 
chance for items to stop your mine cart
if<00:00:59.699> you're<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> regular<00:01:00.570> booster<00:01:01.199> powered

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
if you're on the regular booster powered

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.740 
if you're on the regular booster powered
rails<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.190> yeah<00:01:02.460> we've<00:01:02.609> got<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> speed<00:01:03.510> test

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
rails so yeah we've got the speed test

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.320 
rails so yeah we've got the speed test
if<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.140> guys<00:01:04.260> want<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.589> ahead<00:01:04.939> okay<00:01:05.939> three

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
if you guys want to go ahead okay three

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.840 
if you guys want to go ahead okay three

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
two one go Oh already off the bat pretty

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
two one go Oh already off the bat pretty
obvious<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.900> these<00:01:12.990> are<00:01:13.140> much<00:01:13.290> faster<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
obvious that these are much faster so

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.370 
obvious that these are much faster so
jail<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:15.060> saying<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.630> know<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:16.020> you

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
jail was saying that you know if you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.420 
jail was saying that you know if you
make<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.710> these<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.979> nether<00:01:17.159> it's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
make one of these in the nether it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.580 
make one of these in the nether it's
it's<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.450> G<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> better<00:01:19.020> bet<00:01:19.259> than<00:01:19.290> just

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
it's it's G it's a better bet than just

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590 
it's it's G it's a better bet than just
making<00:01:19.740> regular<00:01:19.950> rails<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.270> maybe<00:01:21.390> even

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
making regular rails you know maybe even

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450 
making regular rails you know maybe even
putting<00:01:21.780> half<00:01:21.960> slabs<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.350> top<00:01:22.530> because<00:01:22.710> this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
putting half slabs on top because this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.859 
putting half slabs on top because this

guys so the very important part about
this<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.560> placement<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.549> direction

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
this is the placement and the direction

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.929 
this is the placement and the direction
so<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.450> guys<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.720> look<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:33.960> my<00:01:34.079> F<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.530> my

debug screen it says f1 this is how

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
debug screen it says f1 this is how
you're<00:01:38.729> gonna<00:01:38.790> place<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> rails<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.960> you're

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
you're gonna place the rails now you're

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
you're gonna place the rails now you're
going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> come<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.650> from<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.979> side<00:01:41.189> wherever

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
going to come in from this side wherever

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.310 
going to come in from this side wherever
it's<00:01:42.180> curved<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.720> curved<00:01:42.960> angle<00:01:43.200> that's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's curved on the curved angle that's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.929 
it's curved on the curved angle that's
we're<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> come<00:01:43.829> from<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.880> how

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
we're going to come from that's how

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.830 
we're going to come from that's how
you're<00:01:45.060> gonna<00:01:45.119> place<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> block<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.750> you're

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
you're gonna place the block so you're

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600 
you're gonna place the block so you're
going<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:45.990> place<00:01:46.140> three<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.740> breakaway

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
going to place three like that breakaway

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.340 
going to place three like that breakaway
the<00:01:47.820> sides<00:01:48.060> you're<00:01:48.659> always<00:01:48.840> gonna<00:01:48.899> place<00:01:49.110> this

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the sides you're always gonna place this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.649 
the sides you're always gonna place this
block<00:01:49.619> right<00:01:49.649> here<00:01:49.860> last<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:51.540> going

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
block right here last and that's going

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.560 
block right here last and that's going
to<00:01:51.720> work<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.189> yeah<00:01:53.970> keep<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.299> like

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
to work like so so yeah keep going like

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.910 
to work like so so yeah keep going like
that<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.130> every<00:01:56.130> 30<00:01:56.460> about<00:01:56.850> every<00:01:57.119> 30<00:01:57.920> blocks

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that and every 30 about every 30 blocks

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
that and every 30 about every 30 blocks
i<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.399> exactly<00:01:59.700> 30<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.360> when<00:02:00.840> you

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
i think it is exactly 30 is when you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
i think it is exactly 30 is when you
need<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> renew<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.619> power<00:02:01.860> source<00:02:02.159> so

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
need to renew the power source so

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.880 
need to renew the power source so
basically<00:02:03.509> you're<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:03.750> gonna<00:02:04.020> go<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.710> that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
basically you're just gonna go like that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.809 
basically you're just gonna go like that
and<00:02:05.719> yeah<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:06.960> continue<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.700> continue<00:02:08.700> on

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and yeah just continue on continue on

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.240 
and yeah just continue on continue on
like<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.420> also<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:10.470> direction<00:02:10.890> to

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
like that so also in direction to

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.870 
like that so also in direction to
excuse<00:02:13.030> me<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.150> direction<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:14.550> works<00:02:15.550> exactly

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
excuse me a direction to works exactly

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.600 
excuse me a direction to works exactly
the<00:02:16.090> same<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.660> have<00:02:16.870> no<00:02:17.170> problem<00:02:17.610> whatsoever

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the same you have no problem whatsoever

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.200 
the same you have no problem whatsoever
but<00:02:19.420> when<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.750> come<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.080> direction<00:02:20.440> 3<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.010> 0

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
but when you come in direction 3 and 0

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.610 
but when you come in direction 3 and 0
you<00:02:22.210> can<00:02:22.360> see<00:02:22.570> there's<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:23.080> little<00:02:23.140> problem

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
you can see there's a little problem

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.880 
you can see there's a little problem
here<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:25.480> just<00:02:25.540> connects<00:02:25.960> back<00:02:26.080> like<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:26.470> so

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
here it just connects back like that so

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.300 
here it just connects back like that so
an<00:02:27.130> easy<00:02:27.820> fix<00:02:28.210> is<00:02:28.480> going<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.840> be<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.310> just

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
an easy fix is going to be to just

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.490 
an easy fix is going to be to just
deliver<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.640> power<00:02:30.850> source<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:34.380> break<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
deliver a power source like so break the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.330 
deliver a power source like so break the
blocks<00:02:37.110> little<00:02:38.110> mess<00:02:38.230> up<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:41.220> there<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.310> go

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
blocks little mess up and there you go

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.850 
blocks little mess up and there you go
you've<00:02:43.300> got<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.750> power<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:44.560> changing

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
you've got that a power just changing

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.770 
you've got that a power just changing
the<00:02:44.950> direction<00:02:45.070> of<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.430> rail<00:02:45.580> for<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.030> so

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
the direction of the rail for you so

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.050 
the direction of the rail for you so
yeah<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.920> can<00:02:48.070> basically<00:02:48.340> build<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:48.940> any

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
yeah you can basically build this in any

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.490 
yeah you can basically build this in any
direction<00:02:49.209> that<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.630> need<00:02:49.810> just<00:02:50.320> make<00:02:50.470> sure

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
direction that you need just make sure

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.960 
direction that you need just make sure
you<00:02:50.650> know<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:50.950> you're<00:02:51.220> coming<00:02:51.489> in<00:02:51.580> like<00:02:51.670> so

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
you know that you're coming in like so

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.729 
you know that you're coming in like so
and<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.720> you're<00:02:52.870> going<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.050> need<00:02:53.170> an<00:02:53.350> initial

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
and that you're going to need an initial

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.949 
and that you're going to need an initial
power<00:02:53.890> source<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:55.000> power<00:02:55.209> source<00:02:55.420> between

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
power source and a power source between

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.350 
power source and a power source between
every<00:02:56.650> 30<00:02:56.890> blocks<00:02:57.130> just<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.730> renew<00:02:58.090> your

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
every 30 blocks just to renew your

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.930 
every 30 blocks just to renew your
maximum<00:02:59.260> speed<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.770> yeah<00:03:00.520> it's<00:03:00.670> going<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.850> be

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
maximum speed and yeah it's going to be

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.430 
maximum speed and yeah it's going to be
much<00:03:01.180> faster<00:03:01.450> than<00:03:01.930> if<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.140> have

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
much faster than if you just have

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.270 
much faster than if you just have
regular<00:03:03.360> powered<00:03:04.360> rails<00:03:04.540> excuse<00:03:04.959> me<00:03:05.080> or<00:03:05.950> all

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
regular powered rails excuse me or all

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.710 
regular powered rails excuse me or all
powered<00:03:06.610> rails<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:06.910> it's<00:03:07.030> much<00:03:07.180> cheaper<00:03:07.209> as

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
powered rails so it's much cheaper as

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.020 
powered rails so it's much cheaper as
well<00:03:08.310> also<00:03:09.310> make<00:03:09.459> sure<00:03:09.489> that<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.790> don't<00:03:09.880> have

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
well also make sure that you don't have

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.050 
well also make sure that you don't have
any<00:03:10.270> blocks<00:03:11.020> beside<00:03:11.440> if<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.670> have<00:03:12.790> blocks

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
any blocks beside if you have blocks

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.940 
any blocks beside if you have blocks
beside<00:03:13.390> like<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:13.780> even<00:03:14.140> on<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.290> regular<00:03:14.440> rail<00:03:14.709> a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
beside like so even on a regular rail a

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.100 
beside like so even on a regular rail a
lot<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.520> people<00:03:15.700> don't<00:03:15.820> know<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:15.940> but<00:03:16.120> you

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
lot of people don't know this but you

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.080 
lot of people don't know this but you
are<00:03:17.320> going<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.560> run<00:03:17.650> into<00:03:17.769> some<00:03:18.160> rubbage<00:03:18.670> as<00:03:18.940> i

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
are going to run into some rubbage as i

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.310 
are going to run into some rubbage as i
like<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.239> call<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.660> rub<00:03:19.870> up<00:03:19.959> against<00:03:20.230> the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
like to call it you rub up against the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.840 
like to call it you rub up against the
walls<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:20.860> slows<00:03:21.070> you<00:03:21.100> down<00:03:21.220> very<00:03:21.640> much

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
walls and it slows you down very much

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.759 
walls and it slows you down very much
especially<00:03:22.450> with<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:22.870> build<00:03:23.320> right<00:03:23.500> here

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
especially with this build right here

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.220 
especially with this build right here
because<00:03:24.420> you're<00:03:25.420> constantly<00:03:25.780> moving

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
because you're constantly moving
