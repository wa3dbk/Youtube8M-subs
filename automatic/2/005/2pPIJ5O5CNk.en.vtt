even<00:02:40.099> if<00:02:40.189> it's<00:02:40.370> just<00:02:40.400> once<00:02:40.700> just<00:02:41.000> further<00:02:41.299> old

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
even if it's just once just further old

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.190 
even if it's just once just further old
because<00:02:42.379> it's<00:02:42.560> cool<00:02:43.389> so<00:02:44.389> as<00:02:44.629> you<00:02:44.750> can<00:02:44.870> see<00:02:45.019> you

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
because it's cool so as you can see you

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.979

kind<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.590> turn<00:02:45.769> invisible<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.310> don't<00:02:46.519> think<00:02:46.730> it

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
kind of turn invisible I don't think it

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.210 
kind of turn invisible I don't think it
stocks<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.169> pull<00:02:48.409> an<00:02:48.500> aggro<00:02:48.829> all<00:02:49.010> together

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
stocks you pull an aggro all together

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.800 
stocks you pull an aggro all together
and<00:02:49.549> makes<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.849> completely<00:02:50.120> invisible<00:02:50.540> I

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
and makes you completely invisible I

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.349 
and makes you completely invisible I
think<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.049> just<00:02:51.079> reduces<00:02:51.639> the<00:02:52.639> radius<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.299> a

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
think it just reduces the radius and a

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.750 
think it just reduces the radius and a
chance<00:02:53.659> of<00:02:53.870> pulling<00:02:54.439> aggro<00:02:54.680> but<00:02:55.579> you'll<00:02:55.700> have

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
chance of pulling aggro but you'll have

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.559 
chance of pulling aggro but you'll have
to<00:02:55.819> test<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.389> that's<00:02:57.139> camouflage<00:02:57.650> everybody

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
to test and that's camouflage everybody

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.259 
to test and that's camouflage everybody
and<00:02:59.569> lastly<00:03:00.169> but<00:03:00.500> by<00:03:00.769> no<00:03:00.829> means<00:03:01.010> East<00:03:01.609> for<00:03:02.000> the
