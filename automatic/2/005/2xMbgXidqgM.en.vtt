 Hi, I'm a healthy tornel and I'm in the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.730
 party here at 50 at the Tamayo Museum 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.919
 this is a gala party and that's why 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.679
 let's find looks really 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.950
 elegant, come with me, this is ricard 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.950
 word 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.890
 to see practically put I bring royal 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.300
 closet is a design that they made 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.360
 especially to wind the closet 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.420
 that we did this is for me and then 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.930
 reduced the is very elegant but a little 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.420
 uncomfortable but I love it too 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.940
 I bring royal closet to see you as 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.890
 experts in fashion and as designers who 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.050
 could you say that is the most important 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.720
 to choose an evening dress because 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.380
 it suits you well that you look good that 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.670
 they save you their qualities but neither 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.930
 you have to be so uncomfortable to not 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.090

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.920
 a lot to see your smile its best 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.360

 what's different and if you repeat it but it 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.149
