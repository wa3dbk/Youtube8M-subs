00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.090
 hello everybody today I will demonstrate here 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.519
 for you 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.580
 make a small demonstration of the census 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.580
 the parking lot of the former Titan 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:32.439
 here in the case is a four-part sensor 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:32.439
 a ss 5800 model 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:50.260
 It's good that we have a manual with the 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.140
 description of the product is how to 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.940
 put in the car okay I'll give attention 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.940
 Special 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:03.580
 here the detection area goes from 0.2 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.229
 meters that would be 20 centimeters 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:11.400
 meter and a half of ok in the box comes with a 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.400
 drill for the cup 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.720
 you're able to stick to the shock 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.860
 this is the lcd display that goes on a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.259
 car or on the rear view mirror 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.399
 Where do you prefer where it's best 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.470
 for you 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.470
 here we have the indication of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.350
 left side approach 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.210
 right he'll learn some led 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.580
 serve worked up i get started at 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.970
 yellow on green still by red 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.479
 here he informs the distance in 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.819
 meters are you the object is only 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.250
 remembering that when it shows that you 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.590
 it's 0 meters you're actually 30 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.369
 which is a distance of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.830
 security is that you connect in the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.299
 that the button to turn bpp off has 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.299
 people who do not like the beep 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.799
 here we have a way that module it 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.070
 It's in the trunk here. It's where it's at. 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:27.540
 connected the sensors 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.959
 the display is where e is fed the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.690
 system is here you will call 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.450
 in the back light of the vehicle here you go 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.900
 turning on the LCD display is on the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.790
 the corresponding sensors 1 2 3 and 4 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.040
 remembering that the count is always made 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.560
 from left to right so you go 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.780
 put in the car the count will be 1 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.780
 234 according to tac 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:06.460
 here we have the power wiring 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:10.150
 sic will're connected to the module and here 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.910
 wiring we train to portray the red 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:18.670
 goes in the positive of the back light with black and 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:21.820
 red goes on the negative let's go straight 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.770
 I know it's the sensor behind him. 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.200
 I have indicated what this means. 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.780
 side to kill himself or if he's going to stay 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.160
 exactly this way in the bumper 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:36.310
 with this part 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.050
 so it comes with the numbering in the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.890
 case of this sensor it comes with the 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.880
 numbering makes it easier 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.160
 we also have two tapes here 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.680
 double-sided to that here to 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.820
 access the module in the trunk and this 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.610
 here to attach the LCD display to the panel or 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.990
 where do you prefer 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.880
 good people, this is it, this is a 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.580
 small demonstration here of the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.070
 Stefhany's parking I'll do 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.410
 a video in the coming weeks of 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.540
 step-by-step installation of this sensor 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.090
 I'll show you how to do the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.850
 installation that is not complicated is 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.950
 super simple I'll be betting video 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.250
 so it's ok then if you want to follow 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.440
 Please sign below and 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.850
 please click also i like help 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:32.400
