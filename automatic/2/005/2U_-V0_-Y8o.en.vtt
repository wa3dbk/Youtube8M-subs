00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.760
 Good day dear 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.900
 needlewomen in this video tutorial will 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:23.200
 demonstrated knitting process 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:27.280
 crochet cord to it is also called 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:34.700
 double chain of air loops 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:42.550
 fit pretty easy looks 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:46.130
 this way and so usually we do 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.460
 one means 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.000
 loop tail while leaving 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:57.040
 small for this 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.860
 double tails need to be left 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.450
 long since will be used and 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:10.270
 thread coming from the ball 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:10.270
 and the thread of this tail and so we do 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.400
 we insert one loop 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.829
 thread coming from the cup is located here 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:39.319
 then we move 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:43.069
 so it's a ponytail 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:49.000
 this dance of the tail we seize the thread 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:49.000
 from crochet and crochet stretch and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:02:00.770
 loop formed then keep the thread from 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:04.420
 the ball we pick up the tail thread to 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:09.280
 it was arranged in this way and 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.280
 we stretch the thread coming from the ball and 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:22.569
 repeat the knitting 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:31.340
 double chains try 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:34.480
 the loops do the same in height and 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.480
 by density 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.299
 notturno chain on this side 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:52.349
 is formed and the chain is formed with this 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:54.609
 the parties thus perform 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:01.889
 required length 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:01.889
 lace or double chain call it 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.500
 be sure to keep in mind that the tail 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.110
 must be long 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.970
 as yarn consumption goes the same 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:25.050
 that with a tail that buying and so if you 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.380
