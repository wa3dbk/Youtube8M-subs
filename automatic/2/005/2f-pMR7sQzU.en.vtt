 this city there are products that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.110
 means that there is a 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.510
 a sort of passage of pipes 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.540
 underground that leads to beer at the bars 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.940
 of cities and this is an experiment 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.580

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.500
 fifth curiosity where beer was born e 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.440
 how long ago do you know but about 7 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.330
 thousand years ago in mesopotamia more or less 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.330
 indicatively in the area of ​​Iran 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.120
 the curious thing is that now in those 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.970
 areas there is forbidden to drink beer and those who 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.750
 drinks in addition to whipping he gets the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.330
 prison 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.090
 you know that beer was sponsored 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.209
 even in 4 thousand forward christ 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.850
 to find him an Italian archaeologist has 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.430
 practically made this discovery of 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.040
 an ebla tablet is called where 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.330
 it was said that in the city it came 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.180
 brewed beer think of beer 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.650
 moretti in 4 thousand forward christ 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:19.070
 there are more than 700 types of beers 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.989
 I will try the maximum 20 beer ago 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.200
 part of our history but even 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.590
 in the Middle Ages it was preferred to water 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.690
 because it gives a higher caloric intake 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.540
 precisely to water and therefore and in meals 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.790
 he often accompanied everything with the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.769
 beer and this is it and this was the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.590
 period of greatest explosion of the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.560
 in fact you could see beer practically 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.590
 so drinking beer is good they say 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.739
 of studies by some researchers who 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.720
 say they drink beer moderately 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.170
 increases the activity of the brain and the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.720
 neurons no you who are at the bar all the 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.450
 day you have a little with the bow do not say 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.010

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:06.280
 nation's most jola beer in the world to

 Already wrong budget is not Germany 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.590
 how often you think 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.430
 just think that the Czech Republic has 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.889
 the world record for beer drinkers 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.350
 per capita higher which means that 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.990
 a person who drinks beer in the 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.380
 Czech Republic can drink up to 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.360
 150 liters a year are so many e 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.090
 almost half a liter a day 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.850
 fuck the best thing is that in 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.810
 Italy we average about 30 of them 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.330
 liters per year 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.229
 and there are those who like China are 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.289
 around 40 liters then good job 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.690

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.700
