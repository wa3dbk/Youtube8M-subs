00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
lot of kales where people just sort of

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
lot of kales where people just sort of
strip<00:00:41.969> off<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> leaves<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:43.079> don't

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.100 
strip off the leaves and they don't
actually<00:00:43.680> eat<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:45.000> know<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> pro

stem<00:00:46.559> farm<00:00:47.129> we're<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.760> era<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.539> always

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
stem farm we're in this era we always

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.209 
stem farm we're in this era we always
use<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> stems<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> stems<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
use the stems I like the stems with the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.330 
use the stems I like the stems with the
chard<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:51.000> stems<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.739> collards<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.920> just

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
chard I like stems of collards I just

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.549 
chard I like stems of collards I just
sauteed<00:00:53.820> them<00:00:54.030> first<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:55.079> feel<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.410> it's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
sauteed them first and I feel like it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.750 
sauteed them first and I feel like it's
a<00:00:55.649> good<00:00:55.800> part<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> plant<00:00:56.340> with<00:00:56.489> lots<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
a good part of the plant with lots of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.279 
a good part of the plant with lots of
nutrients<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.300> why<00:00:57.480> would<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.809> waste<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
nutrients so why would you waste that

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.889 
nutrients so why would you waste that
part<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.820> winter<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.329> colder<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> gets

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
part so so in winter the colder it gets

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.920 
part so so in winter the colder it gets
is<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.289> true<00:01:01.500> I've<00:01:01.859> heard<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
is it true I've heard that that the the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.880 
is it true I've heard that that the the
leaves<00:01:04.140> get<00:01:04.350> more<00:01:04.530> tender<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.439> best<00:01:07.650> time<00:01:07.860> for

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
leaves get more tender the best time for

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.830 
leaves get more tender the best time for
kale<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> flavor<00:01:08.760> gets<00:01:09.090> sweeter<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.659> what

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
kale the flavor gets sweeter is what

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.420 
kale the flavor gets sweeter is what
happens<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.380> kales<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> whole

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
happens because kales and the whole

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
happens because kales and the whole
Brassica<00:01:11.880> family<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.600> something<00:01:13.320> like

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
Brassica family they have something like

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.399 
Brassica family they have something like
an<00:01:13.740> antifreeze<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.610> them<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.540> when<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
an antifreeze in them and so when the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.370 
an antifreeze in them and so when the
cold<00:01:16.650> kicks<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.700> turns<00:01:18.090> them<00:01:18.299> sweet<00:01:18.659> so

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
cold kicks in it turns them sweet so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
cold kicks in it turns them sweet so
that's<00:01:19.799> why<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> meet<00:01:20.340> kale<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.729> such<00:01:20.850> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that's why to meet kale is such a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.640 
that's why to meet kale is such a
perfect<00:01:21.180> winter<00:01:21.689> crop<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.229> opposed<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
perfect winter crop as opposed to a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.380 
perfect winter crop as opposed to a
summer<00:01:22.830> crop<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> doesn't<00:01:24.180> it's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
summer crop because it doesn't it's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.880 
summer crop because it doesn't it's
something<00:01:24.840> about<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.170> colder<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.500> weather

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
something about the colder the weather

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.890 
something about the colder the weather
the<00:01:26.189> more<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.400> activates<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.180> antifreeze

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the more it activates the antifreeze

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.160 
the more it activates the antifreeze
component<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> chemistry

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
component and I don't know the chemistry

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.569 
component and I don't know the chemistry
about<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:32.430> what

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
about that I just know that that's what

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.880 
about that I just know that that's what
makes<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.820> sweeter<00:01:33.119> mmm<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:34.380> really<00:01:34.740> sweet

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
makes it sweeter mmm that's really sweet

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.160 
makes it sweeter mmm that's really sweet
yeah<00:01:35.310> oh<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:35.579> gosh<00:01:35.759> yeah<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.900> abilities

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
yeah oh my gosh yeah and it's abilities

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530 
yeah oh my gosh yeah and it's abilities
and<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.619> brings<00:01:37.740> out<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> colors<00:01:38.340> too<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.360> this

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and it brings out the colors too so this

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.080 
and it brings out the colors too so this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
is the last annatto kale here so this is

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.080 
is the last annatto kale here so this is
a<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.689> different<00:01:42.930> kale<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:44.159> has<00:01:44.369> 12

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
a really different kale and this has 12

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.609 
a really different kale and this has 12
different<00:01:45.329> names<00:01:45.689> at<00:01:45.930> least<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.350> called

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
different names at least it's called

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.760 
different names at least it's called
black<00:01:46.979> kale<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.820> Nero<00:01:48.689> day<00:01:48.899> Toscano<00:01:49.409> or

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
black kale or Nero day Toscano or

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.789 
black kale or Nero day Toscano or
lacinato<00:01:50.340> or<00:01:50.759> Dino<00:01:51.090> kale<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.659> think<00:01:52.380> someone

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
lacinato or Dino kale I think someone

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.929 
lacinato or Dino kale I think someone
thinks<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.189> looks<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.490> little<00:01:53.579> bit<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
thinks it looks a little bit like a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.760 
thinks it looks a little bit like a
dinosaur<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:55.170> think<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.560> looks<00:01:55.680> like

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
dinosaur and it's I think it looks like

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.310 
dinosaur and it's I think it looks like
a<00:01:55.829> palm<00:01:56.159> tree<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.610> we're<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.390> keep<00:01:57.570> growing<00:01:57.840> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
a palm tree if we're to keep growing and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.359 
a palm tree if we're to keep growing and
you<00:01:58.380> keep<00:01:58.590> picking<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> bottom<00:01:59.189> leaves

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
you keep picking the bottom leaves

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.469 
you keep picking the bottom leaves
pretty<00:01:59.610> soon<00:01:59.790> you'd<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> palm<00:02:00.450> tree

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
pretty soon you'd have a palm tree

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.120 
pretty soon you'd have a palm tree
looking<00:02:00.930> thing<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.380> see<00:02:01.590> how<00:02:01.680> different<00:02:01.920> it

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
looking thing here see how different it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.630 
looking thing here see how different it
is<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.490> got<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:03.570> savoy<00:02:04.079> leaves<00:02:04.500> and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.360 

quite<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.270> different<00:02:08.630> flavor<00:02:08.900> -<00:02:09.290> yeah<00:02:09.560> it's<00:02:10.280> a
