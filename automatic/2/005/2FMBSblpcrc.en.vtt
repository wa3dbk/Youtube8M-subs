 Translator: TED Translators admin Checker: Anwar Dafa-Alla 

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:19.500
 571,230,000 pounds 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.410
 Of tissue paper 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.192
 They are used by Americans 

00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:25.123
 every year 

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:30.360
 If we can correct a wrong number 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.566
 There are 30 billion paper napkins used annually 

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.035
 If we can reduce that use 

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.335
 To one paper napkin per day for every citizen 

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:42.780
 The 571,230,000 pounds 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.984
 Of paper napkins will not accumulate every year 

00:00:45.984 --> 00:00:47.811
 We can do this 

00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:51.646
 There are many "cans / racks" tissue paper 

00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:53.349
 There is a folded like triangle 

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:56.168
 People usually consume two or three of them 

00:00:56.168 --> 00:00:59.906
 There is a type that does not contain a "cut" and you have to cut it strongly 

00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:02.702
 Pushing people to pull 1-2-3-4 and then cut it 

00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:04.132
 They consume a long paper napkin 

00:01:04.132 --> 00:01:06.412
 There is the type that includes "cutting track" 

00:01:06.412 --> 00:01:09.137
 People also consume 1-2-3-4 

00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:14.193
 Or there is the same type but it is recycled 

00:01:14.193 --> 00:01:17.246
 Which drives you to consume 5 because its absorption is less 

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:21.675
 The fact is that the process of drying hands 

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:23.254
 You can play them 

00:01:23.284 --> 00:01:25.633
 With one tissue only 

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.283
 So two words 

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:29.081
 I'll know this half 

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:31.540
 The word is "shaking" 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.749
 Let me hear the word from you 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:33.337
 Shake 

00:01:33.337 --> 00:01:34.362
 Louder voice 

00:01:34.362 --> 00:01:35.293
 Shake 

00:01:35.723 --> 00:01:36.728
 Your word is yours 

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:37.342
 Folding 

00:01:37.342 --> 00:01:38.779
 Folding 

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:39.671
 one more time 

00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:40.715
 Folding 

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:41.797
 Louder voice 

00:01:41.797 --> 00:01:42.386
 Shake 

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:43.518
 Folding 

00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:44.857
 Okay 

00:01:46.134 --> 00:01:47.644
 Here my hands are wet 

00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:48.785
 Shake 

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:51.825
 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12 

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:53.418
 Why 12 times 

00:01:53.418 --> 00:01:55.078
 Because there are 12 main tribes 

00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:56.613
 Tower of sight 

00:01:56.613 --> 00:01:58.045
 12 months 

00:01:58.045 --> 00:01:59.393
 What better say 

00:01:59.393 --> 00:02:02.424
 Is that the number 12 is the longest number that can be expressed in one word 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.995
 Tissue paper napkin 

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:09.212
 For his intransigence 

00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:14.791
 My hands became dry 

00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:19.726
 Shake 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.168
 Folding 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.327
 The type that does not have a cut 

00:02:28.327 --> 00:02:29.429
 Folding 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:30.683
 Folding is important 

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:34.595
 Because it allows for temporal disruption 

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:36.243
 You do not have to remember this part 

00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:38.039
 But trust me as well 

00:02:41.547 --> 00:02:42.397
 Shake 

00:02:46.012 --> 00:02:47.261
 Folding 

00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:51.352
 The type that has a cutting process 

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:55.877
 You know what's funny 

00:02:55.877 --> 00:02:57.566
 My hands are more dry than those 

00:02:57.566 --> 00:02:58.912
 Who use 2-3 paper tissues 

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.514
 Because they do not dry between the fingers 

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:02.385
 If you think this kind is not good 

00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:04.136
 Shake 

00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:07.296
 Folding 

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:13.654
 right Now 

00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:15.647
 There is this brilliant invention 

00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:17.962
 Who brings out your handkerchief as you move your hands down from it 

00:03:17.962 --> 00:03:21.883
 The paper napkin that comes out is very long 

00:03:21.883 --> 00:03:23.080
 Let me tell you a secret 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.484
 That I was fast enough 

00:03:24.484 --> 00:03:25.417
 Really fast 

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:27.236
 You can only use half a paper napkin 

00:03:27.236 --> 00:03:28.828
 I can prove that 

00:03:28.828 --> 00:03:31.401
 This is a paper napkin from the toilet in this building 

00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:34.612
 To cut it as soon as the device starts to remove it 

00:03:34.612 --> 00:03:35.986
 It is intelligent behavior 

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:38.303
 To use only half a paper napkin 

00:03:40.134 --> 00:03:41.055
 Shake 

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:44.701
 Folding 

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:56.159
 Let's say it all 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.001
 Shake 

00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:59.618
 Folding 

00:04:00.618 --> 00:04:02.487
 For the last day of your life 

00:04:02.487 --> 00:04:04.309
 Remember these words 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:07.387
 Every day you use a paper napkin 

00:04:07.387 --> 00:04:08.901
 And remember 

00:04:08.901 --> 00:04:10.509
 A paper napkin for each person 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.459
 for a year 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.194
 571,230,000 pounds of tissue paper 

00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:16.749
 Can be provided 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:17.680
 A figure that is not clear 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.028
 Next year I will talk about toilet wipes
