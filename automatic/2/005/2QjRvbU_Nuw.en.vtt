I think the thing that really defines

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.869 
I think the thing that really defines
League<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.620> Legends<00:00:49.949> from<00:00:50.190> from<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.670> character

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
characters one of the things we try to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.430 
characters one of the things we try to
avoid<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:05.039> the<00:01:05.750> cliche<00:01:06.750> you're<00:01:07.110> gonna<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.410> a
