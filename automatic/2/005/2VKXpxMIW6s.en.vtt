 hello people I'm giacomo and I give you the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.609
 welcome to this new installment of 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.250
 audio mania in the column that goes on the air 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.139
 every Monday around 11am where 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.910
 let's talk about how to improve the audio on 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.519
 sound and music within ours 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:25.080
 video but today not because there are i 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:26.180
 results of the contest initial meanwhile vi 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.800
 thank you for the great participation 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.160
 together we received and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.350
 rated 34 videos but before giving you the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.210
 name of the contest winner I want 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.410
 explain to you how i was evaluated 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.350
 your jobs 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.680
 we have analyzed three parameters 1 the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.930
 choice and / or composition of the music 2 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.180
 inserting sound effects or 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.730
 environmental effects based on what you do 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.559
 he saw the voice over on scene three 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.600
 or the voice over 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.789
 having said that I want to clarify that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.129
 none of the videos fully satisfied 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.710
 my expectations a tug of ears 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.690
 to all because in my opinion none of the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.659
 video is complete in all respects 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.970
 you have been lazy and now roll of 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.450
 drum or ring the trumpets I will decide 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.490
 then for the winner, indeed the winners 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.439
 which are the boys of flowers frames i 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.600
 free frames have inserted music 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.880
 appropriate a voiceover and original e 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.380
 funny even if from the point of view 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.270
 of his years they could have done 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.630
 much more like most of 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.610
 you 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 I had thought of making a video where 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.780
 I talked about each of you individually 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.310
 work but I realized that I saw the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.229
 large number of videos probably 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.979
 a feature would have come out 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.600
 worthy of the master woman so I will put 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.939
 the average of the votes of all 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.920
 participants in description and rest a 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.720
 arrangement both on facebook and on 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.630

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.450
