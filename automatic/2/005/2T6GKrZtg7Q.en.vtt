00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
now I'm going to use another bowl with

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.920 
now I'm going to use another bowl with
something<00:01:32.740> else<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.220> it<00:01:33.400> for<00:01:34.090> five<00:01:34.390> minutes<00:01:34.750> in

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
the microwave as the direct antidote to

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.550 
the microwave as the direct antidote to
the<00:01:38.170> mess<00:01:38.350> I<00:01:38.590> just<00:01:39.100> created<00:01:39.670> with<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.240> ravioli

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the mess I just created with the ravioli

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.770 
the mess I just created with the ravioli
so<00:01:41.560> all<00:01:41.740> you'll<00:01:41.890> do<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.400> take<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.850> bowl<00:01:43.119> fill<00:01:43.630> it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
so all you'll do is take a bowl fill it

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.800 
so all you'll do is take a bowl fill it
about<00:01:43.900> half<00:01:44.290> way<00:01:44.560> with<00:01:44.590> water<00:01:45.030> cut<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.210> lemon<00:01:46.570> in

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
about half way with water cut a lemon in

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.980 
about half way with water cut a lemon in
half<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.080> then<00:01:47.650> juice<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.369> lemon<00:01:48.760> into<00:01:49.300> the

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
half and then juice the lemon into the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.790 
half and then juice the lemon into the
bowl<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:51.430> you'll<00:01:52.300> pop<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:53.200> in<00:01:53.740> the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
bowl then you'll pop this in the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.090 
bowl then you'll pop this in the
microwave<00:01:54.160> for<00:01:57.840> five<00:01:58.840> minutes<00:01:59.290> and<00:01:59.590> you're

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
microwave for five minutes and you're

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.429 
microwave for five minutes and you're
going<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.520> give<00:02:00.670> your<00:02:00.820> microwave<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.690> facial

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.219 

the<00:02:08.130> reason<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.610> works<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.030> well<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.660> because

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the reason this works so well is because

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.979 
the reason this works so well is because
the<00:02:10.739> lemon<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> water<00:02:11.640> creates<00:02:12.270> steam<00:02:12.660> in

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
the lemon and the water creates steam in

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.140 
the lemon and the water creates steam in
this<00:02:13.230> contained<00:02:13.920> chamber<00:02:14.459> we<00:02:14.730> call<00:02:14.970> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
this contained chamber we call a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.080 
this contained chamber we call a
microwave<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:16.349> five<00:02:16.739> minutes<00:02:17.130> all<00:02:17.640> this

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
microwave for five minutes all this

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.809 
microwave for five minutes all this
concoction<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.930> doing<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.519> clinging<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
concoction is doing is clinging to the

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.390 
concoction is doing is clinging to the
walls<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.989> dirt<00:02:22.200> breaking<00:02:23.069> it<00:02:23.190> down

walls and the dirt breaking it down

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.000
