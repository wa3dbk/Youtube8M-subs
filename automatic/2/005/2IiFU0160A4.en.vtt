00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 are therefore here and now were also the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.970
 I also go the three most common 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.069
 therefore many people do not cause 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.940
 Deep knee can want first of all 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.949
 a deep squat requires that one 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.029
 sufficiently flexible in the jump joint 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:22.500
 hip joint is and the thoracic spine 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.760
 the thoracic bone can move through 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.410
 but can push forward from below 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.710
 above in front and drive at the jump joint 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.010
 is said to be the first articular mobility 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.100
 is needed so that you thanks deeper 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.629
 the children are slowly moving forward 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.670
 can push if you can not it 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:49.469
 here has a riser agility 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.809
 is it this already hot area on 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.140
 and does not get deeper at just too 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.199
 rises from being and we can not 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.530
 go forward what is necessary to 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.500
 the hip and the CNNIC level continues 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.020
 to sing down 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.900
 motion limitation number two man in 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.380
 air dreams agility hip flexors 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.570
 Activation and that sees it then 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.990
 most of the time you do not feel like you are here 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.920
 can bend the move mainly in 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.479
 lower area always unheard of and 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.869
 nations of the world are delivered by 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.360
 the squat gets mainly through it 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 limits that threatens backwards 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.740
 attacked and the balance 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.009
 lose if he is able to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.450
 to bow this sport bust 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.450
 you come over this point 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:50.009
 Imitation number three my route 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.079
 Skills are supposed to be the image defect 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.119
 looks something like the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.670
 marienhof agility and that soon 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:02.189
 the down move here, however, 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.659
 delivered primarily in the bus section 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.450
 sit 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.219
 the picture has and back over about 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.950
 celebrate 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:12.860
 Instead, consciously do sol rausstrecken 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.080
 and then most of them come a bit 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.120
 Lower down that one the three 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.580
 most common causes why many 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.840
 people can not frivolous and 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.299
 in the next episode, I'll show you 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.370
 then the three best exercises for everyone 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.459
 range an exercise like this 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.030
 can address the limitations 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.030
 until next time
