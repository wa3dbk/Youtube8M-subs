00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.180 
those there are some different mode
options<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:26.260> your<00:02:26.380> brightness<00:02:26.800> settings

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
options and your brightness settings

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.390 
options and your brightness settings
will<00:02:27.400> actually<00:02:27.850> control<00:02:28.300> your<00:02:28.330> speed<00:02:29.400> when

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
will actually control your speed when

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.070 
will actually control your speed when
you're<00:02:30.550> in<00:02:30.700> one<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:30.940> these<00:02:31.120> modes<00:02:33.960> go<00:02:34.960> ahead

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
you're in one of these modes go ahead

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.620 
you're in one of these modes go ahead
and<00:02:35.200> try<00:02:35.410> another<00:02:35.620> one<00:02:35.860> here<00:02:38.820> now<00:02:39.820> cycles

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
and try another one here now cycles

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.040 
and try another one here now cycles
through<00:02:40.840> all<00:02:40.990> your<00:02:41.140> colors<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:43.420> last<00:02:43.660> one<00:02:43.930> is

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
through all your colors the last one is

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.510 
through all your colors the last one is
just<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.790> quick<00:02:45.790> strobe<00:02:46.240> effect<00:02:46.800> which<00:02:47.800> if<00:02:48.220> you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
just a quick strobe effect which if you

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.990 
just a quick strobe effect which if you
turn<00:02:48.730> all<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.030> way<00:02:49.150> up<00:02:49.770> gets<00:02:50.770> kind<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.010> crazy

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.850 

and<00:02:55.000> turn<00:02:55.480> that<00:02:55.660> back<00:02:55.900> down<00:02:56.140> here<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:56.620> we<00:02:56.709> can

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
and turn that back down here so we can

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.220 
and turn that back down here so we can
see<00:02:57.040> with<00:02:57.250> actually<00:02:57.790> what's<00:02:57.970> happening<00:02:58.420> you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
see with actually what's happening you

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.220 
see with actually what's happening you
can<00:02:59.410> actually<00:02:59.560> slow<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.070> down<00:03:00.160> quite<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.150> bit<00:03:03.060> so

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
can actually slow it down quite a bit so

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.090 
can actually slow it down quite a bit so
pretty<00:03:05.230> cool<00:03:05.410> little<00:03:05.680> system<00:03:10.860> not<00:03:11.860> really

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
pretty cool little system not really

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.340 
pretty cool little system not really
super<00:03:12.370> hard<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.850> install<00:03:15.120> just

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
super hard to install just

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.280 
super hard to install just
time-consuming<00:03:18.150> got<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.269> be<00:03:19.360> tedious<00:03:19.660> work<00:03:21.120> so

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
time-consuming got to be tedious work so

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.600 
time-consuming got to be tedious work so
go<00:03:23.290> ahead<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.500> get<00:03:23.590> some<00:03:23.739> lights<00:03:24.040> turn<00:03:24.340> back

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
go ahead and get some lights turn back

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.050 
go ahead and get some lights turn back
on<00:03:24.850> here<00:03:26.100> alright<00:03:27.100> got<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.550> lights<00:03:27.760> turned

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
on here alright got the lights turned

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.550 
on here alright got the lights turned
back<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.300> here<00:03:28.810> we'll<00:03:28.989> go<00:03:29.080> ahead<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.320> sit<00:03:29.530> down

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
back on here we'll go ahead and sit down

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.100 
back on here we'll go ahead and sit down
and<00:03:30.040> kind<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.370> see<00:03:31.030> what<00:03:31.239> we<00:03:31.390> had<00:03:31.600> going<00:03:31.870> on

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
and kind of see what we had going on

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.380 
and kind of see what we had going on
here<00:03:32.560> go<00:03:32.980> ahead<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.370> turn<00:03:33.820> these<00:03:34.090> off<00:03:34.120> so

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
here go ahead and turn these off so

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.870 
here go ahead and turn these off so
basically<00:03:37.390> what<00:03:37.540> they<00:03:37.690> are<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:38.670> just<00:03:39.670> much

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
basically what they are is just much

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.030 
basically what they are is just much
LEDs<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.950> they<00:03:42.850> are<00:03:43.000> fastened<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:44.049> as<00:03:44.950> you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
LEDs and they are fastened to it as you

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.210 
LEDs and they are fastened to it as you
can<00:03:45.190> see<00:03:46.019> they're<00:03:47.019> not<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.350> permanent<00:03:47.950> fixture

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
can see they're not a permanent fixture

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.009 
can see they're not a permanent fixture
but<00:03:48.489> they're<00:03:48.640> not<00:03:48.790> just<00:03:48.970> gonna<00:03:49.150> fall<00:03:49.450> off<00:03:49.690> from

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
but they're not just gonna fall off from

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.140 
but they're not just gonna fall off from
normal<00:03:50.830> day<00:03:50.980> driving<00:03:51.340> or<00:03:51.640> anything<00:03:51.820> like<00:03:52.030> that

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
normal day driving or anything like that

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.460 
normal day driving or anything like that
so<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.480> don't<00:03:52.630> have<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.870> worry<00:03:53.019> about<00:03:53.140> that

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
so you don't have to worry about that

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.920 
so you don't have to worry about that
they<00:03:53.890> won't<00:03:54.070> come<00:03:54.280> off<00:03:54.310> unless<00:03:54.640> you<00:03:54.930> actually

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
they won't come off unless you actually

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.570 
they won't come off unless you actually
take<00:03:56.200> them<00:03:56.410> off<00:03:58.799> did<00:03:59.799> take<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.100> wiring<00:04:00.310> and

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
take them off did take the wiring and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.830 
take them off did take the wiring and
actually<00:04:00.940> tuck<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.299> through<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.570> original

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
actually tuck it through the original

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.710 
actually tuck it through the original
housing<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:03.400> way<00:04:03.580> it's<00:04:03.730> not<00:04:03.970> wrapped<00:04:04.540> around

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
housing that way it's not wrapped around

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.500 
housing that way it's not wrapped around
the<00:04:04.989> sides<00:04:05.260> here<00:04:05.650> anywhere<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:07.180> when<00:04:07.390> you're

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
the sides here anywhere so when you're

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.539 
the sides here anywhere so when you're
actually<00:04:07.690> installed<00:04:08.650> back<00:04:08.920> into<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.310> car

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
actually installed back into the car

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.880 
actually installed back into the car
there's<00:04:09.880> no<00:04:10.060> visible<00:04:10.510> wires<00:04:10.810> running<00:04:11.320> out<00:04:11.830> of

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
there's no visible wires running out of

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.490 
there's no visible wires running out of
the<00:04:12.250> front<00:04:12.519> of<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.730> housing<00:04:13.269> they<00:04:13.450> all<00:04:13.570> do

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
the front of the housing they all do

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.159 
the front of the housing they all do
come<00:04:14.650> out<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:14.980> rear<00:04:15.160> of<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.370> housing<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.750> just

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
come out the rear of the housing so just

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.039 
come out the rear of the housing so just
a<00:04:17.229> little<00:04:17.320> bit<00:04:17.530> cleaner<00:04:18.690> compared<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.810> some<00:04:19.959> of

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
a little bit cleaner compared to some of

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.610 
a little bit cleaner compared to some of
the<00:04:20.080> other<00:04:20.260> things<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.739> I've<00:04:20.859> seen<00:04:21.039> online

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.830 

kids<00:04:24.620> probably<00:04:24.920> will<00:04:25.790> probably<00:04:26.240> sell<00:04:26.510> them<00:04:26.660> if

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
kids probably will probably sell them if

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.740 
kids probably will probably sell them if
you<00:04:26.960> want<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.230> self<00:04:27.500> install<00:04:28.040> for<00:04:28.970> 150<00:04:29.720> bucks

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
you want to self install for 150 bucks

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.220 
you want to self install for 150 bucks
if<00:04:30.500> you<00:04:30.680> want<00:04:30.860> us<00:04:31.010> to<00:04:31.220> install<00:04:31.490> them<00:04:32.140> we'll<00:04:33.140> do

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
if you want us to install them we'll do

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.460 
if you want us to install them we'll do
the<00:04:33.350> whole<00:04:33.470> thing<00:04:33.530> for<00:04:34.070> probably<00:04:35.030> 250<00:04:35.470> again

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
the whole thing for probably 250 again

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.290 
the whole thing for probably 250 again
just<00:04:36.920> because<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.310> is<00:04:37.460> tedious<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:38.180> is

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
just because it is tedious it is

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.050 
just because it is tedious it is
time-consuming<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:40.130> do<00:04:40.250> actually<00:04:40.430> have<00:04:40.790> to

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
time-consuming you do actually have to

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.800 
time-consuming you do actually have to
you<00:04:42.050> know<00:04:42.140> bake<00:04:42.800> these<00:04:43.040> in<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.460> oven<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:44.120> be

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
you know bake these in the oven to be

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.350 
you know bake these in the oven to be
able<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:45.020> get<00:04:45.170> these<00:04:45.320> off<00:04:45.590> because<00:04:45.890> this<00:04:46.760> glue

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
able to get these off because this glue

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.080 
able to get these off because this glue
from<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.750> factories<00:04:48.260> in<00:04:48.440> there<00:04:48.590> pretty<00:04:48.770> good

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
from the factories in there pretty good

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.180 
from the factories in there pretty good
so<00:04:51.760> you<00:04:52.760> can't<00:04:53.000> do<00:04:53.120> damage<00:04:53.680> if<00:04:54.680> you're<00:04:55.010> not

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
so you can't do damage if you're not
