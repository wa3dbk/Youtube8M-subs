one of the ones were going to be taking

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.569 
one of the ones were going to be taking
a<00:00:30.269> look<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:31.140> epic<00:00:31.380> oh<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.369> an

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
a look at it is epic oh and this is an

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.120 
a look at it is epic oh and this is an
abstract<00:00:33.450> by<00:00:33.600> masquerade<00:00:34.350> games<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
abstract by masquerade games and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.790 
abstract by masquerade games and
masquerade<00:00:35.969> games<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.600> small<00:00:37.320> company<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.739> think

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
masquerade games a small company I think

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.260 
masquerade games a small company I think
they<00:00:38.010> only<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.370> two<00:00:38.520> products<00:00:38.969> out<00:00:39.090> right

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
they only have two products out right

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.299 
they only have two products out right
now<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.960> they've<00:00:40.110> made<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.440> abstract<00:00:41.010> for

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
now but they've made this abstract for

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.490 
now but they've made this abstract for
two<00:00:41.760> or<00:00:41.969> four<00:00:42.000> players<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.809> plays<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.320> about

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
two or four players that plays in about

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.709 
two or four players that plays in about
fifteen<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.129> thirty<00:00:44.160> minutes<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.969> just

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
fifteen to thirty minutes I just

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.690 
fifteen to thirty minutes I just
suggested<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.320> ages<00:00:46.530> 13<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> think

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
suggested for ages 13 up but I think

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.340 
suggested for ages 13 up but I think
could<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:47.910> played<00:00:48.120> by<00:00:48.360> somebody<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> lot

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
could be played by somebody a lot

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
could be played by somebody a lot
younger<00:00:49.620> than<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.180> it's<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> pretty<00:00:51.360> good

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
younger than that it's a pretty good

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.819 
younger than that it's a pretty good
game<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.020> why<00:00:52.140> don't<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.320> take<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> look<00:00:52.680> at

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
game so why don't we take a look at

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.380 
game so why don't we take a look at
what's<00:00:52.980> inside<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.489> box<00:00:53.760> how<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> game

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
what's inside this box how the game

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.810 
what's inside this box how the game
plays<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:55.440> my<00:00:55.680> final<00:00:55.980> thoughts<00:00:56.370> are<00:00:56.579> on

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
plays and what my final thoughts are on

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.020 
plays and what my final thoughts are on
it<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.809> product<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> basic

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
it as a product so here we see the basic

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.540 
it as a product so here we see the basic
board<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.199> piece<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> folding

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
board it's one piece it's not a folding

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.460 
board it's one piece it's not a folding
board<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.149> nice<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.600> solid<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.080> fancy

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
board it's it's nice and solid and fancy

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.899 
board it's it's nice and solid and fancy
I<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
I like it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.609 
I like it

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
everything and you know a good

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.170 
everything and you know a good
utilization<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> space<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.400> what<00:01:12.060> we

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
utilization of the space and what we

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.050 
utilization of the space and what we
have<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.900> both<00:01:13.710> players<00:01:14.100> set<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
have here is both players set up in the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.910 
have here is both players set up in the
central<00:01:15.450> line<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> board<00:01:16.110> now<00:01:16.590> usually

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
central line of the board now usually

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.140 
central line of the board now usually
the<00:01:17.040> players<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:17.490> paste<00:01:17.700> these<00:01:17.880> pieces

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the players will paste these pieces

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.300 
the players will paste these pieces
facedown<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.590> other<00:01:19.740> player<00:01:19.920> doesn't

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
facedown so the other player doesn't

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.950 
facedown so the other player doesn't
know<00:01:20.430> where<00:01:20.700> they're<00:01:20.939> placing<00:01:21.390> their<00:01:21.540> pieces

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
know where they're placing their pieces

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
know where they're placing their pieces
and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.560> after<00:01:22.950> they're<00:01:23.040> both<00:01:23.189> place<00:01:23.460> they

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and then after they're both place they

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.749 
and then after they're both place they
flip<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.200> X's<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:26.130> removed<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
flip up and the X's get removed so

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
flip up and the X's get removed so
they're<00:01:26.909> going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.180> leave<00:01:27.330> blank<00:01:27.720> spots<00:01:28.110> on

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
they're going to leave blank spots on

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
they're going to leave blank spots on
the<00:01:28.530> board<00:01:28.880> now<00:01:29.880> that's<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> whole<00:01:30.390> setup<00:01:30.659> for

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the board now that's the whole setup for

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.810 
the board now that's the whole setup for
the<00:01:30.960> game<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.860> idea<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.460> game<00:01:32.700> is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the game and the idea of this game is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.679 
the game and the idea of this game is
that<00:01:32.939> you're<00:01:33.030> trying<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.360> push<00:01:33.540> your

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that you're trying to push your

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.270 
that you're trying to push your
opponent's<00:01:34.079> pieces<00:01:34.350> off<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.799> board<00:01:35.040> so

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
opponent's pieces off of the board so

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.249 
opponent's pieces off of the board so
you<00:01:35.729> know<00:01:35.850> maybe<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.110> player

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you know maybe one or the right player

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.510 
you know maybe one or the right player
wants<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.310> push

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
wants to get this up here and then push

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.880 
wants to get this up here and then push
the<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.299> off<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.720> board<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.710> whole

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the one off of the board and the whole

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.319 
the one off of the board and the whole
idea<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.460> you're<00:01:41.759> trying<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.090> collect

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
idea is that you're trying to collect

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.810 
idea is that you're trying to collect
three<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.960> your<00:01:43.140> opponent's<00:01:43.560> pieces<00:01:43.820> now

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
three of your opponent's pieces now

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.639 
three of your opponent's pieces now
you're<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.570> by<00:01:45.810> playing<00:01:46.079> tiles

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you're going to do this by playing tiles

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
you're going to do this by playing tiles
and<00:01:46.829> you'll<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.520> they<00:01:47.640> come<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:47.880> tiles

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and you'll see that they come with tiles

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.270 
and you'll see that they come with tiles
they<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> numbers<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.950> them<00:01:50.100> so

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
they have all the numbers on them so

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.719 
they have all the numbers on them so
seven<00:01:50.670> four<00:01:51.030> six<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.950> all<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.310> arrows

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
seven four six and they all have arrows

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.700 
seven four six and they all have arrows
pointing<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.750> arrows<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> use

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
pointing and the arrows when you use

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.020 
pointing and the arrows when you use
these<00:01:55.860> tiles<00:01:56.219> are<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> determine<00:01:56.729> which

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
these tiles are going to determine which

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.730 
these tiles are going to determine which
way<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.990> move<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.680> if

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
way you're going to move this so if

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.810 
way you're going to move this so if
we're<00:01:58.829> looking<00:01:58.979> from<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> red<00:01:59.549> player's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
we're looking from the red player's

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.700 
we're looking from the red player's
perspective<00:02:00.090> let's<00:02:00.659> look<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.960> way<00:02:01.170> this

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
perspective let's look this way this

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.679 
perspective let's look this way this
would<00:02:01.920> mean<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.759> seven<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
would mean that the seven is going to

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.440 
would mean that the seven is going to
move<00:02:03.899> forward<00:02:04.649> or<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.969> turn<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.329> way

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
move forward or if I turn it this way

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.839 
move forward or if I turn it this way
the<00:02:06.750> seven<00:02:07.049> would<00:02:07.229> move<00:02:07.409> left<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:08.009> right<00:02:08.580> or

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
the seven would move left or right or

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.700 
the seven would move left or right or
back

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
back

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.770 
back
the<00:02:09.860> case<00:02:10.040> may<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:10.700> each<00:02:11.390> term<00:02:11.600> you're

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
the case may be so each term you're

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.510 
the case may be so each term you're
going<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.990> choose<00:02:12.230> three<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.680> these<00:02:12.830> tiles<00:02:13.130> and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
going to choose three of these tiles and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.550 
going to choose three of these tiles and
you're<00:02:13.910> going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.150> stack<00:02:14.390> them<00:02:14.600> so<00:02:14.630> I've<00:02:15.320> got

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
you're going to stack them so I've got

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.320 
you're going to stack them so I've got
some<00:02:15.800> pre<00:02:16.040> stacked<00:02:16.340> let's<00:02:16.640> say<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.820> chose<00:02:17.120> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
some pre stacked let's say I chose the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.020 
some pre stacked let's say I chose the
seven<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:18.230> go<00:02:18.350> forward<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.010> then<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.610> four<00:02:19.850> to

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
seven to go forward and then the four to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.360 
seven to go forward and then the four to
go<00:02:20.180> right<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.290> six<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.680> go<00:02:21.800> forward<00:02:22.250> and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
go right and the six to go forward and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.860 
go right and the six to go forward and
you're<00:02:22.730> going<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:22.910> resolve<00:02:23.270> these<00:02:23.510> from<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
you're going to resolve these from the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.300 
you're going to resolve these from the
top<00:02:24.080> down<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.590> six<00:02:24.800> would<00:02:24.890> go<00:02:25.010> forward

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
top down so the six would go forward

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.100 
top down so the six would go forward
then<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.730> four<00:02:25.940> would<00:02:26.060> go<00:02:26.210> right<00:02:26.420> then<00:02:26.960> the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
then the four would go right then the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.280 
then the four would go right then the
seven<00:02:27.410> would<00:02:27.530> go<00:02:27.680> forward<00:02:28.130> now<00:02:29.020> both<00:02:30.020> players

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
seven would go forward now both players

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.840 
seven would go forward now both players
are<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.860> choose<00:02:31.040> these<00:02:31.280> at<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.670> same

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
are going to choose these at the same

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.790 
are going to choose these at the same
time<00:02:32.210> so<00:02:32.810> both<00:02:32.990> players<00:02:33.260> here<00:02:33.500> have<00:02:33.590> chosen

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
time so both players here have chosen

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.530 
time so both players here have chosen
them<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.790> top<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.330> they

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
them and on the top of this they

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.480 
them and on the top of this they
actually<00:02:35.660> have<00:02:35.990> a<00:02:36.200> blank<00:02:36.710> tile<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.250> can

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
actually have a blank tile that you can

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.150 
actually have a blank tile that you can
put<00:02:37.670> down<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:38.180> cover<00:02:38.390> up<00:02:38.690> your<00:02:38.870> choices<00:02:39.230> if<00:02:40.040> you

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
put down to cover up your choices if you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.980 
put down to cover up your choices if you
finish<00:02:40.460> before<00:02:40.580> your<00:02:40.880> opponent<00:02:41.270> so<00:02:41.690> we<00:02:41.810> put

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
finish before your opponent so we put

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.560 
finish before your opponent so we put
that<00:02:42.140> on<00:02:42.200> top<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:43.460> at<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.790> same<00:02:44.000> time<00:02:44.300> both

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
that on top and at the same time both

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.910 
that on top and at the same time both
players<00:02:44.870> are<00:02:45.050> going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.260> reveal<00:02:45.470> their<00:02:45.680> tiles

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
players are going to reveal their tiles

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.310 
players are going to reveal their tiles
so<00:02:46.310> red<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.270> white<00:02:47.480> would<00:02:47.660> both<00:02:47.870> pull<00:02:48.170> off

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
so red and white would both pull off

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.380 
so red and white would both pull off
their<00:02:48.500> top<00:02:48.710> tile<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.280> they've<00:02:49.820> both<00:02:50.030> played

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
their top tile and they've both played

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.790 
their top tile and they've both played
the<00:02:50.540> five<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.140> they<00:02:51.200> both<00:02:51.380> play<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> five

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
the five and they both play the five

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
the five and they both play the five
looking<00:02:52.070> forward<00:02:52.370> now<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.490> direction

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
looking forward now the direction

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.180 
looking forward now the direction
doesn't<00:02:53.300> matter<00:02:53.480> here<00:02:53.780> especially<00:02:54.440> since<00:02:54.830> it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
doesn't matter here especially since it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.010 
doesn't matter here especially since it
both<00:02:55.370> players<00:02:55.760> play<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.060> same<00:02:56.360> tile<00:02:56.690> at<00:02:56.930> the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
both players play the same tile at the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.110 
both players play the same tile at the
same<00:02:57.260> time<00:02:57.590> so<00:02:58.340> both<00:02:58.550> players<00:02:58.700> played<00:02:59.000> the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
same time so both players played the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.210 
same time so both players played the
five<00:02:59.270> first<00:02:59.540> neither<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.590> them<00:03:00.710> gets<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.980> do

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
five first neither of them gets to do

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.250 
five first neither of them gets to do
that<00:03:01.400> do<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.730> movement<00:03:02.270> so<00:03:02.420> these<00:03:02.900> two<00:03:03.110> would

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
that do that movement so these two would

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.630 
that do that movement so these two would
cancel<00:03:03.440> out<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:03.890> we'd<00:03:03.980> move<00:03:04.100> out<00:03:04.280> move<00:03:04.430> on<00:03:04.580> to

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
cancel out and we'd move out move on to

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.000 
cancel out and we'd move out move on to
the<00:03:04.730> next<00:03:04.850> movement<00:03:05.290> next<00:03:06.290> we<00:03:06.410> see<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.890> the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
the next movement next we see that the

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.070 
the next movement next we see that the
red<00:03:07.160> player<00:03:07.430> has<00:03:07.970> played<00:03:08.270> as<00:03:08.420> three<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.930> move

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
red player has played as three to move

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.220 
red player has played as three to move
left<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:11.180> white<00:03:11.390> player<00:03:11.660> has<00:03:11.870> played<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
left and the white player has played the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.670

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
a bad move to make because obviously

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.330 
a bad move to make because obviously
your<00:03:51.440> opponent's<00:03:51.740> trying<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:51.980> collect<00:03:52.160> three

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
your opponent's trying to collect three

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.250 
your opponent's trying to collect three
of<00:03:52.490> these<00:03:52.610> pieces<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.120> six<00:03:53.390> has<00:03:53.540> now<00:03:53.690> pushed

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
of these pieces so six has now pushed

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.780 
of these pieces so six has now pushed
one<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.560> their<00:03:54.680> own<00:03:54.830> pieces<00:03:55.190> off<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.610> board

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
one of their own pieces off of the board

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.600 
one of their own pieces off of the board
and<00:03:56.570> it<00:03:56.900> goes<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.290> red<00:03:57.470> player<00:03:57.710> two<00:03:58.430> now

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
and it goes to the red player two now

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.370 
and it goes to the red player two now
moves<00:03:58.940> forward<00:03:59.330> pushing<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.930> white<00:04:00.110> players

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
moves forward pushing the white players

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.250 
moves forward pushing the white players
to<00:04:00.650> forward<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:02.480> that's<00:04:02.660> kind<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.110> game

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
to forward so that's kind of the game

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.590 
to forward so that's kind of the game
now<00:04:03.550> as<00:04:04.550> I<00:04:04.760> said<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.060> objective<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.570> to

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
now as I said the objective is to

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.450 
now as I said the objective is to
capture<00:04:06.140> three<00:04:06.500> of<00:04:06.590> your<00:04:06.710> opponent's<00:04:07.070> pieces

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
capture three of your opponent's pieces

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.480 
capture three of your opponent's pieces
and<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:08.270> can<00:04:08.450> do<00:04:08.570> some<00:04:08.840> pushing<00:04:09.220> by<00:04:10.220> pushing

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
and you can do some pushing by pushing

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.860 
and you can do some pushing by pushing
your<00:04:10.790> opponent's<00:04:11.090> pieces<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.600> can<00:04:11.720> try

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
your opponent's pieces and you can try

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.630 
your opponent's pieces and you can try
and<00:04:11.900> push<00:04:12.110> multiple<00:04:12.500> at<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.650> same<00:04:12.830> time<00:04:13.100> but

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
and push multiple at the same time but

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.420 
and push multiple at the same time but
for<00:04:13.880> example<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.750> two<00:04:14.990> for<00:04:15.350> red<00:04:15.530> could<00:04:16.220> not

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
for example the two for red could not

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.849 
for example the two for red could not
now<00:04:16.700> move<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.600> red<00:04:17.750> players<00:04:18.049> left<00:04:18.350> because

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
now move to the red players left because

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.890 
now move to the red players left because
there<00:04:19.100> are<00:04:19.220> too<00:04:19.430> many<00:04:19.580> white<00:04:20.150> pieces<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.690> push

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
there are too many white pieces to push

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.220 
there are too many white pieces to push
and<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.560> can<00:04:21.680> only<00:04:21.830> push

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
and you can only push

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.050 
and you can only push
many<00:04:22.470> of<00:04:22.710> your<00:04:22.800> opposing<00:04:23.220> colors<00:04:23.460> pieces<00:04:23.880> as

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
many of your opposing colors pieces as

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.510 
many of your opposing colors pieces as
you<00:04:24.570> are<00:04:24.690> using<00:04:24.930> pieces<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.530> push<00:04:25.740> with<00:04:25.980> so

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
you are using pieces to push with so

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.190 
you are using pieces to push with so
this<00:04:26.700> too<00:04:26.970> can't<00:04:27.360> push<00:04:27.540> all<00:04:27.690> three<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:28.050> these

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
this too can't push all three of these

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.200 
this too can't push all three of these
and<00:04:28.440> even<00:04:29.040> if<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.250> three<00:04:29.520> push<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.030> two

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
and even if the three push to the two

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.520 
and even if the three push to the two
they<00:04:30.480> still<00:04:30.720> can't<00:04:30.960> push<00:04:31.140> them<00:04:31.230> because

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
they still can't push them because

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.380 
they still can't push them because
there's<00:04:31.710> more<00:04:31.920> whites<00:04:32.220> than<00:04:32.760> there<00:04:33.000> are<00:04:33.030> Reds

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
there's more whites than there are Reds

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.660 
there's more whites than there are Reds
if<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.590> case<00:04:34.800> were<00:04:35.010> that<00:04:35.190> there<00:04:35.340> were<00:04:35.430> three

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
if the case were that there were three

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.120 
if the case were that there were three
pieces<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.360> can<00:04:36.540> now<00:04:36.690> do<00:04:36.750> this<00:04:37.140> push<00:04:37.410> as<00:04:37.620> three

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
pieces you can now do this push as three

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.100 
pieces you can now do this push as three
pieces<00:04:38.370> can<00:04:38.700> push<00:04:38.910> three<00:04:39.180> pieces<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
pieces can push three pieces and the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.200 
pieces can push three pieces and the
resulting<00:04:40.650> move<00:04:40.860> would<00:04:41.490> look<00:04:41.700> at<00:04:41.820> something

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
resulting move would look at something

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.560 
resulting move would look at something
like<00:04:42.240> this<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:44.310> game<00:04:44.520> ends<00:04:44.940> when<00:04:45.000> one<00:04:45.150> player

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
like this the game ends when one player

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.060 
like this the game ends when one player
has<00:04:45.720> collected<00:04:45.930> three<00:04:46.410> pieces<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.860> their

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
has collected three pieces of their

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.920 
has collected three pieces of their
opponent's<00:04:47.460> color<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:47.940> obviously<00:04:48.660> that

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
opponent's color and obviously that

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.890 
opponent's color and obviously that
player<00:04:49.200> is<00:04:49.230> now<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.530> winner<00:04:50.360> now<00:04:51.360> the

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
player is now the winner now the

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.140 
player is now the winner now the
interesting<00:04:52.230> part<00:04:52.530> about<00:04:52.620> this<00:04:52.830> game<00:04:52.890> is<00:04:53.370> one

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
interesting part about this game is one

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.210 
interesting part about this game is one
that<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.420> plays<00:04:54.570> very<00:04:54.810> quickly<00:04:55.080> too<00:04:55.830> that<00:04:56.100> you

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
that it plays very quickly too that you

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.620 
that it plays very quickly too that you
can<00:04:56.370> use<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.520> lot<00:04:56.730> of<00:04:56.760> strategy<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.390> trying<00:04:57.540> to

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
can use a lot of strategy and trying to

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.940 
can use a lot of strategy and trying to
predict<00:04:57.990> which<00:04:58.110> your<00:04:58.290> opponent<00:04:58.350> will<00:04:58.710> play<00:04:58.890> to

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
predict which your opponent will play to

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.040 
predict which your opponent will play to
cancel<00:04:59.490> out<00:04:59.610> their<00:04:59.790> movements<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.390> then<00:05:00.810> try

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
cancel out their movements and then try

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.140 
cancel out their movements and then try
and<00:05:01.080> make<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.350> future<00:05:01.500> movement<00:05:01.950> so<00:05:02.070> maybe<00:05:02.280> we

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
and make the future movement so maybe we

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.840 
and make the future movement so maybe we
have<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.570> twos<00:05:03.870> here<00:05:04.350> and<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:05.100> red<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.640> could

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
have the twos here and the red to could

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.280 
have the twos here and the red to could
push<00:05:06.060> off<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.720> white<00:05:07.350> two<00:05:08.030> so<00:05:09.030> obviously<00:05:09.420> the

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
push off the white two so obviously the

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.720 
push off the white two so obviously the
red<00:05:10.440> wants<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.800> play<00:05:10.950> a<00:05:10.980> two<00:05:11.250> with<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.520> whites

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
red wants to play a two with the whites

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.490 
red wants to play a two with the whites
also<00:05:11.970> going<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.420> play<00:05:12.570> their<00:05:12.840> two<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.230> stop

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
also going to play their two to stop

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.310 
also going to play their two to stop
that<00:05:13.740> movement<00:05:14.220> but<00:05:15.090> maybe<00:05:15.330> we<00:05:15.930> have<00:05:15.960> even

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
that movement but maybe we have even

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.130 
that movement but maybe we have even
even<00:05:16.680> worse<00:05:16.950> situation<00:05:17.610> here<00:05:17.820> and<00:05:17.970> that<00:05:18.540> these

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
even worse situation here and that these

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.380 
even worse situation here and that these
seven<00:05:19.560> could<00:05:19.710> push<00:05:19.890> off<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.250> two<00:05:20.430> as<00:05:20.640> could

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
seven could push off the two as could

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.900 
seven could push off the two as could
the<00:05:21.420> two<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:22.680> who<00:05:22.890> knows<00:05:23.070> if<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.580> red<00:05:23.730> player

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
the two so who knows if the red player

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.520 
the two so who knows if the red player
is<00:05:24.000> going<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.210> choose<00:05:24.420> seven<00:05:24.870> or<00:05:24.990> two<00:05:25.170> first

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
is going to choose seven or two first

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.230 
is going to choose seven or two first
and<00:05:25.740> it's<00:05:26.100> up<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.460> white<00:05:26.640> player<00:05:26.880> to<00:05:27.060> try

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
and it's up to the white player to try

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.890 
and it's up to the white player to try
and<00:05:27.360> figure<00:05:27.510> that<00:05:27.600> out

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
and figure that out

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.710 
and figure that out
so<00:05:28.500> maybe<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:29.580> white<00:05:29.820> player<00:05:30.060> plays<00:05:30.360> there

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
so maybe the white player plays there

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.230 
so maybe the white player plays there
seven<00:05:31.490> thinking<00:05:32.490> that<00:05:32.640> Reds<00:05:32.850> going<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.120> play

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
seven thinking that Reds going to play

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.120 
seven thinking that Reds going to play
there<00:05:33.420> seven<00:05:33.750> first<00:05:33.960> but<00:05:34.140> seven<00:05:34.470> plays<00:05:34.710> are

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
there seven first but seven plays are

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.400 
there seven first but seven plays are
sorry<00:05:35.340> red<00:05:35.610> plays<00:05:35.880> there<00:05:36.180> too<00:05:36.420> and<00:05:37.050> now<00:05:37.230> this

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
sorry red plays there too and now this

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.590 
sorry red plays there too and now this
piece<00:05:37.620> is<00:05:37.830> moved<00:05:38.100> off<00:05:38.310> anyway<00:05:38.730> well<00:05:39.240> seven

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
piece is moved off anyway well seven

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.840 
piece is moved off anyway well seven
moves<00:05:39.780> their<00:05:40.020> piece<00:05:40.460> so<00:05:41.460> there's<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.640> lot<00:05:41.820> of

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
moves their piece so there's a lot of

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.520 
moves their piece so there's a lot of
trying<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:42.330> out<00:05:42.450> think<00:05:42.780> your<00:05:42.900> opponent<00:05:43.140> trying

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
trying to out think your opponent trying

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.760 
trying to out think your opponent trying
to<00:05:43.680> plan<00:05:43.950> for<00:05:44.490> what<00:05:45.180> they<00:05:45.330> might<00:05:45.540> do<00:05:45.780> but<00:05:46.080> you

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
to plan for what they might do but you

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.410 
to plan for what they might do but you
know<00:05:46.860> maybe<00:05:47.190> you<00:05:47.370> have<00:05:47.430> to<00:05:47.610> guess<00:05:47.820> multiple

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
know maybe you have to guess multiple

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.020 
know maybe you have to guess multiple
different<00:05:48.570> aspects<00:05:49.080> of<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.320> game<00:05:49.460> on<00:05:50.460> top<00:05:50.820> of

that the game comes with just an

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.730 
that the game comes with just an
incredible<00:05:53.790> amount<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.180> variance<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:54.870> this

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
incredible amount of variance and this

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.110 
incredible amount of variance and this
is<00:05:55.890> really<00:05:56.100> the<00:05:56.280> way<00:05:56.370> that<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.580> suggest<00:05:57.030> you

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
stops you're blocking slides all the way

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.150 
stops you're blocking slides all the way
to<00:06:36.360> the<00:06:36.539> edge<00:06:36.660> and<00:06:36.990> that's<00:06:37.560> how<00:06:37.710> the<00:06:37.770> game<00:06:37.949> is

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
to the edge and that's how the game is

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.700 
to the edge and that's how the game is
you<00:06:38.430> choose<00:06:38.940> this<00:06:39.210> you<00:06:39.360> can<00:06:39.479> play<00:06:39.710> three

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
you choose this you can play three

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.320 
you choose this you can play three
separate<00:06:41.130> games<00:06:41.340> and<00:06:41.580> play<00:06:41.669> three<00:06:42.000> separate

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
separate games and play three separate

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330 
separate games and play three separate
variants<00:06:42.690> and<00:06:42.810> that<00:06:43.440> way<00:06:43.650> there's<00:06:43.919> a<00:06:43.979> lot<00:06:44.190> of

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
variants and that way there's a lot of

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.279 
variants and that way there's a lot of
variability<00:06:44.699> to<00:06:44.970> the<00:06:45.060> game<00:06:45.210> it's<00:06:45.660> really<00:06:46.080> an

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:46.289 
variability to the game it's really an

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.800 
variability to the game it's really an
interesting<00:06:46.919> way<00:06:47.220> to<00:06:47.250> go<00:06:47.430> about<00:06:47.550> it<00:06:47.849> and<00:06:48.060> it's

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
interesting way to go about it and it's

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.050 
interesting way to go about it and it's
a<00:06:48.930> lot<00:06:49.110> of<00:06:49.139> fun<00:06:49.410> so<00:06:50.160> as<00:06:50.310> you<00:06:50.490> can<00:06:50.610> tell<00:06:50.669> I<00:06:50.880> really

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
a lot of fun so as you can tell I really

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.080 
a lot of fun so as you can tell I really
enjoy<00:06:51.960> this<00:06:52.199> game<00:06:52.319> I'm<00:06:53.039> not<00:06:53.400> usually<00:06:53.639> a<00:06:53.849> huge

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
enjoy this game I'm not usually a huge

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.809 
enjoy this game I'm not usually a huge
abstract<00:06:54.780> fan<00:06:55.020> as<00:06:55.199> a<00:06:55.229> matter<00:06:55.440> of<00:06:55.530> fact<00:06:55.800> of<00:06:56.280> most

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:56.819 
abstract fan as a matter of fact of most

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:57.800 
abstract fan as a matter of fact of most
of<00:06:56.970> the<00:06:57.060> app<00:06:57.180> tracks<00:06:57.419> that<00:06:57.539> have<00:06:57.660> played

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
of the app tracks that have played

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.450 
of the app tracks that have played
really<00:06:57.990> the<00:06:58.169> only<00:06:58.470> ones<00:06:58.650> that<00:06:58.889> kind<00:06:59.099> of<00:06:59.250> capped

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
really the only ones that kind of capped

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.150 
really the only ones that kind of capped
my<00:06:59.669> attention<00:07:00.150> have<00:07:00.930> been<00:07:01.139> hive<00:07:01.440> and<00:07:01.770> a<00:07:01.830> little

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
my attention have been hive and a little

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.100 
my attention have been hive and a little
bit<00:07:02.310> army<00:07:02.610> of<00:07:02.699> frogs<00:07:02.970> about<00:07:03.210> not<00:07:03.419> nearly<00:07:03.990> to

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
bit army of frogs about not nearly to

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.129 
bit army of frogs about not nearly to
the<00:07:04.229> same<00:07:04.259> level<00:07:04.889> this<00:07:05.520> one<00:07:05.849> I<00:07:05.880> think<00:07:06.060> has<00:07:06.900> the

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
the same level this one I think has the

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.710 
the same level this one I think has the
potential<00:07:07.530> to<00:07:07.860> be<00:07:08.039> at<00:07:08.280> that<00:07:08.460> high<00:07:08.699> level<00:07:08.729> it

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
potential to be at that high level it

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.629 
potential to be at that high level it
has<00:07:09.900> a<00:07:09.930> short<00:07:10.289> playing<00:07:10.590> time<00:07:10.919> it's<00:07:11.130> easy<00:07:11.430> to

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 
has a short playing time it's easy to

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.700 
has a short playing time it's easy to
understand<00:07:12.180> there's<00:07:12.449> very<00:07:12.810> few<00:07:13.169> rules<00:07:13.349> and

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
understand there's very few rules and

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.879 
understand there's very few rules and
there's<00:07:14.280> a<00:07:14.340> ton<00:07:14.669> of<00:07:14.729> variants<00:07:15.330> and<00:07:15.569> so<00:07:16.199> no

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:16.889 
there's a ton of variants and so no

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:18.320 
there's a ton of variants and so no
matter<00:07:17.039> how<00:07:17.250> many<00:07:17.400> times<00:07:17.669> you<00:07:17.849> play<00:07:18.090> I<00:07:18.120> don't

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
matter how many times you play I don't

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.029 
matter how many times you play I don't
think<00:07:18.690> it's<00:07:18.780> going<00:07:18.900> to<00:07:18.960> get<00:07:19.110> old<00:07:19.319> as<00:07:19.530> a<00:07:19.800> matter

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 
think it's going to get old as a matter

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.770 
think it's going to get old as a matter
of<00:07:20.130> fact<00:07:20.340> the<00:07:20.460> first<00:07:20.490> night<00:07:20.970> that<00:07:21.180> we<00:07:21.270> had<00:07:21.509> we

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
of fact the first night that we had we

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.180 
of fact the first night that we had we
got<00:07:21.930> four<00:07:22.289> games<00:07:22.590> in<00:07:22.800> a<00:07:22.979> row

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.190 
got four games in a row

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.580 
got four games in a row
I<00:07:23.370> lost<00:07:23.940> three<00:07:24.330> of<00:07:24.449> them<00:07:24.599> but<00:07:25.110> guess<00:07:25.319> what<00:07:25.560> I

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590 
I lost three of them but guess what I

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.469 
I lost three of them but guess what I
got<00:07:25.800> that<00:07:26.039> final<00:07:26.490> win<00:07:26.669> and<00:07:26.849> that's<00:07:26.970> all<00:07:27.210> I<00:07:27.240> was

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 
got that final win and that's all I was

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.629 
got that final win and that's all I was
looking<00:07:27.840> for<00:07:28.050> and<00:07:28.319> I<00:07:28.650> still<00:07:29.009> wanted<00:07:29.370> to<00:07:29.430> play

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 
looking for and I still wanted to play

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.420 
looking for and I still wanted to play
more<00:07:29.940> so<00:07:30.659> with<00:07:31.080> that<00:07:31.259> said<00:07:31.650> I<00:07:31.680> think<00:07:31.889> that<00:07:32.340> if

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430 
more so with that said I think that if

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.830 
more so with that said I think that if
you<00:07:32.520> like<00:07:32.759> abstract<00:07:33.150> games<00:07:33.509> you<00:07:33.659> should

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 
you like abstract games you should

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.809 
you like abstract games you should
really<00:07:34.080> check<00:07:34.409> out<00:07:34.560> an<00:07:34.680> epic<00:07:34.919> oh<00:07:35.039> it's<00:07:35.610> a

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:40.139 
and I think it's the one that deserves

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:41.810 
and I think it's the one that deserves
to<00:07:40.289> have<00:07:40.469> a<00:07:40.530> lot<00:07:40.889> more<00:07:41.130> attention<00:07:41.430> than<00:07:41.699> it's

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:41.820 
to have a lot more attention than it's
