more so we'll go ahead and do an example

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.700 
more so we'll go ahead and do an example
of<00:00:50.370> mathematics<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.870> just<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> give<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> guys

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
of mathematics so just to give you guys

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.830 
of mathematics so just to give you guys
a<00:00:52.829> simple<00:00:53.250> mathematic<00:00:53.879> equation<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.629> were

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
a simple mathematic equation if we were

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.369 
a simple mathematic equation if we were
to<00:00:54.930> type<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.289> 3<00:00:55.710> times<00:00:56.489> 9<00:00:56.930> right<00:00:57.930> below<00:00:58.230> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to type in 3 times 9 right below it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.610 
to type in 3 times 9 right below it
you're<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> see<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> answer<00:00:59.480> 27<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.230> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
you're going to see the answer 27 so it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.709 
you're going to see the answer 27 so it
literally<00:01:02.100> takes<00:01:02.489> about<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.879> second<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> come

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
literally takes about a second to come

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
literally takes about a second to come
up<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> answer<00:01:04.489> now<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.909> see

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
up with the answer now as you can see

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
up with the answer now as you can see
you<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.540> option<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.290> elementary

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you have the option to do elementary

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.670 
you have the option to do elementary
mathematics<00:01:08.580> basic<00:01:09.270> arithmetic<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.530> could

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
mathematics basic arithmetic you could

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.440 
mathematics basic arithmetic you could
do<00:01:10.740> arithmetic<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.460> fractions<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.390> can

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
do arithmetic with fractions you can

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
do arithmetic with fractions you can
convert<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> decimal<00:01:13.110> number<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.799> another<00:01:14.010> base

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
convert a decimal number to another base

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.109 
convert a decimal number to another base
so<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.450> example<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.110> put<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.409> 569<00:01:17.840> to

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
so for example if you put in 569 to

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:27.390 
so for example if you put in 569 to
binary<00:01:22.790> push<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:23.939> go

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.990 

there's<00:01:28.030> your<00:01:28.180> answer<00:01:28.330> right<00:01:28.450> there<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.880> it's

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
there's your answer right there so it's

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.880 
there's your answer right there so it's
very<00:01:31.270> detail-oriented<00:01:32.170> in<00:01:32.530> terms<00:01:32.740> of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
very detail-oriented in terms of

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.140 
very detail-oriented in terms of
mathematics<00:01:33.550> it's<00:01:33.700> also<00:01:33.880> very

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
mathematics it's also very

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.060 
mathematics it's also very
detail-oriented<00:01:34.810> in<00:01:35.080> terms<00:01:35.260> of<00:01:35.440> statistics

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
detail-oriented in terms of statistics

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.710 
detail-oriented in terms of statistics
so<00:01:36.550> you<00:01:36.640> can<00:01:36.760> put<00:01:36.940> in<00:01:37.030> a<00:01:37.090> statistics

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
so you can put in a statistics

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.350 
so you can put in a statistics
calculation<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.440> it<00:01:38.530> will<00:01:38.620> actually<00:01:39.070> get<00:01:39.280> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
calculation and it will actually get you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.060 
calculation and it will actually get you
it<00:01:40.360> will<00:01:40.480> compute<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:40.990> statistical<00:01:41.590> quantity

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
it will compute a statistical quantity

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.980 
it will compute a statistical quantity
for<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.400> it'll<00:01:42.880> find<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.180> sample<00:01:43.510> size<00:01:43.690> needed

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
for you it'll find a sample size needed

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.800 
for you it'll find a sample size needed
to<00:01:44.020> estimate<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.710> binomial<00:01:45.460> parameter<00:01:46.360> there's

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
to estimate a binomial parameter there's

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.690 
to estimate a binomial parameter there's
various<00:01:47.380> different<00:01:47.410> options<00:01:47.860> here<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.460> terms

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
various different options here in terms

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.220 
various different options here in terms
of<00:01:48.850> statistics<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.540> mathematics<00:01:49.660> with

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
of statistics and mathematics with

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.840 
of statistics and mathematics with
Wolfram<00:01:50.590> Alpha<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.100> that's<00:01:51.250> what<00:01:51.460> makes<00:01:51.670> it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
Wolfram Alpha and that's what makes it

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.240 
Wolfram Alpha and that's what makes it
so<00:01:52.030> unique<00:01:52.300> and<00:01:52.660> so<00:01:53.320> user-friendly<00:01:53.710> because

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
so unique and so user-friendly because

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.430 
so unique and so user-friendly because
