there we go
pattern<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.700> parts<00:01:48.240> now<00:01:49.240> take<00:01:49.540> into<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.930> lab

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
pattern and parts now take into the lab

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:59.040 
pattern and parts now take into the lab
as<00:01:51.850> rust<00:01:52.270> calls<00:01:52.540> it<00:01:53.970> follow<00:01:54.970> me<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:57.869> got<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:58.930> put
