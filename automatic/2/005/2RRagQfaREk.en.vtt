 black sport equipment or why than 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.420
 different from others let's start with the fact that 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:02:19.130

 wing 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.370
 for the place of the usual steering 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.709

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:08.420
 mounted on this motorcycle pack from 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:13.819
