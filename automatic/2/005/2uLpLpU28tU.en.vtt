the left of the of the indigo rose

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.230 
the left of the of the indigo rose
plants<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> ones<00:01:08.610> treated<00:01:09.090> with

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
plants we're the ones treated with

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.649 
plants we're the ones treated with
mycorrhizae<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> day<00:01:12.869> 45<00:01:13.640> we<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.880> seeing<00:01:15.240> no

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
mycorrhizae so day 45 we are seeing no

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.749 
mycorrhizae so day 45 we are seeing no
differences<00:01:16.320> between<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.009> treated<00:01:17.400> plants

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
differences between the treated plants

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.719 
differences between the treated plants
and<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> non<00:01:18.180> treated<00:01:18.659> plants<00:01:19.580> this<00:01:20.580> is

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and the non treated plants this is

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.520 
and the non treated plants this is
really<00:01:21.030> disappointing<00:01:21.210> I've<00:01:21.900> been<00:01:22.110> just

are<00:01:30.810> no<00:01:31.049> differences<00:01:31.759> I<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:33.240> taken<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
are no differences I have taken the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.350 
are no differences I have taken the
chlorophyll<00:01:34.860> content<00:01:35.100> readings<00:01:35.880> from<00:01:36.240> the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
start with the indigo rose so here is a

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.060

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
with the mycorrhizae you can see that

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.180 
with the mycorrhizae you can see that
the<00:02:59.130> tomatoes<00:02:59.280> are<00:03:00.590> starting<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.770> turn<00:03:01.980> purple

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
the tomatoes are starting to turn purple

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.270 
the tomatoes are starting to turn purple
in<00:03:02.460> color<00:03:03.890> it's<00:03:05.840> probably<00:03:06.840> about<00:03:07.280> midway

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
in color it's probably about midway

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.900 
in color it's probably about midway

that here's some tomatoes of you can see

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.580 
that here's some tomatoes of you can see
that<00:03:21.270> there's<00:03:22.260> no<00:03:22.500> difference<00:03:23.010> between<00:03:24.590> these

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
differences since the beginning of this

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.990 
differences since the beginning of this
experiment<00:04:15.920> so<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:18.930> bought<00:04:19.230> this<00:04:19.560> other

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
experiment so so I bought this other

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.300 
experiment so so I bought this other
expensive<00:04:21.000> bottle<00:04:21.390> of<00:04:21.480> great<00:04:21.750> white<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.310> still

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
expensive bottle of great white I still

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.159 
expensive bottle of great white I still
have<00:04:23.550> some<00:04:23.880> faith<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.480> product<00:04:24.720> even

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
have some faith in the product even

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.860 
have some faith in the product even
though<00:04:25.200> it<00:04:25.380> has<00:04:25.530> no<00:04:25.770> effect<00:04:26.100> on<00:04:26.280> these<00:04:26.490> two<00:04:26.640> may

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
though it has no effect on these two may

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.080 
though it has no effect on these two may
plants<00:04:27.320> so<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:27.500> most<00:04:27.979> likely<00:04:28.250> will<00:04:28.699> be<00:04:28.729> doing

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
plants so I most likely will be doing

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.350 
plants so I most likely will be doing
another<00:04:29.540> experiment<00:04:30.410> using<00:04:31.010> great<00:04:31.220> white<00:04:31.460> but

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
another experiment using great white but

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.710 
another experiment using great white but
uh<00:04:32.889> stay<00:04:33.889> tuned<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.550> see<00:04:34.729> what<00:04:34.880> happens<00:04:35.389> I

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
uh stay tuned and see what happens I

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.469 
uh stay tuned and see what happens I
will<00:04:36.410> most<00:04:36.710> likely<00:04:36.919> continue<00:04:37.580> feeding<00:04:38.180> the

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
will most likely continue feeding the

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.719 
will most likely continue feeding the
great<00:04:38.690> white<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.110> these<00:04:39.260> plants<00:04:39.800> just<00:04:40.280> in<00:04:40.460> case

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
great white to these plants just in case
