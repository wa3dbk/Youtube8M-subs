00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.860
 COOK: Before I present the iPhone 5, I want to tell you ... 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.000
 Steve Jobs built this company 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.840
 He is the reason why we are here today, 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.160
 and we see the effects of his actions in everything we do 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.960
 But not anymore. 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.410
 Now the era of Cook begins. 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.160
 Apple is mine, are you listening? Only me! 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.620
 Huh ?! 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.320
 Steve ?! How the hell ... 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.120
 JOBS: Did you think if Tupac can come back from the dead, 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.440
 could STEVE JOBS not do that anyway? Oh please. 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.890
 I'm back to her sluts! 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.050
 The man with the plan! 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.210
 Mac Daddy, even as a hologram {He's back} 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.870
 It took a while, but the wait was worthwhile Because 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.340
 I have the OS that you long for 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.660
 You have been waiting, discussing and wondering without patience 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.260
 Look at you dummies and mentally 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.860
 a deviated I was in heaven, 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.660
 working on technology to choose the hottest 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.280
 that I can throw down on you 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.850
 My design is so delicious 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.520
 you can eat it Even Jesus meant; JESUS: Jesus! You're unbelievable! 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.160
 COOK: But Steve, you can not design 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.950
 That's Jonathan Ive. A bald-faced lie! 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.300
 Nobody likes you {Uh uh}, so shut up Cook! 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.780
 Or I'll beat your skinny ass with my new MacBook 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.470
 always complaining and scraping on labern 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.740
 Someone should get this hacker Cook from my kitchen! 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.690
 Ahora estÃ©n listos la monumental lluvia de cash 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.040
 Get ready for gigantic amounts of money Because five is guaranteed to blow your head off! 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.550
 iFhone 5! 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.500
 I'm Mac Daddy - dead or alive! 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.920
 So buy and do not ask why 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.300
 You know you get an iFhone 5! 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.840
 iFhone 5! 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.380
 I'm Mac Daddy - dead or alive! 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.800
 So buy and do not ask why 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.100
 You know you get an iFhone 5! 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.000
 3Gizzle! The shit was a huge success 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.210
 I got an ass full of the 3GizzleS 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.500
 Number four, another success, pines fell to the ground you did so 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.090
 like you've never seen a phone 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.370
 I was rich, I was interested in a shit 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.850
 Dove into the gold like Uncle Dagobert 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.300
 I had San Francisco for me 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.000
 Got more Californian love than my buddy Tupac {change} 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830
 But then they learned the truth - 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.590
 My hardware was outdated {damn it!} 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.100
 iFhone 5! 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.540
 I'm Mac Daddy - dead or alive! 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.970
 So buy, and do not ask why 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.460
 You know you get an iFhone 5! 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.850
 And now, the true star of the show 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.720
 The Future of Speech - iFhone cincooooo! 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.830
 FANBOY: Shut up! This is exactly the same phone as before! 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.340
 JOBS: That's not true! It has a new power cable. 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.510
 We changed the mount arbitrarily, 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.040
 So I hope you like buying new accessories. 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.410
 Do you see the new design - yes it is out of control 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.660
 We turned and changed it from black to charcoal {Could you please?} 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.430
 Plus the screen is two millimeters larger 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.020
 That must be worth four hundred dollars 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.370
 FANBOY: "All the cool stuff was on the iFhone 4!" 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.130
 But you also buy it for the App Store 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.140
 What will you do - buy a Galaxy for you? 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.670
 You will even be queuing for iFhone 83! {Eightythree} 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.200
 Because Apple has the shit you all want. {you all want} 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.080
 I'm still carrying Bill Gates out of the grave! 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.020
 COOK: Hallelujah Steve! You showed me the light! 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.310
 COOK: It's your apple, I'm just biting off 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.720
 It's cool, Cook - I have a turtleneck for you 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.230
 Now we tell these people what they need to do 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.100
 iFhone 5! 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.130
 I'm Mac Daddy - dead or alive! 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.500
 So buy, and do not ask why 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.220
 You know you get an iFhone 5! 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.520
 iFhone 5! 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.000
 I'm Mac Daddy - dead or alive! 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.370
 So buy, and do not ask why 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.210
 You know you get an iFhone 5!
