but it's got turbo cash so you can if

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.310 
but it's got turbo cash so you can if
you<00:01:41.910> have<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.510> gig<00:01:42.870> or<00:01:43.140> more<00:01:43.530> or<00:01:44.630> Ram<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.080> can

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you have one gig or more or Ram you can

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.640 
you have one gig or more or Ram you can
make<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.160> card<00:01:47.460> run<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:48.150> 512<00:01:49.110> megabytes

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
make this this card run at 512 megabytes

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.550 
make this this card run at 512 megabytes
of

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
of

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.540 
of
maybe<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.190> memory<00:01:52.490> but<00:01:53.300> if<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.570> have<00:01:54.550> 512

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
maybe a memory but if you have 512

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.350 
maybe a memory but if you have 512
megabytes<00:01:56.150> or<00:01:56.510> less<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.500> have<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.800> make<00:01:58.360> make

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
megabytes or less you have to make make

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.210 
megabytes or less you have to make make
it<00:01:59.480> run<00:01:59.690> at<00:01:59.810> 256<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:01.040> me

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
it run at 256 in me

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.490 
it run at 256 in me
so<00:02:03.790> overall<00:02:04.330> this<00:02:04.630> is<00:02:04.690> this<00:02:04.960> is<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.110> pretty<00:02:05.290> good

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
so overall this is this is a pretty good

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
so overall this is this is a pretty good
card

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
card

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.270 
card
it<00:02:07.000> can<00:02:07.210> take<00:02:07.450> like<00:02:07.750> gaming<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.380> think<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.100> took

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
it can take like gaming I think it took

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.930 
it can take like gaming I think it took

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.720 
at like 35 frames per second
I<00:02:22.170> mean<00:02:22.860> that's<00:02:23.400> pretty<00:02:23.700> good<00:02:23.910> okay<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.710> yeah

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
I mean that's pretty good okay so yeah
