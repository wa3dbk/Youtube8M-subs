00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.529
 and we're back and now we're going to 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.960
 make a lasagna from aubergines this 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.190
 It sounds very vegetarian and very rich to me 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.860
 love the version it tastes delicious 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.210
 Alleges the ingredients for this recipe 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.210
 We are going to use 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.800
 a spoonful of oil 4 tomatoes without 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.900
 seed and chopped into small cubes a 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.320
 of chopped garlic salt and pepper 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.140
 taste 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.470
 2 large aubergines cut into slices 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 and roasted 200 grams of panela cheese 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.670
 grated and a quarter cup of cheese 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.670
 Grated parmesan 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.750
 that as it 's going to make this recipe 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.230
 then let's put some oil 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.230
 here in the pan 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.550
 and here we are going to put some garlic 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.699
 and let's start the sear tantito 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.930
 tomato our beta carotene 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.229
 famous and famous and claimed 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.360
 highlight or themes we are going to add and 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.080
 there we are going to let them brown 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.840
 bit 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.640
 and let's put some salt is not 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.130
 They know that I like this the feat 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.750
 does not have the carbohydrates ok if 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.180
 were you talking with a vision 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.190
 author of the diet of the zone diet 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.750
 what would happen would be telling me that 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.840
 these vegetables are a carbohydrate 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.150
 because they have fiber and that I have to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.590
 give the reason is fine but also 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.300
 we have to start from the base that a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.920
 carbohydrate as such has to come to 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.170
 strength of a cereal not then yes 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.940
 we start from this base this recipe does not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 has carbohydrates 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.890
 if we are using the diet in the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.720
 zone then if it's a source of 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.900
 carbohydrates is that there are so many diets 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.040
 since it is not that if you are kings and 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.259
 this one makes us balls then we go to 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.229
 put it like this this has no carbohydrates 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.600
 but it has a lot of fiber it has a lot of water 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.050
 this one has a lot of beta proteins 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.550
 carotene two by one this one we have 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.950
 this the aubergine the cascarita the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.530
 eggplant we have the lycopene of 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.530
 Tomato and remember that this reduces 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.240
 and all any possibility of cancer 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.360
 of prostate that I just found out 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.430
 true that vitamin d also helps 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.030
 that patients who already have cancer 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.090
 of prostate that they no longer have reduces the 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.290
 impressive death risk but that 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.000
 you have to take it very seriously, you have to 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.350
 sunning the vitamin d comes from the sun I 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.080
 then said that way for something 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.680
 let's put a refractory a bed 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.680
 eggplant 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:52.270
 so this little bit will see if we go to 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:57.400
 put eggplant takes here 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.580
 and this we are going to put a little bit this time 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.320
 in this raw we're going to put it in the oven 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.500
 then there is no need to exceed your 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.780
 cooking if they can not put in the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.690
 Grill then grilled 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.760
 but then we will lose a lot of water and 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.120
 then it would become a very much food 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.250
 more caloric we 're going to keep it that way 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.800
 so that you do not pass them, let's put 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.360
 cheese the cheese of your choice 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:28.500
 manchego asadero manchego are the ones 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.500
 I like Oaxaca 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.350
 fresh cheese that is on the ranch we are going to 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.870
 put another capita of eggplant 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.700
 and we are going to put back and we are going to 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.760
 toss all the tomato sauce 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.819
 it seems if we are going to put all 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.150
 to all 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:56.300
 let's splash with a little manchego 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.360
 and we are also going to put 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.030
 Parmesan 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.110
 all 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.670
 for me no longer come from there and now what 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.110
 let's put the microwave in, I say 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.420
 for some that I said the microwave 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.239
 I repeat I repeat now we are going to put it 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.590
 we're going to pepper and we're going to 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.810
 put in the oven about 45 minutes at 180 200 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.270
 degrees so that the eggplant that 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.560
 not hard because the raw eggplant 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.930
 it's super super super bitter what 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.889
 let's put in the oven clear are I already 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.889
 I have here one made 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.629
 I here I already have one made see what 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.979
 chula was left if you like them and 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.310
 also with what you can eat this 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.919
 with a Mediterranean chick are not 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.529
 appetite or with sautÃ©ed legs with a 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.079
 little parsley and butter 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:58.699
 and if they are vegetarian obviously and if not 

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:01.279
 because a port in the east can do 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.619
 a hamburger if they put portovelo and 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:07.189
 this asparagus of asia I'm afraid of 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:08.539
 not for nothing not for nothing we're going 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:11.649
 to a cut that while I'm going to eat something 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.649
 and we returned
