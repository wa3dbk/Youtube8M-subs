NAB 2015 hasn't even started yet but the

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.450 
NAB 2015 hasn't even started yet but the
new<00:00:25.989> enhancements<00:00:26.589> are<00:00:26.769> rolling<00:00:27.220> in<00:00:27.339> thick

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
new enhancements are rolling in thick

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.609 
new enhancements are rolling in thick
and<00:00:27.579> fast<00:00:27.669> I'm<00:00:28.059> here<00:00:28.210> on<00:00:28.269> the<00:00:28.390> DJI<00:00:28.719> booth<00:00:29.050> which

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
and fast I'm here on the DJI booth which

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.459 
and fast I'm here on the DJI booth which
has<00:00:29.800> been<00:00:30.009> set<00:00:30.189> up<00:00:30.219> behind<00:00:30.519> us<00:00:30.669> with<00:00:31.329> Paul<00:00:32.199> and

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
has been set up behind us with Paul and

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.579 
has been set up behind us with Paul and
Mike<00:00:32.920> from<00:00:33.190> DJI<00:00:33.579> what<00:00:34.149> have<00:00:34.269> you<00:00:34.329> got<00:00:34.510> here<00:00:34.660> so

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.589 
Mike from DJI what have you got here so

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:38.549 
Mike from DJI what have you got here so
this<00:00:36.309> is<00:00:36.550> our<00:00:36.730> all-new<00:00:37.269> Ronin<00:00:38.199> M<00:00:38.320> it's

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
this is our all-new Ronin M it's

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.880 
this is our all-new Ronin M it's
essentially<00:00:39.519> the<00:00:39.670> Ronin<00:00:40.059> but<00:00:40.269> shrunken<00:00:40.629> down

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
essentially the Ronin but shrunken down

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.119 
essentially the Ronin but shrunken down
we've<00:00:42.000> taken<00:00:43.500> everything<00:00:44.500> that<00:00:44.680> we've<00:00:44.890> known

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
we've taken everything that we've known

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:46.680 
we've taken everything that we've known
about<00:00:45.159> the<00:00:45.550> Ronin<00:00:45.729> everything<00:00:46.479> that<00:00:46.570> we've

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
about the Ronin everything that we've

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.689 
about the Ronin everything that we've
learned<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:47.170> put<00:00:48.010> it<00:00:48.129> into<00:00:48.399> a<00:00:48.430> smaller

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
learned and put it into a smaller

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.479 
learned and put it into a smaller
package<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.360> it's<00:00:49.780> also<00:00:49.960> much<00:00:50.170> lighter<00:00:50.440> Wow

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
package and it's also much lighter Wow

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.640 
package and it's also much lighter Wow
okay<00:00:51.879> and<00:00:52.119> just<00:00:52.390> how<00:00:52.869> much<00:00:52.989> lighter<00:00:53.259> is<00:00:53.439> this

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
okay and just how much lighter is this

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.499 
okay and just how much lighter is this
than<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:53.979> original<00:00:54.549> it's<00:00:54.759> it's<00:00:55.000> about<00:00:55.119> half

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:55.509 
than the original it's it's about half

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:57.929 
than the original it's it's about half
the<00:00:55.540> weight<00:00:55.809> of<00:00:55.869> version<00:00:56.229> one<00:00:56.409> and<00:00:57.189> you<00:00:57.309> go<00:00:57.879> to

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:57.939 
the weight of version one and you go to

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:59.039 
the weight of version one and you go to
there<00:00:58.089> and<00:00:58.210> in<00:00:58.360> two<00:00:58.540> things<00:00:58.780> I<00:00:58.839> think

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
there and in two things I think

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:00.119 
there and in two things I think
yeah<00:00:59.140> I'm<00:00:59.259> just<00:00:59.350> holding<00:00:59.619> them<00:00:59.710> like<00:00:59.739> this<00:00:59.979> is

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
yeah I'm just holding them like this is

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.850 
yeah I'm just holding them like this is
it's<00:01:00.460> it's<00:01:00.850> superlight<00:01:01.269> it's<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:02.680> made

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
it's it's superlight it's a it's made

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.039 
it's it's superlight it's a it's made
from<00:01:03.009> magnesium<00:01:03.159> so<00:01:03.790> even<00:01:04.479> though<00:01:04.570> magnesium

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
from magnesium so even though magnesium

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.719 
from magnesium so even though magnesium
is<00:01:05.140> much<00:01:05.350> harder<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.770> work<00:01:05.860> with

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
is much harder to work with

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.270 
is much harder to work with
we<00:01:07.180> took<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.600> steps<00:01:07.869> and<00:01:08.079> then<00:01:08.170> pushed<00:01:08.590> the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
we took the steps and then pushed the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.649 
we took the steps and then pushed the
same<00:01:09.490> sort<00:01:09.700> of<00:01:09.759> metal<00:01:10.000> they<00:01:10.090> using<00:01:10.479> like

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
same sort of metal they using like

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.469 
same sort of metal they using like
Proteus<00:01:11.350> laws<00:01:11.590> d4<00:01:12.189> cos<00:01:12.700> one<00:01:12.880> DS<00:01:13.090> that's<00:01:13.270> only

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
Proteus laws d4 cos one DS that's only

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.620 
Proteus laws d4 cos one DS that's only
thing<00:01:13.659> up<00:01:13.780> yep<00:01:14.079> okay<00:01:15.150> battery<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.360> same

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
thing up yep okay battery the same

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.710 
thing up yep okay battery the same
battery<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:18.030> essentially<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.149> same<00:01:19.299> but<00:01:19.360> it's

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
battery is essentially the same but it's

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.109 
battery is essentially the same but it's
a<00:01:19.840> different<00:01:20.229> mounting<00:01:20.590> position<00:01:21.520> different

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
a different mounting position different

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.149 
a different mounting position different
mounting<00:01:22.390> mechanism<00:01:22.479> yeah<00:01:23.159> different

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
mounting mechanism yeah different

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.920 
mounting mechanism yeah different
mounting<00:01:24.430> mechanism<00:01:24.550> no<00:01:25.360> longer<00:01:25.630> has<00:01:25.750> that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
mounting mechanism no longer has that

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.320 
mounting mechanism no longer has that
latch<00:01:26.140> on<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.380> bottom<00:01:26.740> but<00:01:27.670> with<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.060> battery

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
latch on the bottom but with the battery

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.060 
latch on the bottom but with the battery
with<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.510> smaller<00:01:28.870> set<00:01:29.140> up<00:01:29.229> it's<00:01:29.470> able<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:29.950> run

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
with a smaller set up it's able to run

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.280 
with a smaller set up it's able to run
over<00:01:30.280> six<00:01:30.490> hours<00:01:30.630> okay<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.810> then<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:31.930> couple<00:01:32.170> of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
over six hours okay and then a couple of

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.260 
over six hours okay and then a couple of
design<00:01:32.560> changes<00:01:32.979> you've<00:01:33.159> got<00:01:33.370> something

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
design changes you've got something

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.490 
design changes you've got something
different<00:01:34.360> going<00:01:34.630> on<00:01:34.780> here<00:01:34.930> that<00:01:35.140> with<00:01:35.290> the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
different going on here that with the

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.700 
different going on here that with the
yoke<00:01:36.280> with<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.640> arm<00:01:36.850> or<00:01:37.150> das<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.140> this<00:01:38.409> arm

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
yoke with the arm or das so so this arm

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.730 
yoke with the arm or das so so this arm
instead<00:01:39.610> of<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.600> previous<00:01:40.990> Ronin<00:01:41.380> where<00:01:41.590> we

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
instead of the previous Ronin where we

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.950 
instead of the previous Ronin where we
had<00:01:41.920> multiple<00:01:42.670> pieces<00:01:43.120> piece<00:01:43.450> together<00:01:43.630> this

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
had multiple pieces piece together this

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.850 
had multiple pieces piece together this
is<00:01:44.140> one<00:01:44.409> solid<00:01:44.740> piece<00:01:45.180> increasing<00:01:46.180> rigidity

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
is one solid piece increasing rigidity

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.800 
is one solid piece increasing rigidity
okay<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.880> means<00:01:49.030> you've<00:01:49.420> got<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.630> much

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
okay so that means you've got a much

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.870 
okay so that means you've got a much
more<00:01:49.960> stable<00:01:50.140> platform<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:51.250> does<00:01:51.490> have<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.729> mean

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
more stable platform it does have I mean

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.910 
more stable platform it does have I mean
you<00:01:51.970> can't<00:01:52.210> put<00:01:52.600> very<00:01:53.049> long<00:01:53.290> cameras<00:01:53.650> on<00:01:53.770> there

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
you can't put very long cameras on there

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.010 
you can't put very long cameras on there
so<00:01:54.040> you<00:01:54.070> can't<00:01:54.490> get<00:01:54.580> an<00:01:54.640> F<00:01:54.729> fs700<00:01:55.180> we<00:01:55.659> can't<00:01:55.869> do

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
so you can't get an F fs700 we can't do

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.840 
so you can't get an F fs700 we can't do
that<00:01:56.140> I'm<00:01:56.290> but<00:01:56.530> then<00:01:56.740> this<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.490> is<00:01:57.640> made

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
that I'm but then this is this is made

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.120 
that I'm but then this is this is made
for<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.119> smaller<00:01:58.390> setups<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.049> for<00:02:00.040> the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
for the smaller setups and for the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.490 
for the smaller setups and for the
run-and-gun<00:02:00.460> type<00:02:00.729> of<00:02:00.850> shoes<00:02:01.200> you're<00:02:02.200> looking

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
run-and-gun type of shoes you're looking

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.160 
run-and-gun type of shoes you're looking
at<00:02:02.590> any<00:02:02.740> camera<00:02:03.100> setup<00:02:03.430> up<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.850> 8<00:02:04.119> pounds<00:02:04.479> so

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
at any camera setup up to 8 pounds so

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.950 
at any camera setup up to 8 pounds so
you're<00:02:05.650> not<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:06.220> know<00:02:06.310> fs700<00:02:07.060> might<00:02:07.570> be<00:02:07.720> more

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
things that this has got going on you've

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.100 
things that this has got going on you've
got<00:02:29.209> something<00:02:29.450> interesting<00:02:29.750> happens<00:02:29.989> with

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
got something interesting happens with

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.160 
got something interesting happens with
the<00:02:30.170> handles<00:02:30.500> here<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.860> right<00:02:31.040> yeah<00:02:31.099> so

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
the handles here is that right yeah so

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.210 
the handles here is that right yeah so
what<00:02:33.170> we've<00:02:33.319> done<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.680> we've<00:02:33.920> made<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
what we've done is we've made the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.160 
what we've done is we've made the
handles<00:02:34.549> removal<00:02:35.000> much<00:02:35.180> much<00:02:35.599> quicker<00:02:35.840> than

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
handles removal much much quicker than

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.530 
handles removal much much quicker than
the<00:02:36.920> previous<00:02:37.310> handle<00:02:37.549> system<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.060> then<00:02:38.450> you

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the previous handle system and then you

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.210 
the previous handle system and then you
can<00:02:38.690> essentially<00:02:39.049> take<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.500> handle<00:02:39.799> off<00:02:39.890> and

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
can essentially take the handle off and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.150 
can essentially take the handle off and
you<00:02:40.910> can<00:02:41.060> operate<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.720> can<00:02:41.870> still<00:02:42.110> take<00:02:43.040> it

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
you can operate it you can still take it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.789 
you can operate it you can still take it
up<00:02:43.280> steer<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:43.879> this<00:02:44.090> or<00:02:44.629> if<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.560> really

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
up steer it like this or if you really

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.250 
up steer it like this or if you really
want<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.069> get<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.370> completed<00:02:46.970> compact<00:02:47.480> where

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
want to get it completed compact where

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.170 
want to get it completed compact where
we<00:02:48.440> did<00:02:48.620> actually<00:02:48.799> do<00:02:49.129> a<00:02:49.160> shoot<00:02:49.549> in<00:02:49.730> Africa

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
can we we haven't really completely

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.460 
can we we haven't really completely
tweaked<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.299> for<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.510> quad<00:03:26.690> but<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:27.379> know

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
tweaked it for the quad but you know

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.589 
tweaked it for the quad but you know
that's<00:03:27.620> that's<00:03:27.829> that<00:03:28.099> can<00:03:28.579> be<00:03:28.760> upgraded<00:03:29.209> with

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
that's that's that can be upgraded with

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.979 
that's that's that can be upgraded with
the<00:03:29.630> future<00:03:29.930> firmware<00:03:30.169> and<00:03:30.500> maybe<00:03:31.160> even<00:03:31.989> when

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
the future firmware and maybe even when

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.020 
the future firmware and maybe even when
the<00:03:33.079> tongues<00:03:33.319> time<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.859> put<00:03:34.069> out<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.489> version

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
the tongues time to put out a version

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.699 
the tongues time to put out a version
for<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.510> flyable<00:03:35.989> version<00:03:36.380> there's<00:03:36.560> going<00:03:36.650> to

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
for a flyable version there's going to

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.319 
for a flyable version there's going to
be<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:36.829> mount<00:03:37.099> with<00:03:37.310> vibration<00:03:37.819> dampers<00:03:38.209> and
