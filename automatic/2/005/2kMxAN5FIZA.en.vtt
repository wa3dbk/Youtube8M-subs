00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
think it's great and the only good thing

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.950 
think it's great and the only good thing
is<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.000> Marcus<00:01:45.930> games<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.680> also<00:01:47.579> dropping<00:01:48.149> so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
is that Marcus games is also dropping so

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.340 
is that Marcus games is also dropping so
much<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.920> love<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.299> but<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.540> think<00:01:51.750> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
much and I love that but I think this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.679 
much and I love that but I think this
might<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.130> problem<00:01:53.460> still<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.390> gems

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
might be a problem still with it gems

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.010 
might be a problem still with it gems
and<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.770> crafting<00:01:56.399> fee<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.450> little

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and that is the crafting fee is a little

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.560 
and that is the crafting fee is a little
bit<00:01:58.200> too<00:01:58.500> high<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.460> current<00:01:59.909> moment<00:02:00.180> of

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
bit too high and the current moment of

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.359 
bit too high and the current moment of
the<00:02:00.750> game<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:02.990> in<00:02:03.990> my<00:02:04.380> opinion<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.130> best

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
the game and in my opinion the best

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.969 
the game and in my opinion the best
thing<00:02:05.790> Blizzard<00:02:06.630> brought<00:02:06.990> into<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> game<00:02:07.710> is

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
thing Blizzard brought into the game is

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.089 
thing Blizzard brought into the game is
enchanting<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.750> most<00:02:10.020> awesome<00:02:10.530> thing<00:02:10.860> that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099

if you find a decent item for example if

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.679 
if you find a decent item for example if
your<00:02:19.959> barbarian<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:21.129> then<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.879> have<00:02:22.150> thanks

it's really hard to generate generate
theory<00:03:04.560> even<00:03:05.560> though<00:03:05.680> if<00:03:05.829> I<00:03:06.010> have<00:03:06.219> this<00:03:06.400> skill

up<00:03:07.469> so<00:03:08.469> yeah<00:03:08.739> that's<00:03:09.310> something<00:03:09.579> you<00:03:10.000> should

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
up so yeah that's something you should

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.339 
up so yeah that's something you should
look<00:03:10.269> into<00:03:11.969> and<00:03:12.969> there's<00:03:13.209> one<00:03:13.299> thing<00:03:13.870> about

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
look into and there's one thing about

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.509 
look into and there's one thing about
the<00:03:14.590> game<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:15.010> doesn't<00:03:15.489> like<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.419> that's<00:03:17.519> every

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
the game I doesn't like and that's every

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.420 
the game I doesn't like and that's every
time<00:03:18.849> I<00:03:19.180> open<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.810> math<00:03:20.049> I<00:03:20.379> see<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.889> town<00:03:21.129> map

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
time I open the math I see the town map

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.420 
time I open the math I see the town map
and<00:03:21.729> that<00:03:21.879> pisses<00:03:22.299> me<00:03:22.659> off<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:23.169> would<00:03:24.159> love<00:03:24.370> to

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
and that pisses me off I would love to

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.189 
and that pisses me off I would love to
if<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.120> if<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.470> was<00:03:26.500> like<00:03:27.040> on<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:28.569> area<00:03:28.959> map

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
if I if it was like on the area map

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.990 
if I if it was like on the area map
instead<00:03:29.560> for<00:03:30.250> example<00:03:30.790> if<00:03:31.060> I've<00:03:32.669> if<00:03:33.669> I

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
instead for example if I've if I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.569 
instead for example if I've if I
probably<00:03:34.359> am<00:03:34.689> mr.<00:03:35.109> legendary<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.129> then

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
probably am mr. legendary and then

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.789 
probably am mr. legendary and then
impressing<00:03:37.269> them<00:03:37.389> up<00:03:37.599> button<00:03:38.079> to<00:03:38.260> see<00:03:38.439> if<00:03:38.590> I've

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
impressing them up button to see if I've

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.849 
impressing them up button to see if I've
missed<00:03:39.010> anyone<00:03:39.569> legendary<00:03:40.569> but<00:03:41.169> then<00:03:41.409> I<00:03:41.560> can't

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
missed anyone legendary but then I can't

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.330 
missed anyone legendary but then I can't
see<00:03:42.220> because<00:03:42.579> I<00:03:43.090> get<00:03:43.509> the<00:03:43.629> tone<00:03:43.870> mouth<00:03:44.199> and<00:03:44.530> in

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
see because I get the tone mouth and in

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.759 
see because I get the tone mouth and in
the<00:03:45.549> time<00:03:45.849> I'm<00:03:46.120> changing<00:03:46.689> to<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.079> area<00:03:47.500> map

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
the time I'm changing to the area map

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.610 
the time I'm changing to the area map
I'm<00:03:48.040> getting<00:03:48.310> killed<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.540> that's<00:03:50.319> also

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
I'm getting killed and that's also

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.300 
I'm getting killed and that's also
