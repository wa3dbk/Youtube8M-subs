00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
IIHS we tried to pick a winner but it

IIHS we tried to pick a winner but it
was<00:04:00.700> really<00:04:00.940> hard<00:04:01.209> because<00:04:01.329> all<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.690> these<00:04:01.930> are

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
was really hard because all of these are

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.069 
was really hard because all of these are
really<00:04:02.620> safe<00:04:02.940> these<00:04:03.940> crossovers<00:04:04.510> range<00:04:04.930> from

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
really safe these crossovers range from

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.120 
really safe these crossovers range from
just<00:04:05.440> under<00:04:05.819> $20,000<00:04:06.819> to<00:04:07.269> almost<00:04:08.130> 33,000

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.190 
just under $20,000 to almost 33,000
that's<00:04:09.849> not<00:04:10.090> bad<00:04:10.329> considering<00:04:10.750> these<00:04:10.900> are<00:04:11.049> all

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
that's not bad considering these are all

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.509

quality crossovers

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.509

however<00:04:13.480> our<00:04:14.200> testers<00:04:14.769> are<00:04:14.920> at<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.099> high<00:04:15.310> end

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
however our testers are at the high end

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.159 
however our testers are at the high end
of<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:15.670> spectrum<00:04:15.970> because<00:04:16.299> of<00:04:16.600> their<00:04:16.750> options

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
of the spectrum because of their options

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.949 
of the spectrum because of their options
that's<00:04:17.919> why<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.250> Honda<00:04:18.669> CRV<00:04:18.850> wins<00:04:19.630> when<00:04:19.840> it
