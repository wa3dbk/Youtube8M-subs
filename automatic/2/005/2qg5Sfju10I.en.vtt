00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.640 
almost if not purposeful so you know but
the<00:03:10.450> big<00:03:10.600> thing<00:03:10.630> toward<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> end<00:03:11.350> other<00:03:11.560> than

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the big thing toward the end other than

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.280 
the big thing toward the end other than
the<00:03:11.860> revelation<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.670> Caritas<00:03:13.540> sister<00:03:14.110> is

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
the revelation that Caritas sister is

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.320 
the revelation that Caritas sister is
not<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.770> fact<00:03:15.010> his<00:03:15.280> sister<00:03:15.550> but<00:03:15.730> his<00:03:15.850> cousin<00:03:16.209> in

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
not in fact his sister but his cousin in

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.380 
not in fact his sister but his cousin in
law<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.510> guess<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:18.070> email<00:03:18.430> he<00:03:18.610> gets<00:03:18.820> from<00:03:19.120> of

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
law I guess is the email he gets from of

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.080 
law I guess is the email he gets from of
all<00:03:19.570> people<00:03:19.930> eagle<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:21.340> contains<00:03:21.970> a
