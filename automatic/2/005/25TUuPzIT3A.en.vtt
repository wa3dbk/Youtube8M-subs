00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
Oreo loves her wheel apparently that's

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.969 
Oreo loves her wheel apparently that's
the<00:01:06.510> first<00:01:06.780> time<00:01:06.990> she's<00:01:07.200> been<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.470> one<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the first time she's been on one that I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.910 
the first time she's been on one that I
know<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.900> for<00:01:09.900> some<00:01:10.170> reason<00:01:10.619> it's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
know of and for some reason it's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.429 
know of and for some reason it's
supposed<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> silent<00:01:12.030> wheel<00:01:12.260> but<00:01:13.260> that's

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
supposed to be a silent wheel but that's

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.270 
supposed to be a silent wheel but that's
not<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.070> silent<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:15.409> think<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
not so silent I think what it is is it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.999 
not so silent I think what it is is it
it<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.360> silent<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.500> depends<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:19.950> how

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
it is silent but it just depends on how

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.330 
it is silent but it just depends on how
fast<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.549> hamster<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> running<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:24.290> yeah

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
fast the hamster is running on it yeah

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.679 
fast the hamster is running on it yeah
she's<00:01:27.150> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.720> getting<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.890> wheel

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
she's kind of getting it on that wheel

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.590 
she's kind of getting it on that wheel
so<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.750> don't<00:01:31.020> know<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:31.350> um<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:32.329> she<00:01:33.329> plans
