00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello me my name is amandine and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.510
 chaigneau I am 35 years old and I am head of 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.280
 cooking for me the scientific universe 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.340
 I bathed in it forever 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.139
 it was part of everyday life 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.609
 was one of the concerns of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.289
 every day until mans in addition to my 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.740
 mom to work at cnrs so in 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.510
 biochemistry 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.910
 I started a course in fact actually 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.560
 of pharmacy and chance has made that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.619
 I discovered the restoration through 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.920
 my first little job and clay I 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.360
 caught the virus and wanted to continue there 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.600
 in there then through the making 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 mozzarella we'll see that it's 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.730
 a whole series of reactions 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.850
 physicochemicals actually that are going 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.110
 get to what we are this this little 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.710
 ball finally we love so much in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.719
 our plates 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.539
 we will start by heating the milk 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.550
 between 32 and 38 degrees at that time we 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.350
 will add the rennet that is actually 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.850
 an enzyme extracted from the picking of the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.719
 calf and we will observe that the milk is going 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.789
 rush it to say we're going to get 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.400
 on one side whey and on the other 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.670
 side the notebook then this notebook we go 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.220
 go taste to extract to the maximum 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.590
 all the watery parts had to precipitate 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.970
 and then we'll heat the notebook for 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.340
 develop elasticity and arrive 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.369
 finally to the ball that we know 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.710
 understanding how things 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.240
 work I think it's something 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.890
 thing that will allow me to develop 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.530
 creativity in the sense that I have the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.700
 bases and I know that like when 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.400
 understands how something 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.030
 works necessarily we will rely 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.140
 on it and it's going to be an open door to 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.729
 lots of things full of ideas 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.960
 molecular cuisine for example it's 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.060
 not necessarily things with the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.270
 smoke that comes out everywhere it can be 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.130
 just use a gelling agent that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.880
 hold on heat for example that's it 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.500
 can be tools that are 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.000
 interesting to use everyday his 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.540
 fall there is a magic behind that is 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.540
 unbelievable
