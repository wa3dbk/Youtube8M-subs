use<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.860> for<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:11.070> sidearm<00:04:11.310> for<00:04:11.700> hunting<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.709> it

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
use it for a sidearm for hunting and it

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.250 
use it for a sidearm for hunting and it
seems<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.980> be<00:04:14.040> doing<00:04:14.280> real<00:04:14.459> well<00:04:15.109> we'll<00:04:16.109> move

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
seems to be doing real well we'll move

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.750 
seems to be doing real well we'll move
up<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.500> little<00:04:16.709> closer<00:04:16.950> see<00:04:17.280> if<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.430> can<00:04:17.579> tighten

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
up a little closer see if I can tighten

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.449 
up a little closer see if I can tighten
up<00:04:17.940> those<00:04:18.150> groups<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:18.630> little<00:04:18.840> bit<00:04:19.250> how<00:04:20.250> that

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
up those groups a little bit how that

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:43.029 
up those groups a little bit how that
goes

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.350

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:51.320 
that was single-action have pakmar grips
on<00:04:51.000> it

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
on it

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.100 
on it
this<00:04:52.289> Raging<00:04:52.710> Bull<00:04:52.860> has<00:04:53.159> got<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:54.110> the

this Raging Bull has got the the
cushioned<00:04:55.560> rubber<00:04:55.770> grips<00:04:56.189> they're<00:04:56.550> not

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
cushioned rubber grips they're not

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.379 
cushioned rubber grips they're not
pakmar<00:04:57.150> but<00:04:57.330> they<00:04:57.419> just<00:04:57.810> like<00:04:58.020> them<00:04:59.330> these<00:05:00.330> are

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
pakmar but they just like them these are

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:07.360 
pakmar but they just like them these are
the<00:05:00.569> stock<00:05:00.870> grips<00:05:01.199> that<00:05:01.379> came<00:05:01.529> with<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.800> gun

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.189 

it<00:05:08.370> does<00:05:08.580> have<00:05:08.729> a<00:05:08.789> transfer<00:05:09.270> bar<00:05:09.479> safety<00:05:09.990> on<00:05:10.169> it

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
it does have a transfer bar safety on it

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.499 
it does have a transfer bar safety on it
so<00:05:10.469> I'm<00:05:10.529> not<00:05:10.710> worried<00:05:11.009> about<00:05:11.099> loading<00:05:11.430> six<00:05:11.849> as

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
so I'm not worried about loading six as

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.709 
so I'm not worried about loading six as
opposed<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:12.990> you<00:05:13.409> know<00:05:13.469> cowboy<00:05:13.889> style<00:05:14.719> load

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:15.719 
opposed to you know cowboy style load

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.559 
opposed to you know cowboy style load
one<00:05:15.990> skip<00:05:16.289> one<00:05:16.319> load<00:05:16.800> four<00:05:17.210> so<00:05:18.210> we'll<00:05:18.330> see<00:05:18.479> how

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
one skip one load four so we'll see how

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.149 
one skip one load four so we'll see how
those<00:05:18.719> goals<00:05:18.960> will<00:05:19.169> move<00:05:19.319> back<00:05:19.529> up<00:05:19.740> here<00:05:19.949> about

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
those goals will move back up here about

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:35.990 
those goals will move back up here about
halfway<00:05:33.349> single<00:05:34.349> action<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:35.279> I'll<00:05:35.430> do<00:05:35.610> three

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
halfway single action and I'll do three

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:50.689 
halfway single action and I'll do three
in<00:05:36.270> double<00:05:36.659> action

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:06:27.450

some other probably about 240 grain they

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.580 
some other probably about 240 grain they
seem<00:06:58.700> too<00:06:58.820> high<00:06:58.970> and<00:06:59.090> it'll<00:06:59.300> just<00:06:59.450> find<00:06:59.690> plenty

Taurus with a army San Marco Walker Colt
which<00:07:17.900> is<00:07:18.080> approximately<00:07:18.740> the<00:07:19.220> same<00:07:19.430> weight

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
which is approximately the same weight

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.820 
which is approximately the same weight
the<00:07:19.729> same<00:07:20.120> caliber<00:07:20.600> the<00:07:21.140> loads<00:07:21.410> gonna<00:07:21.650> be<00:07:21.800> a

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830 
the same caliber the loads gonna be a

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.550 
the same caliber the loads gonna be a
little<00:07:21.979> lighter<00:07:22.220> but<00:07:22.970> black<00:07:23.570> powder<00:07:23.840> and

little lighter but black powder and

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.900 
little lighter but black powder and
we'll<00:07:24.710> compare<00:07:25.010> the<00:07:25.190> tube<00:07:25.400> because<00:07:25.760> they're

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910 
we'll compare the tube because they're

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.760 
we'll compare the tube because they're
both<00:07:26.090> about<00:07:26.180> basically<00:07:26.840> the<00:07:26.960> same<00:07:27.140> weight<00:07:27.500> of
