regular skin when people get it cut the
bringing<00:00:31.400> together<00:00:31.579> of<00:00:31.849> the<00:00:32.090> two<00:00:32.119> pieces<00:00:32.599> of

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
bringing together of the two pieces of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.530 
bringing together of the two pieces of
skin<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.740> body<00:00:33.950> puts<00:00:34.280> layers<00:00:34.579> of<00:00:34.910> collagen

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
skin the body puts layers of collagen

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.930 
skin the body puts layers of collagen
underneath<00:00:35.989> there<00:00:36.470> so<00:00:37.130> there's<00:00:37.460> layer<00:00:37.730> and

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
underneath there so there's layer and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.550 
underneath there so there's layer and
layer<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:38.120> layer<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:38.450> layer<00:00:38.630> of<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:39.020> thicker

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
layer and layer and layer of a thicker

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.010 
layer and layer and layer of a thicker
type<00:00:39.890> of<00:00:40.160> skin<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.210> what<00:00:41.329> it<00:00:41.450> actually<00:00:41.600> means

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
type of skin so what it actually means

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.560 
type of skin so what it actually means
is<00:00:42.379> that<00:00:42.410> as<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:43.129> ink<00:00:43.340> is<00:00:43.550> going<00:00:43.760> into<00:00:44.149> the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
is that as the ink is going into the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.319 
is that as the ink is going into the
scar<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.890> are<00:00:46.039> going<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.370> get<00:00:46.520> a<00:00:46.550> different

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
scar you are going to get a different

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.740 
scar you are going to get a different
effect<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:48.500> regular<00:00:49.190> skin<00:00:49.609> and<00:00:49.850> that's<00:00:50.269> mainly

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
effect to regular skin and that's mainly

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.119 
effect to regular skin and that's mainly
because<00:00:51.019> of<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.460> layers<00:00:52.730> there<00:00:53.269> so<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:54.800> can

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
because of the layers there so you can

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.939 
because of the layers there so you can
get<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.550> tattoo<00:00:56.239> over<00:00:56.960> a<00:00:56.989> scar

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
get a tattoo over a scar

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.849 
get a tattoo over a scar
however<00:00:58.940> it's<00:00:59.660> not<00:01:00.079> going<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.410> look<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.829> same

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
however it's not going to look the same

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.509 
however it's not going to look the same
as<00:01:01.519> your<00:01:02.149> normal<00:01:02.420> skin<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.559> it's<00:01:03.800> important<00:01:04.370> in

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
as your normal skin so it's important in

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.400 
as your normal skin so it's important in
the<00:01:04.640> design<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:05.150> your<00:01:05.510> tattoo<00:01:05.930> if<00:01:06.170> you're

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
the design of your tattoo if you're

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.830 
the design of your tattoo if you're
going<00:01:06.620> to<00:01:06.710> have<00:01:06.830> a<00:01:06.860> line<00:01:07.340> perhaps<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:08.510> have<00:01:08.690> it

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
going to have a line perhaps to have it

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
going to have a line perhaps to have it
all<00:01:09.230> going<00:01:09.650> along<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.370> scar<00:01:10.700> at<00:01:10.970> one<00:01:11.210> point

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
all going along the scar at one point

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.950 
all going along the scar at one point
but<00:01:12.860> if<00:01:13.130> you're<00:01:13.580> having<00:01:13.760> a<00:01:13.909> large<00:01:14.180> area<00:01:14.570> of

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
but if you're having a large area of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.100 
but if you're having a large area of
color<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.979> might<00:01:16.340> not<00:01:16.670> look<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.000> best<00:01:17.570> having

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
color it might not look the best having

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.130 
color it might not look the best having
you<00:01:18.829> know<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.490> regular<00:01:20.030> skin<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.900> bit<00:01:21.049> of

you know the regular skin and a bit of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.440 
you know the regular skin and a bit of
scar<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.979> colors<00:01:22.369> may<00:01:22.549> not<00:01:22.759> match<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.299> may

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
scar the colors may not match and it may

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.749

not<00:01:23.570> look<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.960> best<00:01:24.200> have<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.040> talk<00:01:25.369> with<00:01:25.399> your

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
not look the best have a talk with your

tattooist and get their opinion and
that's<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.630> really<00:01:30.020> good<00:01:30.170> way<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.409> go<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:31.310> other

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
that's a really good way to go the other

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.760 
that's a really good way to go the other
thing<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.729> that<00:01:31.759> scars<00:01:32.240> change<00:01:32.720> over<00:01:33.200> time<00:01:33.439> so

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
thing is that scars change over time so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.980 
thing is that scars change over time so
a<00:01:33.799> new<00:01:34.159> scar<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.790> very<00:01:35.210> very<00:01:35.420> different<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.960> a

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
a new scar is very very different to a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.859 
a new scar is very very different to a
scar<00:01:36.320> that's<00:01:36.500> two<00:01:36.890> years<00:01:37.130> old<00:01:37.369> if<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.600> scar
