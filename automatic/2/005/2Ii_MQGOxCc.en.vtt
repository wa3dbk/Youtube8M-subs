00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:08.450
 beautiful modaris and 9 welcome this new one 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.430
 spot light today we talk in the fashion that 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.440
 many have requested me and that many 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.970
 you were waiting for this is the outsider 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.260
 I saw the comments of the last video 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.830
 everyone was asking me why she was doing this 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.930
 14.7 had been updated 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.869
 I explain the creatures briefly 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.330
 decided not to update this fashion 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:33.980
 because we say to previous versions 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.190
 at 1 point 4.7 there were a lot of them 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.010
 last very little while the 14.7 lasts 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.989
 a lot and type a month compared to 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.329
 others and therefore created the decision of 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:49.370
 develop to update the mode a 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.780
 this version and so we say it was 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.040
 also a strategic move because it has 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.719
 received many downloads and at least second 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.390
 me anyway this way as you see 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:06.319
 adds minecraft not a thing 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.369
 material but let's say transform 

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:13.670
 just so I didn't want football 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:19.850
 wait to replace a term 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:23.630
 adequate and let's say it makes the water 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.270
 sony can be added more real 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.609
 bulla gls of ours of this 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:36.139
 however clds mistake scheider renders 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:38.240
 minecraft very real thing I can't 

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:41.389
 do because already so minecraft mino 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.889
 slow and still if you see how you see it 

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:45.079
 very well the mod 

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:46.700
 by the way if we go there if we end up there 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.969
 in water 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.029
 this will reflect our silhouette e 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.770
 same thing also with the sun as you see 

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:56.630
 I'm tile saw his first and so 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.249
 you don't see it so well 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.569
 and excuse me if in this video I am that 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:08.360
 I know what it is so I will forgive and a 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.530
 video made very fast because it is practical 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.630
 the professor 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.390
 and asked us to do things like that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.260
 a site and so I'm doing this site 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.090
