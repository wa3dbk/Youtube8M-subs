00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
do you make of the decision to have that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.289 
do you make of the decision to have that
team<00:01:08.820> time<00:01:09.060> trial<00:01:09.360> quite<00:01:09.869> late<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> race

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
team time trial quite late in the race

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
team time trial quite late in the race
it's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.619> it'll<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.680> difficult<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> for

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
it's a it'll be difficult for the for

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.620 
it's a it'll be difficult for the for
the<00:01:15.000> riders<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:16.070> we<00:01:17.070> you've<00:01:17.790> gone<00:01:18.000> you've<00:01:18.420> sort

the riders to we you've gone you've sort
of<00:01:18.659> moved<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.140> far<00:01:19.320> into<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.860> into<00:01:20.189> the

tool by that point people's recovery is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.480 
tool by that point people's recovery is
very<00:01:21.869> different<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.680> it'll<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.189> it'll<00:01:23.400> be

the fact that time bonuses are back I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.070 
the fact that time bonuses are back I
mean<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.670> could<00:02:13.820> be<00:02:13.850> crucial<00:02:14.270> for<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.420> it's

certainly<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.760> think<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.240> good<00:02:17.390> someone

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
certainly I like I think a good someone

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.810 
certainly I like I think a good someone
like<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.320> Volvo<00:02:18.740> name<00:02:18.980> for<00:02:19.190> example<00:02:19.610> might<00:02:19.730> be

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
like a Volvo name for example might be

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.460 
like a Volvo name for example might be
able<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:19.970> take<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> few<00:02:20.390> seconds<00:02:20.810> there<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.290> and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
able to take a few seconds there and and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.590 
able to take a few seconds there and and
not<00:02:22.190> having<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.640> time<00:02:22.970> trial<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.480> will

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
not having the time trial that will

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.570 
not having the time trial that will
maybe<00:02:23.810> maybe<00:02:24.620> that'll<00:02:24.920> balance<00:02:25.190> things<00:02:25.400> out<00:02:25.520> a

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
maybe maybe that'll balance things out a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.210 
maybe maybe that'll balance things out a
little<00:02:25.760> bit<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.120> ran<00:02:27.050> on<00:02:27.230> pure<00:02:27.680> climber<00:02:28.010> will

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
little bit we ran on pure climber will

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.670 
little bit we ran on pure climber will
be<00:02:28.280> taking<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:29.690> able<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.900> take<00:02:30.050> back<00:02:30.230> seconds

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
be taking be able to take back seconds

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.200 
be taking be able to take back seconds
you<00:02:30.770> know<00:02:30.860> because<00:02:31.190> it's<00:02:31.580> more<00:02:31.760> adapted<00:02:32.090> for

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
you know because it's more adapted for

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.460 
you know because it's more adapted for
the<00:02:32.300> riders<00:02:32.630> who<00:02:32.690> have<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.810> bit<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:32.960> a<00:02:33.110> sprint<00:02:33.380> as

Britain<00:02:36.590> but<00:02:37.250> some<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.850> find<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.900> let<00:02:39.290> that's<00:02:39.470> of

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
Britain but some I find it let that's of

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.050 
Britain but some I find it let that's of
course<00:02:39.710> gonna<00:02:39.890> be<00:02:40.070> interesting<00:02:40.580> difficult<00:02:40.970> to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
course gonna be interesting difficult to

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.210 
course gonna be interesting difficult to
get<00:02:41.210> through<00:02:41.420> but<00:02:42.080> it's<00:02:42.710> gonna<00:02:42.800> be<00:02:42.890> exciting

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
get through but it's gonna be exciting

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.430 
get through but it's gonna be exciting
to<00:02:43.460> watch<00:02:43.490> that's<00:02:43.850> for<00:02:44.000> sure<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:44.750> signed<00:02:45.140> in

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
to watch that's for sure but signed in

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.540 
to watch that's for sure but signed in
the<00:02:45.530> second<00:02:45.800> half<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.220> tour<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.520> think

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
the second half of the tour I think

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.740 
the second half of the tour I think
we'll<00:02:46.790> see<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:46.970> whole<00:02:47.090> turnaround<00:02:47.600> of

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
we'll see a whole turnaround of

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.970 
we'll see a whole turnaround of
whatever's<00:02:48.230> happened<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.590> first<00:02:48.770> ten

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
whatever's happened in the first ten

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.320 
whatever's happened in the first ten
days<00:02:49.010> because<00:02:49.460> it's<00:02:49.610> it's<00:02:49.910> really<00:02:50.030> come<00:02:50.240> to

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
days because it's it's really come to

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.240 
days because it's it's really come to
come<00:02:50.720> down<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.710> climbing<00:02:52.070> legs

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
come down to the the climbing legs

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.790 
come down to the the climbing legs
everyone<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.540> finally<00:02:53.960> um<00:02:54.260> who's<00:02:54.470> your<00:02:54.620> tip

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.610 
everyone and finally um who's your tip
for<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.010> victory<00:02:55.900> I'd<00:02:56.900> like<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.200> think<00:02:57.350> when

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
for the victory I'd like to think when

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.030 
for the victory I'd like to think when
Shinzo<00:02:57.920> nibble<00:02:58.220> II<00:02:58.310> as<00:02:59.020> a<00:03:00.020> live<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:00.500> close<00:03:00.740> by

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
Shinzo nibble II as a live so close by

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.620 
Shinzo nibble II as a live so close by
to<00:03:01.100> me<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:01.520> I<00:03:01.550> think<00:03:01.670> when<00:03:02.000> they're<00:03:02.180> going<00:03:02.510> to

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
to me but I think when they're going to

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.120 
to me but I think when they're going to
the<00:03:02.780> second<00:03:03.080> half<00:03:03.230> we<00:03:03.380> can't<00:03:03.590> discount

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
the second half we can't discount

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.610 
the second half we can't discount
Quinn<00:03:04.460> Tanner<00:03:04.730> at<00:03:04.940> all<00:03:05.090> with<00:03:05.570> so<00:03:05.750> many<00:03:05.870> that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
Quinn Tanner at all with so many that

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.470
