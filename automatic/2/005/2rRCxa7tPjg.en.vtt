00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.249
 they need here is because they are ready 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.049
 so we can see the last movie of the 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:10.610
 anime month and manga of horror and day 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.080
 today I bring you the most unknown of 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.660
 all that we had to review this month 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.340
 of takashi miike director of harakiri la 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.050
 death of a samurai essalud vote 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.870
 humiliation filmic time the visitor q 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.340
 we have shirt by hand author shirt command 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.260
 on youtube and tells us the story of 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.970
 this station box that is in a 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.860
 normal school day as boring as 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.720
 always but things take a turn 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.670
 unexpected when the head of his 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.679
 professor exploded him along with his others 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.359
 comrades are suddenly forced to 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.190
 play a variety of games 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.109
 children that involve death and 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.969
 dismember me first think you should 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.100
 say I saw the movie before it will read 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.989
 the manga and personally the manga does not 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.929
 liked for nothing since his style of 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.210
 I draw the rhythm characters all 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.949
 The manga seemed quite deficient 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.839
 has too much fan service and the 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.289
 history is not taken with enough 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.909
 seriousness 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.530
 instead takashi miike is one of his 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.510
 directors that sometimes give me a lot 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.949
 taste and sometimes just not the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.469
 I understand and I think this time 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.970
 I am between am after seeing the juvenile 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.920
 and something silly that tells the story 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.890
 The manga is good and it's good 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.930
 a little more seriousness and good pace of 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.090
 hand of takashi miike starting from the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.310
 principle strongly with what you most 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.750
 like to takashi miike the blood the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.520
 movie progresses according to our 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.290
 protagonists are finishing the games 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.299
 mortals and really are these that 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.799
 they keep all the weight of the movie if 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.360
 the flights that they submit to our 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.670
 protagonists are good movie 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.409
 it improves and gets a lot of attention but 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.030
 then there are ones that simply make 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.340
 the film decays and everything goes to 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.710
 fret undoubtedly the best are those of 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.750
 beginning and the last but one being all 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.640
 the others from the most boring to 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.840
 the passable the special effects of 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.729
 our movie have a role 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.500
 important since most of the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.090
 games need a lot of effects 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.250
 special and convince approach to 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.770
 the games the thing is not realistic 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.330
 but rather surrealism 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.850
 neither can we expect that the thing 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.259
 see or completely real if there are ones 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.240
 moments when the effects leave 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.530
 much to be desired but moments like 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.720
 first test which undergo 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.759
 our protagonists really we 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.440
 they leave with a good taste all the 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.269
 movie is based on seeing how our 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.220
 protagonists are going to advance they are going to leave 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.740
 of this situation but bad point of 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.890
 this movie is that really 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.170
 we are interested in why they are there 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.240
 from the beginning the film starts and 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.160
 it ends and all these shits happen 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.450
 it just does not matter a fuck the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.640
 Most of the actions are 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.530
 simply passable had one or another 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.420
 overreacts character but nothing that 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.860
 distract too much the music is another 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.250
 point where there is not much to say 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.080
 because it is there however it is a 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.450
 approach to a genre like cinema 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.610
 pretty interesting asian and its 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.620
 proper cutting and a little bit of 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.960
 suspense plus it has a premise 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.270
 that attracts enough said all this 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.980
 I will give changes to the command youtube 17 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.530
 I would recommend that you take a look 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.990
 alone or with friends they will enjoy it 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.790
 I think it bores them, but yes, their 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.950
 only potential to scare is the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.690
 blood but we are on the internet by god 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.880
 see heads exploding is the bread of each 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.280
 day yet I would recommend that you throw him 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.420
 a look because bad is not I am mute 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.520
