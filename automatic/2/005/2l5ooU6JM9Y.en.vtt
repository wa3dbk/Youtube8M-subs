00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
pencil and that actually works out

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.770 
pencil and that actually works out
pretty<00:01:10.100> good<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.670> would<00:01:11.120> probably<00:01:11.450> not

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
pretty good I would probably not

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.830 
pretty good I would probably not
recommend<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.470> on<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:13.000> random<00:01:14.000> orbit<00:01:14.360> sander

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
recommend it on a random orbit sander

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.830 
recommend it on a random orbit sander
maybe<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:15.619> dis<00:01:16.550> sander<00:01:17.150> or<00:01:17.180> something<00:01:17.750> like

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
maybe a dis sander or something like

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.690 
maybe a dis sander or something like
that<00:01:17.900> but<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:18.860> worked<00:01:19.190> out<00:01:19.280> pretty<00:01:19.550> well

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
that but this worked out pretty well

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.560 
that but this worked out pretty well
actually

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
actually

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.960

painters tape just put it on the drill
bit<00:03:41.519> attach<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.870> two<00:03:43.049> pieces<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:44.030> now<00:03:45.030> we

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
bit attach the two pieces and now we

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.539 
bit attach the two pieces and now we
have<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.750> little<00:03:45.930> flap<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:47.069> tells<00:03:47.310> us

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
have this little flap and this tells us

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.390 
have this little flap and this tells us
moving<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:49.260> tells<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.680> where<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.129> want<00:03:50.340> to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
moving it tells you where you want to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.699 
moving it tells you where you want to
stop<00:03:50.609> drilling<00:03:51.030> at<00:03:51.449> the<00:03:51.659> end<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.139> and<00:03:52.349> you

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
stop drilling at the end of this and you

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.399 
stop drilling at the end of this and you
can<00:03:52.859> make<00:03:53.010> perfect<00:03:53.459> holes<00:03:53.669> every<00:03:54.000> time<00:03:54.409> for

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409
