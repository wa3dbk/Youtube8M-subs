00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that tied up nope try it again one more

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:04.570 
that tied up nope try it again one more
time

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.840 

and<00:02:05.120> of<00:02:05.330> course<00:02:05.360> you're<00:02:05.660> going<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:06.730> clip<00:02:07.730> off

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
and of course you're going to clip off

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.910 
and of course you're going to clip off
the<00:02:08.030> tag<00:02:08.270> in<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:08.869> there<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.170> go<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.740> is<00:02:10.030> a
