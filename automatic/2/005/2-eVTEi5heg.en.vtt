00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.100
 hello today we are going to learn how to make these 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.750
 five nail designs for beginners 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.000
 these are designs that do not need 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.040
 very complicated tools are you going to 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.559
 need an enamel to place of 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.419
 base for example I used white a 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.300
 enamel that have good coverage for 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:22.060
 that there is only one layer to cover your 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.870
 intensity and a little scissors let's see 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.060
 what we need to do 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.790
 to make the first figure we are going to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.380
 need a piece of chopped ribbon not 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.970
 it has to be very big because the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.940
 first way that we are going to do is a 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.460
 triangle first because the first 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.930
 diagonal click start the excess 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.600
 remaining tape so they were made to me 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.059
 easier to push the camera once 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.210
 that I pique the second half of the triangle 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.200
 I made sure to paste it very delicately 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.230
 at the base of lines for the following 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.600
 nails we are going to cut strips of the same 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.400
 size on the adhesive tape try that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.699
 those in the same nails that were 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.620
 size as similar as possible first 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.380
 We are going to start a band-aid and we're going to 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.480
 put vertically on a nail and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.510
 then another nail like the one in the middle we put 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.280
 two horizontal stripes finally with 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.050
 any piece of tape 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.050
 let's cover the diagonal of a nail 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.930
 Then I had to do something that 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.360
 unfortunately it was not recorded by I tried 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.980
 do as a kind of zig zag that does not 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.170
 I was quite well, I promise 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.620
 perfect this technique and I create a 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.170
 hairline on the fish on that nail 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.510
 and how can you see the next step was 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.330
 and start applying the enamel on 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.190
 the nails use a paint that is 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.920
 quite opaque is to say that only 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.750
 need a layer because in what 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.100
 you finish painting you should not start the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.590
 adhesive 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.360
 Sometimes it can happen to you 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.670
 a bit of white malt as it happened to me 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.000
 on this first doll or how are you going to see 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.280
 later , some nails were damaged 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.470
 because blue was transferred to part of 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.330
 where there should not be blue but this is 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.390
 something that can be solved very 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.540
 easily in the end it is the same for 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.200
 all nails paint the union with a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.810
 polish of the color that I have chosen and in 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.640
 what you finish tearing it 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.360
 You will see that it is very easy to do it 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.360
 with the non-dominant hand 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.180
 [Music] 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.180
 Y 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.060
 and this is the final result of this 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.460
 first part now let it dry a 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.490
 little bit and we can start to repair with 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.560
 a toothpick in my case just not 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.290
 are you solving it with fault 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.910
 ingredients and the white enamel but in 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.350
 if it is not necessary also what 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.780
 you can do with the enamel the other 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.200
 color to clean the details of the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.200
 corners 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.919

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.110
 [Music] 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.450
 do not 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.490
 let it dry a prudential time and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.620
 then apply a gloss coat 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.830
 protector if you wait for the time 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.200
 enough the blue and the white do not go 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.020
 to mix the black is used for this 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.360
 design with much more care and expect a 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.449
 little more time for at least half an hour 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.449

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:59.980
 [Music] 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.190
 and ready with these four tools 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.349
 we create five beautiful and easy designs 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.360
 of fingerprints if you liked this video not 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.459

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.190
