00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.279
 second video on your boots 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.629
 it follows the first in that 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.090
 here I will explain how to do 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.160
 of your character a bot and especially 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.139
 how to create a journey you need to know 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.849
 that the journey is very important in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.010
 effect it is this one that will determine 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.680
 if your boss is going to fight move or 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.660
 harvest 100 ride the bot is only used to 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.949
 nothing before starting all over again I 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.140
 advise you to create a new 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 character or bring up yours to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.560
 carnage when I think it's a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.039
 very good training ground for 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.630
 boots 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.250
 more you can follow tutorial at the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.500
 letter so once characters 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 created to mount connect it to your boots 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.570
 as explained in the first video 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.309
 place it on the map 03 embodies so 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.540
 the exit of the temple I think you do not 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.370
 is not unknown now that everything is 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.440
 ready let's start by creating the first 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.940
 journey everything will be a simple trip from 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.149
 moving for now for that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.590
 open a notepad enter move will open 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.180
 parenthesis and close the parenthesis I 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.039
 will go to the line open a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.770

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.439
 once loaded trips just 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.770
 start it so that the character the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.570
 pike 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.259
 I will do a little demonstration 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.850
 my character is here andrey when I 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.970
 start the route by clicking on the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.720
 action arrow start the ride the one 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.250
 we are moving case exchange we come 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.790
 to make a card change 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.299
 basic 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.939
 we're going a little full-bodied things for 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.329
 this open the notepad again and 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.390
 add a line between 0.3 right and 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.649
 the closed brace register your 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.180
 current position so 1.3 and the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.520
 left direction it takes this line 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.520
 added save the loaded file on 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.539
 again 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.099
 and start the ride you can see 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:17.050
 that the character fernand the returns 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:19.000
 on both cards were only at the 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.590
 end of this tutorial I explained to you 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.080
 how to use the move function 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.660
 of course there are others for the 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.790
 fight and for the harvest but I do not 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.989
 explains ray not here the video lasted 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.209
 for far too long would 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.590
 maybe the subject of a second video 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.930
 in the meantime I stay at your 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.670
 provision on the forum reality game 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.090
 voice over twitter for all your 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.019
 Questions 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.819
 know that the bot will surely be pean 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.620
 early 2013 with the final version I 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.630
 therefore advise you to take advantage of a 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.620
 maximum now do not abuse 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.620
 boots and good game to all
