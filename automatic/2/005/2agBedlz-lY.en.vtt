00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
use with alpha beyblades it's good for

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.430 
use with alpha beyblades it's good for
our<00:03:17.740> attackers<00:03:18.250> but<00:03:18.480> unfortunately<00:03:19.480> i<00:03:19.720> don't

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440

if<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.490> gets<00:03:24.580> knocked<00:03:24.850> off<00:03:25.030> balance<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:26.410> can

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
if it gets knocked off balance it can

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.310 
if it gets knocked off balance it can
scrape<00:03:27.370> with<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.790> little<00:03:28.030> triangle<00:03:28.840> points

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
scrape with the little triangle points

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.840 
scrape with the little triangle points
there<00:03:29.500> or<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:29.890> actual<00:03:30.040> ring<00:03:30.340> itself<00:03:32.850> other

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
there or the actual ring itself other

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.700

than that i couldn't show you what it
looks<00:03:35.740> like<00:03:36.070> on<00:03:36.220> other<00:03:36.400> wheels<00:03:37.650> see<00:03:38.650> if<00:03:38.710> i<00:03:38.800> can

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
looks like on other wheels see if i can

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.680 
looks like on other wheels see if i can
take<00:03:39.130> this<00:03:39.250> path<00:03:39.550> one<00:03:39.790> hand<00:03:40.060> also<00:03:40.390> i<00:03:40.570> don't

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
take this path one hand also i don't

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.770 
take this path one hand also i don't
have<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.290> tripod<00:03:41.650> for<00:03:42.010> this<00:03:42.130> camera<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:42.780> the

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
have a tripod for this camera so the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.970 
have a tripod for this camera so the
videos<00:03:44.140> are<00:03:44.260> going<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:44.410> be<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.530> bit<00:03:44.740> hard<00:03:44.770> to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
videos are going to be a bit hard to

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.500 
videos are going to be a bit hard to
make<00:03:45.280> oh<00:03:47.670> wait<00:03:48.670> yeah<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:48.880> could<00:03:49.120> just<00:03:49.270> lift<00:03:49.420> that

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
make oh wait yeah I could just lift that

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.870 
make oh wait yeah I could just lift that
on<00:03:49.720> all<00:03:50.140> right<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:52.960> we<00:03:53.140> see<00:03:53.460> so<00:03:54.460> you<00:03:54.520> can<00:03:54.670> chuck

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
on all right and we see so you can chuck

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.270 
on all right and we see so you can chuck
it<00:03:54.910> on<00:03:55.180> another<00:03:55.450> wheel<00:03:55.930> such<00:03:56.500> as<00:03:56.650> Earth<00:03:57.780> it's<00:03:58.780> I

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
it on another wheel such as Earth it's I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.640 
it on another wheel such as Earth it's I
don't<00:04:00.280> know<00:04:00.340> if<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.490> guys<00:04:00.640> can<00:04:00.700> tell<00:04:01.120> but<00:04:01.650> it's

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
don't know if you guys can tell but it's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.800 
don't know if you guys can tell but it's
slightly<00:04:02.980> bigger<00:04:03.480> not<00:04:04.480> much

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.650 

looks<00:04:10.810> very<00:04:10.870> useful<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.640> has<00:04:12.640> some<00:04:13.270> potential

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
looks very useful and has some potential

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.690 
looks very useful and has some potential
for<00:04:14.170> defense<00:04:14.530> combinations<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.490> don't

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
for defense combinations and I don't
