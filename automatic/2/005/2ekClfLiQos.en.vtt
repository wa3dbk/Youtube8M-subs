00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.829
 video bay 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.090
 The first thing I'm going to do is base 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.360
 apply a pre base on my eyelid in 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.740
 this case I am using a comb in 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.950
 the skin environment 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.939
 apply a white base on all the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.720
 eyelid I will use a jumbo this is 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.670
 of bayamÃ³n 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.040
 it's the white tone 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.950
 and with the heat of my fingers I'm going to 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.670
 blur in the same way step is 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.920
 apply a white line of gray type and 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.390
 I'm going to apply it with an eyeliner 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.390
 liquid in white tone 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.440
 next I'm going to take my palette of 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.350
 120 colors and with this blue 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.380
 with a brush to blur I'll 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.920
 mark above the white line that 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.920
 I already did 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.200
 I'm going to take a red shadow this is the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.200
 cherry of vissum 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.220
 and with a little mix and it gave me 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.220
 I'm going to wet it 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.180
 and I'm going to apply it in this part that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.180
 lack 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.970
 I will also place a glitter 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.030
 blue on the blue shadow and well then 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.330
 this is number 26 of visu I'm going to 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.800
 apply with a slightly larger brush 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.960
 but in the same way that it gives me 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.180
 stability when I put it, I will not put it 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.670
 in such a concentrated way as 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.750
 red but I'm going to try to make it look 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.750
 the more possible 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.170
 then I will place the same 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.900
 blue shadow that I put over my 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.019
 eyelid on the lower eyelid on the outside 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.299
 of the lash line and I'm going to 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.579
 blur after I'm going to outline my 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.000
 water line with an eyeliner these from 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:18.689
 essence is the long lasting and so good 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.180
 it's a blue eyeliner and they last a lot 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.389
 very good and very creamy is the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.090
 I recommend if you can get it 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.250
 the truth is very good and many come 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.620
 colors and it's also retractable so 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.330
 It is very good 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.959
 then the next one that I'm going to do 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.959
 is to delineate 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.560
 to mine above in filling my eyelashes 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.560
 and apply false eyelashes 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.990
 and well, this is the final result
