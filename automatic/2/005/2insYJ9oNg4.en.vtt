00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
and since day one I probably looked at

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.229 
and since day one I probably looked at
skateboarding<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.430> lot<00:00:56.580> differently<00:00:57.030> than

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
skateboarding a lot differently than

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.810 
skateboarding a lot differently than
most<00:00:57.390> people<00:00:57.750> because<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.080> that<00:00:58.820> going

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
most people because of that going

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
most people because of that going
against<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.330> grain<00:01:00.570> element<00:01:01.380> began<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
against the grain element began to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.000 
against the grain element began to
sponsor<00:01:02.130> girl<00:01:02.309> skateboarders

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
sponsor girl skateboarders

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.969 
sponsor girl skateboarders
Cory<00:01:04.850> was<00:01:05.089> so<00:01:05.390> inspired<00:01:05.870> by<00:01:06.050> what<00:01:06.229> Johnny<00:01:06.710> did

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
Cory was so inspired by what Johnny did

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.100 
Cory was so inspired by what Johnny did
but<00:01:07.790> she<00:01:07.940> wanted<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.270> create<00:01:08.570> something<00:01:08.810> more

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
but she wanted to create something more

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.600 
but she wanted to create something more
feminine<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.370> element<00:01:11.180> Eden<00:01:11.510> was<00:01:11.690> born

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
feminine and so element Eden was born

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.980 
feminine and so element Eden was born
and<00:01:13.610> I<00:01:13.700> think<00:01:13.940> not<00:01:14.090> only<00:01:14.119> meeting<00:01:14.570> Johnny<00:01:14.810> and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
and I think not only meeting Johnny and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.440 
and I think not only meeting Johnny and
seeing<00:01:15.290> how<00:01:15.590> he<00:01:16.310> took<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.670> plunge<00:01:16.880> building

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
seeing how he took the plunge building

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.469 
seeing how he took the plunge building
element<00:01:18.050> then<00:01:18.800> I<00:01:19.190> felt<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.850> strength<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.330> be

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
element then I felt the strength to be

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.830 
element then I felt the strength to be
able<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.720> do<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:20.960> also<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.790> I<00:01:22.820> did

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
able to do it also and so I did

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.300 
able to do it also and so I did
with<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.960> help<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.289> an<00:01:26.439> amazing<00:01:26.710> team<00:01:27.130> of
