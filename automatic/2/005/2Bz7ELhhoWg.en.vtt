watching<00:00:15.560> or<00:00:16.130> observing<00:00:16.700> the<00:00:16.910> eclipse<00:00:17.270> here

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
watching or observing the eclipse here

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.350 
watching or observing the eclipse here
in<00:00:17.660> Hong<00:00:17.810> Kong<00:00:18.940> over<00:00:19.940> there<00:00:20.119> is<00:00:20.690> the<00:00:20.900> Sun<00:00:22.360> and

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
in Hong Kong over there is the Sun and

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.350 
in Hong Kong over there is the Sun and
this<00:00:23.690> is<00:00:23.810> my<00:00:23.930> setup<00:00:24.790> over<00:00:25.790> here<00:00:25.820> I've<00:00:26.180> got<00:00:26.210> a

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
this is my setup over here I've got a

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.380 
this is my setup over here I've got a
pinhole<00:00:27.370> paper<00:00:28.370> I<00:00:28.520> guess<00:00:28.789> it's<00:00:29.030> a<00:00:29.060> pimple

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
pinhole paper I guess it's a pimple

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.860 
pinhole paper I guess it's a pimple
projector<00:00:29.780> and<00:00:30.760> there's<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:32.119> Eclipse<00:00:34.870> can't

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
projector and there's the Eclipse can't

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:45.940 
projector and there's the Eclipse can't
really<00:00:36.020> see<00:00:36.230> it<00:00:36.290> now<00:00:36.470> Oh

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.980 

well<00:00:46.550> that's<00:00:46.700> it<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.360> it's<00:00:47.840> going<00:00:47.900> to

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
well that's it and it's going to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.610 
well that's it and it's going to
continue<00:00:48.050> for<00:00:48.650> about<00:00:48.770> an<00:00:49.160> hour

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.910 

and<00:00:55.190> that's<00:00:55.340> our<00:00:55.610> solar<00:00:55.940> eclipse<00:00:56.420> july<00:00:57.079> twenty

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
and that's our solar eclipse july twenty

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.850 
and that's our solar eclipse july twenty
second<00:00:58.510> 2009<00:01:01.750> in<00:01:02.750> this<00:01:02.960> video<00:01:03.260> i'm<00:01:03.500> going<00:01:03.800> to

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
second 2009 in this video i'm going to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.890 
second 2009 in this video i'm going to
show<00:01:03.949> you<00:01:04.100> how<00:01:04.250> to<00:01:04.460> use<00:01:04.549> a<00:01:04.729> pinhole<00:01:05.390> projector

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
show you how to use a pinhole projector

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.130 
show you how to use a pinhole projector
and<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.710> mirror<00:01:07.009> projector<00:01:07.610> this<00:01:08.509> is<00:01:08.690> a<00:01:08.720> pinhole

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
and a mirror projector this is a pinhole

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.499 
and a mirror projector this is a pinhole
projector<00:01:09.560> it's<00:01:10.220> basically<00:01:10.640> just<00:01:10.759> a<00:01:11.090> piece<00:01:11.479> of

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
projector it's basically just a piece of

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.359 
projector it's basically just a piece of
card<00:01:11.869> with<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.229> small<00:01:12.560> hole<00:01:12.800> cutting<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.250> them

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
card with a small hole cutting in them

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.149 
card with a small hole cutting in them
in<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.610> middle<00:01:13.880> what<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.810> do<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:15.740> hold<00:01:16.009> it

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
in the middle what you do is you hold it

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.399 
in the middle what you do is you hold it
up<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.399> light<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.930> look<00:01:17.930> at<00:01:18.080> its<00:01:18.200> shadow

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
up to the light and look at its shadow

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.080 
up to the light and look at its shadow
and<00:01:18.710> that<00:01:19.040> are<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:19.580> you'll<00:01:19.790> see<00:01:19.970> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
and that are you so that you'll see the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.960 
and that are you so that you'll see the
eclipse<00:01:20.920> this<00:01:21.920> here<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.520> mirror<00:01:22.880> of

in<00:01:45.679> the<00:01:45.800> 21st<00:01:46.250> century<00:01:46.569> here<00:01:47.569> in<00:01:47.659> Hong<00:01:47.840> Kong<00:01:48.080> we

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
in the 21st century here in Hong Kong we

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.529 
in the 21st century here in Hong Kong we
will<00:01:48.710> only<00:01:48.830> get<00:01:49.069> experience<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.880> partial<00:01:50.330> solar

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
will only get experience a partial solar

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.749 
will only get experience a partial solar
eclipse<00:01:50.659> instead<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.770> total<00:01:52.130> solar<00:01:52.280> eclipse

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
eclipse instead of a total solar eclipse

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.910 
eclipse instead of a total solar eclipse
this<00:01:53.539> means<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.020> weather<00:01:54.200> will<00:01:54.500> get<00:01:54.649> cooler

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
this means the weather will get cooler

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.690 
this means the weather will get cooler
but<00:01:55.580> not<00:01:55.759> much<00:01:55.970> darker<00:01:57.100> however<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:58.399> great

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
but not much darker however this great

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.070 
but not much darker however this great
weather<00:01:58.910> here<00:01:59.270> will<00:01:59.599> make<00:01:59.750> for<00:01:59.989> a<00:02:00.020> very

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.190 

what<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.790> have<00:02:19.000> here<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.450> piece<00:02:19.689> of<00:02:19.750> white

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
what I have here is a piece of white

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.509 
what I have here is a piece of white
paper<00:02:20.230> stuck<00:02:21.099> to<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.340> wall<00:02:21.549> and<00:02:21.900> over<00:02:22.900> here<00:02:23.170> I

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
paper stuck to the wall and over here I

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.190 
paper stuck to the wall and over here I
have<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.549> Sun<00:02:24.909> going<00:02:25.329> under<00:02:25.750> going<00:02:25.870> and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
have the Sun going under going and

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.270 
have the Sun going under going and
partial<00:02:26.620> eclipse<00:02:27.720> what<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.750> do<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.230> get<00:02:30.040> another

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
partial eclipse what I do is get another

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.750 
partial eclipse what I do is get another
piece<00:02:30.489> of<00:02:30.519> paper<00:02:30.760> with<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> small<00:02:31.599> hole<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:31.900> it

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
piece of paper with a small hole in it

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.780 
piece of paper with a small hole in it
against<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.879> other<00:02:34.030> paper<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.430> can<00:02:36.609> see

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
against the other paper and you can see

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:50.690 
against the other paper and you can see
the<00:02:36.909> Eclipse

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:16.920 

to<00:02:51.700> get<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.880> larger<00:02:52.300> whole

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930
