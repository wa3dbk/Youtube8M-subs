this<00:02:03.600> case<00:02:03.869> up<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.140> we've<00:02:05.100> got<00:02:05.450> bubble<00:02:06.450> wrap

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
this case up here we've got bubble wrap

this case up here we've got bubble wrap
here<00:02:06.869> around<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> bits

here around the bits

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.890 
here around the bits
we've<00:02:08.899> got<00:02:09.819> diagrams<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.060> bits<00:02:11.239> no<00:02:11.510> actual

need to be able to change the bearings I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.949 
need to be able to change the bearings I
presume<00:02:19.489> I<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:20.300> see<00:02:20.450> there's<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.690> little<00:02:20.870> bit

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
presume I can see there's a little bit

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.979 
presume I can see there's a little bit
of<00:02:20.989> this<00:02:21.140> machine<00:02:21.500> grease<00:02:21.770> on<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.099> bearings<00:02:22.430> I

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
of this machine grease on the bearings I

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.330 
of this machine grease on the bearings I
probably<00:02:23.989> want<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.260> dampen<00:02:24.709> that<00:02:24.830> up<00:02:24.950> here<00:02:25.160> you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
probably want to dampen that up here you

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.559 
probably want to dampen that up here you
can<00:02:25.489> see<00:02:25.519> on<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.819> box<00:02:25.970> here's<00:02:26.269> a<00:02:26.360> little<00:02:26.510> bit

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
can see on the box here's a little bit

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.570 
can see on the box here's a little bit
of<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.690> yellowing<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> top<00:02:28.160> here<00:02:28.400> from<00:02:28.550> a

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
of a yellowing on the top here from a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.410 
of a yellowing on the top here from a
little<00:02:28.730> bit<00:02:28.819> of<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.940> machine<00:02:29.209> grease

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
little bit of the machine grease

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.930 
little bit of the machine grease
hopefully<00:02:30.260> that's<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.500> good<00:02:30.650> sign<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.130> if<00:02:31.819> I

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
hopefully that's a good sign and if I

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.640 
hopefully that's a good sign and if I
take<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.300> bits<00:02:32.480> out<00:02:32.660> here<00:02:32.930> okay<00:02:33.260> look<00:02:33.410> at<00:02:33.500> this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
take the bits out here okay look at this

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.339 
take the bits out here okay look at this

the middle right on top definitely tell
I<00:02:54.799> can<00:02:54.920> definitely<00:02:55.040> sense<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:56.000> small<00:02:56.420> a

I can definitely sense this small a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.110 
I can definitely sense this small a
faint<00:02:57.019> scent<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:58.430> packing<00:02:58.790> grease<00:02:58.970> or

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
faint scent of just packing grease or

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.270 
faint scent of just packing grease or
packing<00:02:59.420> oil<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:02.590> there's<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.769> baron

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
packing oil and there's the baron

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.160 
packing oil and there's the baron
he<00:03:04.730> said<00:03:04.910> we're<00:03:05.120> very<00:03:05.299> favorably<00:03:05.750> reviewed<00:03:05.900> on

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
he said we're very favorably reviewed on

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.289 
he said we're very favorably reviewed on
Amazon<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:06.799> I've<00:03:07.430> got<00:03:07.580> high<00:03:07.730> hopes<00:03:07.760> for<00:03:08.060> these

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
Amazon so I've got high hopes for these

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.789 
Amazon so I've got high hopes for these
and<00:03:08.569> at<00:03:09.340> about<00:03:10.340> $50<00:03:11.030> very<00:03:11.569> budget<00:03:12.019> price

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
and at about $50 very budget price

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.920 
and at about $50 very budget price
similar<00:03:13.340> sets<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.850> these<00:03:13.970> were<00:03:14.239> at<00:03:14.390> least<00:03:14.540> two

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
similar sets of these were at least two

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.500 
similar sets of these were at least two
to<00:03:15.140> three<00:03:15.170> times<00:03:15.440> more<00:03:16.040> than<00:03:16.430> what<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:16.940> paid<00:03:17.180> for

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
to three times more than what I paid for

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.150 
to three times more than what I paid for
this<00:03:17.570> set<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.380> I'm<00:03:18.440> hoping<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.829> this<00:03:18.920> works

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
this set so I'm hoping that this works

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.250 
this set so I'm hoping that this works
but<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:19.970> first<00:03:20.150> thing<00:03:20.299> I<00:03:20.359> notice<00:03:20.630> here<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:21.019> I'm

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
but the first thing I notice here is I'm

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.780 
but the first thing I notice here is I'm
going<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.410> least<00:03:21.620> make<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.280> cut<00:03:22.519> out<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.730> the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
going to least make a cut out of the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.120 
going to least make a cut out of the
back<00:03:22.970> shows<00:03:23.810> all<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.230> critical<00:03:24.709> dimensions

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
back shows all the critical dimensions

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.280 
back shows all the critical dimensions
that<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.340> may<00:03:25.459> want<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:25.910> for<00:03:26.510> how<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.660> bit<00:03:26.870> for

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
that I may want and for how the bit for

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.319 
that I may want and for how the bit for
how<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.410> bits<00:03:27.620> cut<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.280> then<00:03:29.030> just<00:03:29.209> go<00:03:29.299> ahead

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
how the bits cut and then just go ahead

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.910 
how the bits cut and then just go ahead
and<00:03:29.540> place<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:29.720> inside<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.380> top<00:03:30.560> of<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.739> box

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
and place that inside the top of the box

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.309 
and place that inside the top of the box
here<00:03:31.250> which<00:03:32.060> appears<00:03:32.690> like<00:03:32.780> it's<00:03:33.049> gonna<00:03:33.140> need

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
here which appears like it's gonna need

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.470 
here which appears like it's gonna need
a<00:03:33.380> little<00:03:33.560> bit<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:33.709> repair<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.940> fix<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.359> hinge

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
a little bit of repair to fix the hinge

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.819 
a little bit of repair to fix the hinge
on<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.780> back<00:03:35.959> so<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.230> little<00:03:36.380> disappointed

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
on the back so a little disappointed

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.559 
on the back so a little disappointed
with<00:03:36.889> that<00:03:36.950> but<00:03:37.819> got<00:03:37.970> high<00:03:38.090> hopes<00:03:38.239> for<00:03:38.420> this

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
with that but got high hopes for this

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.199 
with that but got high hopes for this
