00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.910
 hi how is my united and girls blogs 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:28.280
 it's already 2002 and this week once again it's 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.680
 a week of dressing up to meet 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.500
 the challenge and the mind the goal I think 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.750
 no one looks so-one like me in the end 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.580
 theme of the week is tips for the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.559
 back to school and the goals that I 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.390
 I got to be students a few months 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.820
 they have no idea how I miss the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.280
 school the first day of school should be 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.660
 you have nothing to do and the 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.760
 most of the things clear 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.430
 interrupting your teachers that I see 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.260
 as I am diverting in myself my first 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.289
 google back to school tips 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.109
 write down all your tasks 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.699
 so you do not forget to do it I am that 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.580
 the goal is that you will see that although the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.740
 we are not going to do it, but for 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.000
 at least we have them present no tip 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.369
 number 2 wears colored scissors 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.549
 and I pretend to listen because when those who 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.369
 they need them and they ask for them one of the 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.590
 more to lend and number three seeks 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.840
 take notes so you're going to avoid the one 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.869
 lend me your notebook to get copies 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.270
 or all the courses of number four of 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.280
 hansel internet at dawn because 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.979
 falling asleep in class is not going to take you 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.479
 nothing good apart if you do not arrive early to 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.300
 school can also go very wrong 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.240
 doing as your mom dante tips but 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.560
 after being a student I can say that 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.940
 these tips really work 5 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.520
 remember that teachers are always 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.549
 the authority do not argue them if not 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.429
 you want to leave losing numbers 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.600
 if you wear uniform feel very very very 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.939
 happy 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.530
 it matters how well and clean every day 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.299
 when it reaches the point where it does not 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.540
 you wear a uniform to school you start 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.690
 suffer because every day you wake up 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.450
 asking you and now that I 'm going to put 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.650
 I no longer know what number to avoid doing 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.050
 things that you know you 're wrong avoid being 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.959
 reported by known stupid no 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.660
 let them unfairly suspend you 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.569

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.239
 elementary school your colors and your 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.709
 notebooks because you never know who can 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.230
 be big size that you lower your 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.819
 notebooks or take off your pens or 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.120
 markers and so on 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.010
 tip very very very functional when you take 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.950
 notes to make you a little more 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.160
 interesting and if you have a very memory 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.110
 visual uses colors in this way you go to 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.930
 differentiate the topics and you will be able to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.600
 learn things in a more 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.370

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.540
