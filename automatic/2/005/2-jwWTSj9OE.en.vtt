trying to find a gift ok it's gonna be
something<00:01:26.070> similar<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> where<00:01:26.820> it's

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
something similar to that where it's

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
something similar to that where it's
just<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.270> an<00:01:27.509> episode<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
just like an episode then they get it to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649 
just like an episode then they get it to
them<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.180> it's<00:01:30.360> gonna<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
them and I just think it's gonna be a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.810 
them and I just think it's gonna be a
fun<00:01:30.869> episode<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.470> don't<00:01:31.680> expect<00:01:31.770> too<00:01:32.159> much<00:01:32.369> but

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
fun episode so don't expect too much but

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
fun episode so don't expect too much but
that<00:01:32.850> being<00:01:33.150> expect<00:01:33.630> more<00:01:33.840> in-depth<00:01:34.200> analysis

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that being expect more in-depth analysis

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.580

that's<00:03:21.760> what's<00:03:21.910> kind<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.090> probably<00:03:22.390> happen<00:03:22.690> at

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
that's what's kind of probably happen at

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.020 
that's what's kind of probably happen at
some<00:03:22.959> point<00:03:22.989> in<00:03:23.380> episode<00:03:24.160> 2<00:03:24.430> which<00:03:24.880> is

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
some point in episode 2 which is

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.759 
some point in episode 2 which is
eventually<00:03:25.300> gonna<00:03:25.540> lead<00:03:25.780> possibly<00:03:26.350> into<00:03:26.620> like

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
eventually gonna lead possibly into like

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.160 
eventually gonna lead possibly into like
episode<00:03:27.220> 6<00:03:27.519> or<00:03:27.670> 7<00:03:28.030> I'm<00:03:28.780> not<00:03:28.959> quite<00:03:29.140> sure

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
episode 6 or 7 I'm not quite sure

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.420 
episode 6 or 7 I'm not quite sure
because<00:03:29.410> these<00:03:29.800> titles<00:03:30.070> haven't<00:03:30.340> been

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
because these titles haven't been

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.180 
because these titles haven't been
confirmed<00:03:30.580> but<00:03:30.910> again<00:03:31.209> based<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.890> how<00:03:32.890> quickly

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
confirmed but again based on how quickly

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.610 
confirmed but again based on how quickly
things<00:03:33.430> are<00:03:33.610> happening<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:35.410> lack<00:03:35.590> of

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
things are happening and the lack of

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.320 
things are happening and the lack of
filler<00:03:36.040> which<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.610> good<00:03:36.820> thing<00:03:37.000> it's<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.300> good

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
filler which is a good thing it's a good

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.050

episodes<00:03:40.480> for<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.810> first<00:03:41.019> arc<00:03:41.290> hopefully<00:03:41.769> 24

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
episodes for the first arc hopefully 24

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.370

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.440 
confirmed so I'm hoping that every arc
it's<00:03:47.290> about<00:03:47.530> 24<00:03:47.920> episodes<00:03:48.310> long<00:03:48.519> maybe<00:03:48.790> 24<00:03:49.209> for

possibly made by a in the making god we
don't<00:04:10.510> know<00:04:10.690> exactly<00:04:10.950> okay<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.120> was<00:04:13.269> the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
don't know exactly okay so that was the

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.550 
don't know exactly okay so that was the
leak<00:04:13.630> let<00:04:13.930> me<00:04:13.989> know<00:04:14.080> in<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.170> comments<00:04:14.470> below

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
leak let me know in the comments below

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.070 
leak let me know in the comments below
what<00:04:14.799> you<00:04:14.920> guys<00:04:15.040> think<00:04:15.459> if<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.570> leaks<00:04:16.840> are

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
what you guys think if the leaks are

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.949 
what you guys think if the leaks are
true<00:04:17.530> then<00:04:18.310> you<00:04:19.150> know<00:04:19.239> what<00:04:19.390> to<00:04:19.479> expect

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
true then you know what to expect

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.680 
true then you know what to expect
and<00:04:20.109> if<00:04:20.530> they're<00:04:20.709> not<00:04:20.890> then<00:04:21.520> most<00:04:22.000> likely<00:04:22.479> if

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
and if they're not then most likely if

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.450 
and if they're not then most likely if
this<00:04:22.900> if<00:04:23.320> this<00:04:23.500> leaks<00:04:23.740> aren't<00:04:23.950> true

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
this if this leaks aren't true

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.120 
this if this leaks aren't true
most<00:04:25.000> likely

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
most likely

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.100 
most likely
we're<00:04:26.250> gonna<00:04:26.370> have<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.640> 24<00:04:27.120> episode<00:04:27.420> arc<00:04:27.630> it's

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
we're gonna have a 24 episode arc it's

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.720 
we're gonna have a 24 episode arc it's
gonna<00:04:28.260> be<00:04:28.440> more<00:04:28.590> filler<00:04:28.830> episodes<00:04:29.340> because

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
gonna be more filler episodes because

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.480 
gonna be more filler episodes because
based<00:04:30.180> on<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:30.510> league<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.960> just<00:04:31.140> kind<00:04:31.380> of

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
based on this league is just kind of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.440 
based on this league is just kind of
telling<00:04:32.490> us<00:04:32.640> things<00:04:33.000> are<00:04:33.090> happening<00:04:33.420> very

quickly things are escalating very

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.120 
quickly things are escalating very
quickly<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:36.210> mean<00:04:36.900> things<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.680> escalate<00:04:37.800> by

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
quickly I mean things to escalate by

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.080 
quickly I mean things to escalate by
episode<00:04:38.520> 5

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
episode 5

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.570

beaters<00:04:42.120> don't<00:04:42.360> fight<00:04:42.570> by<00:04:42.720> episode<00:04:43.110> 5<00:04:43.380> then

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
beaters don't fight by episode 5 then

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.980 
beaters don't fight by episode 5 then
possibly<00:04:44.580> they'll<00:04:44.760> fight<00:04:44.970> some<00:04:45.300> grabs<00:04:45.540> of<00:04:45.780> 10

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990
