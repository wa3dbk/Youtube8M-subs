00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to everything today i'm going to you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.350
 present a super easy art to do 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:13.830
 it is the flower a rat table in ounce 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:16.199
 barter so here's the dessert we 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.880
 are going to make a staircase or for 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.580
 to make this staircase in stanzas I 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.010
 just to climb my brush up 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.170
 in the brush axis I do not shift to 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.000
 the right and I go back up 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.250
 in the brush tail actually I'm doing 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 really a kind of staircase like 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.000
 the image you saw at the beginning when 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.040
 obviously as usual we do are 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.230
 degraded on the palette apparently 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.110
 then we make small stairs 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.360
 like that overlap so for that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.489
 I always start from the stairs of the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.079
 petal from left to right 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.289
 since we are on top of each other 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.430
 it's really easy and quick to do 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.280
 then once I whistled 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.800
 but here I take a pse of detail and I 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.390
 will accentuate the contours since 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.719
 it may be a bit difficult 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.699
 to make a tip well sharp 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.510
 so I accentuate a little bit the tip 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.670
 with the brush of details when I 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.530
 do that with my retail brush 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.860
 always I add a few drops to 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.560
 side so to make drops 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.180
 I shoot with my brush without pressing 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.180
 then I crush all of a sudden 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.310
 I then add some small dots 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.140
 then I'm going to stick a rhinestone in the middle 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.360
 and here it is already finished 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.820
 do not hesitate to come and show me on 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.950
 facebook what did you realize at 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.540
 from my videos it makes me great 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 pleasure 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.140
 then I tell you next friday 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.180
 for a new video I hope this 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.009
 tutorial you liked and really it's 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.350
 easy I had tested in training the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.810
 world has managed to do it so no it's 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.050
 really the flower is the table here at 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.050
 soon
