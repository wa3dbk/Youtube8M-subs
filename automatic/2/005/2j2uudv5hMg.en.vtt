00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.690 

so<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.840> do<00:02:53.050> like<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.430> makes<00:02:54.790> my<00:02:55.120> lashes<00:02:56.700> like

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
so I do like it it makes my lashes like

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.320 
so I do like it it makes my lashes like
volumous<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:59.110> only<00:02:59.590> issue<00:02:59.800> that<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.790> can<00:03:01.030> see

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
volumous the only issue that I can see

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.660 
volumous the only issue that I can see
is<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.660> like<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.989> brush<00:03:02.319> is<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.040> big<00:03:03.400> that

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
is that like the brush is so big that

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.839 
is that like the brush is so big that
it's<00:03:04.120> really<00:03:04.599> hard<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.680> get<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
it's really hard to get like to the

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:15.330 
it's really hard to get like to the
sides<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.690> like<00:03:07.989> in<00:03:08.760> here<00:03:09.760> as<00:03:10.000> well<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.830> I

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
sides and like in here as well and I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.860 
sides and like in here as well and I
like<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.670> do<00:03:15.819> my<00:03:16.030> lower<00:03:17.940> lashes<00:03:18.940> as<00:03:19.540> well

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
like to do my lower lashes as well

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.020 
like to do my lower lashes as well
because<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.860> just<00:03:21.099> makes<00:03:21.250> your<00:03:21.370> eyes<00:03:21.549> like<00:03:21.790> pop

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
because it just makes your eyes like pop

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.570 
because it just makes your eyes like pop
out<00:03:22.299> more<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.739> can<00:03:23.830> see<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.099> bit<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.430> a

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
out more so you can see a bit of a

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.300 
out more so you can see a bit of a
difference<00:03:24.940> for<00:03:25.599> sure<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:26.290> does<00:03:26.709> volume<00:03:27.160> eyes

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
difference for sure it does volume eyes

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.960 
difference for sure it does volume eyes
your<00:03:27.489> lashes<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.299> it<00:03:28.660> lengthens<00:03:29.349> them<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:30.549> I

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
your lashes and it lengthens them so I

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.509 
your lashes and it lengthens them so I
find<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.599> goes<00:03:31.840> on<00:03:34.440> light<00:03:35.489> like<00:03:36.489> you

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
find that it goes on light like you

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.819 
find that it goes on light like you
definitely<00:03:37.390> would<00:03:37.599> have<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.110> build<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.620> up

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
definitely would have to build this up

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.400 
definitely would have to build this up
for<00:03:39.099> sure<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.760> mean<00:03:40.510> that's<00:03:40.750> like<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.230> first

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
for sure I mean that's like the first

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:57.559 
for sure I mean that's like the first
code<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:42.010> did<00:03:42.819> that<00:03:43.030> like<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.690> many<00:03:43.840> times

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.380 

so<00:03:58.569> here<00:03:59.080> is<00:03:59.290> my<00:03:59.650> lashes<00:03:59.860> afterwards<00:04:00.819> after<00:04:01.360> I

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
so here is my lashes afterwards after I

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.309 
so here is my lashes afterwards after I
put<00:04:01.629> on<00:04:01.659> this<00:04:02.019> scandalous<00:04:02.739> flex<00:04:03.299> lycra

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
put on this scandalous flex lycra

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.369

Rimmel<00:04:08.909> so<00:04:09.909> my<00:04:10.030> review<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.450> this<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.989> do<00:04:11.519> like<00:04:12.519> it

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
Rimmel so my review of this I do like it

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.520 
Rimmel so my review of this I do like it
like<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.180> think<00:04:13.239> that<00:04:13.599> it<00:04:13.840> really<00:04:14.140> creates

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
like I think that it really creates

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.939 
like I think that it really creates
length<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.660> volume<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.959> only<00:04:17.410> thing<00:04:17.620> is<00:04:17.739> that

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
length and volume the only thing is that

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.400 
length and volume the only thing is that
with<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.760> brush<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.389> so<00:04:19.870> big<00:04:20.109> that<00:04:20.260> it's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
with the brush just so big that it's

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.280 
with the brush just so big that it's
really<00:04:20.769> hard<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.820> get<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.570> inner<00:04:22.810> corner

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
really hard to get to the inner corner

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.680 
really hard to get to the inner corner
and<00:04:23.530> then<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.860> outer<00:04:24.040> corner<00:04:24.460> as<00:04:24.639> well<00:04:25.270> when

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
and then the outer corner as well when

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.750 
and then the outer corner as well when
you're<00:04:25.840> putting<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.260> on<00:04:26.470> I<00:04:26.860> find<00:04:27.130> like<00:04:27.310> here<00:04:27.729> I

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
you're putting it on I find like here I

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.140 
you're putting it on I find like here I
have<00:04:28.260> if<00:04:29.260> you<00:04:29.350> can<00:04:29.470> see<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.250> touches<00:04:30.789> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
have if you can see like it touches the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.029 
have if you can see like it touches the
top<00:04:31.180> of<00:04:31.690> your<00:04:31.930> lid<00:04:32.139> so<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.410> would<00:04:32.590> have<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.889> get<00:04:33.010> a

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
top of your lid so I would have to get a

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.689 
top of your lid so I would have to get a
q-tip<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.639> then<00:04:33.760> take<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.120> off<00:04:35.550> but<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.669> is

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
q-tip and then take that off but it is

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.180 
q-tip and then take that off but it is
good<00:04:37.360> buildable<00:04:37.840> volume<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.500> I<00:04:38.800> mean<00:04:38.979> they're

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
good buildable volume and I mean they're

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.090 
good buildable volume and I mean they're
they're<00:04:40.030> lengthened<00:04:40.780> really<00:04:41.410> well<00:04:41.590> like<00:04:41.919> it

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
they're lengthened really well like it

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.909 
they're lengthened really well like it
really<00:04:42.460> lengthens<00:04:42.970> your<00:04:43.440> lashes<00:04:44.440> so<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:46.919> think

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
really lengthens your lashes so I think

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.890 
really lengthens your lashes so I think
that<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:48.160> would<00:04:48.550> give<00:04:48.760> this<00:04:49.000> like<00:04:49.270> an<00:04:49.419> 8<00:04:49.630> out<00:04:49.870> of

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
that I would give this like an 8 out of

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.670 
that I would give this like an 8 out of
10<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.729> I<00:04:51.729> do<00:04:52.020> like<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.169> and<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.380> think<00:04:53.410> I'm

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
10 and I do like it and I think I'm
