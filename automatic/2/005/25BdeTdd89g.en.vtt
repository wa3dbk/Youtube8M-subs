00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
okay so right leg is short by about

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.819 
okay so right leg is short by about
three<00:00:41.649> quarters<00:00:42.070> of<00:00:42.190> an<00:00:42.340> inch<00:00:43.230> goes<00:00:44.230> longer<00:00:44.710> in

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
three quarters of an inch goes longer in

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.740 
three quarters of an inch goes longer in
the<00:00:44.980> second<00:00:45.370> position<00:00:45.879> and<00:00:46.059> a<00:00:46.149> little<00:00:46.629> bit

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
the second position and a little bit

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.529 
the second position and a little bit
longer<00:00:46.960> than<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.260> third<00:00:47.469> position<00:00:47.710> so

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:06.980 

misalignment<00:00:52.539> down<00:00:52.750> in<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.199> pelvic<00:00:53.649> area

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.420 

we're<00:01:07.990> doing<00:01:08.200> this<00:01:08.320> real<00:01:08.590> line<00:01:08.860> in<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.130> spine

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
we're doing this real line in the spine

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.420 
we're doing this real line in the spine
so<00:01:09.730> those<00:01:09.909> nerves<00:01:10.360> can<00:01:11.160> communicate<00:01:12.160> to<00:01:12.340> the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
so those nerves can communicate to the

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.750 
so those nerves can communicate to the
muscles<00:01:12.940> obviously<00:01:13.690> so<00:01:13.900> he<00:01:13.930> can<00:01:14.230> be<00:01:14.350> out<00:01:14.530> of

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
muscles obviously so he can be out of

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.440 
muscles obviously so he can be out of
pain<00:01:15.930> feel<00:01:16.930> better<00:01:17.200> legs<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:17.890> even<00:01:18.130> look<00:01:19.030> feel

pain feel better legs and even look feel

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.410 
pain feel better legs and even look feel

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
hands we have more high velocity very

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.470 
hands we have more high velocity very
specific<00:04:42.320> controlled<00:04:43.320> velocity<00:04:44.100> of

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
specific controlled velocity of

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.020 
specific controlled velocity of
adjustment<00:04:45.480> that<00:04:45.630> helps<00:04:46.910> with<00:04:47.910> the
