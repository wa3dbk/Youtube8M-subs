I think kill streaks are a big part of
cold<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.549> especially<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.119> people<00:02:03.450> that

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
actually take the power out was to

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.709 
actually take the power out was to
actually<00:02:05.610> become<00:02:06.060> good<00:02:06.210> at<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> game<00:02:06.509> and

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
actually become good at the game and

argument<00:03:31.590> let's<00:03:32.010> go<00:03:32.940> ahead<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.090> assume<00:03:33.359> that

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
argument let's go ahead and assume that

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.180 
argument let's go ahead and assume that
most<00:03:34.079> of<00:03:34.319> this<00:03:34.410> chopper<00:03:34.680> going<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:34.889> get<00:03:35.010> down

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
most of this chopper going to get down

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.620 
most of this chopper going to get down
the<00:03:35.370> reason<00:03:35.609> this<00:03:35.700> chopper<00:03:36.000> gunner<00:03:36.180> stayed<00:03:36.450> up

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
the reason this chopper gunner stayed up

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.920 
the reason this chopper gunner stayed up
is<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.130> buildings<00:03:38.760> on<00:03:38.910> summit<00:03:39.329> step<00:03:39.599> kept

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
is one the buildings on summit step kept

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.449 
is one the buildings on summit step kept
me<00:03:40.079> safe<00:03:40.470> from<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.769> Rockets<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:41.370> they

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
me safe from the Rockets because they

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.759 
me safe from the Rockets because they
were<00:03:41.579> trying<00:03:41.819> to<00:03:41.970> shoot<00:03:42.120> me<00:03:42.299> down<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.780> two<00:03:43.739> I

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
were trying to shoot me down and two I

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.300 
were trying to shoot me down and two I
was<00:03:44.810> abused<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.900> chopper<00:03:46.109> gunner<00:03:46.410> over<00:03:46.769> 400

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.069 
times well actually over six hundred
times<00:03:49.620> if<00:03:49.769> you<00:03:49.829> count<00:03:49.919> ps3<00:03:50.609> as<00:03:50.700> well<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.209> I've

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
times if you count ps3 as well and I've

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.550

gotten pretty good with it but but
somebody<00:03:55.919> that<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.250> say<00:03:56.780> transition<00:03:57.780> from<00:03:57.930> a

something if you never if it does this

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.620 
something if you never if it does this
to<00:04:07.470> get<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.680> stay<00:04:07.859> in<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.010> air<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.430> think<00:04:09.299> since

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
to get to stay in the air I think since

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.089 
to get to stay in the air I think since
they've<00:04:09.780> made<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.230> killstreaks<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:10.919> much

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
they've made the killstreaks so much

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.680 
they've made the killstreaks so much
harder<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.549> get<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:12.030> should<00:04:12.239> get<00:04:12.480> extra

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
harder to get you should get extra

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.339 
harder to get you should get extra
flares<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:14.250> should<00:04:14.819> at<00:04:14.970> least<00:04:15.180> get<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.540> 4<00:04:15.959> maybe

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
flares you should at least get a 4 maybe

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.319 
flares you should at least get a 4 maybe
get<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.919> should<00:04:17.099> at<00:04:17.159> least<00:04:17.250> get<00:04:17.459> a<00:04:17.519> full<00:04:17.880> 20

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
get you should at least get a full 20

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.940 
get you should at least get a full 20
seconds<00:04:18.810> without<00:04:18.989> them<00:04:19.289> be<00:04:19.380> able<00:04:19.560> to

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
seconds without them be able to

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.700 
seconds without them be able to
shoot<00:04:20.070> your<00:04:20.460> flares<00:04:20.820> or<00:04:21.560> something<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.680> that

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
shoot your flares or something of that

shoot your flares or something of that
nature<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.190> was<00:04:23.670> chopping<00:04:23.880> last<00:04:24.240> 45<00:04:24.720> seconds<00:04:25.460> 20

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
nature I was chopping last 45 seconds 20

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.070 
nature I was chopping last 45 seconds 20
seconds<00:04:26.850> before<00:04:27.270> they<00:04:27.570> get<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.780> shoot<00:04:27.960> you

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
seconds before they get to shoot you

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.060 
seconds before they get to shoot you
down<00:04:28.640> kind<00:04:29.640> of<00:04:29.700> like<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.000> UAB<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:31.140> UAB<00:04:31.380> stands

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
down kind of like the UAB the UAB stands

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.330 
down kind of like the UAB the UAB stands
up<00:04:32.220> for<00:04:32.520> stands<00:04:33.480> up<00:04:33.600> for<00:04:33.750> 45<00:04:34.530> seconds<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.160> think

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
up for stands up for 45 seconds I think

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.270 
up for stands up for 45 seconds I think
yeah<00:04:35.520> 45<00:04:36.510> seconds<00:04:37.050> but<00:04:37.620> you're<00:04:37.830> only<00:04:37.920> able<00:04:38.130> to

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
yeah 45 seconds but you're only able to

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.850 
yeah 45 seconds but you're only able to
shoot<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.610> down<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:39.150> last<00:04:39.390> 25<00:04:40.050> seconds<00:04:40.590> of<00:04:40.680> its

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
shoot it down the last 25 seconds of its

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.550 
shoot it down the last 25 seconds of its
45<00:04:41.250> second<00:04:41.610> life<00:04:41.760> there's<00:04:42.450> 20<00:04:42.840> seconds<00:04:43.170> a<00:04:43.260> UAV

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
45 second life there's 20 seconds a UAV

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.300 
45 second life there's 20 seconds a UAV
that<00:04:43.920> can't<00:04:44.190> be<00:04:44.370> shot<00:04:44.640> down<00:04:45.290> so<00:04:46.290> right<00:04:47.280> there

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
that can't be shot down so right there

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.740 
that can't be shot down so right there
out<00:04:47.670> the<00:04:47.790> gate<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:49.710> mean<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.540> think<00:04:51.540> that's

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
out the gate and I mean I think that's

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.460 
out the gate and I mean I think that's
the<00:04:51.840> way<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.080> go<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.350> mean<00:04:52.770> if<00:04:53.450> why<00:04:54.450> give<00:04:54.750> kit<00:04:55.290> why

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
the way to go I mean if why give kit why

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.560 
the way to go I mean if why give kit why
give<00:04:55.710> rewards<00:04:56.400> if<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.730> don't<00:04:56.910> get<00:04:57.030> rewarded

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
give rewards if you don't get rewarded

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.010 
give rewards if you don't get rewarded
for<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.900> if<00:04:58.680> somebody<00:04:59.280> gave<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.550> fucking<00:05:00.210> nine

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
for it if somebody gave you fucking nine

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.650 
for it if somebody gave you fucking nine
kills<00:05:01.470> or<00:05:01.710> 11<00:05:02.040> kills<00:05:02.250> in<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.490> row<00:05:02.520> and<00:05:02.880> couldn't

kills or 11 kills in a row and couldn't

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.320 
kills or 11 kills in a row and couldn't
kill<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:03.990> you<00:05:04.530> should<00:05:04.830> get<00:05:05.010> rewarded<00:05:05.610> I<00:05:05.880> think

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
kill you you should get rewarded I think

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.730 
kill you you should get rewarded I think
