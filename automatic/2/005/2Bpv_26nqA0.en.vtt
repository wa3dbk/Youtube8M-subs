00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
think that's a good question it's all

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.330 
think that's a good question it's all
about<00:00:54.550> improving<00:00:55.600> performance<00:00:57.190> reducing<00:00:58.190> the

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
about improving performance reducing the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
about improving performance reducing the
risk<00:00:58.579> of<00:00:58.760> injury<00:00:58.910> and<00:01:00.010> education<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.820> more<00:01:02.120> we

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
risk of injury and education the more we

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.620 
risk of injury and education the more we
can<00:01:02.570> understand<00:01:03.170> about<00:01:03.440> how<00:01:03.950> horses<00:01:04.369> work<00:01:04.850> the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
can understand about how horses work the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.489 
can understand about how horses work the
better<00:01:05.899> we<00:01:06.350> can<00:01:06.380> ride<00:01:07.149> train<00:01:08.149> and<00:01:08.479> manage<00:01:09.020> them

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:09.499 
better we can ride train and manage them

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:12.219

Starr<00:01:30.799> wind<00:01:31.069> farm<00:01:31.429> you<00:01:32.209> can<00:01:32.389> see<00:01:32.630> we've

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
Starr wind farm you can see we've

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.649

painted<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.409> skeleton<00:01:34.159> on<00:01:34.369> both<00:01:34.909> sides<00:01:35.329> of

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
painted the skeleton on both sides of

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.050 
painted the skeleton on both sides of
the<00:01:35.779> horse<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.409> Danny<00:01:37.069> is<00:01:37.369> wearing<00:01:37.399> a

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
the horse and Danny is wearing a

the horse and Danny is wearing a
skeleton<00:01:38.779> suit<00:01:39.049> there<00:01:39.319> as<00:01:39.499> well

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
skeleton suit there as well

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.179 
skeleton suit there as well
so<00:01:40.729> you<00:01:40.789> can<00:01:41.090> really<00:01:41.450> begin<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:42.079> imagine<00:01:42.679> how

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
so you can really begin to imagine how

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.510 
so you can really begin to imagine how
the<00:01:43.729> horses<00:01:44.299> bones<00:01:44.749> are<00:01:45.200> moving<00:01:46.099> underneath

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
the horses bones are moving underneath

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.569 
the horses bones are moving underneath
the<00:01:46.849> skin<00:01:47.179> as<00:01:47.479> Danny's<00:01:48.169> riding<00:01:49.039> around<00:01:49.369> the

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
the skin as Danny's riding around the

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.620 
the skin as Danny's riding around the
arena<00:01:50.709> but<00:01:51.709> I<00:01:51.950> think<00:01:52.429> there's<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.999> few<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.389> you

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
arena but I think there's a few of you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.229 
arena but I think there's a few of you
perhaps<00:01:54.319> sitting<00:01:54.919> in<00:01:55.069> the<00:01:55.189> audience<00:01:55.459> thinking

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:56.239 
perhaps sitting in the audience thinking

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:59.019 
perhaps sitting in the audience thinking
well<00:01:56.810> how<00:01:57.259> does<00:01:57.319> this<00:01:57.770> go<00:01:58.130> how<00:01:58.399> is<00:01:58.429> this<00:01:58.729> going

00:01:59.019 --> 00:01:59.029 
well how does this go how is this going

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:02.019 
well how does this go how is this going
to<00:01:59.119> help<00:01:59.329> me<00:01:59.719> with<00:01:59.959> my<00:02:00.259> horse<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:01.639> end<00:02:01.789> of<00:02:01.939> the

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:02.029 
to help me with my horse the end of the

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:04.359 
to help me with my horse the end of the
day<00:02:02.239> the<00:02:02.450> more<00:02:02.719> we<00:02:02.929> can<00:02:03.139> understand<00:02:03.739> about<00:02:03.889> how

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
day the more we can understand about how

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.290 
day the more we can understand about how
our<00:02:04.609> horses<00:02:05.090> work<00:02:05.329> for<00:02:05.749> example<00:02:06.429> posture<00:02:07.429> we

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
our horses work for example posture we

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.610 
our horses work for example posture we
can<00:02:09.290> understand<00:02:09.860> how<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> poor<00:02:10.700> posture<00:02:11.060> would

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
can understand how a poor posture would

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.070 
can understand how a poor posture would
perhaps<00:02:11.799> effect<00:02:12.519> ourselves<00:02:13.269> but<00:02:13.629> what<00:02:13.780> about

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
perhaps effect ourselves but what about

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.500 
perhaps effect ourselves but what about
the<00:02:14.260> horse<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:15.190> really<00:02:15.489> need<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.879> understand

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
the horse you really need to understand

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.289 
the horse you really need to understand

makes<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.609> easy<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.090> understand<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.349> makes<00:03:09.069> it

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
makes it easy to understand and makes it

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.580 
makes it easy to understand and makes it
