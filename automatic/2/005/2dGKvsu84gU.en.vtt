00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.169
 all the players of Pablo Laso and in 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.419
 special not Velikovic Carlos Suarez and 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.880
 sergio Llull the Serbian raised the 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.280
 I find 16 points all of them in 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.710

 the same points as the Serbian 16 and a 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.010
 25 valuation 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.140
 the match started with nikola mirotic 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.839
 short dress and on the bench and with 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.789
 a 21 of Carlos Suarez to open the 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.739
 white marker but defense 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.170
 visitor prevailed over the attack 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.210
 local in the first 10 minutes the real 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.699
 madrid was thick and the baskonia 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.280
 rooted mostly to nemanja bjelica and 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.440
 reasons are up to 8 points came to 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.659
 be the vitoriana advantage to close the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.700
 first quarter 13 20 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.609
 jaycee carroll started to pull the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.679
 Realmadrid seven points of yours joined to 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:20.289
 good work of felipe kings and tomic ante 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:23.140
 in the painting dominating the rebound both 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.969
 the defensive as the offensive did 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.340
 that the team of Pablo Laso gave him the 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.220
 return to the scoreboard and turn pink 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.890
 above 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.360
 with a tie at 31 and after the break the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.420
 rhythm of the party was accelerated by 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.760
 complete and there in that habitat nobody 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.040
 better than real madrid after 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.400
 triple room without failure of oleson 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.530
 labor bank dominated 3640 moment in the 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.740
 that the white set endorsed her 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.260
 rival a partial 10-0 with triples of 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.780
 suÃ¡rez mates de mesa velich and above all 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.750
 a nole velickovic that was all claw 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.480
 push and heart on the track 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.850
 + 6 for Real Madrid and maximum advantage 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.160
 of 7 after a basket by sergio llull 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.830
 who sent the game to the last quarter 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.650
 54 47 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.540
 in those last ten minutes the whole 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.490
 White made it clear that he was not going to 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.920
 happen something other than his 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.680
 victory seven points more than nole 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.960
 Velickovic and four ante tomic 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.720
 they took the white lead plus 10 and the 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.860
 palace burst with this mate from sergio 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.860
 llull 67 55 plus 12 for Real Madrid 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.230
 Baskonia kept trying until the 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.150
 final confused intensity with hardness and 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.520
 with some other fault that should have been 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.830
 unsportsmanlike but Real Madrid did not 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.120
 He let it go and he remained serene and firm 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.650
 to end up winning 73 to 64 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.690
 playoff equaled one and both 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.560
