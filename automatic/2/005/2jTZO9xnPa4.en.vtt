that<00:00:52.579> i<00:00:52.610> want<00:00:52.879> to<00:00:52.909> see<00:00:53.089> first<00:00:53.539> being<00:00:53.780> map

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
that i want to see first being map

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.380 
that i want to see first being map
select<00:00:54.530> at<00:00:54.979> this<00:00:55.280> point<00:00:55.579> I<00:00:55.820> think<00:00:56.089> it's

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
select at this point I think it's

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.109 
select at this point I think it's
permissible<00:00:57.379> for<00:00:57.649> us<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:58.339> ask<00:00:58.519> for<00:00:58.820> this<00:00:58.909> I

00:00:59.109 --> 00:00:59.119 
permissible for us to ask for this I

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:00.729 
permissible for us to ask for this I
think<00:00:59.180> it<00:00:59.539> should<00:00:59.869> be<00:00:59.899> put<00:01:00.229> into<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.589> game

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
think it should be put into the game

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.229 
think it should be put into the game
quickly<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.339> I<00:01:01.399> don't<00:01:01.699> see<00:01:01.969> it<00:01:02.000> being

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
quickly and I don't see it being

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.359 
quickly and I don't see it being
something<00:01:02.539> that<00:01:02.659> hard<00:01:03.049> to<00:01:03.289> put<00:01:03.530> together<00:01:03.649> it's

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
something that hard to put together it's

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.300 
something that hard to put together it's
been<00:01:04.519> in<00:01:04.670> games<00:01:04.909> four<00:01:05.299> years<00:01:05.990> FPS<00:01:06.649> titles<00:01:06.860> have

been in games four years FPS titles have

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.639 
been in games four years FPS titles have

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
allowed players before the match to vote

allowed players before the match to vote
on<00:01:09.830> what<00:01:10.039> map<00:01:10.310> they<00:01:10.520> want<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:10.850> play<00:01:11.119> even<00:01:11.810> if<00:01:12.050> it

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:12.319 
on what map they want to play even if it

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:14.499 
on what map they want to play even if it
is<00:01:12.530> like<00:01:12.740> as<00:01:12.920> simple<00:01:13.280> as<00:01:13.429> the<00:01:13.580> halo<00:01:13.880> 3<00:01:14.179> veto

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
is like as simple as the halo 3 veto

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.690 
is like as simple as the halo 3 veto
system<00:01:15.050> where<00:01:15.319> if<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.950> majority<00:01:16.069> of<00:01:16.460> players

system where if the majority of players

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.820 
system where if the majority of players
vote<00:01:17.179> to<00:01:17.360> skip<00:01:17.509> this<00:01:17.780> map<00:01:18.050> it<00:01:18.259> loads<00:01:18.530> another

one<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.310> would<00:01:19.580> be<00:01:19.700> happy<00:01:19.729> with<00:01:20.210> that<00:01:20.240> but<00:01:20.899> as<00:01:21.080> it

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
one I would be happy with that but as it

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.559 
one I would be happy with that but as it
stands<00:01:21.530> now<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.460> maps<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:22.970> enjoy<00:01:23.179> playing

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
stands now the maps that I enjoy playing

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.469 
stands now the maps that I enjoy playing
the<00:01:23.869> most<00:01:24.110> are<00:01:25.039> everything<00:01:25.549> but<00:01:25.819> the<00:01:26.000> moon<00:01:26.209> and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
the most are everything but the moon and

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.949 
the most are everything but the moon and
the<00:01:26.990> large<00:01:27.500> Mars<00:01:28.130> map<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:28.759> think<00:01:29.420> it's<00:01:29.539> a<00:01:29.720> little

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
the large Mars map I think it's a little

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.870 
the large Mars map I think it's a little
bit<00:01:30.110> silly<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:30.860> just<00:01:31.069> feels<00:01:31.190> pretty<00:01:31.520> dated

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
bit silly and it just feels pretty dated

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.210 
bit silly and it just feels pretty dated
that<00:01:32.179> Bungie<00:01:32.569> has<00:01:32.720> yet<00:01:32.929> to<00:01:33.140> put<00:01:33.619> this<00:01:33.770> into<00:01:34.009> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
that Bungie has yet to put this into the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.770 
that Bungie has yet to put this into the
game<00:01:34.369> now<00:01:34.880> you'll<00:01:35.090> notice<00:01:35.149> with<00:01:35.630> these

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
game now you'll notice with these

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.109 
game now you'll notice with these
changes<00:01:36.289> done<00:01:36.440> about<00:01:36.590> wedding<00:01:36.979> today<00:01:37.100> none<00:01:37.970> of

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
changes done about wedding today none of

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.880 
changes done about wedding today none of
them<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.659> do<00:01:38.810> with<00:01:38.840> balance<00:01:39.440> I<00:01:39.679> know

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
them have to do with balance I know

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.249 
them have to do with balance I know
there<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.369> a<00:01:40.489> lot<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:41.030> people<00:01:41.179> frustrated<00:01:42.020> with

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
there is a lot of people frustrated with

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.979 
there is a lot of people frustrated with
balance<00:01:42.800> but<00:01:43.489> I<00:01:43.520> actually<00:01:43.759> think<00:01:44.179> games<00:01:44.690> in<00:01:44.899> a

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:44.989 
balance but I actually think games in a

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:47.469 
balance but I actually think games in a
really<00:01:45.349> good<00:01:45.709> place<00:01:46.039> in<00:01:46.459> terms<00:01:46.789> of<00:01:47.000> just<00:01:47.330> about

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
really good place in terms of just about

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.510 
really good place in terms of just about
everything<00:01:47.810> aside<00:01:48.289> from<00:01:48.560> secondaries<00:01:49.310> I

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
everything aside from secondaries I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.660 
everything aside from secondaries I
think<00:01:50.209> secondaries<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.679> ammo<00:01:52.039> is<00:01:52.220> a<00:01:52.250> little

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
think secondaries the ammo is a little

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.180 
think secondaries the ammo is a little
bit<00:01:52.819> too<00:01:53.000> easy<00:01:53.209> to<00:01:53.450> come<00:01:53.660> by<00:01:53.709> but<00:01:54.709> that's<00:01:54.979> not

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
bit too easy to come by but that's not

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.160 
bit too easy to come by but that's not
really<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:55.519> change<00:01:55.879> that<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.179> cared<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:56.989> much

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
really a change that I cared that much

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.990 
really a change that I cared that much
to<00:01:57.530> see<00:01:57.679> them<00:01:57.830> change<00:01:58.099> i'm<00:01:58.369> looking<00:01:58.670> at<00:01:58.759> bigger

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
to see them change i'm looking at bigger

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.969 
to see them change i'm looking at bigger
things<00:01:59.330> that<00:01:59.599> i<00:01:59.629> think<00:01:59.690> will<00:01:59.959> have<00:02:00.170> a<00:02:00.379> larger

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
things that i think will have a larger

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.339 
things that i think will have a larger
impact<00:02:01.009> across<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.910> game<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.810> next<00:02:03.200> one

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
impact across the game and that next one

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.279 
impact across the game and that next one
being<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:03.769> voice<00:02:04.009> chat<00:02:04.429> it<00:02:05.179> is<00:02:05.420> really<00:02:05.840> weird

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
being is voice chat it is really weird

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.219
