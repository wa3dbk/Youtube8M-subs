00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.819 
right here as well and we have a minimum
for<00:02:31.560> FPS<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.129> forty<00:02:32.760> point<00:02:33.060> nine<00:02:33.209> nine<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.829> a

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
for FPS of forty point nine nine and a

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.009 
for FPS of forty point nine nine and a
max<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.870> 60<00:02:36.870> average<00:02:37.379> is<00:02:37.799> 50<00:02:38.040> 1.66<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:39.150> yeah

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
max of 60 average is 50 1.66 it's yeah

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.770 
max of 60 average is 50 1.66 it's yeah
edimax<00:02:40.530> had<00:02:40.859> 60<00:02:41.310> 8.47<00:02:41.879> north<00:02:42.209> even<00:02:42.689> though<00:02:42.750> i

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
edimax had 60 8.47 north even though i

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.979 
edimax had 60 8.47 north even though i
could<00:02:42.989> have<00:02:43.079> sworn<00:02:43.140> us<00:02:43.379> all<00:02:43.500> 70<00:02:43.950> but<00:02:44.159> okay<00:02:44.989> uh

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
could have sworn us all 70 but okay uh

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.059 
could have sworn us all 70 but okay uh
that's<00:02:46.439> all<00:02:46.799> 72<00:02:47.189> I<00:02:47.370> don't<00:02:47.599> whatever<00:02:48.599> is<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
that's all 72 I don't whatever is a

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.339 
that's all 72 I don't whatever is a
51-point<00:02:50.069> 66<00:02:50.579> so<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.760> can<00:02:50.879> almost<00:02:51.030> max<00:02:51.510> crisis

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
51-point 66 so you can almost max crisis

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.319 
51-point 66 so you can almost max crisis
with<00:02:52.530> one<00:02:52.680> card<00:02:52.980> not<00:02:53.639> yet<00:02:53.819> though<00:02:54.030> we're

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
with one card not yet though we're

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.559 
with one card not yet though we're
getting<00:02:54.420> close<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:55.340> as<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.819> can<00:02:56.940> see<00:02:56.970> GPU

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
getting close and as you can see GPU

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.149 
getting close and as you can see GPU
usage<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:58.139> over<00:02:58.409> here<00:02:58.620> it's<00:02:58.769> very<00:02:58.950> short

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
usage is over here it's very short

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.740 
usage is over here it's very short
benchmark<00:02:59.670> thank<00:02:59.879> goodness<00:03:00.120> for<00:03:00.299> us<00:03:00.389> and<00:03:00.690> only

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
benchmark thank goodness for us and only

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.390 
benchmark thank goodness for us and only
get<00:03:00.930> down<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.230> 94<00:03:01.500> percentage<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:02.250> I'm<00:03:02.310> just

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
get down to 94 percentage so I'm just

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.429 
get down to 94 percentage so I'm just
going<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.609> go<00:03:02.670> ahead<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:02.940> say<00:03:03.120> max<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:04.079> maxes

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
going to go ahead and say max it maxes

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.670 
going to go ahead and say max it maxes
out<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> GPU<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.519> does<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.060> our<00:03:06.900> core<00:03:07.200> clock

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
out the GPU it does and our core clock

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.649 
out the GPU it does and our core clock
went<00:03:07.980> all<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.099> way<00:03:08.129> up<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.280> 12<00:03:08.579> 15<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.480> way

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
went all the way up to 12 15 so way

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.920 
went all the way up to 12 15 so way
above<00:03:09.930> our<00:03:10.370> 1098<00:03:11.370> regular<00:03:11.819> boost<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.720> don't

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
above our 1098 regular boost so I don't

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.539 
above our 1098 regular boost so I don't
know<00:03:13.049> I'm<00:03:13.290> aside<00:03:13.560> doing<00:03:13.799> all<00:03:13.920> kinds<00:03:14.159> of<00:03:14.220> magic

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
know I'm aside doing all kinds of magic

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.420 
know I'm aside doing all kinds of magic
tricks<00:03:14.730> there<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:16.230> um<00:03:16.409> it<00:03:16.829> works<00:03:16.980> at<00:03:17.129> work<00:03:17.250> it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
tricks there but um it works at work it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.339 
tricks there but um it works at work it
works<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:17.730> works<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.269> gotta<00:03:18.659> hand<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.079> in<00:03:19.200> there

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
works it works so gotta hand it in there

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.780 
works it works so gotta hand it in there
as<00:03:19.500> cards<00:03:19.769> doing<00:03:19.980> really<00:03:20.129> really<00:03:20.220> well<00:03:20.430> I

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
as cards doing really really well I

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.009 
as cards doing really really well I
can't<00:03:21.090> wait<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.239> see<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.450> next<00:03:21.540> benchmark

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
can't wait to see the next benchmark

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.560 
can't wait to see the next benchmark
let's<00:03:22.260> move<00:03:22.409> on
