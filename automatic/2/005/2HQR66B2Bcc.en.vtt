 we want for alerts in this case 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.670
 what we have selected the video 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.770
 original we can also change the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.990

 the history of the chat and show the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.960
 keyboard actions in this case the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.000
 contac layout would be ready or 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.070
 grid here we come back with seven 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.840
 grid now let's see select 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.570
 list that is how I personally like 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.960
 easier to find your contacts 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.540
 here is like in list 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.180
 ok one thing that many people cluttering you 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.940
 is the icon above that we have in the 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.530
 always tab of android that 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.050
 keeps an icon all the time 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.340
 vivienne that icon is removed by turning off 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.870
 this tab if you see the icon there are people 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.650
 what forms them then here goes off 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.790
 and we do not have it anymore as you can see I open 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.989
 ok the tab for my notifications 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.720
 this is the layer remote 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.430
 blaster now they're still back 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.480
 there's the vivienne connected icon 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.130
 there are people who like people who do not 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.130
 I wanted to show you how to remove it 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.829
 again the application as I say the 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.370
 well fluent it's cool cool it looks 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.750
 very much to the blackberry z10 many people 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.150
 has asked how to skip the row 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.459
 well it's very easy to download the 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.590
 application we post any 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.879
 immediately will say you divide 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.310
 will contact by mail 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.189
 When you are first in the row, 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.870
 we give ok ok as you want vivien we close 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.359
 the application we force a closure 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.560
 we open the application again 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.319
 we enter a mail completely 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.269
 different then we again force the 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.269
 close we do these two or three times 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.519
 until we put the mail with we want 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.769
 work immediately happens to us the 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.150
 next activation step this is a 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.760
 little trick that had been working 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.769
 with several 98 percent phones 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.950
 the other 2% have worked for me 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.700
 rejects it's worth a try 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.700
 it's complicated 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.680
