 Today, what we are going to cover here is the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.879
 many people are there. 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.890
 with doubts about this new system 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.170
 It's not that they did not have it, but they did. 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.330
 some things like that in the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.880
 other versions but this weight here is 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.380
 something like some people think 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.890
 important another not 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.170
 I thought it was cool, this system and I 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.750
 I am here today with bayern munich yo 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.909
 to show you how it's that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.659
 What works for thiago fluid training? 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.020
 is the following you are a resource that 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.890
 allows your team to change information 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.400
 without you 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.780
 type or have him command the 7th 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.439
 to change training he changes 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.509
 automatically depending on the situation 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.000
 of the game is in the beginning being with the ball 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.619
 not being good with this good 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.890
 information here is from bayern munich 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.600
 that comes with it normal and without 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.360
 edit without anything 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.270
 you can see the main formation 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.299
 offensive at the beginning is 4222 this is the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.710
 training that the team puts inside 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.689
 field is when you drop the ball 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.390
 and then the team is 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.340
 like this, there it's okay 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.610
 already as it relates to fluid training 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.360
 Do you come here? 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.320
 in tactical options 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.200
 fluid training but the bayern 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.300
 munique is already activated because it is a team 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.760
 who uses this kind of thing a lot 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.620
 It's good that you're going to make tea. 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.560
 the edict that you put a sim is that 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.680
 have not you put so not okay with 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.610
 r31 you point to the side will change there 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.090
 on top also not 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.750
 when you have the ball 244 when 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.030
 without the ball or when you do not have 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.360
 ball 4 2 3 1 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.470
 So, let's go to the march where I'm editing. 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.260
 well you come here in pre tactics 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.920
 defined and will position 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.060
 here you will shake first is the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.860
 at first I thought it was cool because beauty in the 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.390
 beginning but because early in the beginning the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.540
 ball rolled your team is betting 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.000
 This is how your team missed was posted. 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.230
 So, stop, stop, the team. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.390
 bet on optimistic goal shot 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.890
 betting so then you go there and 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.890
 set up your training the way you do 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.320
 either for your team is to stand there 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.430
 The moment the ball stopped, you went. 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.400
 drop the ball 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.110
 the eagle is so it's easy not to 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.470
 You have to think hard, you have to 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.110
 being a real technician here is 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.780
 to embody a real technician you 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.690
 You ball ' beauty has set up her training in 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.700
 You start broadcasting in Kona with r 3 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.200
 changed when you have the ball 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.140
 so you want a more offensive team 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.870
 like the bayern that the u2 centered a 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.400
 sr a right spot 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.470
 out these two here to press or 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.090
 Everyone is going to attack here. 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.580
 It has not changed much, they are not 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.900
 very out of position and only advance 1 and is 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.549
 This is what I'm saying if you take a 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.200
 imposing face will have to run 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.470
 automatically back in position 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.630
 his when I have the ball 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.970
 So this is the team here when the 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.130
 boat now by bait neighborhood is one of the 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.780
 best teams this version the cause 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.579
 of this fluid formation 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.739
 So you go there and ride the way you 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.820
 Do you want the team to stay here when 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.530
 Have you got the ball then? 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.130
 players will automatically assume 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.370
 these positions 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.180
 You take the ball, beauty. 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.940
 I lost the ball 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.250
 Your team is going to stay like this and understood your 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.130
 time will come back quickly with 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.380
 defense position and this will 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.200
 and instead of you 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.810
 put a tactic 1 to 1 against attack 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.620
 tactic 2 the practical ball retention 3 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.560
 retracts 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.420
 you use fluid training, then it's a 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.260
 new feature is what gives you 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.530
 difficult and very mainly online 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.750
 the lives of your opponents because there is 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.000
 person will look there you are playing 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.950
 online has the tactics of its player of the 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.750
 your opponent means and he will 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.670
 be so fitted so he does not know 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.030
 that you are using fluid tactics or 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.140
 the flowing formation then automatically 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.380
 apple but how does the letter team 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:19.280
 defending then this is really 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:22.400
 a good tool if you learn 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.900
 If you train this, you can 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.580
 to become a great part player yet 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.220
 Even I'm not wearing it, I'm training. 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.860
 many here have worked 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.780
 so it's even good 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.330
 how do I belong in here go 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.120
 game plan will be without your team 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.040
 you come here tactical options and put 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.010
 was a fluid formation so no 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.740
 need to edit the defensive here 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.720
 It's not just the beginning. 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.010
 the cup I will use at the beginning or use 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.910
 has come back and says that 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.620
 edit positions 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.900
 There you change the training you can see 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.450
 here also change but no problem 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.070
 give the team instructions you put me already 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.170
 I've been doing information tactics there 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.920
 you put it according to what you 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.130
 would you like 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.070
 It's more, I wanted to clarify more 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.780
 this information was that the staff is 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.330
 asking too much 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.610
 how it works is it guys the 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.640
 that happens at the beginning the team is like this 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.600
 took the ball he's going to take 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.520
 automatically you do not need to change 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.810
 manual it automatically takes another 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.910
 shape in the field 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.200
 that is you the players will if you can 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.300
 How many people do you want to kill? 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.820
 they will automatically lost the ball they 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.580
 automatically return to the 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.870
 defense crowd beauty so I hope 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.110
 Did you like this little girl? 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.300
 explanation, this case is 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.090
