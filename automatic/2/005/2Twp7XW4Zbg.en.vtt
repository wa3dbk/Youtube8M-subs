 Yakins good if you also perform artists who do not come from Europe 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.339
 that gives the whole the international, because you do not understand them 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.759
 So it is only when a lot of effort 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.759

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.469
 that's the way it goes 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.469
