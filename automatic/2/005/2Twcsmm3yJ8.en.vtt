plans for the house the first cottage as

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.319 
plans for the house the first cottage as
we're<00:01:59.490> calling<00:01:59.789> it<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.060> we're<00:02:00.179> going<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
we're calling it that we're going to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.710 
we're calling it that we're going to
move<00:02:00.509> into<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.079> get<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.320> Texas<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.720> week

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
move into and we get to Texas and a week

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
move into and we get to Texas and a week
in<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.960> day<00:02:03.990> oh<00:02:04.759> my<00:02:05.759> god<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:07.229> we've<00:02:07.470> had

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
in a day oh my god and we've had

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.550 
in a day oh my god and we've had
probably<00:02:08.549> two<00:02:09.030> dozen<00:02:09.239> designs<00:02:09.840> two<00:02:10.229> dozen

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
probably two dozen designs two dozen

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.460 
probably two dozen designs two dozen
final<00:02:11.160> designs<00:02:11.700> at<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.269> point<00:02:12.600> but<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.170> think

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
final designs at this point but I think

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.470 
final designs at this point but I think
we<00:02:13.650> finally<00:02:14.040> have<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:14.700> there's<00:02:15.150> been<00:02:15.450> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
we finally have it there's been a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.300 
we finally have it there's been a
problem<00:02:15.810> with<00:02:16.110> every<00:02:16.410> single<00:02:16.590> one<00:02:16.860> either<00:02:17.100> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
problem with every single one either the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.100 
problem with every single one either the
stairs<00:02:17.580> ended<00:02:17.970> up<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.420> right<00:02:18.600> into<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.080> a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
stairs ended up going right into like a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.800 
stairs ended up going right into like a
sloping<00:02:19.530> roof<00:02:19.769> or<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.970> stove<00:02:21.239> was<00:02:21.599> going<00:02:21.750> to

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
sloping roof or the stove was going to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.380 
sloping roof or the stove was going to
make<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.049> ceiling<00:02:22.380> too<00:02:22.560> hot<00:02:22.769> or<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:24.180> bathroom

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
make the ceiling too hot or the bathroom

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.759 
make the ceiling too hot or the bathroom
was<00:02:24.780> not<00:02:24.959> gonna<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.290> near<00:02:25.470> any<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
was not gonna be near any of the

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.089 
was not gonna be near any of the
plumbing<00:02:26.160> yadda<00:02:26.670> yadda<00:02:26.849> yadda<00:02:27.090> anyway<00:02:28.099> after

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
plumbing yadda yadda yadda anyway after

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.870 
plumbing yadda yadda yadda anyway after
several<00:02:29.340> arguments<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:31.200> Snickers<00:02:31.650> bar

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
several arguments and a Snickers bar

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.380 
several arguments and a Snickers bar
later<00:02:33.860> we've<00:02:34.860> come<00:02:35.099> up<00:02:35.130> with<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.910> drew<00:02:36.360> it

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
later we've come up with this I drew it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.690 
later we've come up with this I drew it
out<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.900> Corey<00:02:37.349> help<00:02:37.680> me<00:02:37.799> modify<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.549> that

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
out and Corey help me modify it so that

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.069 
out and Corey help me modify it so that
everything<00:02:38.880> works<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.390> think<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:39.930> what

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
everything works I think this is what

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.160 
everything works I think this is what
we're<00:02:40.170> gonna<00:02:40.230> build<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.850> downstairs<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:43.019> is

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
we're gonna build the downstairs this is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.400 
we're gonna build the downstairs this is
the<00:02:43.320> porch<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.190> then<00:02:45.030> these<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.959> cross

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
the porch and then these this cross

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.160 
the porch and then these this cross
right<00:02:46.769> here<00:02:46.799> of<00:02:47.250> dots<00:02:47.750> represents<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.930> roof

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
right here of dots represents the roof

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.740 
right here of dots represents the roof
otherwise<00:02:50.160> see<00:02:50.459> it's<00:02:50.640> sloping<00:02:51.120> down<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
otherwise see it's sloping down so the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.240 
otherwise see it's sloping down so the
roof<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.049> only<00:02:52.200> really<00:02:52.410> high<00:02:52.680> like<00:02:53.040> right

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
roof is only really high like right

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.360 
roof is only really high like right
there<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:54.239> I've<00:02:54.959> marked<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.590> here<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.190> we'll

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
there so I've marked that here and we'll

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.729 
there so I've marked that here and we'll
have<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.609> TV<00:02:56.819> right<00:02:57.269> here<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.810> address<00:02:58.590> it

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
have the TV right here and address it

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.960 
have the TV right here and address it
right<00:02:58.769> there<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.340> entrance<00:02:59.549> right<00:02:59.760> there

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
right there and the entrance right there

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.130 
right there and the entrance right there
and<00:03:00.120> there's<00:03:00.239> really<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.540> barely<00:03:00.900> any

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
and there's really just barely any

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.199 
and there's really just barely any
walking<00:03:01.410> room<00:03:01.709> upstairs<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:02.579> this<00:03:02.790> area

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
walking room upstairs and then this area

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.170 
walking room upstairs and then this area
drops<00:03:03.540> down<00:03:03.989> so<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.739> can<00:03:04.889> lift<00:03:05.130> up<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.639> bed<00:03:05.850> and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
drops down so we can lift up the bed and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.800 
drops down so we can lift up the bed and
the<00:03:06.630> TV<00:03:06.870> when<00:03:07.410> we<00:03:07.440> first<00:03:07.950> move<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.720> you

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
the TV when we first move in so you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.750 
the TV when we first move in so you
remember<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.440> floor<00:03:10.769> plan<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:11.250> showed<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.730> a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
remember that floor plan we showed you a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.090 
remember that floor plan we showed you a
couple<00:03:12.180> days<00:03:12.359> ago<00:03:12.389> it's<00:03:12.959> changed<00:03:13.859> several

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
couple days ago it's changed several

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.580 
couple days ago it's changed several
times<00:03:14.220> since<00:03:14.609> then<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.420> was<00:03:15.600> like<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.109> 12th

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
times since then that was like the 12th

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.069 
times since then that was like the 12th
version<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.639> now<00:03:18.030> we're<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.329> about<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.720> 20th

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
version and now we're on about the 20th

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.740 
version and now we're on about the 20th
but<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.620> think<00:03:19.889> we<00:03:20.069> finally<00:03:20.430> finally<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.540> it

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
but I think we finally finally have it

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.140 
but I think we finally finally have it
so<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.410> finally<00:03:22.980> drew<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.489> out<00:03:23.579> on<00:03:23.850> graph<00:03:24.120> paper

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
so I finally drew it out on graph paper

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.449 
so I finally drew it out on graph paper
so<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:24.870> we<00:03:25.230> have<00:03:25.440> an<00:03:25.739> accurate

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
so that we have an accurate

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.009 
so that we have an accurate
representation<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:27.180> everything<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.750> scale

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
representation of everything to scale

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.129 
representation of everything to scale
and<00:03:28.319> here's<00:03:28.440> what<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.650> looks<00:03:28.799> like<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.989> know<00:03:30.989> if

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
and here's what it looks like I know if

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.530 
and here's what it looks like I know if
you<00:03:31.200> can<00:03:31.440> read<00:03:31.650> everything<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.389> what

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
you can read everything but this is what

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.080 
you can read everything but this is what
it<00:03:33.630> will<00:03:33.720> look<00:03:33.780> like<00:03:34.100> downstairs<00:03:35.100> and

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
it will look like downstairs and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.650 
it will look like downstairs and
upstairs<00:03:38.780> that's<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.959> loft<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.910> area<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.359> cut

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
upstairs that's a loft this area is cut

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.350 
upstairs that's a loft this area is cut
out<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.859> black<00:03:44.430> bar<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:44.939> ladder

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
out and that black bar is the ladder

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.350 
out and that black bar is the ladder
going<00:03:45.659> up<00:03:45.870> stairs<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.620> my<00:03:46.739> office

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
going up stairs this is my office

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.100 
going up stairs this is my office

how its configured right now I hope we

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.780 
how its configured right now I hope we
do<00:03:51.450> not<00:03:51.570> have<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.990> draw<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.350> one<00:03:53.280> more<00:03:53.520> time<00:03:53.760> I

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
do not have to draw this one more time I

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.630 
do not have to draw this one more time I
think<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.270> is<00:03:54.450> finally<00:03:55.080> done<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:56.490> now

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
think this is finally done and so now

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.490 
think this is finally done and so now
what<00:03:57.030> Corey<00:03:57.330> has<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.660> do<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.930> go<00:03:58.080> through<00:03:58.110> and

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
what Corey has to do is go through and

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.470 
what Corey has to do is go through and
determine<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.370> quantity<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.850> materials

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
determine the quantity of materials

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.060 
determine the quantity of materials
needed<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.900> build<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:01.440> because<00:04:01.830> right<00:04:02.040> now

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
needed to build this because right now

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.490 
needed to build this because right now
we're<00:04:02.400> working<00:04:02.430> on<00:04:02.820> approximations<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:04.290> our

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
we're working on approximations so our

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.350 
we're working on approximations so our
prices<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.130> approximation<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:06.030> want<00:04:06.270> a

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
prices and approximation and I want a

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.680 
prices and approximation and I want a
more<00:04:06.570> determined<00:04:07.170> price<00:04:08.300> just<00:04:09.300> so<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.540> know

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
more determined price just so I know

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.040 
more determined price just so I know
what<00:04:09.990> it<00:04:10.110> is<00:04:10.850> it<00:04:11.850> shouldn't<00:04:12.150> be<00:04:12.240> too<00:04:12.390> bad<00:04:12.420> but

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
what it is it shouldn't be too bad but

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.470 
what it is it shouldn't be too bad but
that's<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.380> next<00:04:13.530> step<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.120> our<00:04:15.240> final

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
that's the next step this is our final
