I<00:00:21.100> do<00:00:21.280> it<00:00:21.610> I<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:25.740> slide

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.560 

strap<00:00:32.830> and<00:00:33.190> just<00:00:33.490> throw<00:00:33.700> it<00:00:33.880> like<00:00:34.030> this<00:00:34.090> with

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
strap and just throw it like this with

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.960 
strap and just throw it like this with

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
two hands

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.450 
two hands
you're<00:00:36.120> kind<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.330> like<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> basketball<00:00:37.460> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
you're kind of like a basketball and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.370 
you're kind of like a basketball and
this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.000> fine<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> dandy<00:00:39.510> when<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.170> have

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
this is all fine and dandy when you have

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.590 
this is all fine and dandy when you have
something<00:00:40.890> maybe<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.250> know<00:00:41.550> six<00:00:41.940> seven<00:00:42.090> feet

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
something maybe I know six seven feet

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.790 
something maybe I know six seven feet
tall<00:00:42.920> but<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.030> problem<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.660> this

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.290 

the<00:00:50.800> strap<00:00:51.160> only<00:00:51.850> flies<00:00:52.180> as<00:00:53.010> far<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.370> as<00:00:55.000> high

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
the strap only flies as far and as high

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.290 
the strap only flies as far and as high
as<00:00:55.330> you<00:00:56.110> throw<00:00:56.470> it<00:00:56.820> basically<00:00:57.820> what<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.090> put

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
as you throw it basically what you put

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.480 
as you throw it basically what you put
in<00:00:58.450> that's<00:00:59.320> what<00:00:59.560> you<00:00:59.680> get<00:00:59.830> there's<00:01:00.340> no

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
in that's what you get there's no

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.850 
in that's what you get there's no
multiplication<00:01:01.000> of<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.600> effort

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
multiplication of the effort

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.160 
multiplication of the effort
there's<00:01:03.250> no<00:01:03.460> transformer<00:01:04.420> effect<00:01:04.900> you<00:01:05.080> know

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
there's no transformer effect you know

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.750 
there's no transformer effect you know
what<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:05.320> mean

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
what I mean

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.010 
what I mean
so<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:07.730> tried<00:01:08.730> and<00:01:08.940> try<00:01:09.120> to<00:01:09.180> throw<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.720> trap

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
so I tried and try to throw this trap

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.980 
so I tried and try to throw this trap
over<00:01:10.230> that<00:01:10.470> 14<00:01:10.920> feet<00:01:11.160> high<00:01:11.190> low<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.120> there<00:01:12.900> was

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
over that 14 feet high low and there was

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.540 
over that 14 feet high low and there was
a<00:01:13.020> strong<00:01:13.380> wind

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
a strong wind

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.690 
a strong wind
nothing<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.930> even<00:01:16.560> turned<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> truck<00:01:17.400> around

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700

great<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:54.899> seeing<00:01:55.899> like<00:01:55.960> this<00:01:56.969> great<00:01:57.969> kind

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
great like seeing like this great kind

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.179 
great like seeing like this great kind
of<00:01:58.450> like<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.289> slingshot<00:01:59.679> or<00:02:00.219> catapult<00:02:00.850> see<00:02:02.189> so

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
of like a slingshot or catapult see so

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.169 
of like a slingshot or catapult see so
this<00:02:03.399> way<00:02:03.640> what<00:02:03.880> happens<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.450> now<00:02:06.179> you

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
this way what happens is that now you

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.589 
this way what happens is that now you
have<00:02:07.569> multiplication<00:02:08.379> of<00:02:09.129> your<00:02:09.700> energy<00:02:10.390> so

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
have multiplication of your energy so

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.479 
have multiplication of your energy so
you<00:02:10.660> don't<00:02:10.840> have<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.080> be<00:02:11.230> very<00:02:11.860> tall<00:02:12.250> very

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
you don't have to be very tall very

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.839 
you don't have to be very tall very
strong<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:13.360> throw<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:14.530> strap<00:02:14.860> very<00:02:15.160> high<00:02:15.430> so

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
strong to throw the strap very high so

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.470 
strong to throw the strap very high so
that's<00:02:16.690> what<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.989> Asian<00:02:17.319> ancients<00:02:18.010> do<00:02:18.129> right

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
that's what the Asian ancients do right

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.170 
that's what the Asian ancients do right
during<00:02:19.480> their<00:02:19.750> Wars<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.640> works<00:02:21.910> great

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
during their Wars so this works great

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.509 
during their Wars so this works great
and<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:23.739> tried<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.459> was<00:02:24.489> able<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:26.519> cover

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
and I tried it and I was able to cover

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.180 
and I tried it and I was able to cover
all<00:02:27.910> my<00:02:29.489> bales<00:02:30.489> of<00:02:30.730> hay<00:02:31.500> 14<00:02:32.500> feet<00:02:32.709> high<00:02:32.739> and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
all my bales of hay 14 feet high and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.080 
all my bales of hay 14 feet high and
sometimes<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.819> even<00:02:33.910> suspect<00:02:34.150> they<00:02:34.510> were<00:02:34.569> hive

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
sometimes I even suspect they were hive

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.199 
sometimes I even suspect they were hive
says<00:02:37.090> make<00:02:37.840> sure<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.380> do<00:02:38.530> not<00:02:38.849> attach<00:02:39.849> this

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
says make sure you do not attach this

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.830 
says make sure you do not attach this
