00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.009
 maite esp and welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.440
 this time how are you watching 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.420
 our screens 9 episodes of the data 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.490
 mining as always courtesy of 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.750
 fellow ninth game and we go there 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.030
 because the truth today 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.970
 we have a lot of new content images 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.520
 text information and others about 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.260
 new gods new skins and different 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.510
 things that are going to be added to the game 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.220
 so we start at we do nothing else 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.619
 and nothing less than with the new goddess 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.119
 beyond to the present in the previous 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.439
 episode the data mining if you have not 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.360
 seen that video you can give it a 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.370
 look now and tell you about it that 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.380
 we already have many images about everything is 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.149
 what appeared in this size images 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.520
 about what his appearance could be 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.020
 as well as your skills or a weird thing 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.850
 that then I will comment to you then 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.230
 we started with his portrait and as you see 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.640
 here you see yonhap 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.230
 let's say it looks pretty 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.390
 fiero is ready for combat 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.820
 really good we can not see the model 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 3d we can not see it in action either 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 it looks pretty good if we go with his 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.309
 record you will see that it is practically what 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.710
 same but with a hair with some shades 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.600
 violaceous and pinkish that front mola 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.170
 quite a lot and he reminds me I do not know why 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.930
 what but it is like that 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.939
 let's say goodbye to a character of 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.070
 manga anime or similar 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.570
 so audio that gets better if 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.250
 let's go to the truth 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.500
 we also have images about each one 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.149
 of them but attention here because you can 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.799
 be that this is not your skills anymore 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.659
 that one of the versions that circulate 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.299
 by the network is that this goddess instead of 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.830
 skills have different weapons to what 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.610
 I mean with this for example the 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.470
 clearest example 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.869
 blair in smart world is if you want 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.820
 it really has two different weapons one 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.520
 is the arch and the others are both 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.860
 axes that he controls with both his hands in 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.679
 this case looked like it does not really seem 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.049
 that it could be that instead of two weapons 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.090
 or one as it would be normal to have up 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.770
 four and each one of the skills 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.500
 in quotes that we will now see 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.420
 were different weapons that I could not 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.520
 draw in totally audio that these are 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.289
 an assumption we could not 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.209
 confirm hired has not yet given anything of 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.860
 information but in the truth would fly 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.990
 pretty and I think it would be super 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.310
 super cool said this let's comment 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.190
 these images that I have told you before 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.659
 I really introduce them as if 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.399
 were skills but we do not know if 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.830
 they will be skills or they will be weapons 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.270
 we start with the passive as you see 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.830
 it looks pretty good I'm not going to 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.080
 comment too much you are going to see 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.970
 the passive then the number 1 you have it 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.800
 also around here you also have the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.020
 number 2 that you see is a kind of 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.360
 hammer and the number 3 that is like a 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.970
 kind of tail with spikes or something by 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.380
 the style finally the number 4 that 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.090
 should be the last one is like a 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.190
 kind of flag maybe this is not a 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.050
 gun because good a flag as a weapon 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.730
 I think it would not give much game but 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.050
 then as the god we still do not know what 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.580
 is going to be all this if they are going to be the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.980
 skills but as they go out 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.690
 more information as always I'm going to 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.910
 inform about it then more 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.920
 little things more little things of this new 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.570
 patch three new is who is the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.940
 first hers not you a video with 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.800
 she who uploaded it up yesterday you can 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.900
 take a look and see her in action the 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.610
 of mercury mercury boxer the truth not 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.490
 so they've flown quite a lot 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.500
 of the population let's say you love 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.790
 mercury and that has not liked another part 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.200
 the general truth as a bit of 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.880
 controversy but good to me really 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.680
 I like it a lot it does not look too 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.450
 to mercury but I still like the roll 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.520
 that they have given him the skin and on the other hand 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.200
 artemis artemis caveman os 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.120
 will show a bit in the previous video if 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.920
 I'm not wrong, it's really very, very 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.700
 cool is Artemis to me personally 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.650
 quite like 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.540
 I told you the video yesterday I repeat today that 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.879
 these two skins at the moment there is only the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.769
 pts and for now you can only try 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.840
 with some codes that he distributed hired by 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.010
 twitter that are no longer available but 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.180
 how Artemis gave me the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.370
 it's really quite cool for me and I'm 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.739
 wishing to try this triceratops and see 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.209
 how it really bursts enemies 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.890
 That said, tell you also that in this 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.989
 part many new ones have been introduced 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.790
 letters you know that they are remodeling 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.410
 as the time passes innocence 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.390
 does not like the community does not like 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.069
 a letter is often changed the truth in 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.680
 In this case, they argued that 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.190
 letter the record of soft also the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.549
 Poseidon record also Danish anise am 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.829
 and even though and I apolo the record too 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.540
 in three codes guys and states have 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.160
 been the news in terms of letters 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.290
 but do not leave because there is one last 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.610
 quite important thing is a new 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.290
 chest that I'll be seeing right now in 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.599
 screen and that really has left us 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.310
 quite speechless why 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.530
 because as you can see I know it really includes 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.930
 about everything that come being arrows 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.430
 arrows with their respective covers that 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.650
 I think they are called nomadic letters there 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.300
 much case and then I know it could be 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.220
 this because I believe in the most obvious thing would be 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.450
 that it was a chest where we had the 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.460
 corners of the different 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.950
 before they go let's say with bow by 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.450
 example branch for example and the truth is not 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.340
 I can think of no one right now 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.140
 but with many kids we do not know what 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.540
 it will be this I suppose that they will already take 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.920
 more information we also have a framework 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.050
 that in principle should go with this 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.910
 chest and where we could see all the 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.680
 gifts that includes well is left guys 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.880
 up to here the data mining of today I hope 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.350
 that you liked Do not forget 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.300
 comment what you think the new info 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.400
 on which you seem melon also 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.170
 for the new skin cinemas and what is the 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.730
 part that you liked most and least of 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.320
 this data mining I hope it has 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.060
 liked and that you continue to enjoy is 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.060
 maite to another anp bye
