guess<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.210> gonna<00:01:54.329> work<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.720> time

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
guess it's not gonna work this time

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.039 
guess it's not gonna work this time
let's<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.380> okay<00:01:55.950> Google<00:01:56.810> no<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.079> not

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
let's see okay Google no it's not

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.130 
let's see okay Google no it's not
can't<00:02:01.049> reach<00:02:01.229> Google<00:02:01.590> at<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.710> morning

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:14.160 

I<00:02:12.150> wonder<00:02:13.150> if<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.300> has<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.780> do<00:02:13.900> with<00:02:13.930> my

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
I wonder if that has to do with my

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.320 
I wonder if that has to do with my
internet<00:02:14.500> connectivity<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.850> will<00:02:16.000> find<00:02:16.240> that

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
internet connectivity we will find that

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.300 
internet connectivity we will find that
out<00:02:16.450> right<00:02:16.600> now<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.650> see<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.860> icons

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
out right now but you can see the icons

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.640 
out right now but you can see the icons
are<00:02:18.610> much<00:02:18.820> bigger<00:02:19.390> they<00:02:19.750> go<00:02:19.930> over<00:02:20.380> pretty

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
are much bigger they go over pretty

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.760 
are much bigger they go over pretty
quick<00:02:21.240> without<00:02:22.240> any<00:02:22.450> issues<00:02:22.960> as<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.320> can<00:02:23.500> see

I'm still hanging off of a wrong server

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.000 
I'm still hanging off of a wrong server
but<00:02:41.500> let's<00:02:41.620> see<00:02:41.709> if<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.010> Internet<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.900> do

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
but let's see if I have Internet I do

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.900 
but let's see if I have Internet I do
that's<00:02:45.010> what<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.220> wanted<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.550> see

that's what I wanted to see
all<00:02:46.360> right<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.690> Internet<00:02:47.050> is<00:02:47.170> working<00:02:47.290> so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
all right so Internet is working so

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.690 
all right so Internet is working so
we're<00:02:49.870> gonna<00:02:49.989> select<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.500> again

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.979 

maybe<00:02:54.700> Google<00:02:55.120> server<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.600> down<00:02:55.780> at<00:02:55.930> the

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
maybe Google server is down at the

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.370 
maybe Google server is down at the

upgraded specs set with the galaxy s5
it's<00:04:59.729> very<00:04:59.880> quick<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.419> don't<00:05:00.810> see<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.020> lot<00:05:01.229> of

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
it's very quick you don't see a lot of

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.620 
it's very quick you don't see a lot of
stutter<00:05:01.680> or<00:05:01.950> a<00:05:01.979> lag<00:05:02.280> in<00:05:02.610> these<00:05:02.910> and<00:05:03.510> it's

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
stutter or a lag in these and it's

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.180 
stutter or a lag in these and it's
actually<00:05:03.990> intuitive<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.470> can<00:05:04.620> barely<00:05:04.860> touch<00:05:05.130> it

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
actually intuitive I can barely touch it

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.580 
actually intuitive I can barely touch it
and<00:05:05.460> make<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.790> screens<00:05:06.090> very<00:05:06.390> slide<00:05:07.260> really

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
and make the screens very slide really

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.070 
and make the screens very slide really
easy<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:08.070> guess<00:05:08.760> my<00:05:08.970> only<00:05:09.000> caveat<00:05:09.419> with<00:05:09.900> that

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
easy I guess my only caveat with that

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.790 
easy I guess my only caveat with that
now<00:05:10.200> is<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.500> fact<00:05:10.650> that<00:05:10.800> that<00:05:11.070> part<00:05:11.760> is<00:05:12.000> not

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
now is the fact that that part is not

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.510 
now is the fact that that part is not
working<00:05:13.800> correctly<00:05:13.830> let's<00:05:14.310> see<00:05:14.370> if<00:05:14.430> this

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
working correctly let's see if this

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.250 
working correctly let's see if this
works<00:05:14.760> though<00:05:14.940> test<00:05:17.690> so<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.780> Google<00:05:18.930> search

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
works though test so the Google search

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.500 
works though test so the Google search
bar<00:05:19.560> is<00:05:19.860> working<00:05:20.550> so<00:05:20.760> maybe<00:05:20.970> it's<00:05:21.150> just<00:05:21.360> the

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
bar is working so maybe it's just the

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.590 
bar is working so maybe it's just the
voice<00:05:21.660> recognition<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.530> that<00:05:23.070> could<00:05:23.310> be

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
voice recognition and that could be

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.210 
voice recognition and that could be
strictly<00:05:24.600> because<00:05:24.900> of<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.710> Google<00:05:26.010> search

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
strictly because of the Google search

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.670 
strictly because of the Google search
