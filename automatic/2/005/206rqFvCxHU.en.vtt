contemporary<00:00:43.680> person<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.100> probably<00:00:44.280> won't

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
contemporary person I probably won't

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.720

like<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.850> much<00:00:44.879> whatever<00:00:45.270> whatever<00:00:45.570> I

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
like it that much whatever whatever I

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.490 
like it that much whatever whatever I
was<00:00:47.730> wrong<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.600> let<00:00:49.079> me<00:00:49.140> talk<00:00:49.230> about<00:00:49.289> the

was wrong so let me talk about the
characters<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.280> most<00:00:50.489> because<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
characters the most because the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
characters the most because the
characters<00:00:51.480> are<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.110> drive<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
characters are what really drive the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.040 
characters are what really drive the
story<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.730> characters<00:00:54.149> are<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.750> well

but the grieving process is really

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.850

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
pace and you do kind of see that like

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.360 
pace and you do kind of see that like
it's<00:04:44.870> building<00:04:45.200> up<00:04:45.290> to<00:04:45.470> something<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:46.220> you're
