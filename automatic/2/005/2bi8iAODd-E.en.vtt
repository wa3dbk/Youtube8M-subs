00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
think increasingly it's going to be very

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.560 
think increasingly it's going to be very
very<00:01:52.530> important<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.549> ordinary<00:01:54.030> citizens

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
very important that ordinary citizens

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.899 
very important that ordinary citizens
understand<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.130> different<00:01:56.520> players<00:01:56.759> in

understand the different players in

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.940 
understand the different players in
their<00:01:57.210> lives<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> sector<00:01:58.770> that's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
their lives and this is a sector that's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.190 
their lives and this is a sector that's
slightly<00:01:59.219> invisible<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.630> need<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.020> make<00:02:01.140> it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
slightly invisible so we need to make it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.089 
slightly invisible so we need to make it
more<00:02:01.469> visible
