00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
isn't up everything's smooth there's no

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.320 
isn't up everything's smooth there's no
problems<00:00:27.900> whatsoever<00:00:28.220> so<00:00:29.220> mainly<00:00:29.760> what<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.119> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
problems whatsoever so mainly what it is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.920 
problems whatsoever so mainly what it is
it's<00:00:30.960> all<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.650> with<00:00:31.679> your<00:00:31.980> simply<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:32.579> your

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
it's all to do with your simply use your

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.430 
it's all to do with your simply use your
CPU<00:00:33.930> cause<00:00:35.000> as<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
CPU cause as you can see this is the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
CPU cause as you can see this is the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the task manager on this side you'll see

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.600 
the task manager on this side you'll see
like<00:00:43.620> CP<00:00:44.430> 1<00:00:44.640> 2<00:00:45.030> 3<00:00:45.629> 4<00:00:45.870> 5<00:00:46.020> 6<00:00:46.140> 7<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.039> way<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.250> 7

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
find place the work key in there which

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.490 
find place the work key in there which
I've<00:01:38.360> I'll<00:01:39.360> post<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.990> description<00:01:40.409> below

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
I've I'll post in the description below

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.859 
I've I'll post in the description below
so<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.400> simple<00:01:41.640> enough<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
so it's simple enough so you just do a

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.219 
so it's simple enough so you just do a
search<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:46.820> it'll<00:01:47.820> pop<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> keys

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
search and it'll pop up with the keys

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.280 
search and it'll pop up with the keys
all<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.340> that's<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.549> key<00:01:50.899> on<00:01:51.899> here

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
all right so that's that key on here

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.569 
all right so that's that key on here
you've<00:01:52.770> got<00:01:52.890> two<00:01:53.100> values

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
you've got two values

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.289 
you've got two values
min<00:01:54.060> min<00:01:54.360> max<00:01:55.350> Y<00:01:56.250> max<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:56.880> probably<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
min min max Y max will probably have a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.899 
min min max Y max will probably have a
hundred<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.640> you

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
hundred in it so what you want to do you

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.550 
hundred in it so what you want to do you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
it and change it to a zero you'll be a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.420 
it and change it to a zero you'll be a
hundred<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.020> at<00:02:04.079> first<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.280> just

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
hundred like that at first then you just

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.100 
hundred like that at first then you just
want<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.640> change<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.090> zero<00:02:06.450> leave<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.049> as

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
want to change it to zero leave it as

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.460 
want to change it to zero leave it as
hexadecimal<00:02:08.090> if<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.300> one's<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.629> anything<00:02:10.200> is

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
hexadecimal if that one's on anything is

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.740 
hexadecimal if that one's on anything is
well<00:02:10.679> not<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> mean<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:12.390> make<00:02:12.540> sure

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
well not the mean one just make sure

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.520 
well not the mean one just make sure
these

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
these

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.230 
these
min/max<00:02:14.190> or<00:02:14.550> 1<00:02:14.730> 0<00:02:14.760> that's<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.900> then<00:02:16.260> go<00:02:16.440> edit

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
min/max or 1 0 that's it then go edit

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.960 
min/max or 1 0 that's it then go edit
then<00:02:18.240> next<00:02:18.630> find<00:02:19.050> X<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:19.560> free<00:02:19.770> they<00:02:20.730> do<00:02:20.880> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
then next find X so if free they do the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.559 
then next find X so if free they do the
same<00:02:21.800> change<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.940> zero<00:02:24.209> if<00:02:24.870> free<00:02:26.569> 0

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
same change that to zero if free 0

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.460 
same change that to zero if free 0
change<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.350> 0<00:02:28.650> both<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.400> they're<00:02:29.880> free

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
change it to 0 both of them they're free

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.559 
change it to 0 both of them they're free
well<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.459> one<00:02:32.819> you'd<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.270> worry<00:02:33.420> about

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
well that one you'd have to worry about

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.030 
well that one you'd have to worry about
that<00:02:33.989> one<00:02:34.110> felt<00:02:34.290> pops<00:02:34.470> up<00:02:34.620> not<00:02:34.739> worry<00:02:34.860> about

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that one felt pops up not worry about

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.330 
that one felt pops up not worry about
that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.660 

there<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.400> go

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
there you go

there you go
finished<00:02:38.940> firstly<00:02:39.480> for<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.660> recipe<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.500> when

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
finished firstly for the recipe so when

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.250 
finished firstly for the recipe so when
that's<00:02:40.770> done<00:02:41.450> shut<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.569> off<00:02:42.630> turn<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.140> off

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260
