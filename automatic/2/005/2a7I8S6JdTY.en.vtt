00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
fridge to set up meanwhile fortunately

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.160 
fridge to set up meanwhile fortunately
if<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.180> have<00:04:36.300> something<00:04:36.480> already<00:04:36.690> done<00:04:36.930> and

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
if you have something already done and

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
these ones have already said okay so we

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.930 
these ones have already said okay so we
can<00:04:40.530> scoop<00:04:40.770> them<00:04:40.950> out<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.340> grab<00:04:41.520> ourselves<00:04:41.670> a

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
can scoop them out and grab ourselves a

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.880 
can scoop them out and grab ourselves a
plate<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.720> then<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:43.140> ease<00:04:43.350> them<00:04:43.560> out<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.860> I
