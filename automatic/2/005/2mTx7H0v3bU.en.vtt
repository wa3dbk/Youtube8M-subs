00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
didn't come to mind at that point how

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780 
didn't come to mind at that point how
big<00:01:15.630> was<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> win<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.229> first<00:01:16.380> game<00:01:16.650> oh<00:01:16.920> it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
big was it to win that first game oh it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.749 
big was it to win that first game oh it
was<00:01:17.939> huge<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.650> was<00:01:19.860> every<00:01:20.220> huge<00:01:20.549> because

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
was huge and it was every huge because

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.310 
was huge and it was every huge because
you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.630> gave<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.110> lot<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
you know that that gave me a lot of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.190 
you know that that gave me a lot of
momentum<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.860> kind<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.490> um<00:01:23.729> i<00:01:24.119> guess<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
momentum and kind of um i guess it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.640 
momentum and kind of um i guess it
rattled<00:01:26.100> him<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.960> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
rattled him a little bit you know so it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.730 
rattled him a little bit you know so it
was<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.700> most<00:01:29.909> important<00:01:30.500> all<00:01:31.500> right<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
