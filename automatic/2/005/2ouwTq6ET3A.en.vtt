something they should have done from the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
something they should have done from the
beginning<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.090> Gundam<00:00:48.300> itself

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
has an incredibly flexible frame three

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.010 
has an incredibly flexible frame three
is<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> fact<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> knees<00:01:15.479> Bend<00:01:15.900> very

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
is the fact that the knees Bend very

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.440 
is the fact that the knees Bend very
well<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> legs<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> figure<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.180> duo

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
well in the legs you get a figure of duo

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.030 
well in the legs you get a figure of duo
Maxwell<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:19.500> you're<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> get<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
Maxwell and then you're going to get the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.469 
Maxwell and then you're going to get the
beam<00:01:20.250> scissors<00:01:20.759> which<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.060> probably<00:01:21.299> one<00:01:21.450> of

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 
haven't built this thing already so this

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.540 
haven't built this thing already so this
is<00:07:19.230> going<00:07:19.350> to<00:07:19.410> be<00:07:19.500> my<00:07:19.650> first<00:07:19.860> shot<00:07:20.130> at<00:07:20.160> both<00:07:20.400> the

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.550 
is going to be my first shot at both the

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.400 
is going to be my first shot at both the
inner<00:07:20.670> frame<00:07:21.060> and<00:07:21.300> the<00:07:21.870> whole<00:07:22.050> bunch<00:07:22.290> of

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
inner frame and the whole bunch of

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.110 
inner frame and the whole bunch of
extras<00:07:22.800> but<00:07:22.920> overall<00:07:23.280> the<00:07:23.430> big<00:07:23.580> black<00:07:23.760> parts

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
extras but overall the big black parts

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.210 
extras but overall the big black parts
look<00:07:24.390> a<00:07:24.480> little<00:07:24.780> bit<00:07:24.930> bland<00:07:25.260> but<00:07:26.040> otherwise

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 
look a little bit bland but otherwise

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.950 
look a little bit bland but otherwise
hopefully<00:07:26.730> the<00:07:26.850> result<00:07:27.150> is<00:07:27.330> going<00:07:27.510> to<00:07:27.660> be<00:07:27.750> very

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
hopefully the result is going to be very

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.260 
hopefully the result is going to be very
cool<00:07:28.170> the<00:07:28.770> extras<00:07:29.130> are<00:07:29.250> nice<00:07:29.400> although<00:07:29.760> I<00:07:30.000> have

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270 
cool the extras are nice although I have

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.670 
cool the extras are nice although I have
to<00:07:30.300> wonder<00:07:30.540> whether<00:07:30.810> they<00:07:30.990> needed<00:07:31.260> to<00:07:31.380> make<00:07:31.530> a

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 
to wonder whether they needed to make a

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.830 
to wonder whether they needed to make a
big<00:07:31.710> box<00:07:32.250> with<00:07:32.430> this<00:07:32.550> it<00:07:33.030> looks<00:07:33.330> like<00:07:33.480> it<00:07:33.630> could

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 
big box with this it looks like it could

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.840 
big box with this it looks like it could
fit<00:07:34.080> into<00:07:34.200> a<00:07:34.320> regular<00:07:34.710> winged<00:07:34.920> 0<00:07:35.190> custom<00:07:35.640> sized

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:35.850 
fit into a regular winged 0 custom sized

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.270 
fit into a regular winged 0 custom sized
box<00:07:36.210> if<00:07:36.480> they<00:07:36.660> cut<00:07:36.840> this<00:07:36.990> plate<00:07:37.230> in<00:07:37.350> half<00:07:37.530> but

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 
box if they cut this plate in half but

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.620 
box if they cut this plate in half but
otherwise<00:07:38.520> it<00:07:38.850> looks<00:07:38.880> good<00:07:39.180> on<00:07:39.270> the<00:07:39.330> Shelf

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:39.630 
otherwise it looks good on the Shelf

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.150 
otherwise it looks good on the Shelf
like<00:07:39.780> this<00:07:39.990> and<00:07:40.260> now<00:07:40.500> it's<00:07:40.740> a<00:07:40.800> question<00:07:41.070> of

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 
like this and now it's a question of

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.760 
like this and now it's a question of
will<00:07:41.370> it<00:07:41.490> look<00:07:41.610> good<00:07:41.850> when<00:07:42.600> I<00:07:42.630> turn<00:07:42.900> these<00:07:43.140> into

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:43.770 
will it look good when I turn these into
