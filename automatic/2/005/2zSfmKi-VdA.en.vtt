00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.200
 very good to all how are you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.240
 we will smoke welcome once again to 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.580
 Calfumán we are in the ign page 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.500
 let's go up a little bit because we're going to 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.720
 see what we have today playstation 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.400
 plus content for January 2015 say 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.660
 it has not been confirmed 100% that what 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.360
 I think because they have not put it in the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.430
 official playstation blog so no 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.810
 it is confirmed but it goes by this line 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.970
 it is safer as these games and 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.980
 are two for each sony platform 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.690
 remember that many times there are three this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.699
 once only two come out at least in this 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.050
 news I have not seen another about 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.719
 precision then entered into several pages 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.190
 of video games and I have not seen anything of 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.239
 precisely because only in this one so I'm going 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.550
 to take advantage to make a small 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.289
 Advance just in case and well you know that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 the year is over so happy new year 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.539
 for everyone if someone leaves some 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.309
 message so you can read it in front 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.889
 of all, well, they would put it on 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.929
 next video and I have to say I have 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:53.760
 to say that from now on instead 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.780
 to start a video like I did the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.699
 two previous ones if I'm not wrong 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.350
 starting by greeting and such that I think 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.179
 very good idea because I'm going to leave it 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.819
 appear a video let's say I'm going to 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.880
 collect let's say all the messages that 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:07.200
 you want greetings let's say questions 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.270
 that there are also enough 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.979
 and I'm going to put them in a single video for 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.229
 that is not a bit heavy so we have already 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.539
 the news I'm going to the point and I'm not with 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.670
 so much nonsense if you do not like what 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.439
 you can obviously say and I would go back to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.299
 step before them what happens is that as 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.310
 you know every day there are more people and every day 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.649
 we are more every day as there are more messages 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.450
 then each day would be lengthened by that 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.369
 I think it 's a good idea to recover 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.289
 how many and make a video a day a video 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.409
 every two days with all the questions and 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.719
 the greetings no and well what is said 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.460
 You want to follow me the other way 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.560
 you say and you already know that here in 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.830
 you send too much you as 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.270
 no good said we're going to focus 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.020
 playstation as content of January 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.989
 2015 you know that we started the year and in the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.300
 logical theory would start the year 

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:57.210
 strong we are in kings almost 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.220
 and well, many will think to see what 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.020
 games will be good not like 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.570
 I always say to taste the colors in 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.540
 this case let's see what are we can 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.110
 see that for pérez and four we have 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.880
 supposedly I already say it is not 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.280
 confirmed 100% is not corroborated the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.460
 information but they baron for this line 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.740
 we have on facebook first light 200 and what 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.370
 I read wrong if I read something bad I feel I am not 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.650
 here 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.019
 a crack of English but good and try 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.799
 and on facebook first light there was no 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:29.230
 ever heard this game be the saga 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.940
 in Filmus I like but not me 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.310
 I remembered filter light I do not know if it's the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.510
 last game of the saga some do not know if 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.489
 someone can tell me you know that I am 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.920
 a little behind and you always help me 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.329
 in the comments with your help 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.970
 like this information so good if 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.340
 Someone knows if it is the last one, 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.379
 Well let me tell you and Asia already 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.540
 I have idea expansion of the shock game 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.190
 to get good punchs I'll leave the 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.140
 description as always so that what 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.609
 you can read quietly I'm not going to 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.250
 read it all because if it would not be a 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.810
 foolishly I think and well this is the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.160
 important game of quotes you know that 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.379
 they always put an important game and 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.560
 then for the other one that is retro type 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.390
 remake type that is not so graphic not the 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.340
 graphics us powerful are more for 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.989
 Have fun a ratillo well then in 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.519
 this case we have to go up but I do not know if 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.670
 I read it well but good an adventure of 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.859
 puzzles created by face palme game a me 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.290

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.489

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.240

 prototype 2 prototype 2 that I have 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.420
 I want to play there are times I see a 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.240
 I play the name of a game I do not have 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.430
 you win but this brings me curiosity I have 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.780
 want to play it so for me it's 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.220
 acceptable that as is not that many 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.459
 Sometimes I complain for good this time 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.860
 acceptable and good the other title that 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.209
 we have is ductile it is remastered and 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.940
 we can read that is the other title 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.920
 adhered to the promotion in this case the 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.410
 remake of the classic and fantastic titles 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.140

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.910
 good ducktails we can see here a 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.610
 picture if I'm not wrong is this is not 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.980

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.110

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.150
 pretty funny to me I like it and 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.769
