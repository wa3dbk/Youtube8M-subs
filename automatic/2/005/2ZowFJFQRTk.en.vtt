hey guys this is Jackie or nerdy crafter
now<00:00:04.470> I'm<00:00:04.710> no<00:00:04.890> marine<00:00:05.100> biologist<00:00:06.649> but<00:00:07.649> that

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
now I'm no marine biologist but that

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.589 
now I'm no marine biologist but that
doesn't<00:00:08.100> stop<00:00:08.370> me<00:00:08.580> from<00:00:08.610> admiring<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.389> deep

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
doesn't stop me from admiring the deep

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.200 
doesn't stop me from admiring the deep
sea<00:00:09.929> although<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.380> do<00:00:10.500> really<00:00:11.070> get<00:00:11.400> seasick<00:00:12.030> I

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
sea although I do really get seasick I

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.270 
sea although I do really get seasick I
can't<00:00:12.509> be<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> boat<00:00:13.139> without<00:00:13.349> getting

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
can't be on a boat without getting

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.900 
can't be on a boat without getting
really<00:00:14.940> really<00:00:15.570> nauseous<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.670> being<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.850> a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
really really nauseous so being on a

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.480 
really really nauseous so being on a
cruise<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.619> definitely<00:00:19.619> not<00:00:19.770> an<00:00:19.949> option<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
cruise is definitely not an option and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.740 
cruise is definitely not an option and
another<00:00:20.580> thing<00:00:20.970> about<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.330> ocean<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.720> that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
another thing about the ocean is that

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.019 
another thing about the ocean is that
it's<00:00:22.020> scary<00:00:22.470> because<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.369> don't<00:00:23.670> know

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it's scary because we just don't know

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.300 
it's scary because we just don't know
what's<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.600> there<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.109> mean<00:00:25.410> there's<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.130> many

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
what's in there I mean there's so many

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.160 
what's in there I mean there's so many
species<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.180> yet<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> discover

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
species that we have yet to discover

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.919 
species that we have yet to discover
isn't<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.039> fascinating<00:00:29.359> since<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.660> many<00:00:30.779> of

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
isn't that fascinating since so many of

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
isn't that fascinating since so many of
you<00:00:31.109> really<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.980> polymer<00:00:32.430> clay<00:00:32.580> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
you really like the polymer clay and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.420

resin<00:00:33.510> combination<00:00:34.140> tutorial<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.800> figured<00:00:35.309> I'd

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
resin combination tutorial I figured I'd

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.000 
resin combination tutorial I figured I'd
give<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.640> another<00:00:35.969> shot<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.739> week

you guys will learn how to make a small
jellyfish<00:00:40.860> tank<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.879> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.210> look<00:00:42.390> under<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
jellyfish tank now if you look under the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
jellyfish tank now if you look under the
jellyfish<00:00:43.200> you'll<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.950> kind<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
jellyfish you'll see that it kind of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.369 
jellyfish you'll see that it kind of
looks<00:00:44.399> goo<00:00:44.969> E<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.390> that's<00:00:45.870> because<00:00:46.230> I've

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
looks goo E and that's because I've

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560 
looks goo E and that's because I've
added<00:00:46.620> some<00:00:46.980> cotton<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.180> give<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
added some cotton there to give it that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.500 
added some cotton there to give it that
effect<00:00:49.160> pretty<00:00:50.160> nifty<00:00:50.430> eh<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:51.180> was<00:00:51.210> so

Canadian<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.079> me<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.039> project<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
Canadian of me now for this project I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.670 
Canadian of me now for this project I
highly<00:00:54.059> suggest<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.750> don't<00:00:55.140> blow<00:00:55.500> out

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
highly suggest that you don't blow out

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.069 
highly suggest that you don't blow out
the<00:00:55.860> bubbles<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.550> your<00:00:56.850> resin<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.690> only<00:00:57.899> thing

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the bubbles in your resin the only thing

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.840 
the bubbles in your resin the only thing
I<00:00:58.170> would<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.320> done<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.680> maybe<00:00:58.859> pop<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.609> one

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
I would have done is maybe pop that one

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.819 
I would have done is maybe pop that one
but<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> would<00:01:00.629> keep<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> rest<00:01:01.590> because

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
but I would keep all the rest because

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.160 
but I would keep all the rest because
they<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.160> look<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.579> floating<00:01:03.180> plankton<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
they do look like floating plankton and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980 
they do look like floating plankton and
little<00:01:04.979> particles<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.640> would<00:01:05.970> exist<00:01:06.420> under

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
little particles that would exist under

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.630 
little particles that would exist under
the<00:01:07.020> ocean<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.890> love<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.369> project

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

what<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.650> did<00:02:42.770> previously<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:44.210> we're

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
what you did previously and then we're

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.510 
what you did previously and then we're
going<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.630> flatten<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.320> down<00:02:45.530> slightly<00:02:46.010> and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
going to flatten it down slightly and

going to flatten it down slightly and
then<00:02:47.000> twirl<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.510> from<00:02:47.720> there<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:47.959> that's<00:02:48.200> going

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
then twirl it from there so that's going

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.350 
then twirl it from there so that's going
to<00:02:48.590> give<00:02:48.800> me<00:02:48.890> different<00:02:49.160> tentacle<00:02:49.940> effects

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
to give me different tentacle effects

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.600 
to give me different tentacle effects
place<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.320> tentacles<00:02:51.800> in<00:02:51.950> however<00:02:52.340> way<00:02:52.580> you

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
place the tentacles in however way you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.460 
place the tentacles in however way you
want<00:02:52.760> just<00:02:53.450> make<00:02:53.600> sure<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.050> center<00:02:54.440> is

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
want just make sure that the center is

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.380 
want just make sure that the center is
empty<00:02:55.130> because<00:02:55.640> we're<00:02:55.790> going<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.030> be<00:02:56.180> putting

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
empty because we're going to be putting

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.199 
empty because we're going to be putting
the<00:02:56.600> cotton<00:02:56.930> swab<00:02:57.140> after<00:02:57.980> we<00:02:58.100> make<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.459> now<00:02:58.970> for

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the cotton swab after we make it now for

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.729 
the cotton swab after we make it now for
the<00:02:59.270> final<00:02:59.600> one<00:02:59.750> you're<00:03:00.080> going<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.350> stop<00:03:00.530> the

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
the final one you're going to stop the

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.740 
the final one you're going to stop the
same<00:03:01.010> base<00:03:01.250> then<00:03:01.550> you're<00:03:01.970> going<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.239> make<00:03:02.360> one

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
same base then you're going to make one

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.400 
same base then you're going to make one
snake<00:03:03.140> put<00:03:04.130> them<00:03:04.280> together<00:03:04.600> twist<00:03:05.600> them<00:03:05.870> put

snake put them together twist them put

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.960 
snake put them together twist them put
it<00:03:06.530> right<00:03:06.830> in<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.040> center<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.640> make

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
it right in the center and make

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.850 
it right in the center and make
tentacles<00:03:08.570> on<00:03:08.900> different<00:03:09.440> sides<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.800> the

tentacles on different sides of the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.280 
tentacles on different sides of the
circle<00:03:10.720> experiment<00:03:11.720> with<00:03:11.900> as<00:03:11.989> many<00:03:12.140> different

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
circle experiment with as many different

now we're going to let them cure

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.590 
now we're going to let them cure
overnight<00:04:33.610> now<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:34.240> they've<00:04:34.360> cured

overnight you can definitely see the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.100 
overnight you can definitely see the

actual food coloring on the second coat
and<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.750> one<00:04:40.900> that<00:04:41.050> doesn't

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
and the one that doesn't

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.340 
and the one that doesn't
now<00:04:42.010> remove<00:04:42.310> them<00:04:42.490> from<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.790> mold<00:04:43.170> and<00:04:44.170> the

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
now remove them from the mold and the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.350 
now remove them from the mold and the
bubbles<00:04:44.710> in<00:04:44.920> there<00:04:45.130> are<00:04:45.340> just<00:04:45.850> perfect

bubbles in there are just perfect

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.510 
bubbles in there are just perfect
because<00:04:46.660> it<00:04:46.780> really<00:04:47.110> gives<00:04:47.320> them<00:04:47.500> an<00:04:47.740> undersea

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
because it really gives them an undersea

because it really gives them an undersea
look<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:49.990> don't<00:04:50.200> want<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.530> blow<00:04:50.710> out<00:04:50.860> your
