00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.899
 DVD review with another trailer 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.000
 check and that to a French 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.160
 film and often the french insulted the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.080
 Often have completely different ideas and so too 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.130
 create this cinematographic export 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.199
 and therefore we take a look at 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.199
 a new comedy called wallet 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.880
 no i do not take care of him 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.510
 I have not got any else 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.790
 the nerves 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.070
 you play with renÃ© he does not even know 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.070
 more like your name is halo 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.690
 Alzheimer's they are not allowed to all 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.610
 Foreigners responsible for their misfortune 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.559
 But do I speak not of 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.090
 that father baptist they had it 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.230
 I really deserves to be 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.550
 come to lose me to the devil 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:58.379
 you can not do that to me 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:03.670
 only the minimum pension sold to live 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:11.170
 mother in law the tip he is 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 clumsy as many professionals no 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.210
 Worry reigns well it will come again 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.250
 and as fast as I am the businessman 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.740
 but the drugs granny I sell is that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.600
 forbidden space cakes have an ideal 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.360
 I give you 10 for every new customer 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.180
 you bring more 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.420
 But beware never hard drugs though 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.240
 Of course I do not feel that way 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.770
 Change I 've even got it 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.460
 befriended with the little black one 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.830
 and now you take our business 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.450
 his place 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.070
 Do not start again 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.399
 what are you doing in there pole drugs 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.399
 all joke 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.680
 After the trailer, I honestly said 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.630
 we really like palettes and new ones 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.610
 Visions film rental from the 18th 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.950
 will bring it to german cinemas on july 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.960
 poland is about the sprightly 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.790
 Retiree named Poletti a former 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.500
 The confectioner is in but the problem has 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.660
 that the pension is not really that 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.130
 life is enough and as you happen to be 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.990
 small pack of grass falls into hands 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.270
 she decides that you are fine with that 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.190
 floorboards could and thus the good 80 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.960
 year old actually to drug deals 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.700
 the pensioners and rises very fast 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.920
 the undisputed threat queens 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.330
 your territory good at the ability 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.830
 to bake can thereby also 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.420
 still wonderful to send hate war 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.150
 and I actually think that's one 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.130
 funny idea retiree meets drugs 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.380
 milieu that would be a German film barely 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.420
 possible because france yes and the idea 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.890
 is fun the trailer is funny too 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.720
 if we do not do the cast in this country 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.980
 I am really looking forward to getting to know you 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.270
 the strip and hope that I 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.340
 maybe one or the other of 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.170
 I can care for you 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.459
 the rhythm and french film often 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.770
 and the main actress seems here 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.270
 unbelievably cool and cool to act and 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.980
 That's why I'm really up for it 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.270
 I hope one or the other 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.380
 maybe a little look for 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.330

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.680
