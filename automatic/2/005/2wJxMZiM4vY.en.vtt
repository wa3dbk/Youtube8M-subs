00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.980

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.619
 become 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.929
 Jeff the shadows a bit and in how many and also 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.130
 In the hand 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.720
 how little one 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.190
 the team had 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.190
 he shoots Vanins Merfeld

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.130
 important also the rounds I've done so that the mobile phone flatrate 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.370
 Conti is sitting 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.650

 Parsippany takes Iceland 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.970
 Scharf Petrov Wyeth 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.290
 with the right one 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.610
 can we do that 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.590
 in Gland increase 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.740
 and with the left 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.000
 because I had intensified 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 I do not only do that now, it's a bit darker now 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.040
 on 30 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.000
 that's fine 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 discard shines buoyancy 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 No, we had a nice missing one 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.970
 and 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.900
 Heckmann okay 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.340
 then we will still use a general 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.990
 a center flow 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.280
 Asbeck 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 around Green 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.610
 in the German army 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.750
 many are 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.660
 Art world came 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.660
 Planning lightening 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.210
 SAP we win mine and the ten losers 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.140
 because they use it around 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.580
 Yes 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.240
 in the picture a little more 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.900
 no idea how to hunt me 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.310
 what is my biggest 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.759
 you can see it is now 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.609
 to be camouflaged 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:12.919
 besides, you have to 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.309
 if you are wrong 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.309
 large 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.819
 look like paint 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.149
 that a Grätz abbey benefits the Chancellor's attitude 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.529
 long shadow he is 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:27.989
 you can 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.329
 Shadow a little reduce me think so it 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.919
 is pretty good 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.249
 the companies are using the grain 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.449
 you can also change that 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.569
 depending on how strong you can "have the little ones that way you should 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.899
 Of course not 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.529
 I ask you my from 3 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.539
 and both intensity 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.669
 you can do it differently 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.599
 dpa pretty quickly then is a good choice or 9 and 8 the concert was me 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.019
 take flight operations 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.019
 and that's how my picture looks like 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.779
 DubLi animals is in 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.469
 So the plane 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.349
 and if still had a field 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.679
 missing 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.679
 extended 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:17.519
 PixelNet 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.079
 no liability 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.079
 in the same year 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.809
 for those interested in founding 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.359
 Rostock 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.849
 the team again 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.049
 then you can have such a window 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.639
 I ask you 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.930
 this Cornelia and not to pretend 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:43.519
 have always done three hits 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.439
 if you can find me the right insurance 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.749
 and not to give the whole Porsche &amp; Fame have to be awarded 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.059
 to lose 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:54.299
 These will be easy 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.909
 and just make the radius 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.079
 and the most beautiful results get a radius of 4 for that 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.259
 stand now 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.109
 that is always a matter of taste 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.309
 Per cent I would have Käßmann take a four-radius 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:09.369
 and then click OK 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.849
 if the whole thing already so that I do not come from strength 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.339
 but 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:17.499
 to better recognize the picture 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.789
 you can leave that commitment and then just the intensity 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:24.870
 change a little bit 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.730
 become 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.259
 in Dr 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.199
 Satellite scheduled many countries to terminate Sion from the Cup 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.499
 like the whole thing up 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.960
 Make dunker than put on data 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.159
 and then you have such a result, he sees power 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.620
 Naturally 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.409
 I make the construct a bit bigger 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.319
 wagner 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.509
 it sounds 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.199
 Wyeth not like that 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.879
 Benito is not very tall 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.779
 which is please 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.059
 what to do 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:58.059
 as the heads-up percent one could of course now 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.000
 a bit at the brightness rumschrauben or at the 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.689
 visibility 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.689
 or paint with the brush 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.050
 Häfner fine switches 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.000
 December do not give up then put on a soft brush that wanted 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.409
 I say so 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.409
 Prince Charles is he with this 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.789
 which is not that hard 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.049
 that he did not have such a person but because I'm constantly 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.029
 and then you could go here 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.089
 even yours 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:35.529
 the z 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.909
 adjust it 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.460
 about once he with one hundred percent 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.460
 you see that they take everything away 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.460
 if only I would take 50 percent now 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.779
 Nintendo 50 percent 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.479
 away from that you can see it then quite well 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:56.800
 14 times 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.030
 is the Pressure Dialogue that has not quite disappeared 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:02.909
 there you can 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.669
 also play a bit 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.029
 if you say so 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:09.580
 yes I want 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.749
 recognize the face more 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:16.419
 but the years the borders to stay after the other department stores 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.770
 you can not invest here 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.009
 and watch 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.479
 depending on how "Sin likes 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.539
 kl 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.089
 what to take away 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:28.469
 or 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.469
 Add again when you talk everyday 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.830
 editing a step backwards 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.180
 It can also quickly replaced by nothing my view 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.249
 about 50% with the child 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:45.060
 if I give the boys a bit 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.439
 what to take away 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.289
 then you recognize the face again 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:50.719
 we'll leave that 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:53.599
 I think that 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:56.249
 Bommer 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.599
 that's pretty much kicked 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.599
 I think so it is a very nice result 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.009
 could 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:08.490
 the godfather in beautiful picture frames and then 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.969
 hanging 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:15.180
 yes, the ice cream is also good as a gift 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.749
 I hope he made it scared fallen 

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:19.009
 and that's why 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:21.780
 at Shell they have a lot of comics 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.369
 Klestil have moderate pictures hanging in their apartment 

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:26.609
 Celgene is the name of the day
