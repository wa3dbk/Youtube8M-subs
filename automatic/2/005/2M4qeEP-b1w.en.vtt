00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.379 
another piece of wood aquarium statue
and<00:02:38.799> she's<00:02:39.159> currently<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.670> he's<00:02:40.450> beat<00:02:40.810> ships

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
and she's currently on he's beat ships

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.710 
and she's currently on he's beat ships
moving<00:02:43.389> along<00:02:43.750> we've<00:02:44.260> got<00:02:44.439> a<00:02:44.470> humidor

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
moving along we've got a humidor

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.940 
moving along we've got a humidor
humidity<00:02:46.720> gauge<00:02:47.700> feel<00:02:48.700> focus<00:02:49.239> area<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.799> then

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
humidity gauge feel focus area and then

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.039 
humidity gauge feel focus area and then
we've<00:02:51.069> got<00:02:51.099> this<00:02:51.430> exhales<00:02:52.060> having<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.569> sit<00:02:52.750> or

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
we've got this exhales having it sit or

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.710 
we've got this exhales having it sit or
maybe<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.500> komodo<00:02:54.010> plant<00:02:54.489> i'm<00:02:54.760> not<00:02:54.909> sure<00:02:55.480> but<00:02:55.510> i

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
maybe a komodo plant i'm not sure but i

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.520 
maybe a komodo plant i'm not sure but i
think<00:02:56.019> it's<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.799> exo<00:02:57.400> terra<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.969> then<00:02:58.930> up<00:02:59.469> here

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
think it's a exo terra and then up here

we've got a 75 watt bulb in a cage and

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.830 
we've got a 75 watt bulb in a cage and
then<00:03:03.700> XO<00:03:04.000> terrell<00:03:04.299> large<00:03:05.219> hide<00:03:06.629> so<00:03:07.629> this<00:03:07.810> is

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
then XO terrell large hide so this is

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.339 
then XO terrell large hide so this is
how<00:03:08.109> a<00:03:08.319> cage<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.709> full<00:03:09.750> got<00:03:10.750> this<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.650> then

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
how a cage in full got this and then

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.050 
how a cage in full got this and then
