 Sure you can't make someone a group 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.680
 dropping him to the interlayer so 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.490

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.490

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.780
 a 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.940
 well from the seasonal responses and 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.160
 you need to carlos your thorn away 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.660

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.810
 target for this season 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.250
 what you're looking for by successful season 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.380
 how many matches in a minute on too 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.060
 for shouting that's hard to say 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.700

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.500

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.019
