show you today how to do it goes off the

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.410 
show you today how to do it goes off the
sheet<00:00:07.620> metal<00:00:07.799> loft<00:00:08.220> between<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> square<00:00:09.179> and

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
sheet metal loft between a square and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.700 
sheet metal loft between a square and
Ryan<00:00:10.170> sketches<00:00:11.540> so<00:00:12.540> I'm<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.349> use<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
Ryan sketches so I'm going to use the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.440 
Ryan sketches so I'm going to use the
front<00:00:13.920> plane<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.460> example<00:00:14.820> just<00:00:15.299> gonna

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
front plane for this example just gonna

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.810 
front plane for this example just gonna
sketch<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.139> hey<00:00:16.890> if<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.400> do<00:00:17.550> an<00:00:17.670> actual

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
sketch on it hey if you do an actual

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.050 
sketch on it hey if you do an actual
full<00:00:18.270> square<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:19.080> around<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.490> do<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.850> so

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
full square to around you can do that so

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.490 
full square to around you can do that so
it<00:00:21.180> works<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.750> doesn't<00:00:22.020> mean<00:00:22.320> it's

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
it works it doesn't mean it's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.160 
it works it doesn't mean it's
manufacturable<00:00:23.400> hey<00:00:24.000> you're<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:24.900> going<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
manufacturable hey you're not going to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.650 
manufacturable hey you're not going to
be<00:00:25.260> able<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.619> actually<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.519> ship<00:00:26.820> so

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
be able to actually be on that ship so

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.900 
be able to actually be on that ship so
what<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:30.179> draw<00:00:30.480> half<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:32.460> shape<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
what I do is just draw half the shape of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.709 
what I do is just draw half the shape of
half<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.239> square<00:00:33.480> or<00:00:33.860> rectangle<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.450> case

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
half a square or rectangle so this case

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.060 
half a square or rectangle so this case
I'm<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.200> draw<00:00:37.440> across<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.760> this

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.700 

lots<00:00:42.489> of<00:00:42.700> dimensions<00:00:43.300> to<00:00:43.480> that<00:00:43.630> so<00:00:43.930> let's<00:00:44.170> say

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.270 

so<00:00:49.340> 200

Zuma

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.450 
Zuma
gonna<00:00:55.070> make<00:00:55.280> these<00:00:55.629> three<00:00:56.629> points<00:00:57.309> horizontal

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
gonna make these three points horizontal

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.920 
gonna make these three points horizontal
unselect<00:01:00.360> the<00:01:00.480> midpoint

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
unselect the midpoint

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.630 
unselect the midpoint
I'm<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.470> origin<00:01:02.920> say<00:01:03.520> there<00:01:03.700> were<00:01:03.850> cattle

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
I'm the origin say there were cattle

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.990 
I'm the origin say there were cattle
okay<00:01:05.239> so<00:01:05.780> that's<00:01:05.990> one<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:06.890> my<00:01:07.010> profiles<00:01:07.640> I'm

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
okay so that's one of my profiles I'm

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.790 
okay so that's one of my profiles I'm
just<00:01:08.150> gonna<00:01:08.360> add<00:01:08.570> some<00:01:08.840> sketchbooks

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
just gonna add some sketchbooks

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.720 
just gonna add some sketchbooks
so<00:01:11.040> he's<00:01:11.220> gone<00:01:11.430> awesome<00:01:11.880> terminal

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.480 

you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.040 

so<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:17.970> does<00:01:18.030> time<00:01:18.450> refers<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.200> that

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.800 

vanish<00:01:23.620> without<00:01:23.800> proof

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
vanish without proof

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.780 
vanish without proof
I<00:01:25.960> don't<00:01:26.380> want<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.619> put<00:01:26.740> another<00:01:26.979> profile<00:01:27.579> so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
I don't want to put another profile so

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.480 
I don't want to put another profile so
out<00:01:27.939> on<00:01:28.149> another<00:01:28.270> plan<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.530> can<00:01:29.860> quickie<00:01:30.220> tiger

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
out on another plan I can quickie tiger

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.270 
out on another plan I can quickie tiger
playing<00:01:30.850> behold<00:01:31.210> that<00:01:31.450> control<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.799> dragging

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
playing behold that control and dragging

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.560 
playing behold that control and dragging
the<00:01:33.369> plan<00:01:33.640> move

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
the plan move

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
the plan move
I'll<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:36.020> say<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.770> says<00:01:37.159> longer<00:01:37.820> milk

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
I'll and say I says longer milk

I'll and say I says longer milk
Dustin<00:01:39.299> see

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.530 

sketch<00:01:43.450> on<00:01:43.690> this<00:01:43.870> play<00:01:44.140> leaky<00:01:44.530> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.320 

I'm<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.230> sketch<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:50.370> will<00:01:50.580> be<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
I'm going to sketch what will be the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.250 
I'm going to sketch what will be the
half<00:01:51.540> circle<00:01:52.700> ok<00:01:53.700> so

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
half circle ok so

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.860 
half circle ok so
what's<00:01:55.890> important<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.480> sheet<00:01:57.720> metal

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
what's important is in the sheet metal

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.050 
what's important is in the sheet metal
loft<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.740> must<00:01:59.010> have<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.340> same<00:01:59.580> amount<00:01:59.730> amount

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
loft it must have the same amount amount

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.580 
loft it must have the same amount amount
of<00:02:00.360> these<00:02:00.510> so<00:02:01.410> this<00:02:01.800> is<00:02:01.980> 1<00:02:02.660> this<00:02:03.660> is<00:02:03.900> 2<00:02:04.350> 3

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
of these so this is 1 this is 2 3

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.330 
of these so this is 1 this is 2 3
five<00:02:07.250> entities<00:02:07.759> on<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.269> so<00:02:09.019> rather<00:02:09.830> than<00:02:10.099> do

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
five entities on this so rather than do

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.550 
five entities on this so rather than do
a<00:02:10.640> half<00:02:10.940> circle<00:02:11.269> which<00:02:11.599> is<00:02:11.750> only<00:02:11.900> gonna<00:02:12.140> be<00:02:12.349> one

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
a half circle which is only gonna be one

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.650 
a half circle which is only gonna be one
entity<00:02:12.890> will<00:02:13.879> just<00:02:14.180> draw<00:02:14.480> another<00:02:16.660> similar

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
entity will just draw another similar

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.380 
entity will just draw another similar
ship

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
ship

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780 
ship
ok<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:19.690> just<00:02:20.170> off<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.770> square<00:02:20.920> started<00:02:21.670> off

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
ok so just off the square started off

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.740 
ok so just off the square started off
like<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:23.100> let's<00:02:24.100> say<00:02:24.520> this<00:02:24.819> is<00:02:25.090> one

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.760 

300

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.390 

on<00:02:34.220> again<00:02:34.550> select<00:02:35.540> midpoint

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
on again select midpoint

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.190 
on again select midpoint
I<00:02:37.459> got<00:02:37.700> vertical<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.480> origin

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
I got vertical to the origin

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.229 
I got vertical to the origin
this<00:02:40.860> point<00:02:41.300> at<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.360> point<00:02:42.830> horizontal<00:02:44.239> okay

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
this point at this point horizontal okay

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.960 
this point at this point horizontal okay
uh<00:02:46.129> aghion<00:02:47.129> sketch<00:02:47.940> Phillip<00:02:49.519> I'll<00:02:50.519> not<00:02:50.819> be

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.790 
able to put in a sketch fill it up warm
to<00:02:53.310> 50<00:02:53.730> cuz<00:02:54.510> it'll<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> narrow<00:02:55.200> down<00:02:55.470> here

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
to 50 cuz it'll have a narrow down here

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.080 
to 50 cuz it'll have a narrow down here
so<00:02:56.550> what<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:56.970> context<00:02:57.360> but<00:02:57.480> under<00:02:57.690> 14

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
so what a context but under 14

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.070 
so what a context but under 14
um<00:03:01.269> yes

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
just gonna be how many band lines run

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.550 
just gonna be how many band lines run
across<00:04:02.220> here<00:04:02.459> when<00:04:02.760> it's<00:04:02.879> plumbed<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:04.349> can

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
across here when it's plumbed and I can

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.610 
across here when it's plumbed and I can
okay<00:04:04.890> that

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
I can see there's the four bound lanes

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.009 
I can see there's the four bound lanes
on<00:04:16.109> each<00:04:16.230> band

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
on each band

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.469 
on each band
and<00:04:18.440> that's<00:04:18.650> that's<00:04:19.609> how<00:04:19.819> you<00:04:19.879> create<00:04:20.150> a
