00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
shape if they go in flat just flip one

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.080 
shape if they go in flat just flip one
of<00:00:59.969> them<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.329> they'll<00:01:00.539> make<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> V<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.350> you

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
of them and they'll make the V for you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.450 
of them and they'll make the V for you
you<00:01:03.090> want<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.270> put<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.480> second<00:01:03.960> together<00:01:04.460> just

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you want to put a second together just

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.469 
you want to put a second together just
like<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.820> first<00:01:06.229> in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:08.070> V<00:01:08.280> shape<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.470> then

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
like the first in the V shape and then

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.929 
like the first in the V shape and then
put<00:01:12.479> those<00:01:12.630> two<00:01:12.930> V<00:01:13.200> shapes<00:01:13.729> together<00:01:16.729> they<00:01:17.729> go

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
put those two V shapes together they go

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.330 
put those two V shapes together they go
together<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> pins<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:20.070> see

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
together because the pins as you can see

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.240 
together because the pins as you can see
are<00:01:20.549> parallel<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.619> then<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> holes<00:01:23.009> are

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
are parallel and then the holes are

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.760 
are parallel and then the holes are
parallel<00:01:23.810> if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.960> try<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> put<00:01:25.500> them<00:01:25.619> in

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
parallel if you try to put them in

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.340 
parallel if you try to put them in
together<00:01:26.180> in<00:01:27.180> singles

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
together in singles

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.120 
together in singles
they<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.220> won't<00:01:29.430> fit<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.210> you'll<00:01:30.780> be

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
they just won't fit and you'll be

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.260 
they just won't fit and you'll be
jamming<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> pieces<00:01:32.579> together<00:01:32.729> trying<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
jamming the pieces together trying to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.840 
jamming the pieces together trying to
get<00:01:33.450> them<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.810> fit<00:01:34.189> so<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> first

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
get them all to fit so this is the first

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.800 
get them all to fit so this is the first
half<00:01:37.460> then<00:01:38.460> we'll<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> same<00:01:39.150> thing<00:01:39.210> for

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
half then we'll do the same thing for

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.639 
half then we'll do the same thing for
the<00:01:39.900> other<00:01:39.930> half<00:01:40.759> two<00:01:41.759> pieces<00:01:43.610> make<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> V<00:01:45.649> two

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the other half two pieces make a V two

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.300 
the other half two pieces make a V two
more<00:01:46.890> pieces<00:01:48.170> make<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> V<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.299> then<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:52.310> four

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
more pieces make a V and then the four

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:07.330 
more pieces make a V and then the four
pieces<00:01:53.579> together<00:01:57.140> wiggle<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.320> push

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.440 

so<00:02:07.939> now<00:02:08.060> we<00:02:08.119> have<00:02:08.300> two<00:02:08.660> halves<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:10.239> we'll<00:02:11.239> put

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
so now we have two halves and we'll put

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.420 
so now we have two halves and we'll put
them<00:02:11.599> all<00:02:11.840> together<00:02:12.110> for<00:02:13.000> pins<00:02:15.069> notice<00:02:16.069> again

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
them all together for pins notice again

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.330 
them all together for pins notice again
that<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.910> pins<00:02:17.209> are<00:02:17.480> parallel<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.920> we'll<00:02:22.040> push

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
that the pins are parallel so we'll push

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.199 
that the pins are parallel so we'll push
the<00:02:23.180> two<00:02:23.390> halves<00:02:23.660> together<00:02:24.459> line<00:02:25.459> up<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.940> pins

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
the two halves together line up the pins

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.920 
the two halves together line up the pins
one<00:02:26.930> at<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.260> time<00:02:28.090> if<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.180> try<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.510> push<00:02:29.750> them

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
one at a time if you try to push them

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.009 
one at a time if you try to push them
all<00:02:30.110> together<00:02:30.319> at<00:02:30.650> once<00:02:31.239> you'll<00:02:32.239> Jam<00:02:32.630> them<00:02:32.870> and

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
all together at once you'll Jam them and

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.259 
all together at once you'll Jam them and
they<00:02:33.110> won't<00:02:33.319> fit<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:34.700> you'll<00:02:34.819> want<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.090> keep

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
they won't fit and you'll want to keep

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.199 
they won't fit and you'll want to keep
your<00:02:35.510> pieces<00:02:35.989> as<00:02:36.410> parallel<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.280> each<00:02:37.640> other<00:02:37.940> as

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
your pieces as parallel to each other as

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.000 
your pieces as parallel to each other as
you<00:02:38.239> can<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.989> don't<00:02:39.140> want<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.319> push<00:02:39.530> one<00:02:39.830> all

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
you can you don't want to push one all

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.100 
you can you don't want to push one all
the<00:02:40.130> way<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.370> because<00:02:41.269> then<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.600> one<00:02:41.840> can't

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
the way on because then this one can't

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.420 
the way on because then this one can't
get<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.280> have<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.640> push<00:02:45.760> evenly<00:02:46.760> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
get on so you have to push evenly and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.320 
get on so you have to push evenly and
gently<00:02:49.430> until<00:02:50.080> all<00:02:51.080> four<00:02:51.350> pieces<00:02:51.620> are<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:53.000> and

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
gently until all four pieces are in and

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.330 
gently until all four pieces are in and
then<00:02:54.230> give<00:02:55.130> them<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.340> wiggle<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:56.150> push<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:57.620> a

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
then give them a wiggle and a push and a

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.500 
then give them a wiggle and a push and a
wiggle<00:02:58.610> in<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.700> push<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:01.150> they<00:03:02.150> will<00:03:02.330> go

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
wiggle in a push and they will go

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.490 
wiggle in a push and they will go
together<00:03:05.470> give<00:03:06.470> them<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.680> little<00:03:06.799> squeeze<00:03:07.250> and

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
together give them a little squeeze and

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.470 
together give them a little squeeze and
a<00:03:09.500> roll<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.549> squeeze<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:10.849> a<00:03:11.060> roll<00:03:11.269> until
