00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
rent the space it she was kind of like

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.210 
rent the space it she was kind of like
opened<00:00:37.730> up<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.510> possibility<00:00:39.140> of<00:00:39.170> being<00:00:40.129> able

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
opened up the possibility of being able

dreamed<00:00:42.559> of<00:00:42.710> starting<00:00:43.149> even<00:00:44.149> though<00:00:44.239> we

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
dreamed of starting even though we

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.530 
dreamed of starting even though we
didn't<00:00:44.570> know<00:00:44.660> what<00:00:44.870> what<00:00:45.110> form<00:00:45.380> it<00:00:45.469> would<00:00:45.590> take

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
didn't know what what form it would take

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.459

both like nice things and we've been
involved<00:00:54.620> in<00:00:54.680> design<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:55.610> architecture<00:00:56.149> and

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
involved in design and architecture and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.979 
involved in design and architecture and
art<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.750> various<00:00:57.500> things<00:00:57.530> for<00:00:58.100> forever<00:00:58.870> so<00:00:59.870> it

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
art and various things for forever so it

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.750 
art and various things for forever so it
kind<00:01:00.170> of<00:01:00.230> started<00:01:00.469> as<00:01:00.590> a<00:01:00.620> side<00:01:00.829> project<00:01:01.100> with

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
kind of started as a side project with

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.639 
kind of started as a side project with
no<00:01:01.789> intention<00:01:02.390> of<00:01:02.449> becoming<00:01:02.600> an<00:01:03.079> actual

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
no intention of becoming an actual

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.520 
no intention of becoming an actual
business

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
business

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.830 
business
and<00:01:05.710> then<00:01:06.220> it<00:01:06.340> slowly<00:01:06.460> kind<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.180> evolved<00:01:07.600> into

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
and then it slowly kind of evolved into

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.170 
and then it slowly kind of evolved into
something<00:01:08.050> that<00:01:08.640> took<00:01:09.640> over<00:01:09.790> our<00:01:09.940> lives

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
something that took over our lives

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.260 
something that took over our lives
certain<00:01:10.990> sense

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.120 

so<00:01:14.270> say<00:01:14.450> like<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.719> garrison<00:01:15.079> bag<00:01:15.259> each<00:01:15.829> piece

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
so say like the garrison bag each piece

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.240 
so say like the garrison bag each piece
is<00:01:16.369> cut<00:01:16.640> one<00:01:17.390> by<00:01:17.539> one<00:01:17.750> there's<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.859> lot<00:01:19.070> of

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
is cut one by one there's a lot of

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.340 
is cut one by one there's a lot of
different<00:01:19.609> sewing<00:01:19.939> steps<00:01:20.210> involved<00:01:20.689> in<00:01:20.899> the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
different sewing steps involved in the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.800 
different sewing steps involved in the
character<00:01:21.530> bag<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:22.700> think<00:01:22.909> we<00:01:23.090> count<00:01:23.299> about<00:01:23.539> 30

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
character bag I think we count about 30

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.649 
character bag I think we count about 30
yeah<00:01:24.560> steps<00:01:24.920> yeah<00:01:25.399> then<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.479> leather

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
yeah steps yeah then the leather

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.080 
yeah steps yeah then the leather
components<00:01:27.490> will<00:01:28.490> get<00:01:28.640> leather<00:01:28.819> from

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
components will get leather from

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.969 
components will get leather from
Halloween<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.289> then<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:30.649> will<00:01:30.740> make<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
Halloween so then you will make the

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.980 
Halloween so then you will make the
handles<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.850> all<00:01:31.969> the<00:01:32.149> leather<00:01:32.329> attachments

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
handles and all the leather attachments

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.990 
handles and all the leather attachments
from<00:01:33.110> those<00:01:33.350> we're<00:01:34.159> always<00:01:34.250> looking<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.700> kind

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
from those we're always looking to kind

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.630 
from those we're always looking to kind
of<00:01:35.119> detail<00:01:36.110> everything<00:01:36.409> for<00:01:36.860> quality<00:01:37.399> and

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
of detail everything for quality and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.090 
of detail everything for quality and
then<00:01:38.209> after<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.350> kind<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.649> worry<00:01:39.860> about<00:01:39.890> the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
then after that kind of worry about the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.699 
then after that kind of worry about the
efficiency<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.149> cost<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.750> all<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:42.110> but

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
efficiency and the cost and all that but

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.069 
efficiency and the cost and all that but
like<00:01:42.860> number<00:01:43.189> one<00:01:43.369> is<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.729> try<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:43.909> make<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:44.360> the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
like number one is to try to make it the

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.589 
like number one is to try to make it the
most<00:01:45.349> refined<00:01:45.920> but<00:01:46.759> yet<00:01:46.939> yet<00:01:47.239> functional

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599 
most refined but yet yet functional

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.809 
most refined but yet yet functional
thing<00:01:48.049> possible<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:48.829> someone<00:01:49.280> will<00:01:49.459> really

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
like precision but then also allowing
