00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.420
 dvd critics another and final 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.559
 trailer check to the tribute of panem 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.559
 2k czech celebration 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.199
 until over they have very hard 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:26.770
 Fought in the games but it was 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.310
 players they want a real 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.310
 experience war 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.110
 but I should say I'm happy 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.000
 just go crazy on the stripes and 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.770
 I know that I am absolutely not 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.329
 but alone after david yesterday 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.429
 behind in the news and a little bit 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.659
 I could have dropped the news now 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.490
 here also a little bit 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.039
 predict exactly to this strip 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.380
 will it be the next youtuber preview g 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.329
 with him and me as host and it comes 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.460
 someone else third to hosted with 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.409
 while more info then in the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.030
 next week and what should i see i saw 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.829
 must say the third trailer of the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.479
 tribute of panem two catching fire the 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.220
 us, by the way, studiocanal expected 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.630
 or what is expected from the 21st 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.369
 bring november to german cinemas 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.599
 becomes the weakest of all three 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.429
 Trailern must be quite honest 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:53.319
 tendered of course pr technical 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.179
 start the release phase now 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.560
 He is very much looking forward to action 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.209
 cut and has many sequences 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.319
 from the first and the second trailer 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.000
 in there and let the revue 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.470
 It also happens quite well 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.329
 in the first trailer it was 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.220
 catching fire to show that 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.869
 Katniss and Peeta in the Hunger Games 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.250
 have won that they are worshiped 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.660
 that they are in their own population because 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.579
 she gets a house and twelfth 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.530
 district to a kind of heroic 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.390
 hero figure matures but so too 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.340
 almost a rebellion triggers and she 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.989
 maybe that's why he has to die 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.459
 second part in the second trailer to 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.230
 catching fire was then shown 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.389
 that the solution almost consists of new ones 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.859
 hunger games with the winners of the 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.600
 past of past hunger 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.980
 trigger games so that you can 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.079
 both sides of the story meanwhile 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.880
 knows and this third trailer is just 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.920
 this mixture full of action full 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.540
 tension because you will be in a few days 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.220
 finally on 12 november is here 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.709
 in berlin the germany premiere and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.030
 then on november 21 this movie will be released 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.889
 then in all german cinemas 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.329
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.609
 and I know I'm not alone with that 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.930
 is only because of the gas, of course, 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.400
 jennifer lawrence joins josh again 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.769
 hutcherson but especially people like 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.630
 im only the hesse philip seymour hoffman 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.430
 donald sutherland stanley tucci liam 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.950
 hemsworth and many others known 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.480
 faces if I'm really happy 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.010
 the view to see this movie 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.690
 and to know that it just works 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.819
 I continue to find it a great series 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.230
 both with a certain romance 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.880
 Therefore, without being too cheesy 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.260
 but also with a seriousness that 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.690
 whole packed in this fantastic 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.340
 World which is partly medieval 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.169
 in the elderly or in the poorer ones 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.180
 districts and partly in total 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.010
 futuristic in the rich districts 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.650
 I think that's a great series where I am 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.209
 I can say 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.920
 because I'm insane on the coming 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.269
 so I am very curious what 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.860
 finds him on this trailer then says 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.120
 her also that third so a bit 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.760
 but the weakest is that too 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.599
 see as the final stage towards release 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.040
 that will be me in any case 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.390
 Interesting to write in the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.819
 comments that was it too now 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.129
 my final trailer check to the 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.879
 tribute of panem two catching fire 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.680
 to let 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.120
 Watch out, let it stay if not 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.769
 already like to mean mine now 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.879
 cinema reviews over or on twitter and 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.439
 facebook was still a bit over 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.970
 but do not want to write this film 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.890
 or my second channel if you do not have one 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.599
 wanted to miss videos of and with me 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.950
 let it be, but that will be it 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.420
 just decide you i wish you on 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.650
 every case a great sunday evening 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.720
 and a nice start to the new one 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.760
 week tomorrow at 15 o'clock is here 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.379
 Of course, at the latest a new video and 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.170
 until then, I hope for tomorrow again 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.170
 with of course at 3
