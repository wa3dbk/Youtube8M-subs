00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.790 
these to about a quarter inch from the
top<00:04:58.440> now<00:04:58.680> if<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:58.949> make<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> little<00:04:59.729> bit<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.090> us<00:05:00.240> a

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
top now if you make a little bit of us a

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.290 
top now if you make a little bit of us a
little<00:05:01.800> bit<00:05:01.979> of<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.130> mess<00:05:02.370> don't<00:05:03.150> worry<00:05:03.949> because

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
little bit of a mess don't worry because

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.450 
little bit of a mess don't worry because
we<00:05:06.300> can<00:05:06.479> always<00:05:06.960> clean<00:05:07.320> that<00:05:07.530> up<00:05:07.560> later<00:05:07.710> and

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
we can always clean that up later and

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.070 
we can always clean that up later and
there<00:05:08.699> you<00:05:08.820> go<00:05:09.050> so<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:11.090> don't<00:05:12.090> you<00:05:12.840> could<00:05:12.990> go

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
there you go so I don't you could go

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.629 
there you go so I don't you could go
right<00:05:13.259> up<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.590> top<00:05:13.740> if<00:05:13.919> you<00:05:14.070> want<00:05:14.250> but<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.430> go

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
right up to the top if you want but I go

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:15.980 
right up to the top if you want but I go
up<00:05:14.759> to<00:05:14.940> 1/4<00:05:15.150> inch<00:05:15.360> because<00:05:15.539> I<00:05:15.690> know<00:05:15.750> what's

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
up to 1/4 inch because I know what's

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.809 
up to 1/4 inch because I know what's
going<00:05:16.169> to<00:05:16.229> expand<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.860> wall<00:05:17.009> and<00:05:19.250> this<00:05:20.250> is<00:05:21.800> so

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
going to expand the wall and this is so

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:30.499 
going to expand the wall and this is so
again<00:05:23.819> once<00:05:24.449> again<00:05:24.840> I<00:05:25.669> shall<00:05:26.669> be<00:05:27.479> back<00:05:29.509> ok

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
again once again I shall be back ok

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.719 
again once again I shall be back ok
we're<00:05:30.930> back<00:05:31.139> here<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:34.159> it<00:05:35.159> was<00:05:35.310> an<00:05:35.430> exact

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
we're back here and it was an exact

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.110 
we're back here and it was an exact
measurement<00:05:37.070> so<00:05:38.070> I<00:05:38.099> guess<00:05:38.340> over<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.759> years

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
measurement so I guess over the years

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.260 
measurement so I guess over the years
I've<00:05:39.599> been<00:05:39.780> getting<00:05:39.960> a<00:05:40.199> little<00:05:40.349> bit<00:05:40.500> of<00:05:40.710> a

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
I've been getting a little bit of a

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.990 
I've been getting a little bit of a
measurement<00:05:42.270> here<00:05:42.630> now<00:05:43.500> if<00:05:44.219> it's<00:05:44.669> a<00:05:44.759> little

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
measurement here now if it's a little

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.670 
measurement here now if it's a little
bit<00:05:45.120> dirtier<00:05:45.599> on<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.840> sides<00:05:46.080> and<00:05:46.289> you<00:05:46.380> missed

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
bit dirtier on the sides and you missed

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.290 
bit dirtier on the sides and you missed
the<00:05:46.830> spot<00:05:47.190> like<00:05:47.490> that<00:05:47.520> or<00:05:47.940> you<00:05:48.030> missed<00:05:48.210> this

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
the spot like that or you missed this

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.670 
the spot like that or you missed this
more<00:05:48.509> like<00:05:48.630> don't<00:05:48.810> worry<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.349> heat<00:05:49.530> won't

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
more like don't worry the heat won't

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.990 
more like don't worry the heat won't
burn<00:05:49.889> that<00:05:50.070> off<00:05:50.130> so<00:05:50.490> I<00:05:50.520> wouldn't<00:05:50.820> worry<00:05:50.940> about

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
burn that off so I wouldn't worry about

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.560 
burn that off so I wouldn't worry about
that<00:05:51.180> too<00:05:51.389> much<00:05:51.419> so<00:05:52.190> now<00:05:53.190> it's<00:05:53.729> gonna<00:05:53.940> go<00:05:54.180> into

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
that too much so now it's gonna go into

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.249 
that too much so now it's gonna go into
a<00:05:54.630> hot<00:05:54.840> oven<00:05:55.050> at<00:05:55.620> 400<00:05:56.610> degrees<00:05:56.639> for<00:05:56.940> about<00:05:57.259> 25

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
a hot oven at 400 degrees for about 25

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.159 
a hot oven at 400 degrees for about 25
to<00:05:58.289> 35<00:05:59.219> minutes<00:05:59.610> but<00:06:00.120> I<00:06:00.150> want<00:06:00.479> you<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.690> keep<00:06:00.930> an

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
to 35 minutes but I want you to keep an

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.589 
to 35 minutes but I want you to keep an
eye<00:06:01.440> on<00:06:01.849> because<00:06:02.849> this<00:06:03.090> is<00:06:03.150> a<00:06:03.270> big<00:06:03.449> difference

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
eye on because this is a big difference

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.040 
eye on because this is a big difference
between<00:06:03.870> gas<00:06:04.349> and<00:06:04.380> electrical<00:06:05.340> heat<00:06:05.550> so<00:06:06.300> you

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
between gas and electrical heat so you

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.180 
between gas and electrical heat so you
need<00:06:07.349> to<00:06:08.280> keep<00:06:08.940> an<00:06:09.120> eye<00:06:09.240> on<00:06:09.270> it<00:06:09.599> ok<00:06:09.870> so<00:06:10.500> into<00:06:11.099> the

need to keep an eye on it ok so into the

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.680 
need to keep an eye on it ok so into the
oven<00:06:11.430> and<00:06:11.639> I<00:06:12.150> shall<00:06:12.719> be<00:06:13.050> back<00:06:14.090> okay<00:06:15.090> we're<00:06:15.509> back
