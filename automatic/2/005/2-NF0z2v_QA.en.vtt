00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:17.110
 imitating what is more luxurious is not 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.440
 of plastic usually has this left 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.190
 part of the charger where you put or place 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.620

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.000
 say 10 this watch 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.440
 I repeat that memory will not do anything 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.690
 that you know us just like that does not live 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.880
 permanently stuck and connected to a 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.369
 smart phone to be able to show 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.130
 notifications and do all the magic of 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.960
 a smart watch with android web 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.390
 is the funds that I copy to another 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.840
 manufacturer in power through buttons 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.840
 in particular and of which I remember as 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.940
 this one is in good funds for your 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.920
 features 5.5 inches is the time 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.510
 most remarkable the resolution is not 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.260
 nothing from ramp to any record 1920 x 720 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.319
 an anxiety of 267 points per inch 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.890
 as a reference the samsung 16 has a 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.080
 577 anxiety is not double in almost 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.810
 double the resolution of forgiveness of 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.209
 pixel density looks good it looks 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.480
 like another phone with android no 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.830

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.319
 above android to be able to modify 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.319
 all options 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.920
 swear that the nexus and then you're done 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.310
 manufacturer goes up and down some 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.760
 question talking about cameras this has 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.720
 a 5 megapixel front camera the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.000
 13 megapixel rear camera lte la 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.160
 battery is sealed the phone the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.490
 Battery 3000 Miriam Perez for you 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.990

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.140
 several colors and this is one of them 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.810
 they have an intel processor 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.530
 there you see the interim side 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:28.660
 and it 's like a one more phone in 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.660
 signature funds 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:43.849

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.220
 4 is almost exactly the same size 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.080
