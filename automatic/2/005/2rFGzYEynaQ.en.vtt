00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
have been asking what kind of ways I

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.399 
have been asking what kind of ways I
prefer<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> inject<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> that's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
prefer to inject with and that's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.840 
prefer to inject with and that's
actually<00:01:13.590> two<00:01:13.979> different<00:01:14.189> methods<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
actually two different methods that I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.940 
actually two different methods that I
would<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.360> discuss<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.500> specific

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
would like to discuss in this specific

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.499 
would like to discuss in this specific
video<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.460> first<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.939> actually<00:01:18.060> quite

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
video the first one is actually quite

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.120 
video the first one is actually quite
simple<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> tend<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> use<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
simple this is what I tend to use in the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.039 
simple this is what I tend to use in the
early<00:01:20.490> part<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.090> game<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:21.990> the

early part of the game because in the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.270 
early part of the game because in the
early<00:01:22.229> part<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> game<00:01:22.619> there's<00:01:22.979> always<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
early part of the game there's always a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.370 
early part of the game there's always a
lot<00:01:23.610> more<00:01:23.759> time<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.840> actually<00:01:25.140> I'm

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
lot more time you can actually I'm

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.020 
lot more time you can actually I'm
separately<00:01:25.950> control<00:01:26.340> each<00:01:26.490> Queen<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
separately control each Queen so what I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.210 
separately control each Queen so what I
like<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.810> actually<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.530> F<00:01:28.680> hotkeys

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
like to do is actually use the F hotkeys

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.920 
like to do is actually use the F hotkeys
which<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.579> set<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.090> my<00:01:30.240> camera<00:01:30.600> hotkeys

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
which are set up to be my camera hotkeys

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.010 
which are set up to be my camera hotkeys
to<00:01:31.110> control<00:01:32.009> individual<00:01:32.579> basis<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.360> f1

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to control individual basis so I will f1

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
to control individual basis so I will f1
which<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.530> main<00:01:34.770> base<00:01:35.009> select<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> main

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
which is my main base select the main

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.359 
which is my main base select the main
queen<00:01:36.420> inject<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:38.009> go<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
queen inject with it and then go on to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
queen inject with it and then go on to
the<00:01:38.610> next<00:01:38.850> base<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> little<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.170> of

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the next base so this is a little bit of

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.690 
the next base so this is a little bit of
a<00:01:40.350> slower<00:01:40.590> method<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.250> reason<00:01:41.520> why<00:01:41.670> I

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
a slower method but the reason why I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.859 
a slower method but the reason why I
like<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.150> because<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.750> actually

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
like it is because you can actually

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.380 
like it is because you can actually
control<00:01:43.770> each<00:01:44.159> Queen<00:01:44.490> individually

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
control each Queen individually

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
control each Queen individually
especially<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.380> early<00:01:46.560> part<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> game

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
especially in the early part of the game

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.950 
especially in the early part of the game
you<00:01:47.070> need<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> hit<00:01:47.790> every<00:01:48.180> single<00:01:48.210> Queen<00:01:48.659> index

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
you need to hit every single Queen index

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.600 
you need to hit every single Queen index
it<00:01:49.079> cannot<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> queen

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
it cannot really like have a queen

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.249 
it cannot really like have a queen
setting<00:01:50.939> around<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.390> ten<00:01:51.630> energy<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
setting around with like ten energy and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.690 
setting around with like ten energy and
not<00:01:52.409> injecting<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.070> ten<00:01:53.220> seconds<00:01:53.579> because

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
not injecting for ten seconds because

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.310 
not injecting for ten seconds because
you're<00:01:53.970> basically<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.930> case<00:01:55.170> just

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
you're basically in that case just

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.499 
you're basically in that case just
putting<00:01:55.619> yourself<00:01:55.979> behind<00:01:56.509> unnecessarily

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
putting yourself behind unnecessarily

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.850 
putting yourself behind unnecessarily
now<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> methods<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.829> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
now this is one of the methods that a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.499 
now this is one of the methods that a
lot<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.159> programmers<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.090> use<00:02:00.299> however

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
lot of programmers like to use however

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
lot of programmers like to use however
when<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> later<00:02:01.770> part<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> game

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
when you get to a later part of the game

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.100 
when you get to a later part of the game
these<00:02:02.969> kind<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.299> injects<00:02:03.659> methods<00:02:03.990> actually

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
these kind of injects methods actually

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.080 
these kind of injects methods actually
start<00:02:04.560> slacking<00:02:05.100> quite<00:02:05.399> heavily<00:02:05.640> because

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
start slacking quite heavily because

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.969 
start slacking quite heavily because
it's<00:02:06.210> kind<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.450> difficult<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.200> actually<00:02:07.770> keep

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
it's kind of difficult to actually keep

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.800 
it's kind of difficult to actually keep
in<00:02:08.190> mind<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.030> need<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.330> inject<00:02:09.629> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
in mind that you need to inject and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.969 
in mind that you need to inject and
what's<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.080> actually<00:02:10.319> pushing<00:02:10.679> out<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
what's your actually pushing out that

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.600 
what's your actually pushing out that
you're<00:02:11.129> fighting<00:02:11.430> versus<00:02:11.879> Europe

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
you're fighting versus Europe

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.580 
you're fighting versus Europe
this<00:02:12.879> is<00:02:13.000> actually<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.330> pretty<00:02:13.599> slow<00:02:14.019> method<00:02:14.290> as

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
this is actually a pretty slow method as

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.080 
this is actually a pretty slow method as
well<00:02:14.769> because<00:02:15.069> you're<00:02:15.489> basically<00:02:15.580> spending

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
well because you're basically spending

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.089 
well because you're basically spending
like<00:02:16.209> five<00:02:16.480> seconds<00:02:16.900> every<00:02:17.170> time<00:02:17.379> you're

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
like five seconds every time you're

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.130 
like five seconds every time you're
injecting<00:02:18.459> like<00:02:18.819> this<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.810> end<00:02:19.930> is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
injecting like this and it in the end is

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.869 
injecting like this and it in the end is
just<00:02:20.170> not<00:02:20.590> very<00:02:20.830> efficient<00:02:21.340> when<00:02:21.790> you

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
just not very efficient when you

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.430 
just not very efficient when you
actually<00:02:22.000> try<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.360> micro<00:02:22.900> banelings<00:02:23.319> are

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
actually try to micro banelings are

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.259 
actually try to micro banelings are
trying<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.800> inject<00:02:24.010> at<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.280> same<00:02:24.430> time<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:25.120> for

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
trying to inject at the same time so for

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.660 
trying to inject at the same time so for
that<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.660> try<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.590> use<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> different<00:02:27.400> kind<00:02:27.550> of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
that I try to use a different kind of

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.039 
that I try to use a different kind of
method<00:02:27.879> that<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.300> method<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.720> I've<00:02:28.930> been

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
method that is the method that I've been

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.110 
method that is the method that I've been
getting<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> most<00:02:29.739> questions<00:02:30.010> about<00:02:30.459> by<00:02:30.700> far

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
getting the most questions about by far

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.270 
getting the most questions about by far
it's<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.629> called<00:02:31.870> backspace<00:02:32.470> method<00:02:32.890> but

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
it's the so called backspace method but

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.160 
it's the so called backspace method but
I<00:02:33.310> actually<00:02:33.519> have<00:02:33.819> rebound<00:02:34.269> my<00:02:34.480> backspace<00:02:34.989> to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
I actually have rebound my backspace to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.930 
I actually have rebound my backspace to
the<00:02:35.260> spacebar<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:36.129> let's<00:02:36.280> jump<00:02:36.430> straight<00:02:36.580> into

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
the spacebar so let's jump straight into

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.490 
the spacebar so let's jump straight into
the<00:02:37.030> Starcraft<00:02:37.390> 2<00:02:37.599> setting<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.110> can<00:02:38.290> show

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
the Starcraft 2 setting so I can show

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.110 
the Starcraft 2 setting so I can show
you<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.799> little<00:02:38.980> bit<00:02:39.129> easier<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:39.610> here<00:02:39.970> we

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
you it a little bit easier so here we

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.309 
you it a little bit easier so here we
are<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.420> actual<00:02:40.660> game<00:02:40.810> now<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.049> first

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
are in the actual game now the first

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.240 
are in the actual game now the first
thing<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.590> will<00:02:41.680> need<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.860> do<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.069> actually

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
thing you will need to do is actually

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.370 
thing you will need to do is actually
set<00:02:42.580> up<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.790> couple<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.209> hotkeys<00:02:43.569> so<00:02:43.989> first<00:02:44.260> of

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
set up a couple of hotkeys so first of

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.600 
set up a couple of hotkeys so first of
all<00:02:44.440> I'm<00:02:44.500> going<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.680> go<00:02:44.769> into<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.069> options<00:02:45.220> and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
all I'm going to go into the options and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.670 
all I'm going to go into the options and
into<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.120> hotkeys<00:02:46.480> setup<00:02:46.750> right<00:02:46.900> here<00:02:46.959> now<00:02:47.650> I

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
into the hotkeys setup right here now I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.410 
into the hotkeys setup right here now I
tend<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.220> use<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.579> grid<00:02:48.849> hold<00:02:49.060> key<00:02:49.209> setup

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
tend to use the grid hold key setup

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.940 
tend to use the grid hold key setup
which<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:49.989> my<00:02:50.140> preference<00:02:50.410> but<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.769> got<00:02:50.920> a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
which is just my preference but I got a

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.740 
which is just my preference but I got a
couple<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.400> keys<00:02:51.549> that<00:02:51.579> I<00:02:51.790> adjusted<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.420> in

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
couple of keys that I adjusted and in

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.270 
couple of keys that I adjusted and in
order<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.079> actually<00:02:53.230> execute<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.040> way

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
order to actually execute it the way

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.460 
order to actually execute it the way
that<00:02:54.579> I<00:02:54.760> do<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.660> will<00:02:55.810> need<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.140> use<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
that I do it you will need to use the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.319 
that I do it you will need to use the
grid<00:02:56.680> hold<00:02:56.890> key<00:02:57.040> setup<00:02:57.250> or<00:02:57.459> use<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> separate

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
grid hold key setup or use a separate

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.960 
grid hold key setup or use a separate
hotkey<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.720> inject<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.349> most<00:03:00.250> informers<00:03:00.819> you

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
hotkey to inject and most informers you

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.640 
hotkey to inject and most informers you
gotta<00:03:01.150> have<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.420> adjust<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:01.930> one<00:03:02.290> hold<00:03:02.500> key

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
gotta have to adjust this one hold key

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.069 
gotta have to adjust this one hold key
right<00:03:02.860> here<00:03:02.890> go<00:03:03.519> based<00:03:03.849> camera<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.690> standard

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
right here go based camera the standard

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.960 
right here go based camera the standard
hook<00:03:05.260> key<00:03:05.410> for<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.920> backspace<00:03:06.549> however<00:03:06.910> I

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
hook key for this is backspace however I

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.030 
hook key for this is backspace however I
have<00:03:07.269> adjusted<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.019> spacebar<00:03:08.530> because

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
have adjusted it to the spacebar because

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.140 
have adjusted it to the spacebar because
if<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.220> take<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.400> look<00:03:09.519> at<00:03:09.640> your<00:03:09.760> keyboard<00:03:10.060> the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
if you take a look at your keyboard the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.729 
if you take a look at your keyboard the
backspace<00:03:10.510> button<00:03:10.720> is<00:03:10.959> just<00:03:11.170> really<00:03:11.500> really

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
backspace button is just really really

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.039 
backspace button is just really really
far<00:03:11.950> away<00:03:12.099> really<00:03:12.730> inconvenient<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.599> I<00:03:13.780> tend

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
far away really inconvenient so I tend

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.140 
far away really inconvenient so I tend
to<00:03:14.170> use<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.530> spacebar<00:03:14.799> button<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:16.030> this

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
to use the spacebar button for this

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.660 
to use the spacebar button for this
every<00:03:16.510> single<00:03:16.690> time<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.530> just<00:03:18.100> go<00:03:18.190> into<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
every single time so just go into the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.789 
every single time so just go into the
global<00:03:19.090> camera<00:03:19.480> settings<00:03:19.900> go<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.590> base

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
global camera settings go to the base

global camera settings go to the base
camera<00:03:21.190> hotkeys<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:21.730> hit<00:03:22.209> down<00:03:22.389> spacebar

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
camera hotkeys and hit down spacebar

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.629

be deleting this one now before jumping

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.460 
be deleting this one now before jumping
into<00:03:28.209> an<00:03:28.389> actual<00:03:28.599> game<00:03:28.810> let's<00:03:28.989> actually<00:03:29.139> talk

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
into an actual game let's actually talk

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.559 
into an actual game let's actually talk
about<00:03:29.530> how<00:03:30.220> my<00:03:30.400> hand<00:03:30.639> is<00:03:30.790> moving<00:03:31.239> around<00:03:31.329> the

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
about how my hand is moving around the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.660 
about how my hand is moving around the
keyboard<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.170> usually<00:03:32.920> what<00:03:33.040> happens<00:03:33.069> is<00:03:33.430> one

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
keyboard so usually what happens is one

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.759 
keyboard so usually what happens is one
two<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:33.910> three<00:03:34.150> are<00:03:34.299> actually<00:03:34.420> my<00:03:34.750> am<00:03:34.959> what<00:03:35.650> is

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
two and three are actually my am what is

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.410 
two and three are actually my am what is
usually<00:03:36.099> like<00:03:36.220> my<00:03:36.340> circling<00:03:36.730> rme<00:03:37.000> than<00:03:37.150> two<00:03:37.299> is

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
usually like my circling rme than two is

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.819 
usually like my circling rme than two is
like<00:03:37.540> my<00:03:37.690> middle<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.109> Garmin<00:03:38.410> three<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.709> like

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
like my middle is Garmin three is like

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.410 
like my middle is Garmin three is like
banelings<00:03:39.250> or<00:03:39.400> spell<00:03:39.609> castle<00:03:40.030> or<00:03:40.120> whatever

banelings or spell castle or whatever
four<00:03:41.109> is<00:03:41.200> gonna<00:03:41.380> be<00:03:41.500> on<00:03:41.650> my<00:03:41.769> head<00:03:41.919> tree<00:03:42.130> so

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
four is gonna be on my head tree so

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.099 
four is gonna be on my head tree so
that's<00:03:42.370> an<00:03:42.519> important<00:03:42.940> what<00:03:43.030> key<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.389> five<00:03:43.900> is

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
that's an important what key and five is

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.809 
that's an important what key and five is
going<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.530> be<00:03:44.650> all<00:03:44.829> my<00:03:44.980> queens<00:03:45.280> now<00:03:45.519> this<00:03:45.700> is

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
going to be all my queens now this is

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.520 
going to be all my queens now this is
the<00:03:45.940> most<00:03:46.150> important<00:03:46.690> one<00:03:46.810> in<00:03:46.989> order<00:03:47.410> to

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
the most important one in order to

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.409 
the most important one in order to
execute<00:03:47.829> this<00:03:48.130> Queen<00:03:48.519> inject<00:03:48.849> method<00:03:49.209> you

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
execute this Queen inject method you

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.879 
execute this Queen inject method you
will<00:03:49.630> need<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.959> have<00:03:50.079> all<00:03:50.290> your<00:03:50.410> Queen's<00:03:50.680> halt

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
will need to have all your Queen's halt

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.129 
will need to have all your Queen's halt
keyed<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.519> at<00:03:51.609> least<00:03:51.760> one<00:03:52.150> hotkey<00:03:52.569> I<00:03:52.750> tend<00:03:53.109> to

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
keyed to at least one hotkey I tend to

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.870 
keyed to at least one hotkey I tend to
be<00:03:53.260> using<00:03:53.560> hold<00:03:53.739> key<00:03:53.859> number<00:03:54.130> five<00:03:54.340> however<00:03:54.609> if

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
be using hold key number five however if

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.949 
be using hold key number five however if
you're<00:03:55.030> more<00:03:55.209> comfortable<00:03:55.389> with<00:03:55.690> something

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
you're more comfortable with something

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.409 
you're more comfortable with something
else<00:03:56.169> obviously<00:03:56.829> use<00:03:57.310> what<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:57.730> use<00:03:57.880> now<00:03:58.269> like

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
else obviously use what you use now like

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.300 
else obviously use what you use now like
I<00:03:58.450> said<00:03:58.569> X<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:59.200> going<00:03:59.349> to<00:03:59.470> be<00:03:59.560> my<00:03:59.769> hotkey<00:03:59.980> for

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
I said X is going to be my hotkey for

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.580 
I said X is going to be my hotkey for
Queen<00:04:00.549> injects<00:04:00.910> as<00:04:01.030> spacebar<00:04:01.930> is<00:04:02.109> going<00:04:02.380> to<00:04:02.470> be

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
Queen injects as spacebar is going to be

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.039 
Queen injects as spacebar is going to be
my<00:04:02.769> hotkey<00:04:03.040> for<00:04:03.250> I'm<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.760> base<00:04:04.329> camera<00:04:04.870> hold

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
my hotkey for I'm the base camera hold

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.839 
my hotkey for I'm the base camera hold
key<00:04:05.200> so<00:04:05.620> basically<00:04:05.950> what<00:04:06.160> spacebar<00:04:06.609> will<00:04:06.700> do

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
key so basically what spacebar will do

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.339 
key so basically what spacebar will do
whenever<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:07.269> tap<00:04:07.569> that<00:04:07.599> it<00:04:07.930> will<00:04:08.079> switch

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
do then I select all my Queens which is

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.160 
do then I select all my Queens which is
the<00:04:34.870> five<00:04:35.080> hotkey<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.650> hold<00:04:36.280> down<00:04:36.430> shift<00:04:36.640> and

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
the five hotkey I hold down shift and

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.480 
the five hotkey I hold down shift and
shift<00:04:38.170> actually<00:04:38.560> allows<00:04:38.800> me<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.100> queue<00:04:39.310> up<00:04:39.340> the

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
shift actually allows me to queue up the

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.210 
shift actually allows me to queue up the
larva<00:04:40.120> inject<00:04:40.540> button<00:04:40.900> so<00:04:41.350> what<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.650> do<00:04:41.740> is<00:04:42.040> hit

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
larva inject button so what I do is hit

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.180 
larva inject button so what I do is hit
5<00:04:42.490> hold<00:04:43.150> down<00:04:43.300> shift<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.690> hit<00:04:43.900> X<00:04:44.170> X<00:04:44.890> is

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
5 hold down shift and hit X X is

button any spacebar button for whatever

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.670 
button any spacebar button for whatever
reason<00:05:13.240> that's<00:05:13.570> how<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:13.780> taught<00:05:14.140> my<00:05:14.320> brain<00:05:14.530> to

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
reason that's how I taught my brain to

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.170 
reason that's how I taught my brain to
do<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:14.920> it's<00:05:15.040> not<00:05:15.130> necessary<00:05:15.640> but<00:05:15.790> here's<00:05:16.030> what

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
do it it's not necessary but here's what

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.370 
do it it's not necessary but here's what
it<00:05:16.270> usually<00:05:16.450> would<00:05:16.780> look<00:05:16.930> like<00:05:17.080> if<00:05:17.260> I'm

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
it usually would look like if I'm

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.780 
it usually would look like if I'm
actually<00:05:17.530> trying<00:05:17.920> inside<00:05:18.280> for<00:05:18.490> some<00:05:18.610> real

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
actually trying inside for some real

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.150 
actually trying inside for some real
opponent<00:05:19.150> I<00:05:19.270> hit<00:05:19.600> five<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:20.200> then<00:05:20.740> just

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
opponent I hit five and then just

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.650 
opponent I hit five and then just
basically<00:05:21.400> do<00:05:21.820> it<00:05:21.910> like<00:05:22.060> that<00:05:22.180> and<00:05:22.390> it's

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
basically do it like that and it's

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.510 
basically do it like that and it's
actually<00:05:22.930> pretty<00:05:23.140> easy<00:05:23.230> to<00:05:23.620> execute<00:05:23.830> ok<00:05:24.460> so

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
actually pretty easy to execute ok so

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.280 
actually pretty easy to execute ok so
here<00:05:24.790> we<00:05:24.940> are<00:05:24.970> in<00:05:25.210> actual<00:05:25.540> game<00:05:25.570> now<00:05:25.870> first<00:05:26.140> of

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
here we are in actual game now first of

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.810 
here we are in actual game now first of
all<00:05:26.380> what<00:05:26.620> does<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:26.830> base<00:05:27.130> camera<00:05:27.520> hold<00:05:27.670> key

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
all what does the base camera hold key

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.790 
all what does the base camera hold key
do<00:05:27.970> well<00:05:28.150> as<00:05:28.330> soon<00:05:28.510> as<00:05:28.660> I<00:05:28.690> hit<00:05:28.810> spacebar<00:05:29.140> it

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
do well as soon as I hit spacebar it

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.290 
do well as soon as I hit spacebar it
will<00:05:29.950> actually<00:05:30.040> cycle<00:05:30.730> between<00:05:30.850> all<00:05:31.180> the

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
will actually cycle between all the

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.760

so<00:06:04.210> let's<00:06:04.480> have<00:06:04.570> a<00:06:04.630> look<00:06:04.810> at<00:06:04.960> how<00:06:05.080> long<00:06:05.320> this

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
so let's have a look at how long this

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.900 
so let's have a look at how long this
would<00:06:05.620> actually<00:06:05.920> take<00:06:06.070> if<00:06:06.250> I<00:06:06.340> try<00:06:06.610> this<00:06:06.640> in

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
would actually take if I try this in

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.160 
would actually take if I try this in
real<00:06:07.090> time<00:06:07.150> I'm<00:06:07.450> going<00:06:07.630> to<00:06:07.690> start<00:06:07.900> with<00:06:07.990> this

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
real time I'm going to start with this

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.960 
real time I'm going to start with this
once<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.560> 12-minute<00:06:09.220> mark<00:06:09.340> it's<00:06:09.580> already

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
once the 12-minute mark it's already

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.730 
once the 12-minute mark it's already
selected<00:06:10.270> all<00:06:10.480> my<00:06:10.600> Queens<00:06:10.870> about<00:06:11.500> how<00:06:11.590> many

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
selected all my Queens about how many

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.170 
selected all my Queens about how many
seconds<00:06:12.130> does<00:06:12.190> it<00:06:12.340> take<00:06:12.460> to<00:06:12.610> inject<00:06:12.940> 5

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
seconds does it take to inject 5

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.730 
seconds does it take to inject 5
hatcheries<00:06:13.630> or<00:06:13.780> 6<00:06:13.990> hatcheries<00:06:14.350> rather<00:06:14.530> right

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
hatcheries or 6 hatcheries rather right

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.190 
hatcheries or 6 hatcheries rather right
there<00:06:14.920> it<00:06:15.820> takes<00:06:16.030> pretty<00:06:16.180> much<00:06:16.390> absolutely<00:06:17.050> no

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
there it takes pretty much absolutely no

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.630 
there it takes pretty much absolutely no
time<00:06:17.440> whatsoever<00:06:17.620> it<00:06:17.950> took<00:06:18.070> me<00:06:18.190> a<00:06:18.220> couple<00:06:18.460> of

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
time whatsoever it took me a couple of

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.980 
time whatsoever it took me a couple of
seconds<00:06:18.940> actually<00:06:19.240> been<00:06:19.360> a<00:06:19.390> slight<00:06:19.660> mess<00:06:19.840> up

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
seconds actually been a slight mess up

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.540 
seconds actually been a slight mess up
right<00:06:20.170> there<00:06:20.350> but<00:06:20.710> you<00:06:20.830> can<00:06:20.950> just<00:06:21.160> see<00:06:21.370> how

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
right there but you can just see how

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.610 
right there but you can just see how
easy<00:06:21.880> this<00:06:22.150> is<00:06:22.210> to<00:06:22.450> actually<00:06:22.600> eject<00:06:23.080> so<00:06:23.470> let's

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
easy this is to actually eject so let's

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.840 
easy this is to actually eject so let's
say<00:06:23.740> what<00:06:23.890> could<00:06:24.040> be<00:06:24.160> happening<00:06:24.250> is<00:06:24.610> that<00:06:24.700> I'm

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
say what could be happening is that I'm

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.790 
say what could be happening is that I'm
actually<00:06:24.970> microing<00:06:25.600> right<00:06:25.810> here<00:06:26.050> I<00:06:26.200> just<00:06:26.320> hit

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
actually microing right here I just hit

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.520 
actually microing right here I just hit
5<00:06:27.100> 5<00:06:27.340> start<00:06:28.060> injecting<00:06:28.360> I<00:06:28.600> go<00:06:28.750> back<00:06:28.960> with<00:06:28.990> 1<00:06:29.320> 1

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
5 5 start injecting I go back with 1 1

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.020 
5 5 start injecting I go back with 1 1
which<00:06:29.710> would<00:06:29.830> be<00:06:29.890> my<00:06:30.100> army<00:06:30.400> off<00:06:30.550> key<00:06:30.730> so<00:06:30.880> I<00:06:30.910> can

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
which would be my army off key so I can

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.300 
which would be my army off key so I can
literally<00:06:31.450> inject<00:06:32.170> as<00:06:32.290> many<00:06:32.500> bases<00:06:32.710> as<00:06:32.890> I<00:06:33.070> want

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
literally inject as many bases as I want

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.980 
literally inject as many bases as I want
as<00:06:33.490> long<00:06:33.670> as<00:06:33.730> I<00:06:33.970> have<00:06:34.090> Queens<00:06:34.480> around<00:06:34.840> to

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
as long as I have Queens around to

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.320 
as long as I have Queens around to
inject<00:06:35.350> with<00:06:35.500> them<00:06:35.710> and<00:06:36.490> basically<00:06:36.910> just

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
inject with them and basically just

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.360

Jack's keep in mind there's about a

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.350 
Jack's keep in mind there's about a
billion<00:06:44.500> different<00:06:44.770> ways<00:06:45.160> you<00:06:45.610> can<00:06:45.940> actually

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
billion different ways you can actually

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.550 
billion different ways you can actually
create<00:06:46.540> injected<00:06:47.020> starcraft2

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560
