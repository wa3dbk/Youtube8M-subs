injunction is essentially a restraining
order<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:12.370> in<00:01:12.640> essence<00:01:13.000> we've<00:01:13.150> restrained<00:01:13.510> the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
order so in essence we've restrained the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.450 
order so in essence we've restrained the
federal<00:01:13.960> government<00:01:14.350> from<00:01:14.530> repealing<00:01:15.220> our

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
federal government from repealing our

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.160 
federal government from repealing our
permits<00:01:15.820> which<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.150> our<00:01:16.300> name<00:01:16.480> against<00:01:16.810> repeal

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
permits which is our name against repeal

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.170 
permits which is our name against repeal
so<00:01:17.710> we've<00:01:17.890> temporarily<00:01:18.310> restrained<00:01:19.030> them

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
so we've temporarily restrained them

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.080 
so we've temporarily restrained them
from<00:01:19.660> repealing<00:01:20.020> our<00:01:20.200> permits<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:21.090> basically

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
from repealing our permits and basically

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.670 
from repealing our permits and basically
twenty<00:01:22.450> percent<00:01:22.720> of<00:01:22.870> federal<00:01:23.170> junctions<00:01:23.590> or

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
twenty percent of federal junctions or

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.220 
twenty percent of federal junctions or
ever<00:01:23.830> won<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:24.940> fact<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.330> we<00:01:25.780> won<00:01:26.020> this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
ever won so the fact that we won this

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.440 
ever won so the fact that we won this
was<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.500> david-versus-goliath<00:01:27.340> fight<00:01:27.760> but

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
was a david-versus-goliath fight but

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.190 
was a david-versus-goliath fight but
ultimately<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.650> proved<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.490> FX<00:01:31.090> came<00:01:31.840> first

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
ultimately it proved that FX came first

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.490 
ultimately it proved that FX came first
and<00:01:32.470> that<00:01:32.770> political<00:01:33.760> fear<00:01:34.360> ma<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:35.230> put

then if when we expect well now that

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.819 
then if when we expect well now that
we've<00:02:37.659> already<00:02:37.840> discredited<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.650> whole
