I've got the heated seats which is very

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.300 
I've got the heated seats which is very

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.140 
important if you're in cold climate
which<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.670> think<00:03:51.060> Ryan<00:03:51.989> can<00:03:52.320> confirm<00:03:52.970> it's<00:03:53.970> got

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
which I think Ryan can confirm it's got

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.120 
which I think Ryan can confirm it's got
the<00:03:54.360> Park<00:03:54.840> distance<00:03:55.200> control<00:03:55.260> front<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:55.950> red

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
the Park distance control front and red

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.310 
the Park distance control front and red
that<00:03:56.160> was<00:03:56.489> an<00:03:56.610> option<00:03:56.760> on<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.900> previous

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
that was an option on the previous

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.800 
that was an option on the previous
models<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.739> believe<00:03:59.100> on<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.700> rear<00:03:59.910> but<00:04:00.690> it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
models I believe on the rear but it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.979 
models I believe on the rear but it
comes<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:01.079> standard<00:04:01.410> on<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.829> 2003<00:04:02.549> model<00:04:02.989> I

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
comes a standard on the 2003 model I

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.930 
comes a standard on the 2003 model I
think<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> rest<00:04:05.190> of<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.370> options<00:04:05.519> are

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
think the rest of the options are

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.630 
think the rest of the options are
standard<00:04:06.660> cup<00:04:07.380> holders<00:04:07.769> which<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.190> know<00:04:08.400> many

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.159 
the TV I've got the Bluetooth telephone
which<00:04:29.550> means<00:04:29.880> I<00:04:30.030> can<00:04:30.240> use<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.750> on<00:04:30.870> my<00:04:31.020> iPhone

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
which means I can use it on my iPhone

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.930 
which means I can use it on my iPhone

obviously<00:04:39.120> GPS<00:04:39.960> navigation<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:41.760> I<00:04:42.150> think<00:04:42.419> one

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
obviously GPS navigation and I think one

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.830 
obviously GPS navigation and I think one
option<00:04:43.020> I'm<00:04:43.140> not<00:04:43.289> sure<00:04:43.470> if<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:44.600> owners<00:04:45.600> in<00:04:45.720> the

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
option I'm not sure if the owners in the

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.770 
option I'm not sure if the owners in the
US<00:04:46.080> can<00:04:46.320> verify<00:04:46.560> but<00:04:47.039> I've<00:04:47.669> got<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.030> factory

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
US can verify but I've got the factory

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.990 
US can verify but I've got the factory
alarm<00:04:49.169> which<00:04:49.770> gives<00:04:50.039> me<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.220> option<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:50.820> put<00:04:50.970> a

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
alarm which gives me a option to put a

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.670 
alarm which gives me a option to put a
code<00:04:51.210> in<00:04:51.360> as<00:04:51.479> well<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:51.810> then<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:52.350> vehicle

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
code in as well and then the vehicle

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.230 
code in as well and then the vehicle
won't<00:04:52.770> start<00:04:53.160> if<00:04:53.669> you<00:04:53.789> enter<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.060> wrong<00:04:54.180> code

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
won't start if you enter the wrong code

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.810 
won't start if you enter the wrong code
so<00:04:55.020> that's<00:04:55.169> quite<00:04:55.350> good<00:04:55.640> interior<00:04:56.640> options

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
so that's quite good interior options

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.630 
so that's quite good interior options

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
seems to be a very good condition for a

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.129

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
some where my steering wheel you can see

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.369 
some where my steering wheel you can see
slight<00:05:12.060> wear<00:05:12.300> on<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:12.599> steering<00:05:12.840> wheel<00:05:12.930> and

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:13.379 
slight wear on the steering wheel and

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.809 
slight wear on the steering wheel and
I'm<00:05:13.560> just<00:05:13.770> focus<00:05:14.580> in<00:05:14.699> there<00:05:14.879> for<00:05:15.060> you<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:16.819> have

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
I'm just focus in there for you I have

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.570 
I'm just focus in there for you I have
used<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.300> leather<00:05:18.509> cream<00:05:18.840> cleaner<00:05:19.289> and<00:05:19.979> all

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
used the leather cream cleaner and all

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.399 
used the leather cream cleaner and all
the<00:05:20.639> leather<00:05:20.819> the<00:05:21.449> driver's<00:05:21.900> side<00:05:22.080> door<00:05:22.349> I

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
the leather the driver's side door I

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.029 
the leather the driver's side door I
think<00:05:22.529> it's<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:23.009> only<00:05:24.469> part<00:05:25.469> of<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.710> vehicle

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
think it's the only part of the vehicle

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.489 
think it's the only part of the vehicle
that's<00:05:26.189> showing<00:05:26.610> anywhere<00:05:26.999> this<00:05:27.629> previous

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:28.499 
that's showing anywhere this previous

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:32.869 
that's showing anywhere this previous
owner<00:05:28.800> was<00:05:29.009> a<00:05:30.259> businessman<00:05:31.259> I<00:05:31.550> only<00:05:32.550> used<00:05:32.759> the

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:32.879 
owner was a businessman I only used the

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.239 
owner was a businessman I only used the
vehicle<00:05:33.029> for<00:05:33.389> motorway<00:05:33.930> miles<00:05:34.199> so<00:05:34.919> I<00:05:34.949> think

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:35.249 
vehicle for motorway miles so I think

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.159 
vehicle for motorway miles so I think
that's<00:05:35.580> why<00:05:35.849> it's<00:05:36.090> a<00:05:36.360> driver<00:05:36.599> side<00:05:36.870> they<00:05:37.020> show

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
that's why it's a driver side they show

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.640 
that's why it's a driver side they show
some<00:05:37.439> signs<00:05:37.680> of<00:05:37.860> where<00:05:38.039> got<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:39.650> aluminium

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
some signs of where got the aluminium

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.519 
some signs of where got the aluminium
trim<00:05:41.159> and<00:05:41.610> as<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:42.569> can<00:05:42.779> see<00:05:42.990> from<00:05:43.229> the<00:05:43.409> window

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529
