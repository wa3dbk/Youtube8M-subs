been removed from the oven and it's and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.260 
been removed from the oven and it's and
it's<00:00:31.980> cooled<00:00:32.250> down<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.489> little<00:00:32.759> bit<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.120> not

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
it's cooled down a little bit but not

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.959 
it's cooled down a little bit but not
completely<00:00:33.809> when<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.170> still<00:00:34.469> warm<00:00:34.940> but<00:00:35.940> not

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
completely when it's still warm but not

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.790 
completely when it's still warm but not
hot<00:00:36.180> burning<00:00:37.110> hot<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.469> touch

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
hot burning hot to the touch

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.910 
hot burning hot to the touch
wrap<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.910> some<00:00:39.120> plastic<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.320> top

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
wrap it in some plastic so that the top

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.760 
wrap it in some plastic so that the top
doesn't<00:00:41.399> develop<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.969> hard<00:00:42.270> crust<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.649> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
doesn't develop a hard crust so that it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.650 
doesn't develop a hard crust so that it
makes<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.160> easier<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.760> work<00:00:45.059> with<00:00:45.120> when<00:00:45.510> you're

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
makes it easier to work with when you're

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.049 
makes it easier to work with when you're
trying<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> spiral<00:00:46.739> roll<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.520> make

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
trying to do the spiral roll and make

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.479 
trying to do the spiral roll and make
the<00:00:48.559> actual<00:00:49.559> jelly<00:00:50.010> roll<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.219> this

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the actual jelly roll so now that this

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.640 
the actual jelly roll so now that this
is<00:00:56.670> completely<00:00:57.149> cool

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.740 

and<00:01:01.650> I<00:01:01.710> unwrapped<00:01:02.130> it<00:01:02.960> I'm<00:01:03.960> gonna<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.440> that

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
and I unwrapped it I'm gonna see that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.090 
and I unwrapped it I'm gonna see that
remove<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.930> quite<00:01:07.200> easily<00:01:07.500> from<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> pan

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
remove was quite easily from the pan

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.030 
remove was quite easily from the pan
because<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.880> has<00:01:09.120> that<00:01:09.300> parchment<00:01:09.540> paper<00:01:11.690> and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
because it has that parchment paper and

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.320 
because it has that parchment paper and
the<00:01:14.040> cake<00:01:14.220> itself<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.910> thin<00:01:15.119> it's

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the cake itself is really thin it's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.170 
the cake itself is really thin it's
about<00:01:15.869> half<00:01:16.440> an<00:01:16.590> inch<00:01:16.770> thick<00:01:16.860> after<00:01:17.550> it's<00:01:17.910> been

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
about half an inch thick after it's been

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.350 
about half an inch thick after it's been
baked<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:20.250> makes<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.759> little<00:01:20.910> easier

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
baked and that makes it a little easier

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.540 
baked and that makes it a little easier
to<00:01:21.420> roll<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> before<00:01:25.860> rolling<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.340> course

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
to roll up so before rolling of course

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.969 
to roll up so before rolling of course
we<00:01:26.670> need<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.850> add<00:01:27.060> our<00:01:27.660> cream<00:01:27.930> cheese<00:01:28.200> frosting

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.740 

and<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.700> doesn't<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.210> look<00:01:33.330> pretty<00:01:33.479> as

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
and it doesn't have to look pretty as

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.370 
and it doesn't have to look pretty as
you<00:01:33.899> apply<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.440> to<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> cake<00:01:36.200> because<00:01:37.200> it's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you apply it to the cake because it's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.900 
you apply it to the cake because it's
all<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.830> inside<00:01:38.399> you're<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
all going to be inside you're going to

00:01:38.910 --> 00:02:03.190 
all going to be inside you're going to
roll<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.390> up

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.080 

and<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.979> don't<00:02:04.159> need<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.340> get<00:02:04.549> too<00:02:04.729> close<00:02:04.850> to

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
and you don't need to get too close to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.789 
and you don't need to get too close to
the<00:02:05.180> edges<00:02:05.299> because<00:02:05.900> it'll<00:02:06.140> sort<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.470> squeeze

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
the edges because it'll sort of squeeze

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.770 
the edges because it'll sort of squeeze
out<00:02:07.040> over<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.460> edges<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.869> can<00:02:09.670> cut<00:02:10.780> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
out over the edges and you can cut the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.100 
out over the edges and you can cut the
two<00:02:12.020> ends<00:02:12.260> off<00:02:12.590> before<00:02:13.580> you're<00:02:13.700> finished<00:02:14.110> so

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
two ends off before you're finished so

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.809 
two ends off before you're finished so
that<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.349> can<00:02:15.500> see<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.069> whole<00:02:16.220> effect<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.730> the

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
that you can see the whole effect of the

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.740 
that you can see the whole effect of the
spiral<00:02:17.270> cake<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.850> icing<00:02:20.390> on<00:02:20.569> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
spiral cake and in the icing on the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.510 
spiral cake and in the icing on the
inside

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.700 

so<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.630> icing<00:02:29.530> application<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.220> going<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.430> be

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
so this icing application is going to be

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.530 
so this icing application is going to be
about<00:02:32.710> as<00:02:32.950> thick<00:02:33.520> as<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.970> cake<00:02:34.180> itself

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
about as thick as the cake itself

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.540 
about as thick as the cake itself
probably<00:02:34.960> about<00:02:35.080> half<00:02:35.380> an<00:02:35.530> inch

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.940 

and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.490 
and
since<00:02:43.610> I'm<00:02:43.790> going<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.180> start<00:02:44.540> rolling<00:02:45.760> cake<00:02:46.760> up

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
since I'm going to start rolling cake up

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.900 
since I'm going to start rolling cake up
on<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.740> side<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:50.600> icing<00:02:51.020> is<00:02:51.140> gonna<00:02:51.319> come<00:02:51.560> up

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
on this side the icing is gonna come up

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.540 
on this side the icing is gonna come up
pretty<00:02:52.910> much<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.390> edge<00:02:53.540> at<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.200> end

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
pretty much to the edge at the end

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.900 
pretty much to the edge at the end
leaving<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.819> little<00:02:56.180> less<00:02:56.360> icing<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:58.640> give<00:02:58.790> it

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
so we're keeping the parchment paper

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.720 
so we're keeping the parchment paper
intact<00:03:19.300> so<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:19.780> we<00:03:19.990> can<00:03:20.140> roll<00:03:20.290> this<00:03:20.500> up<00:03:22.320> and

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
intact so that we can roll this up and

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.850 
intact so that we can roll this up and
sort<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.880> gently<00:03:25.390> unrolling<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.380> parchment

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860

sort of gently unrolling the parchment
paper<00:03:27.070> as<00:03:27.690> we<00:03:28.690> roll<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:29.020> up<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.680> might<00:03:29.830> find

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
paper as we roll this up you might find

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.680 
paper as we roll this up you might find
that<00:03:30.220> there<00:03:30.460> are<00:03:30.490> a<00:03:30.580> few<00:03:30.760> cracks<00:03:31.090> in<00:03:31.270> there<00:03:31.420> but

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
that there are a few cracks in there but

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.690 
that there are a few cracks in there but
when<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.020> cut<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.410> cake<00:03:32.620> up<00:03:32.800> it<00:03:33.040> generally

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
when you cut the cake up it generally

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.300 
when you cut the cake up it generally
looks<00:03:33.850> okay<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:38.230> as<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.440> can<00:03:38.620> see<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.890> icing

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
looks okay and as you can see the icing

00:03:39.310 --> 00:04:00.309 
looks okay and as you can see the icing
is<00:03:39.490> squeezing<00:03:40.120> up<00:03:40.240> around<00:03:40.510> there

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.600 

and<00:04:01.319> right<00:04:01.590> now<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:01.860> looks<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:02.129> little<00:04:02.219> funny<00:04:02.489> to

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
and right now it looks a little funny to

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.559 
and right now it looks a little funny to
the<00:04:02.819> sides

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
the sides

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.020 
the sides
but<00:04:04.290> those<00:04:04.500> edges<00:04:04.920> are<00:04:05.040> going<00:04:05.129> to<00:04:05.189> be<00:04:05.250> cut<00:04:05.609> off

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.550 

ultimately<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.420> they're<00:04:09.930> gonna<00:04:10.290> actually

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
ultimately and they're gonna actually

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.999 
ultimately and they're gonna actually
slice<00:04:10.980> up<00:04:11.189> really<00:04:11.430> nicely<00:04:14.780> okay<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.769> it's<00:04:16.919> a

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
slice up really nicely okay so it's a

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.900 
slice up really nicely okay so it's a
final<00:04:17.400> part<00:04:17.699> of<00:04:17.910> rolling<00:04:18.449> up<00:04:18.690> your<00:04:19.910> pumpkin
