the only problem with this method for

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.970 
the only problem with this method for
later<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.559> see<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.860> takes

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
a long time so long that the person

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.670 
a long time so long that the person
recording<00:00:58.829> might<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.820> know<00:00:59.940> mess<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.230> don't

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
recording might you know mess up I don't

recording might you know mess up I don't
I<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.190> know<00:01:02.340> why<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.550> still<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:02.969> I'm

showing you I could do it but as you can
see<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> takes<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.540> long<00:01:07.020> time

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
see it takes a really long time

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.890 
see it takes a really long time
definitely<00:01:08.790> not<00:01:08.909> effective<00:01:09.330> especially<00:01:09.780> not

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
definitely not effective especially not

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
for 200 in a row it's very easy to get

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.410 
for 200 in a row it's very easy to get
distracted<00:01:12.680> again<00:01:13.700> I'm<00:01:14.700> not<00:01:14.970> very<00:01:15.180> good<00:01:15.330> at

part<00:02:16.530> about<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.799> is<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.280> takes<00:02:17.430> a

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
part about this is that it takes a

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.610 
part about this is that it takes a
certain<00:02:18.150> level<00:02:18.299> of<00:02:18.629> concentration<00:02:19.379> but<00:02:19.409> at

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
certain level of concentration but at

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.280 
certain level of concentration but at
the<00:02:19.709> same<00:02:19.890> time<00:02:20.189> not<00:02:21.180> too<00:02:21.420> much<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:22.019> like<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the same time not too much so like the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.440 
the same time not too much so like the
second<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.709> get<00:02:22.920> too<00:02:23.099> used<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.609> it<00:02:23.700> that's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
second you get too used to it that's

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.940 
second you get too used to it that's
when<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:24.719> mess<00:02:24.900> up<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:26.329> every<00:02:27.329> 25<00:02:27.769> strikes<00:02:28.769> or

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
