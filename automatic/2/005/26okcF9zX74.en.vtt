00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
really changes the whole a game and I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.849 
really changes the whole a game and I

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
pretty just clarify right now the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.709 
pretty just clarify right now the
console<00:00:40.710> version<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.399> title<00:00:41.820> update<00:00:42.149> 26

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
console version is on title update 26

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.930 
console version is on title update 26
it's<00:00:43.020> currently<00:00:43.350> only<00:00:43.440> available<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> 360

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it's currently only available on the 360

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.610 
it's currently only available on the 360
because<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> massive<00:00:46.170> bug<00:00:46.410> where

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
because there was a massive bug where

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.229 
because there was a massive bug where
they<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.890> use<00:00:46.980> emergency<00:00:47.309> certification

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
they have to use emergency certification

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.850 
they have to use emergency certification
I<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:48.750> clarified<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.289> one<00:00:49.500> at<00:00:49.590> Minecon

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
I actually clarified that one at Minecon

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
I actually clarified that one at Minecon
there<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> process<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.480> there's

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
there there is like a process if there's

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.360 
there there is like a process if there's
a<00:00:51.719> game<00:00:51.960> breaking<00:00:52.379> bugs<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.100> actually

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
a game breaking bugs they can actually

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.279 
a game breaking bugs they can actually
do<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.670> earlier<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.390> yet<00:00:54.510> I'll<00:00:54.690> update<00:00:54.899> 26

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
do that earlier but yet I'll update 26

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.959 
do that earlier but yet I'll update 26
it's<00:00:55.440> currently<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.129> 360<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:56.820> it's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
it's currently out on the 360 but it's

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.340 
it's currently out on the 360 but it's
coming<00:00:57.270> out<00:00:57.390> soon<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:57.930> other<00:00:58.170> platforms

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
coming out soon for all other platforms

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619 
coming out soon for all other platforms
so<00:00:58.859> when<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.370> arrives<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.940> does<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.359> fix<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
so when that arrives it does just fix a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.270 
so when that arrives it does just fix a
few<00:01:00.870> minor<00:01:01.050> bugs<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.949> current

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
few minor bugs and then the current

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.740 
few minor bugs and then the current
update<00:01:02.550> they're<00:01:02.730> working<00:01:03.120> right<00:01:03.270> now<00:01:03.449> is

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
update they're working right now is

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.929 
update they're working right now is
title<00:01:04.229> update<00:01:04.530> 27th<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.250> they've<00:01:05.369> got<00:01:05.489> fix<00:01:05.729> all

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939

the<00:01:06.119> bugs<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.479> are<00:01:06.689> currently<00:01:06.960> Intel<00:01:07.290> update

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the bugs that are currently Intel update

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
the bugs that are currently Intel update
26<00:01:08.040> there's<00:01:08.340> no<00:01:08.580> severe<00:01:09.060> ones<00:01:09.270> anymore<00:01:09.510> but

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
26 there's no severe ones anymore but

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.359 
26 there's no severe ones anymore but
there<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.049> small<00:01:10.350> ones<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:10.830> no<00:01:10.979> people

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
there are small ones that are no people

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.190 
there are small ones that are no people
the<00:01:11.820> nature<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.090> coding<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the nature of coding is you do have to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.810 
the nature of coding is you do have to
fix<00:01:13.439> these<00:01:13.619> bugs<00:01:13.860> when<00:01:14.070> they<00:01:14.159> arise<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.580> no

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
fix these bugs when they arise like no

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
fix these bugs when they arise like no
one<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.090> code<00:01:15.270> perfectly<00:01:15.869> I'm<00:01:16.290> pretty<00:01:16.500> sure

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
one can code perfectly I'm pretty sure

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.810 
one can code perfectly I'm pretty sure
that's<00:01:16.740> fact<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.189> even<00:01:17.220> when<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.640> some

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that's fact and even when you do some

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820 
that's fact and even when you do some
basic<00:01:18.060> QA<00:01:18.450> having<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.409> ten<00:01:19.650> million

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
basic QA having you know ten million

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.380 
basic QA having you know ten million
players<00:01:20.130> test<00:01:20.430> your<00:01:20.580> game<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:20.939> twenty<00:01:21.270> million

and like one quarter of 1.8 at the same
time<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:04.080> didn't<00:03:04.380> really<00:03:04.560> bring<00:03:04.770> us

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
time and it didn't really bring us

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.260 
time and it didn't really bring us
forward<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.220> version<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.640> just<00:03:05.670> kind<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.030> gave

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
forward a version it just kind of gave

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.760 
forward a version it just kind of gave
us<00:03:06.420> more<00:03:06.570> features<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.650> at

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
us more features and that is that at

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.960 
us more features and that is that at
first<00:03:07.800> we've<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:08.550> seen<00:03:08.760> from<00:03:08.910> that

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
first we've really seen from that

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.699 
first we've really seen from that
besides<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.989> know<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.140> kind<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.470> mini

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
besides you know the kind of mini

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.680 
besides you know the kind of mini
updates<00:03:11.010> we've<00:03:11.160> had<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.150> really<00:03:12.360> kind<00:03:12.660> of

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
updates we've had and it really kind of

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.240 
updates we've had and it really kind of
is<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> confusing<00:03:13.470> thing<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.950> think<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
is a confusing thing and I think the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.949 
is a confusing thing and I think the
reason<00:03:14.610> for<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.060> something<00:03:15.330> we'll<00:03:15.720> see

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
reason for that is something we'll see

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.479 
reason for that is something we'll see
at<00:03:16.080> some<00:03:16.320> point<00:03:16.500> later<00:03:16.620> because<00:03:17.310> they<00:03:17.430> were

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
at some point later because they were

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.759 
at some point later because they were
working<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.209> update<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.720> some<00:03:19.200> level<00:03:19.560> for

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
working on the update in some level for

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.530 
working on the update in some level for
the<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.160> know<00:03:20.280> past<00:03:20.489> six<00:03:20.760> months<00:03:21.030> they<00:03:21.330> did

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
the you know past six months they did

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.880 
the you know past six months they did
confirm<00:03:21.900> their<00:03:22.110> work<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.530> it's<00:03:22.650> since

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
confirm their work and it's since

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.340 
confirm their work and it's since
January<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:23.970> if<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.570> do<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.900> math<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.290> is

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
January so if you do the math that is

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.500 
January so if you do the math that is
actually<00:03:25.890> six<00:03:26.250> months<00:03:26.610> of<00:03:26.730> work<00:03:26.940> of<00:03:27.120> time<00:03:27.299> and

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
actually six months of work of time and

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.360 
actually six months of work of time and
I<00:03:27.750> think<00:03:28.019> some<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.350> those<00:03:28.560> things<00:03:28.860> are<00:03:29.190> going

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
I think some of those things are going

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.560 
I think some of those things are going
to<00:03:29.430> be<00:03:29.489> in<00:03:29.580> this<00:03:29.700> current<00:03:30.030> update<00:03:30.299> but<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
to be in this current update but in a

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.180 
to be in this current update but in a
hidden<00:03:30.780> form<00:03:31.080> that's<00:03:31.350> not<00:03:31.709> gonna<00:03:31.860> come<00:03:32.100> an

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
hidden form that's not gonna come an

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.009 
hidden form that's not gonna come an
update<00:03:32.489> form<00:03:32.700> if<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:32.940> makes<00:03:33.150> any<00:03:33.360> sense<00:03:33.510> if

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
update form if that makes any sense if

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.720 
update form if that makes any sense if
it<00:03:34.200> doesn't<00:03:34.560> don't<00:03:34.799> worry<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.280> let's<00:03:35.489> talk

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
it doesn't don't worry and let's talk

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.400 
it doesn't don't worry and let's talk

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
opinion at some point in the next six

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.600 
opinion at some point in the next six
months<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.079> seems<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:44.190> we're<00:03:44.340> getting<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.579> a

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
months it seems that we're getting on a

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.910 
months it seems that we're getting on a
more<00:03:44.820> regular<00:03:45.060> cycle<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.840> like<00:03:46.079> you<00:03:46.380> know<00:03:46.500> five

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
more regular cycle of like you know five

more regular cycle of like you know five
six<00:03:47.400> months<00:03:47.640> for<00:03:47.880> an<00:03:47.970> update<00:03:48.239> given<00:03:48.690> that

six months for an update given that
there<00:03:48.900> was<00:03:49.049> almost<00:03:49.290> exactly<00:03:49.980> six<00:03:50.250> months

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
there was almost exactly six months

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.890 
there was almost exactly six months
between<00:03:50.640> 219<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:52.700> 225<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.600> with<00:03:54.780> that

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.060 
between 219 and 225 that is with that
there<00:03:55.019> was<00:03:55.110> like<00:03:55.230> five<00:03:55.470> updates<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.920> tweet

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
between tu 19 and T 25 was six months

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.030 
between tu 19 and T 25 was six months
but<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:00.570> was<00:04:00.959> with<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.260> mini<00:04:01.590> update<00:04:01.920> in

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
but that was with a mini update in

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.470 
but that was with a mini update in
between<00:04:02.370> just<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.640> give<00:04:02.760> us<00:04:02.820> new<00:04:03.030> achievements

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
between just to give us new achievements

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.390 
between just to give us new achievements
and<00:04:03.630> Alex<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.170> if<00:04:04.470> we<00:04:04.590> assume<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.890> means<00:04:05.190> you

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
and Alex so if we assume that means you

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.130 
and Alex so if we assume that means you
know<00:04:05.489> let's<00:04:05.700> say<00:04:05.850> four<00:04:06.209> months<00:04:06.510> average<00:04:06.870> cuz

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
know let's say four months average cuz

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.390 
know let's say four months average cuz
when<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.350> account<00:04:07.620> for<00:04:07.739> whatever<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.280> know

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
when you account for whatever you know

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.250 
when you account for whatever you know
is<00:04:08.489> inside<00:04:08.670> there<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.239> means<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.079> would

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
is inside there that means that I would

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.990 
is inside there that means that I would
imagine<00:04:10.530> we'll<00:04:10.890> be<00:04:10.980> seeing<00:04:11.280> before<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.820> end

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
imagine we'll be seeing before the end

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.729 
imagine we'll be seeing before the end
of<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.239> year<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:12.690> new<00:04:12.989> update<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.590> what

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
of the year this new update and what

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.470 
of the year this new update and what
will<00:04:13.860> be<00:04:13.980> inside<00:04:14.130> there<00:04:14.579> is<00:04:14.730> really<00:04:15.239> hard<00:04:15.420> to

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
will be inside there is really hard to

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.270 
will be inside there is really hard to
predict<00:04:15.810> but<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.440> know<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:16.829> using<00:04:17.160> my

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
predict but you know just using my

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.890 
predict but you know just using my
little<00:04:17.430> Intel<00:04:17.820> based<00:04:18.000> on<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.419> little<00:04:18.630> you

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
little Intel based on the little you

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.020 
little Intel based on the little you
know<00:04:19.019> clues<00:04:19.290> I<00:04:19.440> picked<00:04:19.680> up<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:20.040> will<00:04:20.579> say<00:04:20.820> that

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
know clues I picked up I will say that

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.219 
know clues I picked up I will say that
there<00:04:21.150> are<00:04:21.269> three<00:04:21.539> kind<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:21.870> obvious

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
there are three kind of obvious

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.570 
there are three kind of obvious
solutions<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.860> can't<00:04:23.070> really<00:04:23.160> think<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.430> any

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
solutions I can't really think of any

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.880 
solutions I can't really think of any
one<00:04:23.729> besides<00:04:24.060> these<00:04:24.270> one<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.260> to<00:04:25.440> go<00:04:25.590> all<00:04:25.860> the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
one besides these one is to go all the

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.490 
one besides these one is to go all the
way<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.190> one

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
way to one

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.680 
way to one
when<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.710> what<00:04:26.950> we<00:04:27.040> expected<00:04:27.550> from<00:04:27.610> t25<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.510> just

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
when a what we expected from t25 to just

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.510 
when a what we expected from t25 to just
do<00:04:28.900> it<00:04:28.930> all<00:04:29.200> in<00:04:29.380> one<00:04:29.410> update<00:04:29.860> this<00:04:30.040> might<00:04:30.370> make

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
do it all in one update this might make

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.220 
do it all in one update this might make
them<00:04:30.730> take<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:30.940> bit<00:04:31.120> longer<00:04:31.330> but<00:04:31.720> it<00:04:31.840> would<00:04:32.050> be

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
them take a bit longer but it would be

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.660 
them take a bit longer but it would be
the<00:04:32.260> update<00:04:32.620> everybody<00:04:33.040> loves<00:04:33.460> with

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
the update everybody loves with

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.700 
the update everybody loves with
guardians<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:34.420> slime<00:04:34.780> blocks<00:04:35.080> of<00:04:35.260> rabbits

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
guardians of slime blocks of rabbits

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.740 
guardians of slime blocks of rabbits
with<00:04:35.950> all<00:04:36.190> those<00:04:36.400> things<00:04:36.700> but<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.420> course<00:04:37.600> that

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
with all those things but of course that

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.690 
with all those things but of course that
would<00:04:37.870> be<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:38.020> big<00:04:38.380> big<00:04:38.560> ask<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.070> second<00:04:39.550> thing

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
would be a big big ask the second thing

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.760 
would be a big big ask the second thing
is<00:04:39.880> they<00:04:40.150> might<00:04:40.330> just<00:04:40.480> go<00:04:40.630> up<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.810> 1.7<00:04:41.350> now

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
is they might just go up to 1.7 now

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.530 
is they might just go up to 1.7 now
they've<00:04:41.950> done<00:04:42.220> quite<00:04:42.460> a<00:04:42.490> few<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.670> the<00:04:42.760> 1.7

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
they've done quite a few of the 1.7

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.180 
they've done quite a few of the 1.7
features<00:04:43.960> all<00:04:44.260> they<00:04:44.410> have<00:04:44.560> left<00:04:44.590> really<00:04:45.040> is

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
features all they have left really is

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.680 
features all they have left really is
like<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.430> new<00:04:45.760> fishing<00:04:46.030> a<00:04:46.330> few<00:04:46.570> new

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
like the new fishing a few new

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.810 
like the new fishing a few new
enchantments<00:04:47.290> and<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:48.340> new<00:04:48.460> biomes

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
enchantments and the new biomes

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.950 
enchantments and the new biomes
obviously<00:04:49.120> there's<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:49.300> few<00:04:49.450> bigger<00:04:49.630> features

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
obviously there's a few bigger features

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.450 
obviously there's a few bigger features
but<00:04:50.140> the<00:04:50.230> new<00:04:50.380> biomes<00:04:50.980> and<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.160> blocks<00:04:51.370> that

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
but the new biomes and the blocks that

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.430 
but the new biomes and the blocks that
come<00:04:51.640> with<00:04:51.760> them<00:04:51.880> is<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.360> biggest<00:04:52.750> one<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.170> I

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
come with them is the biggest one and I

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.380 
come with them is the biggest one and I
decided<00:04:54.040> because<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.700> was<00:04:54.820> trying<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.090> sneak

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390

decided because I was trying to sneak
Lee<00:04:55.600> asked<00:04:55.780> about<00:04:56.110> t25<00:04:56.830> features<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:57.370> I

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
Lee asked about t25 features and I

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.920 
Lee asked about t25 features and I
really<00:04:57.640> got<00:04:57.730> nowhere<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.420> decided<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.780> you

really got nowhere so I decided to you

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.270 
really got nowhere so I decided to you

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
know just ask some questions about how

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.130 
know just ask some questions about how
biomes<00:05:00.610> would<00:05:00.760> work<00:05:00.910> because<00:05:01.240> honestly<00:05:01.930> on<00:05:02.110> a

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
biomes would work because honestly on a

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.290 
biomes would work because honestly on a
360<00:05:02.380> or<00:05:02.800> ps3<00:05:02.950> size<00:05:03.370> what<00:05:03.610> you've<00:05:03.790> got<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.090> think

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
360 or ps3 size what you've got to think

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.060 
360 or ps3 size what you've got to think
like<00:05:04.390> there's<00:05:04.810> no<00:05:05.169> way<00:05:05.350> you<00:05:05.410> can<00:05:05.680> have<00:05:05.710> all

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
like there's no way you can have all

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.830 
like there's no way you can have all
twenty-something<00:05:07.060> biomes<00:05:07.390> how<00:05:07.690> are<00:05:07.780> you

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
twenty-something biomes how are you

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.750 
twenty-something biomes how are you
gonna<00:05:07.930> make<00:05:08.080> that<00:05:08.110> work<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.560> you<00:05:08.860> know<00:05:09.070> as<00:05:09.640> I

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
gonna make that work and you know as I

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.250 
gonna make that work and you know as I
spoke<00:05:10.000> full<00:05:10.210> of<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.390> staff<00:05:10.600> members<00:05:10.660> they<00:05:11.230> all

had<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.620> pretty<00:05:12.010> good<00:05:12.250> idea<00:05:12.610> of<00:05:12.640> how<00:05:12.850> they<00:05:13.000> would

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
had a pretty good idea of how they would

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.790 
had a pretty good idea of how they would
get<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.390> bombs<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.780> work<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.169> maybe<00:05:14.350> they

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
get the bombs to work and maybe they

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.380 
get the bombs to work and maybe they
have<00:05:14.950> conversations<00:05:15.520> like<00:05:15.580> this<00:05:15.850> about<00:05:16.090> every

have conversations like this about every
PC<00:05:16.720> feature<00:05:16.960> but<00:05:17.530> they<00:05:17.620> had<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:17.830> lot<00:05:18.220> of<00:05:18.310> death

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
PC feature but they had a lot of death

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.550 
PC feature but they had a lot of death
into<00:05:19.060> exactly<00:05:19.630> how<00:05:19.750> they<00:05:20.020> would<00:05:20.110> make<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.440> new

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
into exactly how they would make the new

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.260 
into exactly how they would make the new
biomes<00:05:20.860> work<00:05:21.040> on<00:05:21.250> last<00:05:21.520> gen<00:05:21.640> and<00:05:21.940> current<00:05:22.090> gen

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
biomes work on last gen and current gen

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.150 
biomes work on last gen and current gen
and<00:05:22.570> this<00:05:22.930> does<00:05:23.200> make<00:05:23.410> me<00:05:23.590> think<00:05:23.800> that<00:05:24.010> they<00:05:24.100> do

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
and this does make me think that they do

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.490 
and this does make me think that they do
have<00:05:24.460> plans<00:05:24.790> for<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.180> pipes<00:05:25.390> maybe<00:05:26.020> it's<00:05:26.320> not

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
have plans for the pipes maybe it's not

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.659 
have plans for the pipes maybe it's not
the<00:05:26.620> current<00:05:26.860> object<00:05:26.919> but<00:05:27.190> I<00:05:27.250> would<00:05:27.430> imagine

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
the current object but I would imagine

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.060 
the current object but I would imagine
most<00:05:27.880> likely<00:05:28.480> if<00:05:28.720> so<00:05:29.020> if<00:05:29.260> you<00:05:29.470> do<00:05:29.710> add<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:29.950> new

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
most likely if so if you do add the new

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.560 
most likely if so if you do add the new
biomes<00:05:30.460> then<00:05:30.669> you<00:05:30.760> can<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.180> know<00:05:31.270> do<00:05:31.450> the

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
biomes then you can you know do the

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.030 
biomes then you can you know do the
third<00:05:31.810> option<00:05:31.990> which<00:05:32.260> is<00:05:32.320> kind<00:05:32.650> of<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.800> mishmash

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
third option which is kind of a mishmash

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.240 
third option which is kind of a mishmash
of<00:05:33.400> 1.7<00:05:34.060> 1.8<00:05:34.479> again<00:05:34.810> but<00:05:35.470> I<00:05:35.500> imagine<00:05:36.010> it<00:05:36.190> will

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
of 1.7 1.8 again but I imagine it will

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.520 
of 1.7 1.8 again but I imagine it will
probably<00:05:36.490> be<00:05:36.729> the<00:05:36.940> rest<00:05:37.210> of<00:05:37.390> 1.7<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.110> then

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
probably be the rest of 1.7 and then

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.530 
probably be the rest of 1.7 and then
some<00:05:38.740> more<00:05:38.770> 1.8<00:05:39.460> features<00:05:39.820> because<00:05:40.000> 1.8<00:05:40.390> is<00:05:40.510> a

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
some more 1.8 features because 1.8 is a

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.940 
some more 1.8 features because 1.8 is a
massive<00:05:40.960> update<00:05:41.110> so<00:05:41.500> maybe<00:05:41.740> they're<00:05:41.919> just

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
massive update so maybe they're just

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.380 
massive update so maybe they're just
trying<00:05:42.220> to<00:05:42.250> split<00:05:42.550> it<00:05:42.640> up<00:05:42.729> as<00:05:42.910> much<00:05:43.120> as<00:05:43.270> they

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
trying to split it up as much as they

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.020 
trying to split it up as much as they
can<00:05:43.450> but<00:05:44.440> yeah<00:05:44.650> that's<00:05:44.800> my<00:05:45.100> theory<00:05:45.370> I<00:05:45.460> reckon

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
can but yeah that's my theory I reckon

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.930 
can but yeah that's my theory I reckon

features<00:05:49.180> were<00:05:49.270> missing<00:05:49.570> and<00:05:49.720> then<00:05:50.020> maybe

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
features were missing and then maybe

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.990 
features were missing and then maybe
some<00:05:50.470> 1.8<00:05:50.860> features<00:05:51.190> let's<00:05:51.370> make<00:05:51.580> up<00:05:51.760> some

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
some 1.8 features let's make up some

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.760 
some 1.8 features let's make up some
like<00:05:52.180> you<00:05:52.300> know<00:05:52.390> rabbits<00:05:52.690> let's<00:05:53.200> say<00:05:53.440> you<00:05:53.500> know

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
like you know rabbits let's say you know

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.550 
like you know rabbits let's say you know
like<00:05:53.950> red<00:05:54.570> sandstone<00:05:55.570> and<00:05:56.050> stuff<00:05:56.260> like<00:05:56.380> that

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
like red sandstone and stuff like that

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.290 
like red sandstone and stuff like that
you<00:05:56.830> know<00:05:56.919> that<00:05:57.070> reason<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.520> basic<00:05:57.940> features

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
you know that reason the basic features

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.719 
you know that reason the basic features
from<00:05:58.600> one<00:05:58.840> point<00:05:59.020> a<00:05:59.169> but<00:05:59.530> you<00:06:00.340> know<00:06:00.400> just<00:06:00.580> put

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
from one point a but you know just put

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:01.980 
from one point a but you know just put
them<00:06:00.820> in<00:06:00.880> there<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.090> make<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.510> happen<00:06:01.810> so

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
them in there and make the happen so

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.469 
them in there and make the happen so
what<00:06:02.200> I<00:06:02.229> predict<00:06:02.620> is<00:06:02.860> tu<00:06:03.220> 27<00:06:03.880> will<00:06:04.000> be<00:06:04.120> a<00:06:04.150> bug

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
what I predict is tu 27 will be a bug

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:05.640 
what I predict is tu 27 will be a bug
fix<00:06:04.690> and<00:06:04.930> it<00:06:05.020> will<00:06:05.110> come<00:06:05.229> out<00:06:05.260> at<00:06:05.410> some<00:06:05.620> point

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
fix and it will come out at some point

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.480 
fix and it will come out at some point
in<00:06:05.830> this<00:06:05.890> next<00:06:06.190> month

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
in this next month

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.060 
in this next month
tu<00:06:06.850> 28<00:06:07.330> will<00:06:07.630> be<00:06:07.780> a<00:06:07.810> big<00:06:08.200> feature<00:06:08.440> update<00:06:08.860> it

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
tu 28 will be a big feature update it

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.520 
tu 28 will be a big feature update it
will<00:06:09.190> probably<00:06:09.640> be<00:06:10.060> 1.7<00:06:10.990> but<00:06:11.290> you<00:06:11.440> know

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
will probably be 1.7 but you know

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.080 
will probably be 1.7 but you know
they're<00:06:11.710> blurring<00:06:12.010> the<00:06:12.220> lines<00:06:12.430> between<00:06:12.640> PC

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
they're blurring the lines between PC

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.640 
they're blurring the lines between PC
versions<00:06:13.419> and<00:06:13.540> console<00:06:13.840> versions<00:06:14.200> so<00:06:14.620> you

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
versions and console versions so you

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.260 
versions and console versions so you
know<00:06:14.979> it<00:06:15.100> might<00:06:15.310> miss<00:06:15.640> out<00:06:15.790> someone<00:06:16.060> put<00:06:16.150> some

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
know it might miss out someone put some

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.300 
know it might miss out someone put some
features<00:06:16.570> but<00:06:16.690> I<00:06:16.720> imagine<00:06:17.080> it's<00:06:17.200> most<00:06:17.500> of<00:06:17.680> 1.7

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
features but I imagine it's most of 1.7

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.420 
features but I imagine it's most of 1.7
with<00:06:18.760> some<00:06:19.000> 1.8<00:06:19.570> and<00:06:19.720> the<00:06:20.380> dream<00:06:20.860> update<00:06:21.250> the

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
with some 1.8 and the dream update the

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.400 
with some 1.8 and the dream update the
update<00:06:21.460> I<00:06:21.940> guess<00:06:22.240> we<00:06:22.479> could<00:06:22.660> all<00:06:22.780> hope<00:06:22.930> for<00:06:23.169> and

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
update I guess we could all hope for and

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.500 
update I guess we could all hope for and
then<00:06:23.530> maybe<00:06:23.770> get<00:06:24.040> is<00:06:24.220> actually<00:06:24.940> having<00:06:25.240> all

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
then maybe get is actually having all

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.570 
then maybe get is actually having all
the<00:06:25.660> 1.8<00:06:26.050> features<00:06:26.410> but<00:06:26.620> like<00:06:27.070> I<00:06:27.190> said<00:06:27.400> that<00:06:27.550> is

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
the 1.8 features but like I said that is

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.219 
the 1.8 features but like I said that is
just<00:06:27.729> a<00:06:28.000> dream<00:06:28.210> away<00:06:28.390> I<00:06:28.690> hope<00:06:28.900> you<00:06:29.050> did<00:06:29.200> enjoy

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
just a dream away I hope you did enjoy

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.140 
just a dream away I hope you did enjoy
