00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:10.900
 Hi Fujiguchi Even the person who is not good at designing this video 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:16.900
 We talk about weapon which shortens time to spend in drafting examination of second grade architect 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:20.830
 If you get this weapon, you will be able to make a difference in rivals and you will have less room for mistakes. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:26.340
 You will be able to review and confirm the correction within the examination time 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.340
 That means that it will be easier for the exam 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.470
 Even if I can not study for exams , I think it is difficult to study design and drawing in this hot day 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.820
 I will 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:47.290
 I am not doing Eskiss meeting plan drawing practice under invisible pressure 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:48.350
 At this point you think that you will be troubled with the biggest problems Third class architect drafting 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.870
 The biggest of the exam 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:01:00.559
 The problem is that it gets harder every year and takes more time 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:07.130
 Anyway , I felt that I was running out of time when I was writing drawings, but I was disgusted at the middle of my concentration or on the way 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:08.370
 If you end up practicing for a long time and you postpone to tomorrow, it is yours 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.900
 It is not a fault 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:20.310
 It's not your fault I've been involved in the past 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:25.680
 I develop into a social problem and the rules become stricter because I am blamed by some of the evil builders. 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.360
 Are forced to take difficult exams, so unfair and unreasonable 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.540
 I us to bounce a handicap in the world is 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.620
 How do I get an architect license 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:41.920
 You need a tool to save time easily 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:47.590
 For example, say you have been asked to to build a house in Nokogiridake as was the carpenter's 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.350
 It takes a lot of time and I feel tired, so it is better to use an electric saw 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:55.530
 Be short 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:02:00.840
 I think it will be easier, that is, changing tools to something that can save time 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.680
 Then, how do we do instead of doing it will change in three easy steps 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.680
 It is possible 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.320
 Determine the reference line in step 1 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.680
 Move the reference line decided in step 2 up and down 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.790
 I use the ruler thoroughly in step 3 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.720
 If the order of writing the lines is decided, the drawing speed will naturally be faster 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.890
 Because next time there is no time to get lost 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:33.050
 Child in particular, write quickly rectangular meter drawings if to hand the weapon to increase the drawing speed 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:36.260
 It means that to complete the remaining tend to glue a total of one side to say that you will bet 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:42.200
 It means that you can pass the system exam 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:46.030
 It is by all means to reference because it has published more detailed How to make on this website 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.030
 I hope you will make a contribution
