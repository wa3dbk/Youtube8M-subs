00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 and hello everyone these bodies 38th 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.230
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.360
 video a little bit special he's it 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.380
 simply a tutorial to do 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.109
 a factory to do in minecraft so the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.150
 more optimized possible so for this 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.580
 do it will have to first find the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.289
 spawn so make a 4.4 square that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.420
 we can find with a compass 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.060
 so I've already marked the area for 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.590
 the video puts so you see you 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.740
 arrive with the compass and at the end of a 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.590
 year 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.870
 she turns so you go digging so 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 a trick of 2 out of 2 1 44 and normally 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.030
 when you turn in this square the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.890
 compass should be turned as for the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.809
 next you will build diagonally 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.860
 you will count to 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.809
 7 8 9 and make a pillar nails once 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.109
 of flora is so in every diagnosis 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.609
 opened four poles of 3 and so 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.980
 every post normally has to be 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.820
 spaced 20 blocks apart so you can 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.439
 check to see if all that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.150
 works if it's after doing 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.640
 a try simply you go 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.470
 build over 16 blocks 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.360
 so I put ours colors for 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.100
 the needs of the video for you 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.439
 have four rounds of 19 2o so why 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.450
 19 simply because three because 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.270
 that a golem is 3 and that's where 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.210
 the golems are going to be able this pony and so 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.470
 it does not have to touch that finally like that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.420
 they will land more free 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.490
 high school books four panels and make a 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.590
 floor a flat surface to make a 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.829
 kind of store finished platform 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.200
 you're going to make a wall all around 2 3 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.369
 voices your wall 3 2 3 in height 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.850
 built around the floor 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:57.600
 you're going to take a blog hop you 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.740
 go do 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 you ask a question 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.610
 block 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.790
 one two three four years follows is 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.700
 normally one two three four five 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.410
 six hop like that so this space actually 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.940
 that's where we'll put the doors or 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.380
 simply and you do that so 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.750
 normally you have to arrive a 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.599
 result that looks pretty much like this 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.620
 so you have to know that for 16 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.540
 villagers there is a golem who spawn 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.880
 you will fill the holes 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.590
 of 6 not as against as I have 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.459
 done there you go fill the holes of 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.190
 6 by doors is simply 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.319
 still elevated so 2-1 and you can 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.510
 bush and now the holes of zeal 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.400
 then do each side where there is 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:51.120
 the holes so at the doors one 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.900
 platform 3 of 6 hop like that for 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.390
 that the web village 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.880
 they think they're at home and we're going 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.280
 so do it in fact it will be a pen in 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.200
 somehow the enclosure to villagers and 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.690
 it has to be 2.2 for this 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.590
 be optimized you have to put four 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.079
 villager 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:13.799
 in all so that's for the loan to 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.840
 see what aulas and the four container 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.890
 with four villagers in each of you 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.690
 go make the insolent at the level of the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.519
 head of the villagers and doors on 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.359
 appreciable finish one you go 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.329
 now make a new wall of two 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.549
 tall after still this wall realize 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.859
 you will now put two 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.769
 migdal from above all around the wall 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.500
 do not forget to put 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.350
 torches at least one torch in each 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.700
 compartment to prevent zombies 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.900
 simply spawn with the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.819
 villagers have for not that they 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.680
 do not make it be transformed into 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.950
 deposit you can also cover 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.630
 each compartment 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.670
 in a kind of small roof in half 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.650
 simply slab like after you 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.959
 go take a bucket of water and place it 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.310
 two tall in a corner like 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.109
 this is all along the sources 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.510
 of water along the wall while 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.130
 just to push laurent the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.960
 live final associates and so do remain 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.540
 almost one quarter 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.850
 and two you'll immediately 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.950
 broken and you're going to do exactly the 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.380
 same thing at the 2nd floor hands it is 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.820
 so moving a golem that spawn 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.220
 on this surface 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.560
 So the golem will fall he is 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.410
 simply attracted by currents 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.830
 to the center this is exactly it's going 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.890
 fall 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.990
 and here so as you could see 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.810
 besides with the golem that followed me 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.000
 so right here we're going to do our 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.680
 system that will kill golems 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.380
 and harvest them and me too I 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.780
 love you golem and we'll see that 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.120
 so go to dig a hole 2-3-2 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.110
 depth so that is the size 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:03.380
 of college and if like those like 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:06.710
 these and like this or just 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:11.180
 like this if you prefer you go 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.860
 then place the blade here so 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.950
 that they make a curtain of 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:21.010
 fire here is the golem will drown in 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.010
 the fire simply fire poorly designed but 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.300
 hey he can go out but we will do 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.240
 a system do not worry and seen from 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.130
 underneath so it looks like that so the 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.370
 items so ingots and flowers 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.050
 dropped by the golem are going to be they 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.360
 are going to adhere so you're going to 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.730
 four hopper like these in direction 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.260
 of a chest is simply the 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:47.060
 golems that will fall and die will 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.570
 because they make 3 2 to go their head goes 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.770
 cramer 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.880
 but the lower body will stay normal this 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.370
 which makes the items do not go 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.520
 burn so we put that to too much 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.200
 afraid to harvest the ingot to make and 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.480
 possibly the rose to put it 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.670
 then on the question of aesthetics and 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:09.260
 in case of any 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:13.100
 hubei glitch of hell golem i did a 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.960
 pipe just upside down connecting the 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.130
 wash at the water hole 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.140
 so it's mostly a question 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.849
 aesthetics and in case a bug 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.889
 happens to what they do 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.629
 that they make shifted a little bit 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.309
 the golem but it's more for 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:27.559
 the aesthetics and this should be 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:29.839
 present like this so hoping 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:32.599
 that the video you liked do not hesitate to 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:34.550
 put a green thumb max 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:37.729
 not also to subscribe to the channel I 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.639
 can also put the link of another 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.709
 youtuber who did the same type of 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.139
 factory to do and at the end of the video I 

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:47.179
 recommend you his video because this model 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.669
 This is a small factory if you want 

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:52.599
 enlarge it I invite you to click in 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:56.319
