00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
and it's a really really light

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.849 
and it's a really really light
foundation<00:03:50.159> it<00:03:50.549> does<00:03:50.790> cover<00:03:51.180> pretty<00:03:51.689> well<00:03:52.079> so

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
foundation it does cover pretty well so

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.860 
foundation it does cover pretty well so
it<00:03:52.979> has<00:03:53.189> got<00:03:53.220> two<00:03:53.609> great<00:03:53.729> coverage<00:03:54.269> but<00:03:54.569> it's

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
it has got two great coverage but it's

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.159 
it has got two great coverage but it's
very<00:03:55.849> light<00:03:56.849> foundation<00:03:57.509> I<00:03:57.599> feel<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:57.959> it's

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
very light foundation I feel like it's

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.839 
very light foundation I feel like it's
not<00:03:58.259> really<00:03:58.560> clog<00:03:58.919> invisible<00:03:59.519> most

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
not really clog invisible most

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.330 
not really clog invisible most
consistencies<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:00.959> believe<00:04:01.259> it's<00:04:01.560> really

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
consistencies so I believe it's really

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.640 
consistencies so I believe it's really
light<00:04:02.870> formulation<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.470> actually

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
light formulation and that it actually

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.809 
light formulation and that it actually
allows<00:04:05.009> my<00:04:05.459> skin<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:06.299> breed<00:04:06.599> which<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.049> very
