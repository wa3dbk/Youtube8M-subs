00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.880 
so the first thing we're going to do is
beat<00:00:23.970> up<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.300> cup<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.750> butter<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.230> an<00:00:25.500> electric

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
beat up a cup of butter in an electric

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.589 
beat up a cup of butter in an electric
mixer<00:00:26.039> now<00:00:26.730> you're<00:00:26.880> basically<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.300> looking

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.160 
and basically double the volume at that
point<00:00:32.399> we're<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.910> add<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> sugar<00:00:33.480> so

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
with a base and several little inserts

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.290 
with a base and several little inserts
that<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.530> can<00:02:53.710> swap<00:02:53.980> out<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.700> make<00:02:54.850> different

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
that you can swap out to make different

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.840 
that you can swap out to make different
cutouts<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:56.160> we're<00:02:57.160> going<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.370> be<00:02:57.430> using<00:02:57.610> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
cutouts so we're going to be using the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.190 
cutouts so we're going to be using the
heart<00:02:58.060> cut<00:02:58.270> out<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.630> make<00:02:58.810> our<00:02:58.960> heart-shaped

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
heart cut out to make our heart-shaped

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.770 
heart cut out to make our heart-shaped
cookie<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:01.300> we're<00:03:01.390> gonna<00:03:01.480> take<00:03:01.600> our<00:03:01.690> first

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
cookie so we're gonna take our first

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.290 
cookie so we're gonna take our first
batch<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.140> dough<00:03:02.470> roll<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:03.280> out<00:03:03.700> on<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.030> floured

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
batch of dough roll it out on a floured

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.630 
batch of dough roll it out on a floured
surface<00:03:04.530> just<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.680> about<00:03:05.920> an<00:03:06.100> eighth<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.520> an

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
surface just to about an eighth of an

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.820 
surface just to about an eighth of an
inch<00:03:06.730> thick<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.390> then<00:03:08.350> we're<00:03:08.470> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> cut

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
inch thick and then we're going to cut

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.650 
inch thick and then we're going to cut
out<00:03:08.950> all<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.550> bottoms<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.180> you'll<00:03:10.390> see<00:03:10.540> it

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
out all of the bottoms and you'll see it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.970 
out all of the bottoms and you'll see it
really<00:03:10.870> helps<00:03:11.140> when<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.380> dough<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.560> nice<00:03:11.830> and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
really helps when the dough is nice and

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.950 
really helps when the dough is nice and
cold<00:03:12.220> because<00:03:12.760> it'll<00:03:12.970> help<00:03:13.120> us<00:03:13.360> get<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.630> nice

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
cold because it'll help us get a nice

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.320 
cold because it'll help us get a nice
clean<00:03:14.350> cut<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.460> then<00:03:15.880> once<00:03:16.090> you've<00:03:16.300> done

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
clean cut and then once you've done

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.600 
clean cut and then once you've done
about<00:03:16.750> 12<00:03:17.200> bottoms<00:03:17.710> you<00:03:17.800> can<00:03:17.980> go<00:03:18.220> ahead<00:03:18.460> and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
about 12 bottoms you can go ahead and

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.460 
about 12 bottoms you can go ahead and
just<00:03:18.700> pop<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.360> refrigerator<00:03:19.960> while

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
just pop that in the refrigerator while

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.290 
just pop that in the refrigerator while
you<00:03:20.620> prepare<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.040> tops<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.520> find<00:03:21.940> if<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.150> dough

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
you prepare the tops I find if the dough

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.360 
you prepare the tops I find if the dough
becomes<00:03:22.660> too<00:03:22.900> warm<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.710> begins<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.160> lose<00:03:24.340> its

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
becomes too warm it begins to lose its

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.190 
becomes too warm it begins to lose its
shape<00:03:24.790> as<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.270> starts<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.570> bake<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.140> it's

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
shape as it starts to bake so it's

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.390 
shape as it starts to bake so it's
better<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.710> dough<00:03:26.830> is<00:03:26.950> nice<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.280> cold

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
better that the dough is nice and cold

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.370 
better that the dough is nice and cold
so<00:03:27.640> at<00:03:28.240> this<00:03:28.420> point<00:03:28.660> we're<00:03:28.870> going<00:03:28.990> to<00:03:29.050> take<00:03:29.260> the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
so at this point we're going to take the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.500 
so at this point we're going to take the
heart<00:03:29.620> insert<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.370> our<00:03:30.520> cookie<00:03:30.850> cutter<00:03:31.060> we're

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
heart insert to our cookie cutter we're

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.030 
heart insert to our cookie cutter we're
going<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.690> insert<00:03:32.110> it<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.440> center<00:03:32.860> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
going to insert it in the center and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.070 
going to insert it in the center and
then<00:03:33.790> we're<00:03:33.910> going<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.090> cut<00:03:34.300> out<00:03:34.450> all<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.870> tops

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
then we're going to cut out all the tops

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.690 
then we're going to cut out all the tops
and<00:03:35.620> you'll<00:03:35.740> see<00:03:35.920> it'll<00:03:36.100> have<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> beautiful

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
and you'll see it'll have a beautiful

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.670 
and you'll see it'll have a beautiful
little<00:03:36.760> heart<00:03:37.060> in<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.210> center<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.380> can<00:03:38.560> go

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
little heart in the center so you can go

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.320 
little heart in the center so you can go
ahead<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.130> transfer<00:03:39.460> that<00:03:39.490> to<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.880> parchment

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
ahead and transfer that to a parchment

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.660 
ahead and transfer that to a parchment
lined<00:03:40.360> cookie<00:03:40.540> sheet<00:03:40.780> as<00:03:41.020> well<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.590> then<00:03:42.430> take

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
lined cookie sheet as well and then take

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.090 
lined cookie sheet as well and then take
the<00:03:42.850> bottoms<00:03:43.270> pop<00:03:43.810> those<00:03:44.080> in<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.380> oven<00:03:44.410> and

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
the bottoms pop those in the oven and

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.070 
the bottoms pop those in the oven and
we're<00:03:45.250> going<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.430> bake<00:03:45.610> at<00:03:45.820> 350<00:03:46.300> Fahrenheit

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
we're going to bake at 350 Fahrenheit

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.710 
we're going to bake at 350 Fahrenheit
for<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.590> 10<00:03:48.250> minutes<00:03:48.700> you'll<00:03:49.300> know<00:03:49.390> when

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
for just 10 minutes you'll know when

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.850 
for just 10 minutes you'll know when
they're<00:03:49.870> done<00:03:49.900> when<00:03:50.260> they<00:03:50.350> start<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.680> just

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
they're done when they start to just

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.710 
they're done when they start to just
rise<00:03:51.280> up<00:03:51.459> a<00:03:51.580> little<00:03:51.850> bit<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.150> become<00:03:52.390> puffed

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
rise up a little bit and become puffed

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.900 
rise up a little bit and become puffed
and<00:03:52.959> look<00:03:53.380> like<00:03:53.530> they're<00:03:53.740> set<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.490> actually

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
and look like they're set you actually

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
and look like they're set you actually
don't<00:03:55.060> want<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.240> take<00:03:55.390> them<00:03:55.570> all<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.780> way

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
don't want to take them all the way

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.240 
don't want to take them all the way
where<00:03:56.230> they<00:03:56.290> begin<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.709> get<00:03:56.860> golden<00:03:57.190> brown

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
where they begin to get golden brown

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.800 
where they begin to get golden brown
because<00:03:58.060> then<00:03:58.209> they'll<00:03:58.330> just<00:03:58.360> get<00:03:58.570> a<00:03:58.630> little

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
because then they'll just get a little

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.660 
because then they'll just get a little
too<00:03:58.900> crumbly<00:03:59.290> on<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.040> just<00:04:00.190> go<00:04:00.310> ahead<00:04:00.520> and

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
too crumbly on you so just go ahead and

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.280 
too crumbly on you so just go ahead and
take<00:04:00.850> them<00:04:01.060> out<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.480> what<00:04:01.810> we're<00:04:01.900> going<00:04:01.990> to<00:04:02.050> do

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
take them out and what we're going to do

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.230 
take them out and what we're going to do
is<00:04:02.680> allow<00:04:02.980> them<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.310> cool<00:04:03.520> on<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:04.090> cookie

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
is allow them to cool on the cookie

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.940 
is allow them to cool on the cookie
sheet<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.020> benefit<00:04:05.380> of<00:04:05.410> allowing<00:04:05.860> the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
sheet and the benefit of allowing the

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.770 
sheet and the benefit of allowing the
cookies<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.400> kind<00:04:06.580> of<00:04:06.640> continue<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.360> cook<00:04:07.540> this

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
cookies to kind of continue to cook this

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.900 
cookies to kind of continue to cook this
way<00:04:07.990> is<00:04:08.260> that<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.680> cookies<00:04:08.950> will<00:04:09.130> firm<00:04:09.340> up<00:04:09.580> due

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
way is that the cookies will firm up due

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.610 
way is that the cookies will firm up due
to<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.150> heat<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.660> cookie<00:04:10.959> sheet<00:04:11.170> but<00:04:11.530> they

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
to the heat of the cookie sheet but they

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.650 
to the heat of the cookie sheet but they
won't<00:04:11.860> become<00:04:12.130> extra<00:04:12.520> brown<00:04:12.760> as<00:04:13.030> they<00:04:13.480> would

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
won't become extra brown as they would

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.480 
won't become extra brown as they would
if<00:04:13.750> we<00:04:13.870> left<00:04:14.050> them<00:04:14.140> in<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.290> oven<00:04:14.410> then<00:04:15.400> we're

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
if we left them in the oven then we're

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.310 
if we left them in the oven then we're
going<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.640> pop<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:16.000> tops<00:04:16.239> in<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.570> oven<00:04:16.810> at<00:04:16.930> 350

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
going to pop the tops in the oven at 350

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.560 
going to pop the tops in the oven at 350
for<00:04:17.770> just<00:04:17.980> nine<00:04:18.250> minutes<00:04:18.730> they<00:04:19.090> take<00:04:19.299> less

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
for just nine minutes they take less

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.090 
for just nine minutes they take less
time<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.900> bake<00:04:20.229> because<00:04:20.530> they<00:04:20.650> don't<00:04:20.799> have<00:04:21.010> as

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
time to bake because they don't have as

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.159 
time to bake because they don't have as
much<00:04:21.250> surface<00:04:21.910> area<00:04:22.060> as<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.630> bottoms<00:04:22.990> because

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
much surface area as the bottoms because

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.300 
much surface area as the bottoms because
we've<00:04:23.440> done<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.800> cutout

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
we've done the cutout

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.440 
we've done the cutout
so<00:04:24.520> they're<00:04:24.639> a<00:04:24.670> little<00:04:24.730> bit<00:04:24.970> quicker<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.300> bake

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
so they're a little bit quicker to bake

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.030 
so they're a little bit quicker to bake
and<00:04:25.720> then<00:04:26.230> we're<00:04:26.320> going<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.500> allow<00:04:26.620> them<00:04:26.830> to

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
and then we're going to allow them to

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.650 
and then we're going to allow them to
cool<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.430> same<00:04:27.610> way<00:04:27.790> just<00:04:28.060> on<00:04:28.240> our<00:04:28.270> cookie

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
cool the same way just on our cookie

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.860 
cool the same way just on our cookie
sheet<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.610> this<00:04:30.610> whole<00:04:30.940> stage<00:04:31.270> can<00:04:31.540> be<00:04:31.570> done

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
sheet and this whole stage can be done

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.290 
sheet and this whole stage can be done
the<00:04:32.050> day<00:04:32.080> before<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:33.160> all<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.669> have<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:34.000> do<00:04:34.120> is

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
just lightly cover them with foil and

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.379 
just lightly cover them with foil and
allow<00:04:36.190> them<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.760> just<00:04:36.910> stay<00:04:37.120> on<00:04:37.270> your

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
to go the next day then to assemble

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.390 
to go the next day then to assemble
here's<00:04:41.290> what<00:04:41.470> we're<00:04:41.560> going<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.710> do<00:04:41.919> we're

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
here's what we're going to do we're

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.980 
here's what we're going to do we're
going<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.580> dust<00:04:42.790> all<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.090> cookies<00:04:43.600> lightly

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
going to dust all the cookies lightly

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.470 
going to dust all the cookies lightly
with<00:04:44.139> some<00:04:44.290> powdered<00:04:44.590> sugar<00:04:45.210> then<00:04:46.210> we<00:04:46.360> are

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
with some powdered sugar then we are

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.030 
with some powdered sugar then we are
going<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.690> transfer<00:04:47.230> some<00:04:47.470> raspberry<00:04:47.980> jam

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
going to transfer some raspberry jam

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.520 
going to transfer some raspberry jam
into<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.910> pastry<00:04:49.330> bag<00:04:49.540> I<00:04:49.810> find<00:04:50.260> that<00:04:50.380> it's

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
into a pastry bag I find that it's

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.620 
into a pastry bag I find that it's
really<00:04:50.590> a<00:04:50.889> lot<00:04:51.100> easier<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.790> work<00:04:52.090> with<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.419> jam

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
really a lot easier to work with the jam

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.210 
really a lot easier to work with the jam
when<00:04:52.810> it's<00:04:52.930> in<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.110> pastry<00:04:53.470> bag<00:04:53.560> because<00:04:54.130> you'll

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
when it's in a pastry bag because you'll

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.950 
when it's in a pastry bag because you'll
get<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.340> lot<00:04:54.490> more<00:04:54.700> precision<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.389> way<00:04:55.570> but

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
get a lot more precision that way but

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.270 
get a lot more precision that way but
you<00:04:56.050> could<00:04:56.230> just<00:04:56.260> spoon<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.740> out<00:04:56.830> too<00:04:57.040> if<00:04:57.190> you

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
you could just spoon it out too if you

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.770 
you could just spoon it out too if you
didn't<00:04:57.460> have<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.610> pastry<00:04:57.880> bag<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.300> then<00:04:58.660> we're

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
didn't have a pastry bag and then we're

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.080 
didn't have a pastry bag and then we're
going<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.080> take<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.500> raspberry<00:04:59.919> jam<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:00.490> just

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
going to take the raspberry jam and just

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.240 
going to take the raspberry jam and just
create<00:05:01.390> a<00:05:01.450> little<00:05:01.780> dollop<00:05:02.140> in<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.740> center<00:05:03.040> of

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
create a little dollop in the center of

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.790 
create a little dollop in the center of
