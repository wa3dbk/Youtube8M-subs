 water copiously the art must by 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.370
 wet weather and this for several 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.680
 weeks 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.270
 then there are special cases 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.840
 that is to say the so-called earth plants 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.849
 heather 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.640
 these are particularly

 earth acidic and rich in 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.360
 organic 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.819
 these weapons ut appreciated a contribution of land 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.910
 heather during planting 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.319
 they will grow better and faster in 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.319
 offering abundant flowering 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.890
 shrubs do not require 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.230
 important maintenance however it is necessary 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.680
 watch over watering during the first

 to overcome the weak rooting 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.900
 temporary you can also cover 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.420
 the soil, that is to say, mulching with 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.960
 pine bark to maintain a good 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.990
 freshness 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.060
 once the booting done you 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.700
 can bring our special envoy 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.150
 shrubs and remove regularly 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.150
 weeds 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.920
 for size use a pruner 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.660
 clean and well sharpened a size 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.210

 at the end of winter for those who 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.390
 bloom in summer like buddleia 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.430
 the hydrangea the potentilla just after the 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.959
