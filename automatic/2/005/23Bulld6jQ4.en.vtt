00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.270
 hello dear friends of you tube today I am going to comment to you what I think of the 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.830
 video game that everyone knows and must have played 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.129
 the metal gear solid 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:10.789
 as a saga he considered it a masterpiece 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.579
 it's practically a story 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.869
 a small biography of the progress of a man called hideo kojima 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.810
 everything begins in the year 1987 when hideo kojima launched the game metal gear 

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:25.269
 for the msx 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.560
 a game that historically innovated the first game where the idea was not 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:30.630
 kill and advance 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.250
 but move forward without killing an infiltration game 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.520
 the argument 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.770
 it was not as impeccable as the later 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.510
 then came metal gear 2 1989 which had a better argument 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.590
 with more turns 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.570
 and some rare middle parts 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.160
 towards philosophical 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.070
 besides that the gameplay was widely developed there was a radar 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.670
 you could crouch among other things 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.160
 here one step was marked 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.470
 that would define the following metal gear the argument 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.080
 then he arrived 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.220
 in the 1997 metal gear solid 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.510
 for the psx 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.850
 which marked a milestone 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.910
 to take the saga to 3d marking one of the best-selling games in history 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.020
 transforming this one that already the cardboard box into famous of the whole world 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.930
 such a moving argument 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.510
 so detailed characters 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.180
 the game was made to taste 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.940
 it was noticeable 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.250
 here the term was fully developed in argued 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 besides having a moral that several people that I have known 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.300
 their life has changed 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.600
 simplicity of life 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.040
 construction of the future nothing is predicted 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 followed metal gear solid 2 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.350
 in 2001 he created 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.880
 game in which I devised I owe the term of the argument even further 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.470
 coming to issues such as freedom of expression 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.150
 our contribution to history 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.830
 One of our reasons for living among other things more 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.070
 the argument itself was a complicated issue that many people did not understand 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.369
 and they did not like the argument for the same 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.790
 saying it is loose 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.020
 among other things 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.090
 is undoubtedly the most complex argument of the whole saga 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.500
 until now 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.590
 then in metal gear solid 3 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.569
 Imagined left aside the complexity 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.259
 and gave way to feelings 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.510
 and that's how the intricate tale of love that is this game begins 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.650
 maternity sense of de vos the feeling of belonging of the hacker is 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.629
 was born towards her 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.620
 among many other beautiful things 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.599
 that make the plot of this game that of the plot and plot most moving 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.499
 of the whole saga 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.069
 giving rise to a woman patriot 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.659
 omito portable ops 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.029
 because I have not played it yet 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.360
 then would come metal gear solid 4 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.340
 the story is set in 2014 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.779
 five years after the incident maja so 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.849
 and nine years after fox still gives jump to the desired island or moses 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.169
 where solidity nothing that was injected with a retrovirus called late forks 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.309
 solid snake appears considerably aged due to its advanced 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:56.010
 cellular degeneration like sada by a failure in the cloning process that 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.949
 I believe and now he has only six months to live 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:03.089
 metal gear solid 4 portrays a world where military dominance in land 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.939
 is the objective to dominate the economy 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.069
 leading mercenaries to fight big battles for financial purposes against 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.049
 private military companies 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.209
 the twenty-first century world economy now depends on the war 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.230
 but nevertheless 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.819
 five of the great pinzis are bent on forming a single large 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.659
 outer heaven company commanding liquid c lotc 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.079
 who has the power to take total control over the soldiers' nanomachines 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.109
 he wants to end the patriots 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.869
 for it is done with the control of the feed itself last power arms of 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:34.989
 the patriots 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.430
 by disconnecting the soldiers' nanobots 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.519
 the patriots would lose their last vestige of power 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.129
 that giving destroyed 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.249
 it is known that outer heaven has accumulated a capital and military equivalent to that 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:47.529
 has united states 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.529
 and now he's preparing to launch a nuclear weapon 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:52.760
 with the world once again in crisis 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.540
 solid snake is recruited for theft and change and the UN asks for help is nothing 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.819
 than to stop at 12 lot 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.379
 accompanied by ota with 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.359
 to eliminate such a stellar team 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.329
 your mission will take place in five locations around the middle world 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:05.909
 East 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.159
 South America a European city 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.839
 saadoun moses and utera haven 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:14.899
 a floating fortress based on arsenal gear where the gw system is and where 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:17.009
 refuges liquids from art 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.389
 metal gear has advanced in every game 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.629
 but more than just that 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:24.940
 It shows how a person progresses in his work and better to everything he does 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:26.490
 always moving forward 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.440
 sometimes little 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.479
 and sometimes fed up 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.689
 but always advancing esma that evolves together with kojima from a 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.370
 drawing 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.919
 to 700 polygons 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.229
 then to 3000 and polygons then aoute snake 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.199
 the story and the argument go beyond normal 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.490
 It has a purpose 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.620
 a reason not like other games 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.249
 gives a totally new meaning to the term video game 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:49.509
 in other words 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.169
 makes history 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.520
 characters as a motto 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.719
 ota with 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:54.460
 It is one that 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.590
 big boss 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.389
 solidus 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.520
 among many others will never be forgotten by those who have submerged 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.449
 in the arguments of these games 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.599
 that seem to be close to perfection 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.879
 in artistic terms 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.490
 in terms of gameplay 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.570
 I love it 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.449
 just like the soundtracks 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.559
 how to forget when heene mgs2 could surprise the guards or in mgs3 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:19.400
 you had to walk slowly to avoid making noise 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.559
 or the big xd cardboard box 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:22.759
 about bosses 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.250
 because each boss is retained in my memory 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.129
 his story 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:27.319
 how do you face it 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.379
 and its end 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.240
 ocelot is neither Peruvian psycho mantis 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.689

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:36.960
 i desso rou 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.960
 bolt jin without forgetting the antagonists 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.970
 liquids nothing that moved me when I talked about how I had grown thinking 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.819
 that was born to be a garbage 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.500
 soligo cessna that has taught me many things 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.540
 I was touched by your patriotism and your loyalty to your ideals and the new 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.879
 Enemies the unit owes to a pull of beast 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.409
 I will never forget the scene of her death in mgs2 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.850
 or the exhaust on the bike in mgs3 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.789
 or the perseverance of liquiden mgs 1 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.449
 without forgetting the sad story of gay fox 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.199
 who ended up hating politicians for turning their backs on him when he 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.949
 he asked for refuge for his beloved 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.099
 after having given so much for his country 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:19.460
 the romance between a Vietnamese soldier and an ice skater 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.919
 destroyed by politicians
