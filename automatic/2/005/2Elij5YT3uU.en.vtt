these are my second pair actually there

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.910 
these are my second pair actually there
because<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.630> liked<00:00:21.960> them<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.140> much<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.680> first

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
because I liked them so much the first

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.089 
because I liked them so much the first
time<00:00:23.269> skated<00:00:24.269> them<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.779> i<00:00:25.050> thought<00:00:25.769> i<00:00:25.980> needed

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
time skated them so i thought i needed

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.730 
time skated them so i thought i needed
to<00:00:26.939> get<00:00:27.090> another<00:00:27.240> pair<00:00:27.570> i<00:00:27.840> probably<00:00:28.470> won't

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
to get another pair i probably won't

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.330 
to get another pair i probably won't
skate<00:00:29.010> much<00:00:29.359> outside<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.630> these<00:00:30.900> maybe

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
skate much outside of these maybe

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.069 
skate much outside of these maybe
Janoskians<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.430> something<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.000> these<00:00:33.840> are

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
Janoskians or something but these are

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.130 
Janoskians or something but these are
probably<00:00:34.950> one<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> best<00:00:35.430> shoes<00:00:35.989> that<00:00:36.989> I've

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
probably one of the best shoes that I've

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.350 
probably one of the best shoes that I've
skated<00:00:37.380> definitely<00:00:40.219> yeah<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.550> basically<00:00:41.879> it's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
skated definitely yeah so basically it's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.360 
skated definitely yeah so basically it's
focalized<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.070> tell<00:00:44.280> from<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.520> name

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
focalized as you can tell from the name

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.420 
focalized as you can tell from the name
first<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.550> all<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.390> soul<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> guess<00:00:49.219> it's<00:00:50.219> not

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
first of all the soul I guess it's not

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.760 
first of all the soul I guess it's not
the<00:00:50.610> grip<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.090> soul<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.469> definitely

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the grip you soul but it definitely

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.880 
the grip you soul but it definitely
lasts<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.520> long<00:00:53.640> time<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:57.379> ya<00:00:58.379> like
