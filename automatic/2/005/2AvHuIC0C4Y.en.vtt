a<00:01:38.189> slightly<00:01:38.460> different<00:01:39.090> version<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.500> don't

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
a slightly different version so I don't

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.649 
a slightly different version so I don't
feel<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.060> so

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
feel it is if I have to do that so

feel it is if I have to do that so
that's<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.350> installous<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
that's what installous is for so

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.940 
that's what installous is for so
whenever<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.450> an<00:01:45.659> application<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.829> i

whenever I have an application that i
want<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.280> run<00:01:47.430> natively<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.149> I've<00:01:48.750> already

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
want to run natively and I've already

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.679 
want to run natively and I've already
purchased<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:49.770> iphone<00:01:49.950> 4<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.670> mean<00:01:51.540> it

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
purchased it on my iphone 4 I mean it

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.940 
purchased it on my iphone 4 I mean it
just<00:01:51.780> doesn't<00:01:52.110> really<00:01:52.140> make<00:01:52.380> sense<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.799> pay

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
just doesn't really make sense to pay

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.030 
just doesn't really make sense to pay
more<00:01:53.189> money<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:54.270> run<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> application

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
more money just to run the application

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.459 
more money just to run the application
normally<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> different<00:01:57.030> device<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.600> that's

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
normally on a different device so that's

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
normally on a different device so that's
what<00:01:58.619> that's<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:58.890> about<00:01:59.210> if<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.329> don't

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
what that's all about if you don't

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.380 
what that's all about if you don't
believe<00:02:00.539> me<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.079> don't<00:02:01.409> care<00:02:02.149> next<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.360> have

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
believe me I don't care next up we have

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.240 
believe me I don't care next up we have
winterboard<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.170> can't<00:02:04.680> remember<00:02:04.740> what<00:02:05.130> I'm

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
winterboard I can't remember what I'm

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.249 
winterboard I can't remember what I'm
using<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.060> think<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.810> actually<00:02:06.960> have

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
using this for I think I actually have

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.200 
using this for I think I actually have
the<00:02:07.409> mobile<00:02:07.829> substrate<00:02:08.039> extension<00:02:08.700> disabled

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
the mobile substrate extension disabled

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.389 
the mobile substrate extension disabled
so

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
so

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.059 
so
I'll<00:02:10.879> probably<00:02:11.060> get<00:02:11.360> rid<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.569> grid<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.319> rid<00:02:12.890> of

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
I'll probably get rid of grid a rid of

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.780 
I'll probably get rid of grid a rid of
winterboard<00:02:13.730> as<00:02:13.819> well<00:02:14.560> over<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:16.489> course<00:02:16.610> I

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
winterboard as well over in of course I

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.210 
winterboard as well over in of course I
have<00:02:16.909> sbsettings<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.780> lets<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.079> turn<00:02:18.769> certain

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
have sbsettings it lets you turn certain

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.270 
have sbsettings it lets you turn certain
settings<00:02:19.549> on<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.849> off<00:02:20.319> let's<00:02:21.319> go<00:02:21.470> over<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.709> my

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
settings on and off let's go over to my

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.860 
settings on and off let's go over to my
oh<00:02:22.579> let<00:02:23.450> me<00:02:23.480> show<00:02:23.689> you<00:02:23.720> grab<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.500> board

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
oh let me show you grab a board

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.030 
oh let me show you grab a board
basically<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:27.140> is<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.319> cool<00:02:27.500> little<00:02:27.680> tweak

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
basically this is a cool little tweak

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.860 
basically this is a cool little tweak
let<00:02:28.250> lets<00:02:28.579> you<00:02:28.730> turn<00:02:29.120> your<00:02:29.299> springboard<00:02:29.720> into

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
let lets you turn your springboard into

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.319 
let lets you turn your springboard into
this<00:02:30.140> little<00:02:30.519> gravitational<00:02:31.519> board<00:02:32.950> let<00:02:33.950> me

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
this little gravitational board let me

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.509 
this little gravitational board let me
turn<00:02:35.329> it<00:02:35.390> on<00:02:35.569> there<00:02:36.379> it<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.370> basically

look at grab a board oh and my
springboard<00:03:08.299> just<00:03:08.510> crashed<00:03:09.129> you<00:03:10.129> can<00:03:10.310> see

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
springboard just crashed you can see

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.809 
springboard just crashed you can see
that<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.659> looks<00:03:12.650> like<00:03:12.709> I'm<00:03:12.920> in<00:03:13.040> safe<00:03:13.310> mode<00:03:13.340> so

all<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.150> my<00:03:14.359> mobile<00:03:14.660> substrate<00:03:14.870> extensions

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
all of my mobile substrate extensions

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.490 
all of my mobile substrate extensions
are<00:03:15.739> currently<00:03:16.280> disabled<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.510> apparently

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
are currently disabled so apparently

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.740 
are currently disabled so apparently
that<00:03:18.889> was<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.040> problem<00:03:19.459> with<00:03:19.790> grab<00:03:20.419> a<00:03:20.449> board

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
that was a problem with grab a board

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.309 
that was a problem with grab a board
maybe<00:03:21.410> I'll<00:03:21.680> report<00:03:22.069> that<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.400> developer
