only a utility knife and a set of tin
snips<00:00:35.950> we<00:00:36.430> got<00:00:36.580> those<00:00:36.760> in<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:37.000> bench<00:00:37.180> yes<00:00:37.750> all

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
snips we got those in the bench yes all

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.290 
snips we got those in the bench yes all
right<00:00:38.620> we'd<00:00:39.040> use<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.400> utility<00:00:39.879> knife<00:00:40.059> to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
right we'd use the utility knife to

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.780 
right we'd use the utility knife to
slice<00:00:40.629> away<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:41.050> shrink-wrap<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:42.520> really

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
slice away the shrink-wrap that's really

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.090 
slice away the shrink-wrap that's really
time-consuming<00:00:43.199> so<00:00:44.199> we've<00:00:44.379> already<00:00:44.559> done<00:00:44.739> it

and<00:00:45.220> we'll<00:00:45.580> just<00:00:45.730> simply<00:00:46.030> lift<00:00:46.180> it<00:00:46.330> off<00:00:46.510> it<00:00:47.050> was

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
and we'll just simply lift it off it was

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.840 
and we'll just simply lift it off it was
kind<00:00:47.410> of<00:00:47.470> boring<00:00:47.650> trust<00:00:48.129> me<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.400> didn't<00:00:48.730> want

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
we should mention that the forks come in

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.999 
we should mention that the forks come in
a<00:01:36.429> separate<00:01:36.759> box<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:38.049> makes<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.530> genie<00:01:38.740> lift

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
a separate box this makes the genie lift

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:52.039 
a separate box this makes the genie lift
a<00:01:39.130> two-piece<00:01:39.549> shipment<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:46.390> for<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.750> okay

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049

and<00:01:53.219> one<00:01:54.219> for<00:01:54.399> me<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:54.759> a<00:01:54.969> couple<00:01:55.179> of<00:01:55.240> pins<00:01:56.609> to

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
and one for me and a couple of pins to

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.209 
and one for me and a couple of pins to
mount<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:57.939> forks<00:01:58.409> simply<00:01:59.409> slip<00:01:59.679> them<00:01:59.859> over<00:01:59.979> in

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
mount the forks simply slip them over in

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:06.630 
mount the forks simply slip them over in
the<00:02:00.249> fork<00:02:00.520> mounting<00:02:00.880> tubes<00:02:05.100> put<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.249> pin<00:02:06.460> in

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
the fork mounting tubes put the pin in

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.460 
the fork mounting tubes put the pin in
and<00:02:06.759> rotate<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.810> ring<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.860> locks
