how to clean or flush a piston style

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.190 
how to clean or flush a piston style
fountain<00:00:05.160> pen<00:00:05.720> for<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.779> purpose<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.140> the

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
fountain pen for the purpose of the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.200 
fountain pen for the purpose of the
video<00:00:07.350> I<00:00:07.500> have<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.859> cup<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.280> warm<00:00:08.639> water<00:00:08.760> an

video I have a cup of warm water an
empty<00:00:09.510> cup<00:00:09.750> I'm<00:00:10.080> gonna<00:00:10.290> use<00:00:11.040> instead<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.880> a

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
empty cup I'm gonna use instead of a

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.549 
empty cup I'm gonna use instead of a
sink<00:00:12.300> normally<00:00:12.660> I<00:00:12.719> do<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.049> in<00:00:13.230> front<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
sink normally I do this in front of a

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.099 
sink normally I do this in front of a
sink<00:00:13.830> or<00:00:14.070> over<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.820> sink<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.269> then<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:16.080> a

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
sink or over the sink and then I have a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.200 
sink or over the sink and then I have a
piston<00:00:16.500> style<00:00:16.800> fountain<00:00:17.609> pen<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.880> happens

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
piston style fountain pen this happens

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.099 
piston style fountain pen this happens
to<00:00:18.300> be<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.449> Delta<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.140> T<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:20.270> so<00:00:21.270> first<00:00:21.720> thing<00:00:21.900> we

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
to be a Delta I T and so first thing we

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.679 
to be a Delta I T and so first thing we
would<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.560> remove<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.160> cap<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:24.449> see

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
would do is remove the cap you can see

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.230 
would do is remove the cap you can see
there's<00:00:24.900> still<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.289> bit<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.590> ink<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
there's still a little bit of ink in the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.820 
there's still a little bit of ink in the
barrel<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> pen<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.680> this

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
barrel of the pen so with this

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.500 
barrel of the pen so with this
particular<00:00:29.099> piston<00:00:29.699> style<00:00:29.939> pen<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
particular piston style pen you have to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.410 
particular piston style pen you have to
remove<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.019> cap<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.820> piston<00:00:33.180> style

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
remove this cap and on the piston style

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660 
remove this cap and on the piston style
pens<00:00:33.690> there's<00:00:33.899> usually<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.350> knob<00:00:34.649> at<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> end

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
pens there's usually a knob at the end

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.790 
pens there's usually a knob at the end
of<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> pen<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.989> would<00:00:37.380> move<00:00:37.590> that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
of the pen and so you would move that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.900 
of the pen and so you would move that
knob<00:00:38.129> or<00:00:39.059> twist<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.640> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
knob or twist it and you can see that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.959 
knob or twist it and you can see that
piston<00:00:42.600> moves<00:00:43.020> forward<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:44.730> going

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
piston moves forward and what I'm going

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.750 
piston moves forward and what I'm going
to<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.629> drain<00:00:46.079> any<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> excess

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
to do is just drain any of the excess

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.459 
to do is just drain any of the excess
ink<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.539> out<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> pen<00:00:49.200> there's

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
ink I can get out of that pen there's

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.220 
ink I can get out of that pen there's
not<00:00:50.250> much<00:00:50.489> left<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.719> first<00:00:51.960> step

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
not much left but that's the first step

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.420 
not much left but that's the first step
the<00:00:52.800> next<00:00:52.829> step<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.149> would<00:00:54.390> run<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> nib

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
the next step is I would run the nib

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.400 
the next step is I would run the nib
underneath<00:00:56.430> water<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.050> run<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
underneath water I would just run it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.799 
underneath water I would just run it
underneath<00:00:58.649> your<00:00:58.859> tap<00:00:59.329> since<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.420> don't<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
underneath your tap since I don't have a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
underneath your tap since I don't have a
tap<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.410> won't<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.219> I'll<00:01:02.309> put<00:01:02.430> it

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
tap here I won't do that but I'll put it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.289 
tap here I won't do that but I'll put it
in<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.629> bottle<00:01:03.930> link<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:05.299> that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
in the bottle link and you can see that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.109 
in the bottle link and you can see that
ink<00:01:06.570> come<00:01:07.229> out<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> will<00:01:08.250> draw<00:01:10.070> water

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
ink come out and then I will draw water

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.929 
ink come out and then I will draw water
into<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> chamber<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:15.150> pan<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.939> release

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
into the chamber of the pan and release

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.820 
into the chamber of the pan and release
that<00:01:18.240> may<00:01:18.930> go<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.320> opposite<00:01:19.680> direction

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that may go in the opposite direction

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.010 
that may go in the opposite direction
I'm<00:01:20.460> gonna<00:01:20.610> flush<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:23.210> ink<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.810> then

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I'm gonna flush that ink out and then

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.840 
I'm gonna flush that ink out and then
I'll<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.320> more<00:01:25.530> water<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.250> repeat<00:01:26.700> this

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I'll get more water and just repeat this

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.760 
I'll get more water and just repeat this
process<00:01:27.150> over<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.900> over<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> over

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
process over and over if you do it over

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.810 
process over and over if you do it over
a<00:01:28.950> sink<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> lot<00:01:29.610> easier<00:01:30.060> because<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.380> can

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
a sink it's a lot easier because you can

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.010 
a sink it's a lot easier because you can
just<00:01:33.590> go<00:01:34.590> back<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.829> forth<00:01:35.250> without

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
just go back and forth without

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.830 
just go back and forth without
transferring<00:01:37.020> from<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.829> cup<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> other

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
transferring from one cup to the other

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.969 
transferring from one cup to the other
it's<00:01:39.840> quick<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.079> easy<00:01:40.259> over<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> sink<00:01:40.890> you

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it's quick and easy over the sink you

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.770 
it's quick and easy over the sink you
can<00:01:41.040> actually<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> color<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> ink<00:01:42.479> or

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
can actually see the color of the ink or

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.960 
can actually see the color of the ink or
the<00:01:42.869> water<00:01:43.170> changing<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.520> I'm<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:44.790> really

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the water changing so I'm not really

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.440 
the water changing so I'm not really
getting<00:01:45.210> real<00:01:45.600> clean<00:01:46.130> water<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
getting real clean water but what you

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.310 
getting real clean water but what you
will<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.110> continue<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:50.659> draw<00:01:51.659> water

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
will do is just continue to draw water

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
will do is just continue to draw water
into<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> barrel<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> pen<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.329> then

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
into the barrel of the pen and then

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.410 
into the barrel of the pen and then
flush<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.899> out<00:01:55.219> until<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.399> water<00:01:56.640> starts<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
flush it out until that water starts to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
your ink this is going to take a little

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.840 
your ink this is going to take a little

back and forth and it it can be a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.260 
back and forth and it it can be a
lengthy<00:02:07.920> process<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.879> see<00:02:09.119> already

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
lengthy process but you can see already

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.900 
lengthy process but you can see already
my<00:02:09.569> ink<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.890> water<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.340> starting<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.760> run<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
my ink is the water is starting to run a

my ink is the water is starting to run a
little<00:02:12.000> clearer

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
little clearer

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.700 
little clearer
but<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.720> hard<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:15.990> see<00:02:16.200> because<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
but it's hard to see because of the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.620 
but it's hard to see because of the
water<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.460> I'm<00:02:17.580> pulling<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.270> actually

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
water that I'm pulling in is actually

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.670 
water that I'm pulling in is actually
turning<00:02:18.930> black<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.410> well<00:02:21.200> but<00:02:22.200> once<00:02:22.440> you've

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
turning black as well but once you've

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.420 
turning black as well but once you've
done<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.910> your<00:02:24.090> water<00:02:24.480> runs<00:02:24.840> clear<00:02:25.430> then

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
done that and your water runs clear then

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.890 
done that and your water runs clear then
what<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.730> would<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.300> just<00:02:27.540> kind<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.720> wipe

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320
