00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.810
 for everyone who follows me on my channel 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.370
 honest and fat 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.250
 they removed from upload the page of the moon 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.600
 an ace m2 in haiti was his life today 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.660
 then I will give a tube how 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.600
 install it but have made a video 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.340
 previously of an efe xp I have 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.370
 installed this what we are going to do is 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.160
 install the enzyme 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.440
 on top of this the new brown annual that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.180
 they went up today I'm going to explain to you how 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.210
 so they do not lose all those that have 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.190
 installed and only rents in for the new 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.140
 then let's start with the tutorial 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.930
 well here I bring you and for 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.690
 update it with the latest version of 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.269
 nothing to magic there are two methods of doing it 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.940
 the method that I'm going to do is going to 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:07.920
 flashing the better cell phone and the other 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.920
 method would be to enter configurations 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.970
 and here where you say no longer with me gates 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.620
 for transactions 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 the update will appear 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.720
 you can see here they went up today those who 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.820
 I showed at the beginning of the liveleak video 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.460
 they can download it and they can 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.600
 download install so they do not lose all 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.730
 the applications that have been installed 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.570
 you will not erase anything the method that 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.830
 I will do is the following 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.830
 and we pay our cell phone 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.400
 although we turn on the cell phone 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.650
 and that's when the man slade moradito 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.300
 we press the volume button up 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.560
 let his king appear 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.150
 we wait for between no recoder and a 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.420
 Once we enter the route directly 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.310
 we are going to install buttoning once 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.760
 stands and we look for it where we have it 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.760
 saved 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.630
 miley we install 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.160
 we go to 10 and we wait for it to be installed 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.160
 how it will take a long time 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.930
 or that has already finished, we restart 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.340
 According to the system, we restart and wait for 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.340
 that on the cell 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.060
 and as we have seen it is over 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.090
 to install and our applications do not 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.909
 we have been affected for nothing now going to 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.540
 the star screen to show them a 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.540
 new version 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.810
 well here not here we are already finished 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.810
 and health 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.780
 and you can see already the applications are not 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:15.150
 They deleted the ones we had installed 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.340
 so what you have to do if you have 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.810
 installed a rom cm 12 and goes to 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.549
 administer another so that it does not erase 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.310
 applications only the flag is no more 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.370
 above the previous one and do not 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.780
 nothing will happen or as I showed also go to 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.720
 configurations 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.970
 in system information read in exchange 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.590
 of those updates disappears the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.330
 update to each new be the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.060
 they install and they are also going to restart 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.100
 and not for nothing is how to install a 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.920
 normal use is the version 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:50.250

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.820

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.240
