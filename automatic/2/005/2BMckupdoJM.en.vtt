00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
was cool it's it's essentially kind of

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.649 
was cool it's it's essentially kind of
big<00:03:24.319> team<00:03:24.500> battle<00:03:24.530> right<00:03:25.430> like<00:03:25.849> I'm<00:03:25.970> huge<00:03:26.419> huge

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
big team battle right like I'm huge huge

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.990 
big team battle right like I'm huge huge
battles<00:03:27.019> between<00:03:27.169> player<00:03:28.099> versus<00:03:28.340> player<00:03:28.370> but

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
battles between player versus player but

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.319 
battles between player versus player but
in<00:03:29.329> them<00:03:30.019> is<00:03:30.260> 12<00:03:30.500> on<00:03:30.650> 12<00:03:30.769> right<00:03:31.129> I<00:03:31.400> believe<00:03:32.239> ya

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
in them is 12 on 12 right I believe ya

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.839 
in them is 12 on 12 right I believe ya
24<00:03:32.900> total<00:03:33.109> and<00:03:33.560> then<00:03:33.979> so<00:03:34.159> what<00:03:34.280> happens<00:03:34.609> is<00:03:34.819> a

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
24 total and then so what happens is a

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.149 
24 total and then so what happens is a
so<00:03:35.569> you<00:03:35.629> have<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.900> PvP<00:03:36.290> aspect<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.829> it<00:03:36.859> right

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
so you have the PvP aspect to it right

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.159 
so you have the PvP aspect to it right
and<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.849> have<00:03:38.000> your<00:03:38.180> basis<00:03:38.479> to<00:03:38.599> defend<00:03:38.900> you

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
and you have your basis to defend you

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.020 
and you have your basis to defend you
have<00:03:39.319> basically<00:03:40.189> you<00:03:40.310> can<00:03:40.459> like<00:03:40.609> their<00:03:40.849> base

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
have basically you can like their base

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.309 
have basically you can like their base
to<00:03:41.239> take<00:03:41.419> over<00:03:41.689> itself<00:03:41.810> like<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.139> and

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
to take over itself like that and

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.259 
to take over itself like that and
there's<00:03:42.439> like<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:43.459> essentially<00:03:43.849> kill<00:03:44.150> other
