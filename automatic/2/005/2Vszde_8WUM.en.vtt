00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
one problem with this is this getting a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.690 
one problem with this is this getting a
die<00:00:33.960> grinder<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:35.899> in<00:00:36.899> there<00:00:37.520> and<00:00:38.520> there's

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
die grinder in here in there and there's

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.880 
die grinder in here in there and there's
such<00:00:38.879> little<00:00:39.239> aluminum<00:00:39.989> there<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.770> know

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
such little aluminum there as you know

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.690 
such little aluminum there as you know
you<00:00:40.980> take<00:00:41.370> off<00:00:41.610> way<00:00:41.820> too<00:00:41.879> much<00:00:42.149> metal<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
you take off way too much metal and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.740 
you take off way too much metal and
unfortunately<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> die<00:00:45.090> grinder<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.570> can

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
unfortunately with a die grinder you can

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.220 
unfortunately with a die grinder you can
do<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
do that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:01:13.590 
do that
take<00:00:46.469> off<00:00:46.649> metal<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.250> do

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.130 

melt<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.380> aluminum<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:15.220> you<00:01:15.250> can<00:01:15.640> see<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
melt the aluminum and you can see the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.929 
melt the aluminum and you can see the
gas<00:01:17.410> is<00:01:17.680> getting<00:01:17.920> red-hot

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.480
