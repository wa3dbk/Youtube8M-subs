wave into the environmental variables

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.759 
wave into the environmental variables
and<00:00:10.730> then<00:00:11.509> we'll<00:00:11.690> check<00:00:11.900> the<00:00:12.110> version<00:00:12.559> as<00:00:12.740> well

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
and then we'll check the version as well

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.780 
and then we'll check the version as well
to<00:00:13.610> do<00:00:13.759> that<00:00:13.789> go<00:00:14.269> to<00:00:14.329> google<00:00:14.889> say<00:00:15.889> download
