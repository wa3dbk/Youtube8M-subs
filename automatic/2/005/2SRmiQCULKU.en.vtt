00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.629
 never because for the time being I commented 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.910
 that in Querétaro he spoke for the first time 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.460
 at a press conference ronaldinho already 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.650
 with little less than a month football 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.260
 Brazilian Mexican took stock of the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.390
 national football at the club level what 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.180
 still awaits this last third of the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.310
 season and the obligatory question so 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.740
 that was lived in its first days in 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 querétaro unfortunately those notes 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.859
 absurdities of racism 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.390
 ronaldo de assis moreira offered his 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.430
 first press conference 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.350
 querétaro after just over a month of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.690
 Workouts and games with the set 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.430
 of roosters good the child recognized that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.379
 there have been errors inside the court 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.149
 but he said that his squad is 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.430
 time to return to the path of triumph 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.589
 with the clear goal of qualifying the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.129
 liguilla and aspire to something else in the 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.790
 tournament we have some height 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.230
 parties still not to be able to be 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:04.350
 between the 82 the goal of this enter 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.200
 between the 8 and then fight to 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.500
 do something big I think it's in a 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.050
 good way we are good but bad 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:19.350
 luck not to realize the victories 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.780
 do not make mistakes sometimes and then attack 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.979
 but 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.600
 and team the wrong times like 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:34.030
 team penal fouls defense attack 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.030
 so I think that period of bad luck 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.570
 about acts of racism of which 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.060
 he was a victim upon his arrival to football 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.950
 Mexican the Brazilian star made a 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.950
 called to stop this kind of 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.950
 reprehensible situations of agreement 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.280
 I would not like to talk much because it is 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:00.490
 something that hurts all independent 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:04.650
 color race paris hopefully we do not 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.250
 continue so that soon it's over 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.789
 if we all agree that enough of 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.540
 All this 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.359
 what I want, here is the stadium 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.690
 already filled more and more than the hobby 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:22.910
 how are you going to have fun in the stadium 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.440

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.920
 do 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.340
 not my work and that's what I 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.100
 have fun and then I hope you have 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.710

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.130

 stadium and all I hope I
