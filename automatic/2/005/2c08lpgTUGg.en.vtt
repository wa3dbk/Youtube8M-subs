00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello and welcome tsum thesis 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.420
 abc tip number 21 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.760
 today we are dealing with seven 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.849
 evil writing falls in the thesis 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.260
 my name is so gerlach I am thesis 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.289
 coach since 2003 the first case is the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.789
 spring fall one always writes beautifully 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.380
 along the springs 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.080
 that is obvious but that has 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.610
 that is, you do not have your own 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.050
 analysis or much too late and you 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.680
 consumes far too much time for the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.480
 theory the tragic thing is that you 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.280
 most of the time for the theory 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.860
 used because one swell there 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 but the reviewer does it exactly 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.950
 vice versa 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.719
 The theory looks very fast 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.250
 and then he looks after the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.870
 own performance the tip is therefore one 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.719
 fine education make the content 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.910
 set and then along the springs 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.790
 to work off this inclusion trap 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.939
 number two the details fall one 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.640
 just write everything out what you look like 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.080
 then the sources can pull out 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.130
 write everything in the text 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.640
 the result is we have many details 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.200
 and it takes a lot of time 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.350
 this is also the look for the goal 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.810
 lost yourself 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.420
 the tip is again a fine turn 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.759
 with the definition of the contents and then 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.159
 the sources are specifically processed 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:41.610
 to fill the individual chapters 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.229
 case number three splitter trap man 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.909
 Write a partial chapter here 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.790
 other country leaves gaps 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.549
 So you write according to the motto I am 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.430
 think that can not write and that 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.979
 Other searches I later the result is 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.000
 the overview is lost and that 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.100
 the unfinished that also gnaws because one has 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.840
 of course, the task of a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.000
 to bring one's own performance and at the end 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.450
 then the time is missing 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.849
 much in between again the tip of 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.440
 same tip make a fine the drum 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.350
 set the content 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.400
 associating sources and social inclusion 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.940
 to work out the trap number four is the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.370
 enlightenment ssf all you hope for 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.240
 intense employment finally 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.280
 Clarity comes the risk is that one 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.650
 that she comes too late the enlightenment 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.040
 one deals intensively with the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.810
 foundations and tries to get in 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.150
 but works too little towards the goal 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.750
 the tip is from the end think that 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.580
 is called the and capital at the beginning 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.760
 already consider yourself asking something 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.960
 get in there and then answer 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.930
 seek and do not wait for enlightenment 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.460
 under questions help and the iv 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.040
 inclusion with the determination of 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.930
 contents and then the execution of the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.880
 the reworking trap is the source 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.950
 already packed a lot one writes 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.660
 laboriously a first chapter and 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.239
 overhauled it over and over again 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.770
 I've heard that so many times before 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.239
 five pages written yes but that is 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.920
 not yet I'm not satisfied yet 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.560
 that's not finished yet I have to 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.080
 rework the episode is a 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.940
 congestion and loss of time 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.209
 one deals too much for too long 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.820
 The basics will be those of the reviewers 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.190
 barely a glance is left over by the leaves 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.970
 Much faster than you 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.370
 your guess is this is your guess 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.080
 leave chapter and only after the 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.480
 touch again next chapter and 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:54.690
 better even after the next one 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.430
 chatter the 123 trap one busy 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.400
 first with chapter one then only 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.890
 with chapter 2 and so on the episode 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.510
 is that the basics chapter too many 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.000
 One has time loss and one side 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.410
 gaining new insights only until 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.730
 if you chap with these 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.350
 busy in that around the 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.090
 own performance goes and that is much too 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.400
 late 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.519
 you do not have a clear goal then 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.260
 you just work with the sources of the 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.090
 first chapter she writes one after the other 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:31.680
 Of course, that's good, though 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:35.270
 You end up in time pressure because you 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.850
 for the own performance has too little time 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.070
 important is again let a foe 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:46.140
 with definition of contents and then the 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.090
 work off sources and helps 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.430
 Targeted reading and analysis 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.770
 so everyone is practically chatting at first 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.110
 chapters by sections to all chapters 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.200
 think what comes in there to all 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.390
 chapters search the sources or just 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.120
 consider how to do it yourself 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.900
 I come to my knowledge and 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:11.099
 then you get away from this trap 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.229
 that one stops to find now the 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:16.349
 no more glass falls that it a whole 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.479
 very dangerous trap one waits a lot 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.849
 too long with the omission of content 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.419
 and makes it first and the time pressure completely 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:27.270
 at the end if you are forced if the 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:33.660
 deadline threatens then one is 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:35.400
 suddenly ready 20 30 40 or even 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.940
 even more easy to leave out 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.900
 the consequence one must omit drastically 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.970
 that means uncontrolled and under duress 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.479
 because you do not have the material if you 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.070
 there's no time for that, of course 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.800
 sources of error 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.479
 this also ensures that the content 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.760
 Be unbalanced because you are quite sure 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.590
 at the end leaves where you own 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.660
 to bring performance 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:05.250
 one brings much less own achievements 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.599
 the pity of the quality and it is yes 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.370
 also often so that you start 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.630
 I promised I was going to leave the the 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.500
 analyze and that's that 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.270
 find out 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.860
 and in the end they will promise 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.539
 not redeemed that also leads to that 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.750
 If the introduction revise again 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.539
 got to 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.950
 and in the end there is a very bad one 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:25.160
 congestion shortly before the levy because yes 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:28.260
 again have to balance out the text 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.930
 you have to balance so much on 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.970
 Started on and said on it 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.449
 we come back and then we do it 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.670
 Not 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:39.050
 and that gives bad grades 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:42.420
 These off let's diet can easily fall 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.010
 so on again a fine guido with firm 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.650
 living content and sources 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.800
 the emphasis is on fixing the 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.930
 I lay down in the beginning what I can do 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.730
 I can do what I can do there 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.660
 what can I put in there 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:01.560
 and not just a week before the delivery 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:04.040
 because I did not manage how can 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.050
 to help the thesis abc 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.790
 We have examples and examples 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.190
 templates for the fine songs 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.770
 we write technique with which one 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.320
 five pages a day can write with it 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:19.080
 you also write the write fall 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.270
 escape and we have a write 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.660
 template as a style with it 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:27.570
 You can be a lot worse at 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:33.210
 format save that this abc gives 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:37.410
 it also www.pwc.de my name is like that 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:39.870
 I like to be a thesis coach since 2003 and 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:43.400
 wish you much success in your 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.400
 to write the thesis
