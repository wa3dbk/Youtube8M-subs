the pieces are original because or to be
to<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.500> era<00:01:05.679> of<00:01:05.860> 1965<00:01:06.759> to<00:01:07.440> late<00:01:08.440> 60s<00:01:09.009> and<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.840> had

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
to the era of 1965 to late 60s and I had

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.080 
to the era of 1965 to late 60s and I had
hard<00:01:11.860> time<00:01:12.039> putting<00:01:12.310> them<00:01:12.490> together<00:01:12.610> in<00:01:12.910> fact

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
hard time putting them together in fact

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.609 
hard time putting them together in fact
I<00:01:13.240> can<00:01:13.420> see<00:01:13.450> part<00:01:13.869> of<00:01:13.929> it<00:01:14.080> started<00:01:14.470> working

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
I can see part of it started working

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.400 
I can see part of it started working
itself<00:01:15.130> apart<00:01:15.459> back<00:01:15.729> here<00:01:15.940> in<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.119> back<00:01:16.410> they

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
itself apart back here in the back they

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.249 
itself apart back here in the back they
either<00:01:17.619> don't<00:01:18.190> stick<00:01:18.550> good<00:01:18.789> enough<00:01:19.090> or<00:01:19.750> they

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
either don't stick good enough or they

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.830 
either don't stick good enough or they
stick<00:01:20.500> too<00:01:20.649> tight<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:22.390> some<00:01:22.660> of<00:01:22.750> these

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
stick too tight because some of these

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.529 
stick too tight because some of these
parts<00:01:23.200> are<00:01:23.380> cellulose<00:01:23.979> acetate<00:01:24.220> which<00:01:24.880> did

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
parts are cellulose acetate which did

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.889 
parts are cellulose acetate which did
not<00:01:25.690> have<00:01:26.349> lasting<00:01:27.009> clutch<00:01:27.250> power<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:28.630> did<00:01:28.780> not

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
not have lasting clutch power it did not

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.339 
not have lasting clutch power it did not
hold<00:01:29.170> its<00:01:29.349> shape<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.780> classic

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:32.349 
hold its shape but this is a classic

Lego<00:01:32.860> set<00:01:33.220> it's<00:01:33.520> vintage<00:01:33.849> Lego<00:01:34.479> it's<00:01:35.200> what<00:01:35.500> I

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
Lego set it's vintage Lego it's what I

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.999 
Lego set it's vintage Lego it's what I
love<00:01:36.399> to<00:01:36.459> feature<00:01:36.849> on<00:01:37.179> my<00:01:37.330> channel<00:01:37.830> because<00:01:38.830> it

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
love to feature on my channel because it

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.249 
love to feature on my channel because it
uses<00:01:39.220> standard<00:01:39.550> bricks<00:01:40.179> and<00:01:40.390> plates<00:01:40.420> pretty

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
uses standard bricks and plates pretty

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.330 
uses standard bricks and plates pretty
much<00:01:41.440> except<00:01:42.220> for<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.489> wheel<00:01:42.700> holder

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
much except for the wheel holder

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.400 
much except for the wheel holder
everything<00:01:45.340> in<00:01:45.489> here<00:01:45.789> is<00:01:45.819> stuff<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:47.020> can

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
everything in here is stuff that you can

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.309 
everything in here is stuff that you can
use<00:01:47.590> modern<00:01:48.099> equivalents<00:01:48.880> today<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:50.050> you

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
use modern equivalents today and you

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.740 
use modern equivalents today and you
could<00:01:50.440> probably<00:01:50.530> make<00:01:50.800> an<00:01:50.920> adaptation<00:01:51.569> to<00:01:52.569> use

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
could probably make an adaptation to use

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.999 
could probably make an adaptation to use
the<00:01:52.929> wheel<00:01:53.080> holder<00:01:53.440> that<00:01:53.619> this<00:01:53.800> is<00:01:53.890> the

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
the wheel holder that this is the

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.070 
the wheel holder that this is the
propellers<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.819> the<00:01:55.479> wheels<00:01:55.660> on<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.929> bottom

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
propellers and the wheels on the bottom

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.469 
propellers and the wheels on the bottom
you<00:01:56.890> probably<00:01:57.190> just<00:01:57.340> make<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:57.610> modern

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
you probably just make a modern

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.880 
you probably just make a modern
adaptation<00:01:59.319> of<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.590> but<00:02:00.580> this<00:02:01.509> is

about<00:02:52.860> them<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.610> never<00:02:54.090> could<00:02:54.330> find<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660

about them and I never could find the
minifigure<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.489> I've<00:02:56.489> decided<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:56.970> go

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
minifigure and I've decided to go

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.240 
minifigure and I've decided to go
through<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.660> get<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> pieces<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:58.980> set

so what I did is I printed out the parts
list<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.350> don't<00:03:04.500> have<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.709> print<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.010> out

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100

it's Pat pending I think you can see
that<00:04:08.180> pending<00:04:09.180> so<00:04:10.109> these<00:04:10.200> are<00:04:10.380> all<00:04:10.500> old<00:04:11.160> pieces

and I had a hard time getting some of
them<00:04:13.200> stick<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.739> don't<00:04:13.769> know<00:04:14.010> if<00:04:14.099> you<00:04:14.190> can<00:04:14.370> see

of<00:04:34.060> focus<00:04:34.270> here<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:35.590> 2x4<00:04:36.189> brick<00:04:36.719> that's<00:04:37.719> trans

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
of focus here the 2x4 brick that's trans

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.920 
of focus here the 2x4 brick that's trans
clear<00:04:38.889> there<00:04:39.189> this<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.389> one<00:04:40.539> I<00:04:40.569> tried

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
clear there this is the one I tried

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.459 
clear there this is the one I tried
sticking<00:04:41.349> on<00:04:41.469> there<00:04:41.620> first<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.780> this<00:04:43.960> this

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:44.469 
sticking on there first and this this

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.520 
sticking on there first and this this
brick<00:04:45.069> here<00:04:45.340> is<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.699> same<00:04:46.169> type<00:04:47.169> of<00:04:47.199> brick

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
brick here is the same type of brick

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.309 
brick here is the same type of brick
brick<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.909> pet<00:04:49.090> pending<00:04:49.629> but<00:04:49.930> if<00:04:50.080> this

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
brick that the pet pending but if this

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.679 
brick that the pet pending but if this
one<00:04:50.560> was<00:04:50.710> so<00:04:50.919> warped<00:04:51.219> it<00:04:51.669> would<00:04:51.819> not<00:04:51.969> work<00:04:52.000> I

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:52.689 
one was so warped it would not work I

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.110 
one was so warped it would not work I
could<00:04:53.319> not<00:04:53.529> get<00:04:53.740> it<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:54.159> connect<00:04:54.639> and<00:04:54.819> this<00:04:54.939> one

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
could not get it to connect and this one

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.029 
could not get it to connect and this one
even<00:04:55.240> I<00:04:55.629> forced<00:04:56.349> it<00:04:56.439> on<00:04:56.590> there<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:56.889> there's

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
even I forced it on there and there's

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:58.980 
even I forced it on there and there's
still<00:04:57.219> a<00:04:57.279> little<00:04:57.550> gap<00:04:57.729> that's<00:04:58.569> the<00:04:58.750> problem

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
still a little gap that's the problem

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.540 
still a little gap that's the problem
you<00:04:59.169> run<00:04:59.289> into<00:04:59.349> with<00:04:59.889> some<00:05:00.099> of<00:05:00.189> these<00:05:00.279> vintage

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
you run into with some of these vintage

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.219 
you run into with some of these vintage
parts<00:05:01.539> but<00:05:02.409> I<00:05:02.469> was<00:05:02.620> really<00:05:02.830> happy<00:05:03.099> to<00:05:03.340> have<00:05:04.229> all

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
parts but I was really happy to have all

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.879 
parts but I was really happy to have all
but<00:05:05.620> five<00:05:06.310> of<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:06.550> pieces<00:05:06.789> which<00:05:07.300> was<00:05:07.689> I<00:05:08.409> was

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
but five of the pieces which was I was

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.839 
but five of the pieces which was I was
missing<00:05:09.219> a<00:05:09.279> couple<00:05:09.400> plates<00:05:09.819> and<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:15.159> was

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
missing a couple plates and the I was

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.950 
missing a couple plates and the I was
missing<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.210> couple<00:05:16.509> of<00:05:16.599> 1<00:05:17.020> by<00:05:17.169> 2<00:05:17.229> grey<00:05:17.590> plates

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
missing a couple of 1 by 2 grey plates

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.689 
missing a couple of 1 by 2 grey plates
kind<00:05:19.960> of<00:05:20.050> remember<00:05:20.379> which<00:05:20.589> shows<00:05:20.889> of<00:05:21.039> what

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
kind of remember which shows of what

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.459 
kind of remember which shows of what
pieces<00:05:21.940> were<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.449> were<00:05:22.569> missing<00:05:22.870> I<00:05:23.169> think<00:05:23.379> it

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
pieces were that were missing I think it

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.529 
pieces were that were missing I think it
was<00:05:23.589> some<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.919> red<00:05:24.099> oh<00:05:24.490> the<00:05:24.909> black<00:05:25.120> a

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
was some of the red oh the black a

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.540 
was some of the red oh the black a
couple<00:05:25.960> of<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.110> black<00:05:26.229> plates<00:05:26.650> a<00:05:26.949> couple<00:05:27.430> the

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
couple of the black plates a couple the

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.399 
couple of the black plates a couple the
gray<00:05:28.180> place<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.539> I<00:05:28.569> think<00:05:28.629> one<00:05:28.930> white<00:05:29.110> plate

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
gray place and I think one white plate

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.519 
gray place and I think one white plate
so<00:05:29.800> it's<00:05:30.159> really<00:05:30.400> simple<00:05:30.639> to<00:05:30.879> replace<00:05:31.379> now<00:05:32.379> let

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:32.529 
so it's really simple to replace now let

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:34.969 
so it's really simple to replace now let
me<00:05:32.589> show<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:33.039> vintage<00:05:33.400> instructions

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
me show you the vintage instructions

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.670 
me show you the vintage instructions
this<00:05:35.979> is<00:05:36.419> step<00:05:37.419> by<00:05:37.690> step<00:05:38.050> instructions<00:05:38.589> look

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
this is step by step instructions look

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.339 
this is step by step instructions look
at<00:05:38.770> step<00:05:39.009> one<00:05:39.279> they<00:05:39.430> get<00:05:39.550> all<00:05:39.669> that<00:05:39.789> in<00:05:39.940> there

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.570 

like<00:05:44.349> halfway<00:05:44.589> done<00:05:44.770> by<00:05:45.189> the<00:05:45.250> time<00:05:45.339> you<00:05:45.460> do

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
like halfway done by the time you do

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.760 
like halfway done by the time you do
step<00:05:45.819> one<00:05:46.029> it<00:05:46.180> seems<00:05:46.419> like<00:05:46.659> they<00:05:47.169> just<00:05:47.379> you<00:05:47.650> got

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
step one it seems like they just you got

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.860 
step one it seems like they just you got
to<00:05:47.889> really<00:05:48.009> watch<00:05:48.250> the<00:05:48.580> lines<00:05:48.819> and<00:05:49.599> everything

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
to really watch the lines and everything

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.540 
to really watch the lines and everything
there<00:05:51.930> this<00:05:52.930> is<00:05:53.110> one<00:05:53.349> again<00:05:54.129> like<00:05:54.310> I<00:05:54.339> said

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
there this is one again like I said

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.879 
there this is one again like I said
earlier<00:05:54.610> could<00:05:55.060> easily<00:05:55.210> be<00:05:55.539> made<00:05:55.779> from<00:05:56.319> modern

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
earlier could easily be made from modern

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.409 
earlier could easily be made from modern
pieces<00:05:57.159> that<00:05:57.430> took<00:05:57.639> for<00:05:57.819> the<00:05:57.879> wheels<00:05:58.060> and<00:05:58.330> the

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
pieces that took for the wheels and the

00:05:58.419 --> 00:05:59.629 
pieces that took for the wheels and the
wheel<00:05:58.539> holders<00:05:58.900> when<00:05:59.050> we<00:05:59.169> could<00:05:59.349> use

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
wheel holders when we could use

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.860 
wheel holders when we could use
adaptations<00:06:00.639> over<00:06:00.879> and<00:06:01.180> then<00:06:01.449> it<00:06:01.539> gives<00:06:01.659> you

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
adaptations over and then it gives you

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.480 
adaptations over and then it gives you
other<00:06:02.050> models<00:06:02.500> that<00:06:02.560> can<00:06:02.800> be<00:06:02.830> built<00:06:03.159> with<00:06:03.370> this

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
other models that can be built with this

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.920 
other models that can be built with this
sit<00:06:05.189> which<00:06:06.189> leads<00:06:06.430> me<00:06:06.580> to<00:06:06.610> wonder<00:06:06.870> did<00:06:07.870> they

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
sit which leads me to wonder did they

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.570 
sit which leads me to wonder did they
strain<00:06:08.589> come<00:06:08.919> with<00:06:09.039> this<00:06:09.159> sitting<00:06:09.430> in<00:06:09.520> the

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
strain come with this sitting in the

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.659 
strain come with this sitting in the
inventory<00:06:09.870> own<00:06:10.870> brick<00:06:11.710> link<00:06:11.979> it's<00:06:12.219> based<00:06:12.460> on

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
inventory own brick link it's based on

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.439 
inventory own brick link it's based on
building<00:06:12.879> the<00:06:13.150> main<00:06:13.330> model<00:06:13.830> but<00:06:15.150> they<00:06:16.150> show<00:06:16.419> a

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
building the main model but they show a

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.850 
building the main model but they show a
strain<00:06:16.960> here<00:06:17.379> on<00:06:17.620> this<00:06:17.949> windmill<00:06:18.900> so<00:06:19.900> and

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
strain here on this windmill so and

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.100 
strain here on this windmill so and
here's<00:06:21.819> another<00:06:21.939> one<00:06:22.300> it<00:06:22.539> could<00:06:22.719> be<00:06:22.779> a<00:06:22.900> rubber

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
here's another one it could be a rubber

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.149 
here's another one it could be a rubber
band<00:06:23.580> so<00:06:24.580> I'm<00:06:24.639> wondering<00:06:25.149> if<00:06:26.110> it<00:06:26.380> came

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
band so I'm wondering if it came

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.869 
band so I'm wondering if it came
with<00:06:27.399> a<00:06:27.429> string<00:06:28.949> don't<00:06:29.949> know<00:06:30.129> it<00:06:30.309> never<00:06:30.429> opened

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:30.879 
with a string don't know it never opened

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:33.479 
with a string don't know it never opened
up<00:06:30.999> the<00:06:31.149> sealed<00:06:31.389> one<00:06:31.659> and<00:06:32.259> unlikely<00:06:33.189> there

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:33.489 
up the sealed one and unlikely there

00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:45.379 
up the sealed one and unlikely there
ever<00:06:33.669> would<00:06:33.939> see<00:06:34.149> one<00:06:34.619> here's<00:06:35.619> the<00:06:35.679> box

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.779 

on<00:06:45.960> the<00:06:46.080> back<00:06:46.259> it<00:06:46.470> shows<00:06:46.500> the<00:06:47.039> other<00:06:47.129> suggested

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789 
on the back it shows the other suggested

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.270 
on the back it shows the other suggested
models<00:06:48.210> maybe<00:06:49.169> that<00:06:49.379> wasn't<00:06:49.590> a<00:06:49.770> string<00:06:50.069> looks

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
models maybe that wasn't a string looks

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
a rubber band so that probably does not

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.459 
a rubber band so that probably does not

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569 
is really worn out but could open it up

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:05.330 
is really worn out but could open it up
slide<00:07:03.840> it<00:07:03.960> open<00:07:04.080> like<00:07:04.349> this<00:07:04.620> this<00:07:04.830> is<00:07:05.009> the<00:07:05.189> way

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
slide it open like this this is the way

a<00:07:05.370> lot<00:07:05.580> of<00:07:05.610> the<00:07:05.789> boxes<00:07:05.969> were<00:07:06.719> there<00:07:07.530> in<00:07:07.770> the

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
a lot of the boxes were there in the

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.909 
a lot of the boxes were there in the
seasons<00:07:08.280> so<00:07:08.610> there<00:07:09.330> you<00:07:09.479> go<00:07:09.689> the<00:07:10.650> vintage<00:07:10.979> sit

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:18.659 
it's at 320 the two engine lane if it

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:20.959 
it's at 320 the two engine lane if it
looks<00:07:18.870> familiar<00:07:19.139> I<00:07:19.560> think<00:07:19.800> that<00:07:20.280> Lego<00:07:20.759> and

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:20.969 
looks familiar I think that Lego and

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:23.779 
looks familiar I think that Lego and
some<00:07:21.150> of<00:07:21.270> their<00:07:21.830> creator<00:07:22.830> sets<00:07:23.219> I<00:07:23.520> think<00:07:23.699> they

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:23.789 
some of their creator sets I think they

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:25.520 
some of their creator sets I think they
kind<00:07:23.969> of<00:07:24.090> do<00:07:24.210> throwbacks<00:07:24.659> to<00:07:24.810> some<00:07:25.349> of<00:07:25.469> the

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530 
kind of do throwbacks to some of the

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.520 
kind of do throwbacks to some of the
early<00:07:25.800> models<00:07:26.360> they<00:07:27.360> look<00:07:27.389> very<00:07:27.629> similar<00:07:27.930> in

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530 
early models they look very similar in

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.450 
early models they look very similar in
style<00:07:29.360> just<00:07:30.360> wood<00:07:30.539> updated<00:07:31.020> pieces<00:07:31.409> and<00:07:32.310> I

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 
style just wood updated pieces and I

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.100 
style just wood updated pieces and I
think<00:07:32.699> one<00:07:32.849> of<00:07:32.879> the<00:07:33.060> creator<00:07:33.419> sets<00:07:33.780> had<00:07:33.990> an

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
think one of the creator sets had an

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.950 
think one of the creator sets had an
airplane<00:07:34.409> twin-engine<00:07:34.949> airplane<00:07:35.580> similar<00:07:36.449> to

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 
airplane twin-engine airplane similar to

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.390 
airplane twin-engine airplane similar to
this<00:07:37.139> different<00:07:37.680> colors<00:07:39.229> anyway<00:07:40.229> that's<00:07:41.129> the
