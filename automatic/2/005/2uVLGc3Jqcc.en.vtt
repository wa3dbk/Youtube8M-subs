here<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.040> an<00:00:02.190> iPhone<00:00:02.550> 5<00:00:02.970> that's<00:00:03.270> been<00:00:03.419> sent<00:00:03.720> to

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
here is an iPhone 5 that's been sent to

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.289 
here is an iPhone 5 that's been sent to
us<00:00:03.929> for<00:00:04.370> what<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.460> think<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.670> about<00:00:05.759> Lightroom

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
us for what we think is about Lightroom

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.750 
us for what we think is about Lightroom
and<00:00:06.420> it<00:00:06.720> has<00:00:07.140> software<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.280> liquid<00:00:08.580> damage

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
and it has software the liquid damage

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.850 
and it has software the liquid damage
the<00:00:09.540> screen<00:00:09.719> has<00:00:09.900> been<00:00:09.929> replaced<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.769> the

now if we connect power ok I hope you
hated<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.359> charge<00:00:21.630> time<00:00:22.020> now<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:24.119> yeah<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
hated the charge time now so yeah it is

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.109 
hated the charge time now so yeah it is
switch<00:00:24.779> done<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.529> nothing<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.430> screen<00:00:26.849> oh

switch done but nothing on the screen oh
you<00:00:27.180> can't<00:00:27.570> see<00:00:27.840> what's<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:29.039> just

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you can't see what's there it's just

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.279 
you can't see what's there it's just
incredibly<00:00:30.029> dark<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.689> can't<00:00:30.900> really<00:00:31.109> pick

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
incredibly dark and we can't really pick

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.620 
incredibly dark and we can't really pick
it<00:00:31.320> up<00:00:31.529> over<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> movie<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:33.420> going

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
it up over the movie so what I'm going

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.569 
it up over the movie so what I'm going
to<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> squish<00:00:35.010> stuff<00:00:35.250> we'll<00:00:35.430> get

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
to do is going to squish stuff we'll get

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.190 
to do is going to squish stuff we'll get
inside<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.180> see<00:00:36.360> what's<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.930> what

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
inside it to see what's going on what

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.459 
inside it to see what's going on what
we're<00:00:37.320> looking<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.930> area

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
we're looking at here then is the area

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.220 
we're looking at here then is the area
that<00:00:40.530> I'm<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.610> working<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.120> now<00:00:42.930> what

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
that I'm going to be working in now what

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.160 
that I'm going to be working in now what
I've<00:00:43.770> found<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> component<00:00:47.480> just<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
I've found is a component just here that

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.360 
I've found is a component just here that
I<00:00:49.410> think<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:50.449> blown<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.629> burnt<00:00:51.840> out<00:00:52.280> there's<00:00:53.280> no

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
I think is blown is burnt out there's no

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670 
I think is blown is burnt out there's no
continuity<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.120> I'm<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
continuity to it I'm not one of the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
continuity to it I'm not one of the
components<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> backlight<00:00:57.000> relies<00:00:57.300> on

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
components that the backlight relies on

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.729 
components that the backlight relies on
to<00:00:57.660> work<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.309> thing<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.789> led<00:00:59.910> me<00:01:00.059> here

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
to work and the thing that led me here

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.429 
to work and the thing that led me here
was<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.960> that's<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.229> very

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
was that there is a that's on a very

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160 
was that there is a that's on a very
specifically<00:01:04.979> shaped<00:01:05.339> sticker<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.810> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
specifically shaped sticker that so that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.679 
specifically shaped sticker that so that
would<00:01:07.320> protect<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.830> off<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.220> put<00:01:08.460> here

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
would protect it off and just put here

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.020 
would protect it off and just put here
that<00:01:09.689> normally<00:01:10.500> covers<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.189> area<00:01:11.670> sunny<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that normally covers this area sunny you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.499 
that normally covers this area sunny you
can<00:01:12.180> only<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.970> connectors<00:01:14.970> themselves

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
can only see the connectors themselves

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.539 
can only see the connectors themselves
one<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.439> taken<00:01:16.740> off<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.040> reveals<00:01:17.340> all

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
one that's taken off it reveals all

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.270 
one that's taken off it reveals all
these<00:01:17.850> components<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.830> there<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.950> actually

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
these components here there was actually

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.490 
these components here there was actually
one<00:01:20.310> part<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.540> burnt<00:01:21.840> out<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
one part of it that was burnt out so I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.770 
one part of it that was burnt out so I
think<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> lot<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.490> heat<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.970> affected

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
think like a lot of heat and affected

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.390 
think like a lot of heat and affected
the<00:01:24.869> component<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.590> sort<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.799> burned<00:01:26.040> through

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the component and sort of burned through

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.690 
the component and sort of burned through
the<00:01:26.640> plastic<00:01:27.360> covering<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> that's<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.490> me

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the plastic covering so that's like me

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
the plastic covering so that's like me
to<00:01:30.060> test<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.020> we've<00:01:31.409> seen<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.890> not

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to test that we've seen that it's not

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.679 
to test that we've seen that it's not
working<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.640> could<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.270> component

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
working so it could be that component

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.480 
working so it could be that component
that<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.710> needs<00:01:34.860> replacing

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that just needs replacing

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.460 
that just needs replacing
hopefully<00:01:36.210> sold<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
hopefully sold it in this I'm going to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.310 
hopefully sold it in this I'm going to
desolder<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:39.689> sold<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.140> new

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
desolder that and then sold a new

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.050 
desolder that and then sold a new
component<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.130> component<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.790> off

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
component I think that component is off

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.639 
component I think that component is off
now<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.509> being<00:01:42.659> dissolved<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> hope<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
now it's being dissolved and I hope you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.660 
now it's being dissolved and I hope you
can<00:01:43.770> see<00:01:44.159> these<00:01:44.479> two<00:01:45.479> kind<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.470> shiny<00:01:46.770> solder

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
can see these two kind of shiny solder

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.330 
can see these two kind of shiny solder
pads<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.100> component<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.189> on

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
pads there that the component was on

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.539 
pads there that the component was on
we've<00:01:51.210> D<00:01:51.450> Sol<00:01:51.720> didn't<00:01:52.020> know<00:01:52.079> obviously<00:01:52.549> they

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
we've D Sol didn't know obviously they
