questions about what it is it's a simple
square<00:00:35.180> like<00:00:36.180> such<00:00:37.700> you're<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.090> cut<00:00:39.300> it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
square like such you're going to cut it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.520 
square like such you're going to cut it
into<00:00:39.980> four<00:00:40.980> parts<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.850> I'll<00:00:42.000> show<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.270> why

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
into four parts and I'll show you why

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.600 
into four parts and I'll show you why
and<00:00:43.530> let's<00:00:44.430> say<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:45.629> want<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.370> blue

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and let's say we want to know if a blue

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.819 
and let's say we want to know if a blue
check<00:00:48.210> paired<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> blue<00:00:49.260> bar<00:00:49.500> hand

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
check paired to a blue bar hand

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.600 
check paired to a blue bar hand
what<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.820> possible<00:00:51.539> combinations<00:00:52.260> are<00:00:52.610> so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
what the possible combinations are so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.720 
what the possible combinations are so
right<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> very<00:00:55.079> top<00:00:55.440> here<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:56.070> where

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
right up at the very top here is where

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.540 
right up at the very top here is where
you<00:00:57.090> put<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.690> male<00:00:57.870> line<00:00:58.199> or<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.309> dominant

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you put the male line or the dominant

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.710 
you put the male line or the dominant
trait<00:01:00.350> now<00:01:01.350> let's<00:01:01.620> say<00:01:01.890> our<00:01:05.119> blue<00:01:06.119> check

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
trait now let's say our blue check

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.590 
trait now let's say our blue check
is<00:01:09.799> dominant<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.580> don't<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.180> for<00:01:12.240> sure

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
is dominant we don't know this for sure

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.499 
is dominant we don't know this for sure
but<00:01:12.900> we're<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> make<00:01:13.710> an<00:01:13.890> assumption<00:01:14.509> so

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
but we're going to make an assumption so

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.230 
but we're going to make an assumption so
I'm<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> use<00:01:17.390> big<00:01:18.390> bees<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:20.700> represent

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I'm going to use big bees to represent

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.920 
I'm going to use big bees to represent
the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.620 

blue<00:01:28.930> check<00:01:29.580> on<00:01:30.580> this<00:01:30.790> side<00:01:31.060> we're<00:01:31.390> going<00:01:31.510> to

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
blue check on this side we're going to

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.240 
blue check on this side we're going to
use<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.409> Hin<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:37.270> believe<00:01:37.630> her<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:38.050> be

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
use for the Hin and we believe her to be

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.630 
use for the Hin and we believe her to be
recessive<00:01:40.500> now<00:01:41.500> we<00:01:41.560> don't<00:01:41.740> know<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:42.280> but

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
recessive now we don't know this but

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.200 
recessive now we don't know this but
we're<00:01:42.930> theorizing<00:01:43.930> it

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.200 

she<00:01:49.210> is<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.540> blue<00:01:50.050> bar<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.530> what<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.640> do<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:55.090> you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
she is a blue bar so what you do is you

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.410 
she is a blue bar so what you do is you
take<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.770> very<00:01:56.770> top<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.280> take<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.700> dominant

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
take the very top you take the dominant

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.779 
take the very top you take the dominant
gene<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.710> bring<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.070> down<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.930> do<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.289> again

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
gene you bring it down you do that again

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.820 
gene you bring it down you do that again
bring<00:02:03.789> it<00:02:03.880> down

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
bring it down

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.999 
bring it down
follow<00:02:05.830> this<00:02:06.130> again<00:02:06.490> bring<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.119> down<00:02:07.920> bring<00:02:08.920> it

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
follow this again bring it down bring it

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.810 
follow this again bring it down bring it
down<00:02:09.390> now<00:02:10.390> we<00:02:10.450> take<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.929> inside<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:12.090> add<00:02:13.090> it

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
down now we take the inside and add it

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.990 
down now we take the inside and add it
all<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.120> way<00:02:16.180> across<00:02:17.010> now<00:02:18.010> what<00:02:18.250> we<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.430> here

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
all the way across now what we have here

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.370 
all the way across now what we have here
is<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:20.320> instead<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.890> having<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.930> purebred<00:02:22.930> blue

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
is is instead of having a purebred blue

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.080 
is is instead of having a purebred blue
check<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:25.150> purebred<00:02:25.630> blue<00:02:26.470> power<00:02:26.739> hen

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
check and a purebred blue power hen

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:39.850 
check and a purebred blue power hen
we<00:02:28.090> now<00:02:28.300> have<00:02:28.600> four<00:02:31.530> four<00:02:33.150> blue<00:02:34.150> check<00:02:34.590> pigeons

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.340 

every<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.070> these<00:02:41.310> birds<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:42.240> split<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:43.320> a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
every one of these birds is split for a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.910 
every one of these birds is split for a
blue<00:02:43.500> bar<00:02:43.740> although<00:02:44.580> they<00:02:45.570> will<00:02:45.780> look<00:02:46.110> blue

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
blue bar although they will look blue

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.610 
blue bar although they will look blue
check<00:02:49.160> now<00:02:50.160> let's<00:02:50.400> take<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.180> pair<00:02:51.630> let's<00:02:52.230> do

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
check now let's take a pair let's do

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.460 
check now let's take a pair let's do
another<00:02:52.740> square<00:02:58.760> okay

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
another square okay

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.190 
another square okay
and<00:03:01.470> let's<00:03:01.680> say<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:02.090> take<00:03:03.090> one<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.510> these<00:03:05.030> birds

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
and let's say we take one of these birds

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.890 
and let's say we take one of these birds
and<00:03:08.240> we<00:03:09.240> are<00:03:09.450> going<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:11.480> put<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.660> particular

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
and we are going to put this particular

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.060 
and we are going to put this particular
bird<00:03:13.500> up<00:03:13.740> so<00:03:14.459> Big<00:03:14.700> B<00:03:14.880> little<00:03:15.150> B<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.140> we're

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
bird up so Big B little B and we're

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.140 
bird up so Big B little B and we're
going<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.430> pair<00:03:17.820> this<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.750> known<00:03:20.480> blue<00:03:21.480> bar

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
going to pair this to a known blue bar

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.770 
going to pair this to a known blue bar
so<00:03:24.150> again<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:24.630> bring<00:03:24.900> down<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.320> Big<00:03:25.650> B<00:03:26.780> now

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
so again we bring down the Big B now

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.490 
so again we bring down the Big B now
we're<00:03:27.990> bringing<00:03:28.140> down<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.650> little<00:03:28.950> B<00:03:30.500> we

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
we're bringing down the little B we

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.010 
we're bringing down the little B we
bring<00:03:31.800> over<00:03:31.980> these<00:03:35.060> now<00:03:36.060> what<00:03:36.270> we<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.450> here

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
bring over these now what we have here

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.160 
bring over these now what we have here
is<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.620> we<00:03:37.950> have<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:39.290> split<00:03:40.640> blue<00:03:41.640> check<00:03:42.020> we<00:03:43.020> have

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
is is we have a split blue check we have

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.729 
is is we have a split blue check we have
a<00:03:43.200> pure<00:03:43.680> blue<00:03:44.310> bar<00:03:44.989> split<00:03:45.989> blue<00:03:46.200> check<00:03:46.500> and

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
a pure blue bar split blue check and

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.680 
a pure blue bar split blue check and
pure<00:03:47.100> blue<00:03:47.340> bar<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:48.390> we<00:03:48.570> get<00:03:48.780> two<00:03:50.780> blue<00:03:51.780> checks

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
pure blue bar so we get two blue checks

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:04.509 
pure blue bar so we get two blue checks
split<00:03:56.239> for<00:03:58.940> blue<00:03:59.940> bar<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.720> we<00:04:00.900> get<00:04:01.110> two<00:04:01.580> pure

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
split for blue bar and we get two pure

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:12.289 
split for blue bar and we get two pure
blue<00:04:05.519> bars<00:04:07.730> so<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.570> possible<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:10.440> get<00:04:11.299> blue

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
blue bars so is it possible to get blue

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.300 
blue bars so is it possible to get blue
bars<00:04:13.160> out<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:15.140> blue<00:04:16.140> check<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.160> blue

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
bars out of a blue check and a blue

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.140 
bars out of a blue check and a blue
bar<00:04:17.549> hen<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:19.109> only<00:04:19.530> way<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:19.830> as<00:04:20.729> if<00:04:20.970> the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
bar hen the only way it is as if the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.560 
bar hen the only way it is as if the
 is<00:04:22.169> split<00:04:22.620> for<00:04:22.860> blue<00:04:23.010> bar<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:24.360> hand

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
 is split for blue bar and the hand

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.700 
 is split for blue bar and the hand
is<00:04:24.870> pure<00:04:25.260> for<00:04:26.220> blue<00:04:26.400> bar<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:28.290> is<00:04:28.500> how<00:04:28.650> you

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
is pure for blue bar and that is how you

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.330 
is pure for blue bar and that is how you
set<00:04:29.130> up<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.400> simple<00:04:29.810> punnett<00:04:30.810> square<00:04:31.140> and<00:04:31.440> you

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
set up a simple punnett square and you

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.690 
set up a simple punnett square and you
can<00:04:32.610> do<00:04:32.850> this<00:04:33.120> with<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.720> variety<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:35.130> genetic

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
can do this with a variety of genetic

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.950 
can do this with a variety of genetic
issues<00:04:36.390> and<00:04:36.690> come<00:04:37.560> up<00:04:37.710> with<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.070> probability

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
issues and come up with the probability

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.430 
issues and come up with the probability
now<00:04:39.960> I'd<00:04:40.140> caution<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:40.830> that<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.930> could<00:04:43.140> pair

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
now I'd caution you that you could pair

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.550 
now I'd caution you that you could pair
this<00:04:44.250> pair<00:04:44.550> together<00:04:44.729> and<00:04:45.240> breed<00:04:46.200> twelve

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
this pair together and breed twelve

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.529 
this pair together and breed twelve
babies<00:04:47.040> and<00:04:47.310> they<00:04:47.610> may<00:04:47.760> all<00:04:48.000> come<00:04:48.180> out<00:04:48.300> blue

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
babies and they may all come out blue

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.140 
babies and they may all come out blue
check<00:04:49.849> geneticists<00:04:50.849> would<00:04:51.030> tell<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.450> that

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
check geneticists would tell you that

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.120 
check geneticists would tell you that
order<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.540> get<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.930> true<00:04:53.170> probability<00:04:53.980> you

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
order to get the true probability you

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.770 
order to get the true probability you
have<00:04:54.160> to<00:04:54.520> breed<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:54.940> lot<00:04:54.970> and<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:56.500> lot<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:57.780> progeny
