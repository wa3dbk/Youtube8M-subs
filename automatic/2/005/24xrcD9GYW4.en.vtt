00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.750
 Y 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.750
 welcome to dukascopy tb I am minions 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.639
 our guest today is ant menu 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.340
 who is with me online to 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.900
 participate in weekly rafa sanz we are going to 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.700
 start talking about the unemployment rate 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.950
 in the united kingdom published the week 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.199
 last for the first time in the year 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.300
 numbers did not fall and they stayed at 6 % 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.160
 that those numbers are going to decrease or 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.130
 have reached a natural level of 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.779
 unemployment in the united kingdom 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.760
 come I suggest we do not put the cart 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.350
 in front of the horse the deceleration 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.940
 could be the result of the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.690
 uncertainty created by the referendum 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.190
 Scottish 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.719
 along with the fact that the euro zone 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.730
 it was and still is a relevant issue 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.070
 for the economy of the united kingdom by 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.629
 course it could be the natural rate I've 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.760
 read some studies that talk about a 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.340
 6.2 percent but it's too soon 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.570
 to affirm that and let's not forget 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.610
 that the weekly income was 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.230
 greater than expected so 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.390
 obviously the gap is decreasing 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.070
 but we need to see what will happen in 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.840
 the next months 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.119
 nextel germany published its GDP 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.759
 Friday on an annual basis the numbers 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.610
 rose to 1 2% but believes that figure 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.690
 it's enough for Germany in a 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.150
 word no 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.070
 and judging from the surveys of the pm and the 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.330
 fourth quarter will be weaker and the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.890
 France numbers were also 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.020
 published on Friday and they were a bit 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.700
 higher however this is due to the 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.740
 public expenditures and the accumulation of 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.360
 inventories or net exports 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.700
 neither the investments had a 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.410
 positive contribution so the center 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.990
 is not growing enough 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.970
 fast enough to help the periphery and 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.590
 the periphery is not growing fast 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.020
 to get rid of debt problem 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.580
 in a general way comparatively those 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.040
 numbers were good but they are not 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.690
 enough alpha last the rate of 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.640
 inflation and the GDP numbers of the 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.620
 euro zone were both published 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.420
 inflation remained unchanged 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.430
 continues at 0.4 percent and the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.530
 growth with annual base at 0.8 per 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.979
 percent that those two numbers indicate for 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.930
 the euro zone is true those are the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.700
 numbers ended in October and they were 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.740
 in line with expectations that's why 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.540
 we had surprises there are still 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.770
 low in real terms but if 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.050
 we judge by the inflation indicator 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.090
 favorite of draghi every five years 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.350
 the markets look a lot better if 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.150
 we compare with the feeling of 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.180
 mid -October then 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.680
 the expectations were close to 1 7% and 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.590
 now there is none 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.290
 and 5% but they are below 2% what 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.540
 It is obviously a problem talking 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.069
 pib as I said earlier the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.109
 main data are comparatively 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.209
 better but they are not enough 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.099
 good to give us hope for 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.680
 the future I think the markets are going to 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.719
 demand more from the bc and even if it responds 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.719
 to that requirement I would still be 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:42.099
 worried about the future of the euro zone 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.870
 satse once again thank you for your 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.400
 participation in our program and 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.819
 thank you for seeing us that's all for today 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.819
 see you soon 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.200
