00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
so small as in realizing that I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.490 
so small as in realizing that I
I<00:02:11.819> don't<00:02:12.180> need<00:02:12.299> to<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.599> greedy<00:02:12.750> i<00:02:13.049> can<00:02:13.290> just

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
I don't need to be greedy i can just

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.479 
I don't need to be greedy i can just
play<00:02:13.680> safe<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:16.560> fine<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.040> all<00:02:17.189> that

that<00:02:17.790> really<00:02:18.329> has<00:02:18.599> made<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.870> huge<00:02:19.290> difference<00:02:19.620> I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
that really has made a huge difference I

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.500 
that really has made a huge difference I
think<00:02:20.450> um<00:02:22.189> hello<00:02:23.189> be<00:02:23.459> careless<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:23.879> my<00:02:24.030> macro

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510

but<00:02:24.659> it's<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:25.170> over<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.709> didn't<00:02:26.040> really

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
but it's it's over so I didn't really

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.099 
but it's it's over so I didn't really
care<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.819> much<00:02:26.849> anymore<00:02:27.269> playing<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:28.019> little

become<00:02:53.849> be<00:02:54.180> mine<00:02:54.389> is<00:02:54.540> pretty<00:02:54.750> soon<00:02:55.049> um<00:02:56.689> since

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
become be mine is pretty soon um since

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.649 
become be mine is pretty soon um since
he's<00:02:58.109> gonna<00:02:58.260> look<00:02:58.530> like<00:02:58.680> 1<00:02:58.889> 130<00:02:59.879> points<00:03:00.269> from

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
he's gonna look like 1 130 points from

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.379 
he's gonna look like 1 130 points from
this<00:03:00.870> game<00:03:01.500> if<00:03:01.769> he<00:03:01.889> lose<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:02.519> i<00:03:02.760> guess<00:03:03.239> he

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
this game if he lose so i guess he

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.179 
this game if he lose so i guess he
wanted<00:03:03.599> he<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:04.169> wants<00:03:04.409> to<00:03:04.560> stay<00:03:04.769> on<00:03:04.799> as<00:03:05.159> long

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
wanted he just wants to stay on as long

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.659 
wanted he just wants to stay on as long
as<00:03:05.549> possible<00:03:05.609> and<00:03:06.239> see<00:03:06.810> if<00:03:06.870> he<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:08.010> find<00:03:08.549> a

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
as possible and see if he can find a

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.819 
as possible and see if he can find a
flaw<00:03:08.879> in<00:03:09.060> my<00:03:09.180> gameplay<00:03:09.659> I<00:03:09.930> guess<00:03:10.500> he<00:03:10.650> thinks

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
flaw in my gameplay I guess he thinks

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.970 
flaw in my gameplay I guess he thinks
that<00:03:11.069> I'm<00:03:11.189> much<00:03:11.400> worse<00:03:11.609> than<00:03:11.849> him<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.709> I<00:03:13.709> don't

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
that I'm much worse than him and I don't

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.699 
that I'm much worse than him and I don't
know<00:03:14.069> maybe<00:03:14.730> maybe<00:03:15.540> he<00:03:15.780> might<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.440> kind<00:03:16.680> of

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
know maybe maybe he might it's kind of

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.949 
know maybe maybe he might it's kind of
like<00:03:16.889> explainable<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:18.090> he<00:03:18.209> thinks<00:03:18.569> so<00:03:18.720> Ben

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
like explainable that he thinks so Ben

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.610 
like explainable that he thinks so Ben
because<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:20.069> don't<00:03:20.579> care<00:03:20.699> so<00:03:20.940> much<00:03:21.000> about
