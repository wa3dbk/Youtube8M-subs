to<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.450> sure<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:06.840> end<00:01:06.960> up

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to really make sure that we don't end up

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.459 
to really make sure that we don't end up
with<00:01:07.140> any<00:01:07.260> lumps<00:01:07.710> inside<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.579> our<00:01:08.729> grill<00:01:12.469> all

making once we add the flour to the
butter<00:01:26.280> we're<00:01:27.179> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> whisk<00:01:27.899> it<00:01:28.079> up<00:01:31.579> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
butter we're going to whisk it up and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.709 
butter we're going to whisk it up and
you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:33.030> how<00:01:33.149> that's<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.479> just

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
you can see how that's really just

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.239 
you can see how that's really just
coming<00:01:33.929> together<00:01:34.140> beautifully<00:01:34.469> very<00:01:34.920> gently

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249 
coming together beautifully very gently

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:37.069 
coming together beautifully very gently
you<00:01:35.759> might<00:01:36.299> even<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.659> pull<00:01:36.899> it<00:01:36.960> off<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
you might even want to pull it off the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.330 
you might even want to pull it off the
heat<00:01:37.289> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.499> bit<00:01:37.679> at<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.859> point<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
heat a little bit at this point you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.440 
heat a little bit at this point you
build<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.759> whatever<00:01:39.090> cook<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.240> right

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
build up whatever cook you can see right

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.510 
build up whatever cook you can see right
now<00:01:42.509> we're<00:01:42.780> basically<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.109> blond<00:01:43.499> Roux<00:01:44.039> stage

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
now we're basically a blond Roux stage

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.849 
now we're basically a blond Roux stage
which<00:01:45.179> just<00:01:45.390> means<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.679> at<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
which just means that it's at the

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.499 
which just means that it's at the
lightest<00:01:47.249> color<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:48.149> its<00:01:48.329> greatest

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
lightest color and at its greatest

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.279 
lightest color and at its greatest
thickening<00:01:49.139> power<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.840> here<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.109> our

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
thickening power so here we have our

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.399 
thickening power so here we have our
milk<00:01:52.950> mixture<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:54.389> could<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.780> your<00:01:55.170> mac<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
milk mixture this could be your mac and

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.559 
milk mixture this could be your mac and
cheese<00:01:55.590> sauce<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.490> didn't<00:01:56.759> thicken<00:01:57.179> it

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
cheese sauce that didn't thicken it

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.440 
cheese sauce that didn't thicken it
could<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:58.609> sauce<00:01:59.609> that<00:01:59.909> you're<00:01:59.999> making<00:02:00.209> for

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
could be sauce that you're making for

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.690 
could be sauce that you're making for
something<00:02:00.780> else<00:02:00.979> we<00:02:01.979> always<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> season

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
something else we always like to season

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.270 
something else we always like to season
our<00:02:02.909> sauces<00:02:03.389> here<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.439> salt<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.069> fresh

cracked<00:02:05.310> black<00:02:05.850> pepper<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.109> want

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
cracked black pepper and then you want

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.900 
cracked black pepper and then you want
to<00:02:07.319> slowly

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
to slowly

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.790
