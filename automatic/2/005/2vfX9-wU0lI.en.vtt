00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
have to worry about healers I used to

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.279 
have to worry about healers I used to
always<00:04:14.009> run<00:04:14.220> giant<00:04:14.579> healer<00:04:14.939> but<00:04:15.689> I<00:04:15.780> don't<00:04:15.959> do

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.560 
that as
much<00:04:16.840> anymore<00:04:17.080> just<00:04:17.380> because<00:04:18.480> healers<00:04:19.480> are

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
much anymore just because healers are

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.539 
much anymore just because healers are
