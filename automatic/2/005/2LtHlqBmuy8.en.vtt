00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.720
 excuse me you need it 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.720
 hey guys what 's the winemaker doing snake and 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.880
 as you had seen at the beginning 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.490
 worst funnier of the moments slipped 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.590
 how parachutes can duplicate that 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.689
 is really mega funny should be here 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.939
 absolutely tried it out and here 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.830
 needs a parachute and then gd 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.329
 first in clothes store because she 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.430
 have no parachute is about so 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.160
 shopping ammunition and then opens up 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.320
 inventory haggling and doing that 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.450
 parachute on one so that you on yours 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.190
 is back and if you are ready 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.680
 has done then the nice ones 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.590
 Cashier versus outfits 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.539
 saved and pressed once square so 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.780
 that they are the outfit on one 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.280
 save empty space can say 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.769
 I'll do something right later 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.590
 cool functions in any case and then 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.290
 write down there, no idea 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.480
 parachute new violets and so on 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.130
 I did not want to know 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.910
 parachute 0 written down I found 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.710
 quite fit 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.670
 and if you have the extent made 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.710
 then you can do that again 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.600
 go out and now you have one 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.250
 organize heli because you have to first 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.170
 fly up a bit 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.790
 either call merriweather or her 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.329
 heliport is always about how 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.180
 around 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.570
 I thought so yes first fly 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.780
 due to heli jumping up so 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.450
 he really cool out with the window 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.720
 and so far is already really cool what 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.790
 happened I speak out of me daily 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.430
 turns and the rotor blades me 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.960
 here simply because mega missing then have 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.790
 I of course I only used in heli 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.619
 I got jumped and now 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.110
 you have to pull the parachute once 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.880
 and then you have to throw it off 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.520
 then the next mistake i could have 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.780
 I have not found anything yet 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.789
 I died again 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.920
 but that does not matter because it's just him 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.990
 just drop the main parachute like that 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.420
 that the way is you want to be safe 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.860
 i only do this once and if 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.030
 you then did that then then 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.710
 you have the glitch actually 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.750
 already so far can be made ready now 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.350
 they go somewhere and then you go 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.860
 This time on the inventory goes again 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.440
 accessories and goes on outfits and now 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.420
 wants the outfit saved 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.700
 and there is nothing again 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.430
 on it and then he just picks up 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.610
 each new case are available from again 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.950
 and there you can really blatantly 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.230
 so that the whole floor is just full 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.480
 wrong is i learn that by all means 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.019
 superhot I have to break in the picture 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.819
 laugh 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.530
 especially if you like something then in 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.450
 the lobby rule or with many 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.190
 People and everyone running around s throw 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.420
 Parachute all the time because you 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.940
 Of course you can also join 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.640
 movement , I found that just awesome 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.250
 because that necessarily tells some 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.650
 are going to be determined now there is yes 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.580
 Disabled or what would be robbed but nee 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.470
 that was really funny and hardly wolters 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.450
 necessarily show here as well 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.280
 little tip on the edge my mobile phone faith 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.790
 I have to throw it away 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.599
 if you go outfits and 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.519
 then stored outfits can 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.959
 you always need to switch indirectly 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.180
 not in clothes country for example me 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.340
 have you this invisible or the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.750
 basket and everything can do it 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.200
 and then we can always do it so directly 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.700
 Change no matter where you are the video for me 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.829
 here I hope of course now has you 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.959
 would have been cool if 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.000
 you ladder and for that you say 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.620
 us at the next video people until then 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.620
 looks pure
