00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.420 
dialogue I think that's kind of a
constant<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.140> everything<00:01:42.530> we<00:01:42.710> do<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
constant and everything we do that the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.789 
constant and everything we do that the
idea<00:01:43.790> of<00:01:43.880> contrasts<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:44.900> we're<00:01:45.290> attracted<00:01:45.799> to

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
idea of contrasts and we're attracted to

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.690 
idea of contrasts and we're attracted to
that<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:48.260> minute<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:48.590> see<00:01:48.799> something<00:01:48.830> Kate<00:01:49.460> be

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700

that the minute I see something Kate be
wingy<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.390> think<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.320> know<00:01:51.470> supérieur<00:01:51.979> I
