00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.939
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.509
 group and now in Odessa about half 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.150
 the fourth morning well and basically night 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.199
 someone like me can not sleep and I decided 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.280
 review the regular edition of the game 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.440
 battlefield 4 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.629
 but before that I would like 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.449
 show you a poster which 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.870
 I was presented to the exit of the game cyber store 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.559
 zone 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:53.280
 well let's unpack and see what 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:57.010
 last on a healthy poster sorry 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.780
 my crooked hands wouldn't let him 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.780
 ok open so here it looks 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.710
 here is battlefield 4 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.710
 here is a big poster 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.740
 so here he sees but let's consider 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.890
 what is included in the regular edition like this 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.490
 we look like a normal building 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:27.020
 inside tedit three drive advertising ppm 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:33.180
 studio days origin in general, all stuck 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:38.810
 what's possible impossible let's open 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.810
 [music] 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:54.729
 Well, let's open at your own risk and 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:02:04.420
 it depends on codes for them so disk 1 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:04.420
 under him open dice 2 not under them 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.250
 no years well, apparently it means when 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:19.860
 written here right here on this mine and 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:24.060
 here's the third disk so but basically it 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.480
 all battlefield I like the third one 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.959
 part 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.880
 and company and multiplayer chic but in 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.700
 the fourth must be in principle 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:38.459
 good comp strong com so that everything went 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.760
 I did not lag at maxim 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.989
 will go even you can predict will fly but 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.530
 I want to see myself 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:53.360
 on the battlefield for the video will be my nickname 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:57.560
 origina so see you again at 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.560
 War on crab
