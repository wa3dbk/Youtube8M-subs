IRONWORT

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.990
Ironwort, also called Greek or mountain tea, is a plant

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.990
which took its name from the ability to heal wounds.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Its Latin name 'sideritis', refers to a Greek word 'sideros' meaning iron.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.990
In the first century, Greek soldiers were given this tea when setting off to the war, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and they said it's a herb that helps those who suffer because of iron. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
To put it shortly, for the wounded who were hurt with sharp iron - it was cold steel as there was no other option at the time. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.990
So the mountain tea let them not only heal the wounds faster 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.990
but also get back the lost energy during the battle.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Next, it helped relieve the pain and had antibacterial effects which prevented infections from getting into the wounds.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.990
Hence at that time it was known as soldiers' tea - for soldiers going on front. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You must have seen Roman Legions and now imagine Greek warriors from that time - no guns, 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.990
often nearly naked, carrying huge shields - you can easily find it out.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
A legionnaire was armed heavily like a medieval  battle knight, while those had light armour so it was easy to get wounded.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You should notice that nowadays ironwort is rather rarely used for healing wounds.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.990
Firstly, we no longer fight with swords today,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and we don't get wounded so much to have the need to use herbs.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.990
But ironwort has much more wonderful properties in today's herbal medicine.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Above all, ironwort gives energy and allows to enjoy better physical and mental well-being.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It improves the functioning of nervous system, has good impact on urinary system, kidneys and bladder.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It also favours digestive system - if you have food poisoning. We can also use it to fight colds, flu, as well as upper airway infections. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.990
beginning from the sinuses ending with bronchial tubes. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.990
Ironwort also helps regulating blood pressure and body temperature. Thanks to the content of many antioxidants,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
which was confirmed by universities in the Netherlands, Greece and the Balkans in general as there this plant occurs natively.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The Balkans, Middle East, Northern Africa - there you can find wildly growing ironwort which - what's crucial - occurs above 1000 metres above the sea level. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.990
It means it's a very clean plant, free from any pollution, smog doesn't reach so high,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.990
wonderful, clean air up in the mountains - it's a great plant: small yellow flowers gathered into woodlets,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.990
they grow in a big snarl, and they are harvested like so. It's quite hard to grow yourself,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.990
but some people do it although the most valued is from wild places, 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and it's used in the local gastronomy. It's the most popular in Greece, where it is called Olympus tea.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
In England it is also known as shepherd’s tea since highly located terrains were usually visited by shepherds who knew and valued local herbs.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The herbal material taken from ironwort are the tops of the plant - flowers, stems and leaves-funny little cones

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that we brew and get yellow infusion of semi-herbal and semi-spicy aroma, which explains why it is used in gastronomy.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.990
It's a very unusual flavour that you probably don't know yet. Something between herb and spice.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It is a bit similar to other herb infusions but you can clearly taste something to eat - kitchen, soup, even something fried. More of a spice.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It explains why this herb is applied in gastronomy. I think there are plenty more herbs that taste worse.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So this can be drunk for taste - refreshing, a bit tangy - really nice in flavour, I could recommend it to anyone for health.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.990
