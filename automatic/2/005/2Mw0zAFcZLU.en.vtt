00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

this<00:00:24.900> one<00:00:25.140> actually<00:00:25.350> has<00:00:26.539> five<00:00:27.539> total

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
this one actually has five total

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.910 
this one actually has five total
suitable<00:00:28.910> see<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.269> only<00:00:30.420> has<00:00:30.539> two<00:00:31.019> that

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
suitable see this one only has two that

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.500 
suitable see this one only has two that
one<00:00:32.070> has<00:00:32.250> three<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:33.630> one<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> new<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:35.510> so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
one has three this one is a new one so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.380 
one has three this one is a new one so
this<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.230> connected<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.390> it's

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this one was connected to it it's it's

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.959 
this one was connected to it it's it's
long<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.620> doesn't<00:00:40.980> grow<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:43.649> way<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.340> you

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
long so it doesn't grow the way that you

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.970 
long so it doesn't grow the way that you
would<00:00:45.090> expect<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.899> was<00:00:46.050> growing<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.680> pot

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
would expect if it was growing in a pot

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.889 
would expect if it was growing in a pot
like<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.000> circle<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.739> grows<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
like in a circle it just grows to the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.610 
like in a circle it just grows to the
side<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:54.030> maybe<00:00:54.570> mounting<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.440> is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
side so I think maybe mounting it is

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.349 
side so I think maybe mounting it is
just<00:00:56.010> pretty<00:00:56.600> it's<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.899> better<00:00:58.760> this<00:00:59.760> one<00:01:00.059> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
just pretty it's just better this one is

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.670 
just pretty it's just better this one is
a<00:01:00.780> piece<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.530> pine<00:01:02.129> bark<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.390> actually<00:01:04.199> picked

actually under the roots but I can

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.390 
actually under the roots but I can
already<00:04:23.430> see<00:04:23.699> that<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:24.000> roots<00:04:24.300> are<00:04:25.400> starting

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.659 
else I wouldn't know it was a species
and<00:05:21.570> I'm<00:05:22.169> just<00:05:22.349> gonna<00:05:22.470> tie<00:05:22.770> it<00:05:22.830> together<00:05:23.039> like

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
and I'm just gonna tie it together like

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.960 
and I'm just gonna tie it together like
this<00:05:23.940> one<00:05:24.150> into<00:05:24.750> that<00:05:25.110> hole<00:05:25.320> that<00:05:25.349> I<00:05:25.590> drilled

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
this one into that hole that I drilled

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.540 
this one into that hole that I drilled
with<00:05:26.970> a<00:05:27.210> zat<00:05:27.630> I'm<00:05:27.870> too<00:05:28.500> lazy<00:05:28.770> to<00:05:29.190> use<00:05:29.370> the

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
with a zat I'm too lazy to use the

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.370 
with a zat I'm too lazy to use the
raffia<00:05:30.139> mm<00:05:31.139> yeah<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:32.070> this<00:05:32.759> one<00:05:33.110> and<00:05:34.110> we're

raffia mm yeah and this one and we're

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.040 
raffia mm yeah and this one and we're
gonna<00:05:34.470> use<00:05:34.710> this<00:05:34.860> hook<00:05:35.070> only<00:05:35.610> because<00:05:35.970> it<00:05:36.360> was

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
gonna use this hook only because it was

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.050 
gonna use this hook only because it was
the<00:05:37.110> only<00:05:37.289> thing<00:05:37.470> I<00:05:37.710> have<00:05:37.979> but<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.729> would

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
the only thing I have but I would

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.230 
the only thing I have but I would
recommend<00:05:39.270> using<00:05:39.870> say<00:05:40.800> like<00:05:41.009> a<00:05:41.039> metal<00:05:41.400> hook<00:05:41.639> or

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
recommend using say like a metal hook or

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.060 
recommend using say like a metal hook or
something<00:05:43.050> that<00:05:43.169> you<00:05:43.259> can<00:05:43.409> get<00:05:43.650> at<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:44.039> store

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
something that you can get at the store

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.450 
something that you can get at the store
it's<00:05:44.820> really<00:05:45.180> cheap<00:05:46.099> these<00:05:47.099> are<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.280> ones

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
that they give you to hang your wires

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.010 
that they give you to hang your wires

know<00:05:55.050> I'm<00:05:55.169> not<00:05:55.620> using<00:05:55.949> it<00:05:56.190> for<00:05:56.490> that<00:05:56.639> I<00:05:56.699> have<00:05:57.180> it

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
know I'm not using it for that I have it

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.570 
know I'm not using it for that I have it
and<00:05:57.780> I'm<00:05:58.020> just<00:05:58.080> gonna<00:05:58.289> use<00:05:58.560> it<00:05:58.590> for<00:05:58.740> this<00:05:58.949> one<00:05:59.159> I

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
and I'm just gonna use it for this one I

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.589 
and I'm just gonna use it for this one I
don't<00:06:00.120> have<00:06:00.330> anything<00:06:00.539> else<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:01.139> use

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
don't have anything else to use

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.020 
don't have anything else to use
so<00:06:04.599> here<00:06:05.020> it<00:06:05.139> is<00:06:05.410> finally<00:06:06.039> it's<00:06:06.190> done<00:06:06.310> my<00:06:06.819> tag

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
so here it is finally it's done my tag

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.390 
so here it is finally it's done my tag
is<00:06:07.240> in<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.389> back<00:06:07.780> and<00:06:09.930> I<00:06:10.930> can<00:06:11.860> go<00:06:11.979> a<00:06:12.009> look-up

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
is in the back and I can go a look-up

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.610 
is in the back and I can go a look-up
ton<00:06:12.789> better<00:06:13.000> if<00:06:13.419> I<00:06:13.569> use<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:13.870> raffia<00:06:14.289> just

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
ton better if I use the raffia just

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.279 
ton better if I use the raffia just
because<00:06:14.949> it's<00:06:15.340> gonna<00:06:15.550> be<00:06:15.819> a<00:06:15.849> lot<00:06:16.360> more<00:06:16.389> natural

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
because it's gonna be a lot more natural

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.800 
because it's gonna be a lot more natural
but<00:06:17.650> I<00:06:17.949> was<00:06:18.190> too<00:06:18.400> lazy<00:06:18.580> so<00:06:19.000> I<00:06:19.030> just<00:06:19.330> rake<00:06:19.569> this

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
but I was too lazy so I just rake this

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.469 
but I was too lazy so I just rake this
one<00:06:19.990> up<00:06:20.139> you<00:06:20.979> can<00:06:21.159> do<00:06:21.340> it<00:06:21.490> any<00:06:21.699> way<00:06:21.879> that<00:06:22.150> you

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
one up you can do it any way that you

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.710 
one up you can do it any way that you
would<00:06:22.659> like<00:06:23.430> there's<00:06:24.430> really<00:06:24.849> no<00:06:25.210> right<00:06:25.509> way

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
would like there's really no right way

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.710 
would like there's really no right way
to<00:06:25.750> do<00:06:26.050> it<00:06:26.080> I<00:06:26.259> just<00:06:26.470> do<00:06:26.889> it<00:06:27.039> this<00:06:27.220> way<00:06:27.430> because

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
to do it I just do it this way because

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.600 
to do it I just do it this way because
these<00:06:28.720> are<00:06:28.900> the<00:06:29.110> things<00:06:29.319> that<00:06:29.530> I<00:06:29.560> have<00:06:29.919> and<00:06:30.310> I

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
these are the things that I have and I

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.309 
these are the things that I have and I
was<00:06:30.699> too<00:06:30.909> lazy<00:06:30.940> to<00:06:31.389> use<00:06:31.419> the<00:06:31.690> raffia<00:06:32.050> at<00:06:32.199> the

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 
was too lazy to use the raffia at the

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:38.070 
was too lazy to use the raffia at the
top<00:06:33.780> so<00:06:34.780> let's<00:06:35.229> go<00:06:35.620> to<00:06:35.680> here<00:06:36.520> I<00:06:36.960> think<00:06:37.960> I'll

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
top so let's go to here I think I'll

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:57.689 
top so let's go to here I think I'll
just<00:06:38.229> hang<00:06:38.470> it<00:06:38.620> here<00:06:55.349> so<00:06:56.349> there<00:06:56.680> is<00:06:56.979> sitting

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699 
just hang it here so there is sitting

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:02.129 
just hang it here so there is sitting
there<00:06:58.530> cute<00:06:59.530> and<00:06:59.889> nice<00:07:00.099> and<00:07:00.479> getting<00:07:01.479> lots<00:07:01.960> of

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:02.139 
there cute and nice and getting lots of

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.619 
there cute and nice and getting lots of
Sun<00:07:02.400> actually<00:07:03.400> it<00:07:03.520> might<00:07:03.759> not<00:07:04.000> be<00:07:04.210> so<00:07:04.419> good

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:04.629 
Sun actually it might not be so good

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:07.680 
Sun actually it might not be so good
over<00:07:04.900> here<00:07:04.990> on<00:07:05.139> this<00:07:05.319> side<00:07:06.240> because<00:07:07.240> this<00:07:07.449> side

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
over here on this side because this side

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.029 
over here on this side because this side
gets<00:07:08.050> a<00:07:08.289> lot<00:07:08.680> of<00:07:08.889> Sun<00:07:09.190> so<00:07:09.729> I'm<00:07:09.880> thinking

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
gets a lot of Sun so I'm thinking

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:18.800 
gets a lot of Sun so I'm thinking
probably<00:07:12.039> this<00:07:12.789> side<00:07:13.090> less<00:07:13.840> done<00:07:14.199> here<00:07:16.319> nope

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
probably this side less done here nope

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:25.830 
probably this side less done here nope
bad<00:07:19.810> idea<00:07:20.199> that<00:07:20.440> red<00:07:24.270> let's<00:07:25.270> land<00:07:25.479> over<00:07:25.810> in

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
bad idea that red let's land over in

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.680 
bad idea that red let's land over in
this<00:07:26.169> side<00:07:26.440> because<00:07:27.009> the<00:07:27.159> trellis<00:07:27.580> tends<00:07:28.240> to

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:28.690 
this side because the trellis tends to

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.890 
this side because the trellis tends to
cover<00:07:29.199> up<00:07:29.409> a<00:07:29.440> lot<00:07:29.770> of<00:07:29.949> the<00:07:30.310> sun<00:07:30.580> rays<00:07:30.789> which<00:07:31.690> is

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:31.900 
cover up a lot of the sun rays which is

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.640 
cover up a lot of the sun rays which is
a<00:07:31.930> good<00:07:32.319> thing<00:07:33.779> so<00:07:34.779> there<00:07:35.020> it<00:07:35.139> is<00:07:35.229> that's

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:35.650 
a good thing so there it is that's

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.490 
a good thing so there it is that's
pretty<00:07:35.889> much<00:07:36.069> it<00:07:36.340> and<00:07:36.550> because<00:07:37.389> these<00:07:37.719> are<00:07:37.779> wet

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500 
pretty much it and because these are wet

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.019 
pretty much it and because these are wet
I<00:07:38.529> don't<00:07:38.919> really<00:07:39.099> have<00:07:39.279> to<00:07:39.400> water<00:07:39.550> it<00:07:39.699> right

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:40.029 
I don't really have to water it right

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:42.600 
I don't really have to water it right
now<00:07:40.180> so<00:07:40.599> for<00:07:41.319> tomorrow<00:07:41.529> it's<00:07:41.979> probably<00:07:42.460> gonna

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.610 
now so for tomorrow it's probably gonna

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.249 
now so for tomorrow it's probably gonna
be<00:07:42.699> really<00:07:42.789> dry<00:07:43.210> tomorrow<00:07:43.539> and<00:07:43.960> I'll<00:07:44.080> just

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:44.259
