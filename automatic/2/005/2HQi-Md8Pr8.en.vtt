00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 so now with whom I have spoken on 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.029
 weekend it said it will be 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.760
 streifschuss that hits us there or the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.050
 just over there we see one here 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.420
 you have to imagine him one 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.880
 huge boulders a little planet 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.619
 so to speak, the hair on the earth 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.850
 over at 17 o'clock 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.550
 our time here in germany 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.730
 maybe you will get it on the eastern side 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.470
 alpenrand can see though with telescope 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.849
 but only if the weather is good 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.769
 is and we see here again the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.420
 365,000 is the distance to the 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.540
 1000 kilometers is the distance to the moon 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.590
 and 12 million kilometers of distance 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.079
 to this asteroid b86 so a whole 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.570
 but we'll see you here in 2013 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.809
 siberia chelyabinsk a million instead 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.360
 there is a 20 meter diameter fatter 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.100
 Brocken over the city and made for 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.320
 fear and frighten 1500 people 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.789
 hurt and he had the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.350
 destruction of 30 hiroshima 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.899
 Atomic bombs so you can imagine 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.539
 what would happen if such a 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.460
 Captain actually here with us 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.930
 I really want to pitch it 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.810
 i do not want to be in size 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.390
 imagine but there are also more beautiful 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.850
 US American movies so the heroes 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.979
 that save the world from such comets 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.430
 always the same thomas showed is 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.990
 possible therefore made to the tui the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.759
 Space agencies are one of them 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.310
 to get a grip on disaster 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.450
 if it would be critical 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.549
 at the moment the esa has 500 risky ones 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.619
 asteroids listed the us 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.570
 maybe make life difficult 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.970
 could and then you think about it 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 she will shoot with probes or with 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.990
 rockets you can see that around here then 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.610
 to slow down and shake off the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.340
 train so that they then 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.829
 very close to the earth 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.320
 is this procedure is 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.670
 Tried and tested in the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.880
 certainly once in the next few years 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.610
 used that is what the nasa the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.340
 actually predict it now 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.159
 and what you think about and at the moment 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.350
 it looks like bl 86 recession 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.959
 so again just fly past us 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.640
 and so at least we do not have one today 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.330
 have to worry about in twelve years 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.770
 comes the next big brÃ¶mer 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.500
 it also flies a bit to us 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.630
 but we can still be relative 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.760
 Sit back and relax 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.290
 thanks with dumas me courage for today 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.290
 one week thank you very much
