played<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> map<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:47.430> had<00:01:47.549> more<00:01:47.670> kills<00:01:47.939> they

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119

Alliance all around yeah and I think

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.210 
Alliance all around yeah and I think
another<00:01:51.840> point<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> vision<00:01:52.860> control

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
another point that is the vision control

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.130 
another point that is the vision control

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
that call obviously just wasn't in place

gonna<00:04:24.320> lose<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.590> base<00:04:24.740> race

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
gonna lose the base race

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.980 
gonna lose the base race
turn<00:04:25.860> ative<00:04:26.160> Lee<00:04:26.310> why<00:04:27.120> would<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.479> try<00:04:27.810> and

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
turn ative Lee why would you try and

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.360 
turn ative Lee why would you try and
race<00:04:28.169> five<00:04:28.500> members<00:04:28.949> when<00:04:29.100> you've<00:04:29.220> got<00:04:29.310> a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
race five members when you've got a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.129 
race five members when you've got a
twitch<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:29.819> a<00:04:29.880> twisted<00:04:30.180> fate<00:04:30.330> at<00:04:30.449> 23<00:04:30.870> minutes

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
twitch and a twisted fate at 23 minutes

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.870 
twitch and a twisted fate at 23 minutes
you're<00:04:31.410> not<00:04:31.620> going<00:04:31.889> to<00:04:32.009> just<00:04:32.160> delete<00:04:32.460> towers

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
you're not going to just delete towers

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.140 
you're not going to just delete towers
so<00:04:33.419> I<00:04:33.660> do<00:04:33.750> feel<00:04:34.319> that<00:04:34.349> the<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.639> calling<00:04:36.060> is

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
so I do feel that the the the calling is

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.300 
so I do feel that the the the calling is
questionable<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:37.190> unfortunately<00:04:38.190> for

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
questionable and unfortunately for

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.460 
questionable and unfortunately for
nitrous<00:04:38.610> made<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.599> wrong<00:04:39.690> decision<00:04:40.050> they

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
nitrous made the wrong decision they

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.659 
nitrous made the wrong decision they
will<00:04:40.650> be<00:04:40.740> hitting<00:04:40.949> this<00:04:41.099> else<00:04:41.310> across<00:04:41.490> the

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
will be hitting this else across the

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.640 
will be hitting this else across the
head<00:04:41.789> when<00:04:41.910> they<00:04:42.000> watch<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.449> replay<00:04:42.840> let's

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
head when they watch that replay let's

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.170 
head when they watch that replay let's
look<00:04:43.830> at<00:04:43.979> what<00:04:44.130> this<00:04:44.280> means<00:04:44.520> for<00:04:44.639> both<00:04:44.910> teams

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
look at what this means for both teams

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.760 
look at what this means for both teams
because<00:04:45.599> that's<00:04:45.750> fragen<00:04:46.139> as<00:04:46.349> I<00:04:46.470> point<00:04:46.680> out

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
because that's fragen as I point out

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.839 
because that's fragen as I point out
with<00:04:46.919> frog<00:04:47.099> and<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.310> is<00:04:47.400> an<00:04:47.490> important

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
with frog and it is an important

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.550 
with frog and it is an important
weakened<00:04:48.120> versus<00:04:48.449> gamitin<00:04:48.840> versus<00:04:49.169> fanatic

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
weakened versus gamitin versus fanatic

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.980 
weakened versus gamitin versus fanatic
could<00:04:50.039> this<00:04:50.130> be<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.340> bit<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.639> a<00:04:50.729> momentum<00:04:51.479> game

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
could this be a bit of a momentum game

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.659 
could this be a bit of a momentum game
for<00:04:52.319> weeks<00:04:52.500> instead<00:04:52.770> of<00:04:52.919> summer<00:04:53.130> split<00:04:53.460> all

teams<00:04:53.970> kind<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.330> looking<00:04:54.539> for<00:04:54.720> their<00:04:54.870> form<00:04:55.139> in

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
teams kind of looking for their form in

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.650 
teams kind of looking for their form in
the<00:04:55.949> in<00:04:56.430> search<00:04:56.669> for<00:04:56.699> playoffs<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.539> then<00:04:57.630> a

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
the in search for playoffs and then a

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.420 
the in search for playoffs and then a
moment<00:04:57.960> like<00:04:58.320> this<00:04:58.349> between<00:04:58.740> these<00:04:59.039> two<00:04:59.220> teams

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
moment like this between these two teams

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.490 
moment like this between these two teams
I<00:04:59.729> would<00:05:00.030> dare<00:05:00.240> say<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.570> gives<00:05:00.780> confidence<00:05:01.080> to

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
I would dare say it gives confidence to

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.140 
I would dare say it gives confidence to
alliance<00:05:01.979> in<00:05:02.160> terms<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.460> their<00:05:02.610> shot<00:05:02.820> calling

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
alliance in terms of their shot calling

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.050 
alliance in terms of their shot calling
because<00:05:04.080> they<00:05:04.889> all<00:05:05.099> committed<00:05:05.639> to<00:05:05.759> a<00:05:05.789> call

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
because they all committed to a call

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.550 
because they all committed to a call
they<00:05:06.180> trusted<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.690> call<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.080> worked<00:05:07.289> and

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
they trusted the call and it worked and

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.620 
they trusted the call and it worked and
I<00:05:08.039> would<00:05:08.220> say<00:05:08.250> it's<00:05:08.759> gonna<00:05:08.970> sow<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.419> seed<00:05:09.599> of

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
I would say it's gonna sow the seed of

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.810 
I would say it's gonna sow the seed of
doubt<00:05:09.870> in<00:05:09.930> fanatic<00:05:10.530> because<00:05:11.340> whoever<00:05:11.610> was

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
doubt in fanatic because whoever was

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.950 
doubt in fanatic because whoever was
yelling<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.240> loudest<00:05:12.270> or<00:05:12.660> whoever<00:05:12.870> was

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
yelling the loudest or whoever was

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.200 
yelling the loudest or whoever was
making<00:05:13.139> a<00:05:13.380> decision<00:05:13.620> wasn't<00:05:14.610> taking<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.060> big

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
making a decision wasn't taking the big

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.879 
making a decision wasn't taking the big
picture<00:05:15.389> into<00:05:15.539> account<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.080> that<00:05:16.169> could<00:05:16.470> be<00:05:16.620> a

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
picture into account and that could be a

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.310 
picture into account and that could be a
big<00:05:17.340> blow<00:05:17.849> to<00:05:17.880> their<00:05:18.240> mindset<00:05:18.599> so<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.050> think

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
big blow to their mindset so I think

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.570 
big blow to their mindset so I think
there<00:05:19.440> are<00:05:19.530> two<00:05:19.710> ways<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.949> look<00:05:20.250> at<00:05:20.370> it<00:05:20.490> if

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
there are two ways to look at it if

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.850 
there are two ways to look at it if
you're<00:05:20.699> fanatic<00:05:21.210> right<00:05:21.389> now<00:05:21.570> number<00:05:22.320> one<00:05:22.530> that

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
you're fanatic right now number one that

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.399 
you're fanatic right now number one that
is<00:05:23.099> a<00:05:23.370> crappy<00:05:23.970> game<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.599> lose<00:05:24.750> that<00:05:24.810> is<00:05:25.229> the

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
is a crappy game to lose that is the

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.350 
is a crappy game to lose that is the
worst<00:05:25.680> way<00:05:26.039> to<00:05:26.069> be<00:05:26.430> losing<00:05:26.819> a<00:05:26.880> game<00:05:27.090> on<00:05:27.300> the

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
worst way to be losing a game on the

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.870 
worst way to be losing a game on the
other<00:05:27.930> side<00:05:28.229> it's<00:05:28.650> very<00:05:28.979> easy<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.340> pin<00:05:29.669> down<00:05:29.699> I

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
other side it's very easy to pin down I

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.999 
other side it's very easy to pin down I
think<00:05:30.180> why<00:05:30.419> they<00:05:30.659> lost<00:05:30.870> that<00:05:31.110> game<00:05:31.320> so<00:05:31.650> it's

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
think why they lost that game so it's

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.529 
think why they lost that game so it's
also<00:05:32.250> something<00:05:32.669> that<00:05:32.820> they<00:05:33.030> can<00:05:33.210> probably

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
also something that they can probably

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.740 
also something that they can probably
easily<00:05:33.750> work<00:05:34.259> on<00:05:34.530> so<00:05:34.770> on<00:05:35.340> one<00:05:35.550> hand<00:05:35.750> horrible

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
easily work on so on one hand horrible

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.510 
easily work on so on one hand horrible
way<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:36.930> lose<00:05:37.169> a<00:05:37.199> game<00:05:37.409> the<00:05:37.650> other<00:05:37.800> side<00:05:38.009> easily

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
way to lose a game the other side easily

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.430 
way to lose a game the other side easily
fixable<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:39.030> think<00:05:39.240> for<00:05:39.360> fanatic<00:05:39.720> or<00:05:39.960> whatever

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
fixable I think for fanatic or whatever

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.409 
fixable I think for fanatic or whatever
side<00:05:40.710> it<00:05:40.889> was<00:05:41.009> it<00:05:41.190> was<00:05:41.340> great<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:41.849> watch<00:05:42.000> for<00:05:42.240> us

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
side it was it was great to watch for us

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.490 
side it was it was great to watch for us
so<00:05:42.690> that's<00:05:42.870> always<00:05:43.110> nice<00:05:43.469> it's<00:05:43.979> nearly<00:05:44.219> time
