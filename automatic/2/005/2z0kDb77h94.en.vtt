trigger<00:00:24.539> line<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.990> very<00:00:25.199> awkward<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.740> this

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
trigger line up is very awkward in this

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.790 
trigger line up is very awkward in this
one<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.220> very<00:00:26.279> unorthodox<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:28.260> base<00:00:28.769> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
one it's very unorthodox but I base it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.900 
one it's very unorthodox but I base it
around<00:00:29.010> depending<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> needs<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
around depending on the needs of the

use them to modify your deck according

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.950 
use them to modify your deck according
to<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> situations<00:00:44.280> very<00:00:44.539> adaptive<00:00:45.539> deck<00:00:45.750> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to the situations very adaptive deck it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.170 
to the situations very adaptive deck it
takes<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.289> lot<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.559> skills<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> use<00:00:47.059> but<00:00:48.059> it's

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
takes a lot of skills to use but it's

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.700 
takes a lot of skills to use but it's
very<00:00:48.270> rewarding<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.050> know<00:00:49.170> how<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.410> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
very rewarding if you know how to use it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.690 
very rewarding if you know how to use it
so<00:00:49.920> let's<00:00:50.100> start<00:00:50.219> off<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.489> trigger

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
so let's start off with the trigger

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.939 
so let's start off with the trigger
lineup<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.629> heal<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.199> they're<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.649> laws<00:00:52.800> in

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
lineup for heal the they're like laws in

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.380 
lineup for heal the they're like laws in
jamaica's<00:00:53.280> copies<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:53.820> go<00:00:53.910> right<00:00:54.120> back<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
jamaica's copies they go right back to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.729 
jamaica's copies they go right back to
the<00:00:54.449> deck<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.840> makes<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.320> deck<00:00:55.469> very

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
the deck and makes the deck very

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.889 
the deck and makes the deck very
defensive<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.000> sakky<00:00:57.270> because<00:00:57.690> you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
defensive and just so sakky because you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.959 
defensive and just so sakky because you
can<00:00:58.050> recycle<00:00:58.289> those<00:00:58.500> triggers<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.730> most

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
can recycle those triggers in most

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.270 
can recycle those triggers in most
matches<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:01.109> least<00:01:01.260> he<00:01:01.500> likes<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:01.800> six

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
matches I at least he likes about six

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.979 
matches I at least he likes about six
times<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.820> makes<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.090> very<00:01:03.149> hard<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.899> my

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
times it makes it very hard to my for my

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.740 
times it makes it very hard to my for my
opponent<00:01:04.290> finish<00:01:04.530> me<00:01:04.650> off<00:01:04.970> three<00:01:05.970> draws<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
opponent finish me off three draws the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.090 
opponent finish me off three draws the
deck<00:01:06.930> does<00:01:07.140> need<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.560> bit<00:01:07.770> more<00:01:07.920> speed

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
deck does need a little bit more speed

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
deck does need a little bit more speed
than<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> usually<00:01:08.490> has<00:01:08.790> that's<00:01:09.720> why<00:01:09.840> i<00:01:09.869> have

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
than it usually has that's why i have

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810 
than it usually has that's why i have
three<00:01:10.170> draws<00:01:10.380> along<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.740> arm<00:01:11.010> rows<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.460> speed

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
three draws along with arm rows to speed

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.030 
three draws along with arm rows to speed
up<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.000> back<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.540> pieces<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:13.040> because

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
up the back and get my pieces in because

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.310 
up the back and get my pieces in because
when<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.280> comes<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.720> field<00:01:15.720> presence<00:01:16.080> they're

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
when it comes to field presence they're

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.800 
when it comes to field presence they're
very<00:01:16.530> weak<00:01:16.710> units<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.700> pretty<00:01:18.450> hard<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
very weak units and it's pretty hard to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.710 
very weak units and it's pretty hard to
maintain<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.759> then<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.850> have<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.210> critical

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
maintain it then we have a critical

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.950 
maintain it then we have a critical
point<00:01:21.810> seven<00:01:22.170> critical<00:01:22.320> because<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:24.780> deck

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
point seven critical because the deck

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
point seven critical because the deck
needs<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> group<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> if<00:01:26.159> they're<00:01:26.460> their

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
needs that a group of if they're their

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
needs that a group of if they're their
defensive<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:27.900> need<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.439> able<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
defensive but they need to be able to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.399 
defensive but they need to be able to
finish<00:01:29.009> off<00:01:29.220> your<00:01:29.250> point<00:01:29.549> quickly<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.960> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
finish off your point quickly and you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.560 
finish off your point quickly and you
know<00:01:31.500> criticals<00:01:31.890> always<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:33.270> stand

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
know criticals always do that to stand

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.850 
know criticals always do that to stand
now<00:01:33.900> I'm<00:01:33.990> not<00:01:34.110> running<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> Stan

technical but like I said when you when
you<00:03:37.530> learn<00:03:37.680> how<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.890> do<00:03:37.980> those<00:03:38.100> combos<00:03:38.459> it's

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
you learn how to do those combos it's

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.300 
you learn how to do those combos it's
extremely<00:03:39.600> rewarding<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.140> then<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.130> have

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
extremely rewarding and then we have

four member core memory arm rows now why

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.560

that in a little bit then for our
starter<00:04:17.580> we<00:04:17.700> have<00:04:17.790> thermometer<00:04:18.209> angel<00:04:18.570> just

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
starter we have thermometer angel just

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.479 
starter we have thermometer angel just
the<00:04:19.080> generic<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.650> know<00:04:19.739> great<00:04:19.919> day<00:04:20.100> structure

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
the generic you know great day structure

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.490 
the generic you know great day structure
right<00:04:21.390> over<00:04:21.600> her<00:04:21.750> she<00:04:21.960> becomes<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.289> booster

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
right over her she becomes a booster

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.290 
right over her she becomes a booster
then<00:04:23.620> you<00:04:23.860> can<00:04:23.980> counter<00:04:24.220> blast<00:04:24.280> one<00:04:24.610> check<00:04:25.210> at

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
then you can counter blast one check at

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.330 
then you can counter blast one check at
the<00:04:25.360> top<00:04:25.540> five<00:04:25.750> cards<00:04:26.140> and<00:04:26.320> grab<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:27.010> grade

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
the top five cards and grab a grade

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.950 
the top five cards and grab a grade
three<00:04:27.640> I<00:04:27.820> believe<00:04:28.360> she's<00:04:28.540> better<00:04:28.750> than<00:04:28.900> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
three I believe she's better than the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.200 
three I believe she's better than the
other<00:04:29.230> series<00:04:29.620> because<00:04:29.890> she<00:04:30.220> gets<00:04:30.430> fodder<00:04:30.760> the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
other series because she gets fodder the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.390 
other series because she gets fodder the
grade<00:04:31.390> threes<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.810> have<00:04:31.990> extra<00:04:32.350> those<00:04:33.280> are

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
grade threes I have extra those are

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.640 
grade threes I have extra those are
basically<00:04:33.580> fodder<00:04:33.880> for<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.150> swaps<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:34.750> most

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
basically fodder for the swaps and most

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.350 
basically fodder for the swaps and most
most<00:04:35.980> of<00:04:36.100> times<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.400> can<00:04:36.580> modify<00:04:36.790> my<00:04:37.030> damn<00:04:37.210> it

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
most of times I can modify my damn it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.730 
most of times I can modify my damn it
should<00:04:37.540> be<00:04:37.690> just<00:04:37.720> off<00:04:38.080> budget<00:04:38.380> grade<00:04:38.500> threes

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
should be just off budget grade threes

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.980 
should be just off budget grade threes
in<00:04:38.950> there<00:04:39.330> but<00:04:40.330> she's<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.540> great<00:04:40.750> fodder

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
in there but she's a great fodder

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.590 
in there but she's a great fodder
catcher<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:42.460> also<00:04:42.700> just<00:04:42.850> good<00:04:43.030> for<00:04:43.150> grabbing
