00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.580 
looking game there were a lot of moments
where<00:01:55.539> I<00:01:55.569> was<00:01:55.659> taken<00:01:55.750> away<00:01:55.959> by<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.200> attention

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
where I was taken away by the attention

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.800 
where I was taken away by the attention
to<00:01:56.799> detail<00:01:56.890> for<00:01:57.520> instance<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:58.030> shells<00:01:58.539> of

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
to detail for instance the shells of

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.139 
to detail for instance the shells of
your<00:01:59.110> main<00:01:59.289> gun<00:01:59.560> would<00:02:00.310> fire<00:02:00.549> out<00:02:00.819> and

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
your main gun would fire out and

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.550 
your main gun would fire out and
depending<00:02:01.659> on<00:02:01.750> what<00:02:01.959> environment<00:02:02.439> you're<00:02:02.530> in

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
depending on what environment you're in

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.859 
depending on what environment you're in
they<00:02:03.429> behave<00:02:03.700> differently<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:04.330> in<00:02:04.420> space<00:02:04.689> they

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
they behave differently so in space they

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.499 
they behave differently so in space they
kind<00:02:05.049> of<00:02:05.110> floated<00:02:05.500> away<00:02:05.590> in<00:02:06.179> underwater<00:02:07.179> they

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
kind of floated away in underwater they

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.539 
kind of floated away in underwater they
kind<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:08.080> know<00:02:08.140> stay<00:02:08.380> put<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:08.830> sink<00:02:09.429> just

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
kind of you know stay put and sink just

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.100 
kind of you know stay put and sink just
slightly<00:02:09.849> and<00:02:10.479> then<00:02:10.509> on<00:02:10.660> ground<00:02:10.899> they<00:02:11.019> would

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
slightly and then on ground they would

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.690 
slightly and then on ground they would
behave<00:02:11.230> like<00:02:11.620> normal<00:02:11.950> shells<00:02:12.190> just<00:02:12.459> you<00:02:12.610> know

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
behave like normal shells just you know

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.280 
behave like normal shells just you know
