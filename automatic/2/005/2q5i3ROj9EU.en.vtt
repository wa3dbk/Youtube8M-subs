00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.310

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
better probably on albums site but this

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.680 
better probably on albums site but this
is<00:04:55.800> what<00:04:55.980> I<00:04:56.010> think<00:04:56.430> about<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:56.820> bag<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.390> I

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
is what I think about the bag and I

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.440 
is what I think about the bag and I
think<00:04:58.500> it's<00:04:58.650> super<00:04:59.010> awesome<00:04:59.160> it's<00:04:59.640> I<00:05:00.120> think

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
think it's super awesome it's I think

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.470 
think it's super awesome it's I think
right<00:05:00.930> now<00:05:01.200> retail<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:02.840> 61<00:05:03.840> 99<00:05:04.410> so<00:05:04.590> $62<00:05:05.480> shipped

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
right now retail is 61 99 so $62 shipped

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.690 
right now retail is 61 99 so $62 shipped
to<00:05:06.600> my<00:05:06.720> place<00:05:07.020> shipping<00:05:07.980> to<00:05:08.190> my<00:05:08.220> place<00:05:08.490> was<00:05:08.670> a

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
to my place shipping to my place was a

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.100 
to my place shipping to my place was a
little<00:05:08.970> expensive<00:05:09.270> even<00:05:09.840> though<00:05:09.930> they're

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
little expensive even though they're

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.100 
little expensive even though they're
from<00:05:10.260> Arizona<00:05:10.710> I<00:05:10.830> guess<00:05:11.070> it's<00:05:11.250> from<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.520> size

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
from Arizona I guess it's from the size

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.280 
from Arizona I guess it's from the size
