 roberta and the wing commemorate the arrival 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.809
 of artur but also celebrate the health of 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.759
 your vision soon after the test of the little eye 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.829
 years feel safe because I saw that he 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.970
 had nothing and this was very 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.240
 important brought a lot of peace to us 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.310
 tranquility 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.470
 the test is not yet mandatory at all 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.360
 the country but it is a child's right to 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.270
 lack of information on how the 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.400
 test also inhibits parents from requesting 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.230
 as soon as the baby is born a 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.620
 he is a test is made to be 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.839
 developed by the pediatrician is a 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.969
 maternity in the office or 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.249
 even by the ophthalmologist a test that 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.800
 aimed at identifying a reflex that 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:48.379
 happens in the child's retina is a 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.870
 reflected in reddish color and reflects 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.569
 putting in present in said that there are means 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.370
 the ocular structure is 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:57.219
 well- informed well-developed 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.479
 when there is a change in this reflex 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.999
 signals that there is a problem in this 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.739
 sense and points to the need for a 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.640
 more detailed assessment with a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.649
 Ophthalmologist 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.780
 according to the specialist several 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.210
 diseases are detected with only one 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.159
 quick eye test dou's text 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.350
 it is intended primarily for diagnosis 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.810
 again with a congenital cataract 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.909
 congenital and some information 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.520
 then these children who have these 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.170
 problems should still be addressed in 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.610
 the first months of life because they are 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.070
 changes that will make the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.740
 development does not happen 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.409
 then once postponed this treatment 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.140
 the consequences are irreversible then 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.390
 there is a very short deadline for doing the 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.430
 therefore the examination of the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.409
 The eye should be as early as possible. 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.719
 the little eye test can be done 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.950
 by the pediatrician or referred to a 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.020
 Ophthalmologist 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.750
 but it is essential that it be done 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.600
 by the child's parents at the first 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.840
 month of life an examination was super-comfortable 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.060
 the actor if it is so no no cry is too much 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.219
 It's fast this minute thing. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.950
 so the doctor is already already 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:07.579
 accustomed then and even cried is just 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.619
 open your eyes even and ready fast 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.370
 a minute finished the exam so I guess 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.610
 that everyone has to 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.610
 all mothers have to do the test
