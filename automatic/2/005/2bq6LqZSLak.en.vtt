this<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.500> kind<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.890> separate<00:01:57.220> piece<00:01:57.460> as<00:01:57.700> well

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
this is kind of a separate piece as well

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.420 
this is kind of a separate piece as well
as<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.149> kind<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.170> creeps<00:01:59.890> me<00:02:00.009> out<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.280> touch

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
as this kind of creeps me out the touch

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.760 
as this kind of creeps me out the touch
but<00:02:00.700> anyways<00:02:03.960> articulation<00:02:04.960> wise<00:02:05.049> all<00:02:05.590> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
but anyways articulation wise all the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.529 
but anyways articulation wise all the

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
toes are on ball joints they cannot move

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.640 
toes are on ball joints they cannot move
up<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:10.869> down<00:02:10.929> as<00:02:11.200> well<00:02:11.319> as<00:02:11.380> from<00:02:11.620> side<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.950> side

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
up and down as well as from side to side

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.460 
up and down as well as from side to side
he's<00:02:14.650> got<00:02:14.860> ball<00:02:15.310> jointed<00:02:15.580> ankles<00:02:16.080> or<00:02:17.080> sorry

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
he's got ball jointed ankles or sorry

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.750 
he's got ball jointed ankles or sorry
actually<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.920> front<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.280> foot<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.610> like

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
actually the front of the foot is like

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.820 
actually the front of the foot is like
on<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:18.910> ball<00:02:19.120> joint<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.510> then<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:20.470> back<00:02:20.620> piece

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
on a ball joint and then the back piece

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.180 
on a ball joint and then the back piece
is<00:02:21.040> also<00:02:21.280> on<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.430> ball<00:02:21.580> joint<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.780> i<00:02:22.860> guess<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
is also on a ball joint so i guess the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.800 
is also on a ball joint so i guess the
ankle<00:02:24.519> itself<00:02:24.880> doesn't<00:02:25.120> actually<00:02:25.300> move<00:02:25.600> with

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
ankle itself doesn't actually move with

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.180 
ankle itself doesn't actually move with
these<00:02:25.959> two<00:02:26.140> pieces<00:02:26.319> do<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:26.860> can<00:02:26.950> kind<00:02:27.130> of

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
whole wouldn't swap look so just kind of

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.370 
whole wouldn't swap look so just kind of
you<00:04:17.400> know<00:04:17.430> rather<00:04:17.880> cool<00:04:18.120> looking<00:04:18.389> and<00:04:18.540> then

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
you know rather cool looking and then

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.800 
you know rather cool looking and then
he's<00:04:19.500> also<00:04:19.680> got<00:04:19.980> a<00:04:20.209> articulated<00:04:21.209> Cape<00:04:21.419> as<00:04:21.600> well

and<00:04:25.139> then<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.830> can<00:04:26.010> move<00:04:26.220> all<00:04:26.760> three<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.120> those

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
and then you can move all three of those

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.430 
and then you can move all three of those
pieces<00:04:27.979> independently<00:04:28.979> so<00:04:30.110> actually<00:04:31.110> like

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
pieces independently so actually like

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.990
