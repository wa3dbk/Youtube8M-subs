 I told them yesterday and well and I know 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.850
 I come bringing and it's like a converter 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.250
 that is, we are by default 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.410

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.369

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.390
 everything that we do and if in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.989
 these steps that I am going to bring 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.730
 right now, what will work 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.550
 the first thing you will need is going to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 be the tumen items that is a script mode 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.910
 that I have it here on my channel and I know 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.560
 they pass they are downloaded too many items and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.250
 then when they already have that they are going to 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.840
 have the full possibility of installing the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.150
 next skype mode how to install 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.860
 normally good what is it here in 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.140
 the download link should I put the link 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.520

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.590

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.050
 video and download the tumen items and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.630

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.580
 skype to become any 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.610
 good what we're going to do is we're going 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.190
 to get into the link and rather the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.050
 icon of the tsumani temps and let's 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.090
 select any block either no 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.720
 it matters but what matters is here 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.310
 where it says that idea item we are going to give 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.970
 to 400 and then when we give him 400 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.280
 we give items with any good and then 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.830
 give full stack and we will give good 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.440

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.980
 to give again to any item but in 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.170
 the item and from there if they have to go 400 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.620
 we will give you good today if you see that 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.900

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.690

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.710
 Excuse me but it will always continue 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.770
