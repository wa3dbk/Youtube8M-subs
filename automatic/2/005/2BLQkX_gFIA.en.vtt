00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
really good battery saver then you want

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.359 
really good battery saver then you want
to<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> settings<00:01:27.829> go<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.860> display<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:31.530> go

to animation if you want to save battery

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.310 
to animation if you want to save battery
tenfold<00:01:35.299> even<00:01:36.299> more<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.110> juice

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
tenfold even more so with the juice

tenfold even more so with the juice
defender<00:01:37.530> application<00:01:38.780> turn<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> that

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
defender application turn all of that

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.260 
defender application turn all of that
off<00:01:40.439> no<00:01:40.920> animations<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:44.909> fully<00:01:45.119> optimize

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
off no animations and to fully optimize

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.880 
off no animations and to fully optimize
the<00:01:45.869> battery<00:01:46.170> even<00:01:46.500> more<00:01:47.840> put<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> 15<00:01:49.409> seconds

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the battery even more put the 15 seconds

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.810 
the battery even more put the 15 seconds
instead<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:51.020> two<00:01:52.020> minutes<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.920> 10<00:01:53.399> minutes<00:01:53.430> or

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
instead of two minutes or 10 minutes or

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.020 
instead of two minutes or 10 minutes or
even<00:01:53.909> 30<00:01:54.240> minutes<00:01:55.250> it's<00:01:56.250> better<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.969> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
even 30 minutes it's better to have it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.420 
even 30 minutes it's better to have it
right<00:01:57.329> there<00:01:57.630> because<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.439> always<00:01:58.619> push

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
right there because you can always push

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.270 
right there because you can always push
the<00:01:59.610> button<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.149> turn<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.390> screen<00:02:00.750> back<00:02:00.960> on

know using it turn the gps all because

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.170 
know using it turn the gps all because
that<00:02:28.950> will<00:02:30.410> then<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:32.280> will<00:02:32.610> drain<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
that will then that will drain the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.350 
that will then that will drain the
battery<00:02:33.570> three<00:02:34.080> times<00:02:34.290> as<00:02:34.530> fast<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
battery three times as fast and the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.540 
battery three times as fast and the
airplane<00:02:36.840> mode<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.500> can<00:02:37.530> put<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.280> there

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
airplane mode you can put that in there

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.590 
airplane mode you can put that in there
and<00:02:39.110> not<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> healthier<00:02:40.590> battery<00:02:40.950> right<00:02:41.130> there

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
and not a healthier battery right there

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.540 
and not a healthier battery right there
let<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.630> help<00:02:42.870> save<00:02:43.140> battery<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.370> won't

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
let it help save battery but you won't

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.870 
let it help save battery but you won't
