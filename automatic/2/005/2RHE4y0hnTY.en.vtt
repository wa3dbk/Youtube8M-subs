 and so like so many of his contemporaries 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.889
 composer he had to 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.850
 earn money playing lessons on 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.779

 teaching chopin hated because 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.249
 too often by his students 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.289
 it turns out untalented children 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.310
 rich parents 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.830
 could he imagine that many years later 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.699
 his writings will be included in the program 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.250

 team him from the stables 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.710
 for the fact that they have a special opportunity 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.460
 carefulness to assess the limits 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.250

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.810
 how did you distinguish 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.620

 china again 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.280
 deciding what 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.610
 give time for growth gifted clearly 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.780
 not enough technically 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.049
 equipped child 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.189
 or in another case, we point out the magnificent 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.469
 work on the control of the nose found 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.469

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.100
 constitution no nothing he was 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.210
 whether it is an adult warsaw competition 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.260
 and his dumplings 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.520
 by tradition and 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.720
 of such pianist 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.490
 in the run-up and youthful competition 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.470
 Chopin's name 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.780
 sq. percentage 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.729
 ponomarenko 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.679
 Russian only living space 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.490
 as he calls himself 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.720
 born still learn music in Tashkent 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.720
 It turned out in Moscow and in the cluster of the plan 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:09.939
 thanks to the competition 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.159
 according to the big and strong last but 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.729
 famous competition projects in munich on 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:17.769
 which Malikova won the first 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.439
 an award 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.719
 and no one could do for 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.929
 12 years old 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.929
 percent 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:28.860
 no secret that now 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.450
 the music of east is coming vodka 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.050
 This and sometimes noticeable on competition Chopin 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.330
 China's first supplier protest award 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.299
 first prizes and japan 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.180
 that's why it happens to me 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.279
 it's hard to judge it like that 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.559
 in such a critical point of view why 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.649
 this is not easy 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.689
 it seems intuitive that we have a very 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.819
 many talented people 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.179
 left 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:59.359
 Of course, no use their own 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.839
 strength to your talent somewhere in the west on 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.199
 east many teaches japan 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.319
 Someone for sure May husbands in China local 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.279
 and they are like our school and 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.719
 a different perception of music is not only 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.599
 purely mechanical 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.989
 and since there are talented people 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.810
 Of course there is no charge and with time 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.629
 the level also rises you 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.849
 believe as a common many musicians that 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.349
 no victories over numerous 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.629
 contests impossible 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:27.979
 as known 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.719
 Now this path has become a little bit 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.919
 weaken in that people take 3 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.969
 million very high very prestigious 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.139
 Contests hope that this will give them a way. 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.719
 this gives 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.949
 kokoyty bursts on 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.619
 Kokoity first time but in year 2 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:44.039
 then at this competition comes 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.359
 new first prize and 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.479
 not everything has time itself 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.909
 recommend and how to be a little 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:51.809
 economists 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.079
 such question 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.659
 lot 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.829
 This here I have noticed that Germany is obviously he 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.150
 more practical western people this 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.919
 have understood 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.689
 local people prefer to go to 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.849
 computer equipment 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.889
 ziku cartoon something more 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.399
 technical 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:12.419
 we would be very interested to know 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.960
 report what lives 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.500
 europe musical 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.480
 Generally Kokoit indirect difference yes 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.450
 here between our countries exists 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.029
 square 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.319
 the question is but when is the manager 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.479
 I need to make such decisions 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.539
 and what is the closure of the Moscow hour 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.870
 area closed 12 concert 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.599
 organizations termination 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.460
 financing 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.099
 Here is what Germany Austria France 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.619
 Well, that is a lot of unnecessary of course 

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:40.699
 which do this but points 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.830
 issuing problems because 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.199
 that is, agencies 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.809
 with a name with experience is by the way large 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:50.840
 agencies there were small 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.770
 and of course large 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.940
 suffers from this shallow tom plan that not 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.870
 interrupts 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.870
 with your eesu contacts 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.330
 contacts more 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.539
 so let's say 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.050
 philharmonic organization 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.139
 funded from the state budget and 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.249
 and so on 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:11.969
 it's in germany 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.409
 from the state budget should generally principle 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.289
 art funded 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.749
 it seems to me that this is not only correct 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:19.489
 is necessary
