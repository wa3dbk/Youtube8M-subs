00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.209
 little quiz where am I 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.099
 finally we'll talk a few things 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:27.849
 serious and should football since we have 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.689
 right to the quarterfinals go from 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.759
 league of champions who have a 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.500
 peculiarity is that they have disputed 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.079
 in a week that goes so nothing to 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.980
 see with the 8th finals a little bit 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.329
 weird also this change of 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.620
 this acceleration of the calendar 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.770
 we will do more matches are 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.820
 important the more we play them next 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.280
 believe that not only was France and we 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.780
 fruity calendars to the agreement we're going 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.079
 start with Tuesday's matches with 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.850
 the madrid derby the atletico real which 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.230
 so there the reissue of the final of the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.090
 champions league of lisbon year 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.640
 last miraculously won by the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.590
 real giguÃ¨re curiously because 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.360
 sergio ramos had equalized in the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.820
 stops the game then the codes is very 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.759
 funny it's super tight of 86 for 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.130
 AtlÃ©tico victory 3.20 the draw of 55 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.990
 for real so it's super tight this 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.210
 which is normal it's going to be super tight and 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.280
 it can be pretty awful to watch 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.920
 because she usually when the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.470
 two teams play against each other 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.330
 what is more at bixente calderon the stadium 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.310
 to note that they get busy 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.280
 so for those who love football a 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.950
 a little bit roots a little trashy you 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.790
 risk of feasting obviously there is 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.229
 more offensive possibilities on the side 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:51.240
 of the real is maybe more than two 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.790
 hours of fort this grinta the atletico 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.940
 not easy predicted com holds game 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.300
 I'm going to say conceded tie 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.910
 by mutual then juventus monaco 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.520
 very funny huh the coteurs about the 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.770
 jacquot roof 1.45 a vector of the skirt 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.520
 eighty draws 9 for the win 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.110
 Monegasques 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.690
 yet do not be wrong look 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.890
 well the season is the match where the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.310
 Monegasques have the opportunity to make the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.770
 difference 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.660
 monaco does not know how to play the game and 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.440
 monaco is enjoying spaced 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.050
 Outside 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.210
 so Monegasques they are not idiots 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.480
 they know that they will enjoy the 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.480
 match 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.430
 golden trio as a means to try to 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.780
 make a move to be easy because 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.750
 now and strong that the people of Turin 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.780
 play and throw himself at the attack with the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.970
 naivety of the gunners 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.580
 but good monaco still has some 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.840
 guarantees showed a lot of things 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.440
 interesting I mean draw 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.480
 also knowing that I would not share 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.880
 probably not the same optimism for 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.350
 the return match 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.800
 finally it's already two matches 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.360
 extremely tight especially with the match 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.700
 go to the atletico and the judge and then 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.930
 tomorrow obviously from the other two 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.739
 matches is that's it and 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.739
 gamberger here
