00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
fashion the game is playable from

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.680 
fashion the game is playable from
beginning<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.399> end<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.090> are<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.480> track

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
beginning to end so they are on track

for<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> release<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.379> next<00:00:43.590> year<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> there

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
for a release for next year and there

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.040 
for a release for next year and there
you<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.760> more<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.149> less<00:00:45.180> done<00:00:45.570> they've<00:00:45.840> got

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you know more or less done they've got

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
you know more or less done they've got
to<00:00:46.140> add<00:00:46.260> some<00:00:46.680> more<00:00:46.800> things<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.309> polish<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.730> up

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
to add some more things and polish it up

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.490 
to add some more things and polish it up
and<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.239> course<00:00:48.450> there's<00:00:48.629> still<00:00:49.020> much<00:00:49.260> much

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
and of course there's still much much

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.229 
and of course there's still much much
more<00:00:49.680> work<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:49.980> go<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> looks<00:00:51.180> like

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
more work to go in but it looks like

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510 
more work to go in but it looks like
we'll<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.480> hearing<00:00:51.750> something<00:00:52.079> about<00:00:52.520> that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
we'll be hearing something about that

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.130 
we'll be hearing something about that
when<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.820> game<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.360> available<00:00:54.660> sometime

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
when the game will be available sometime

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.380 
when the game will be available sometime
relatively<00:00:55.949> soon<00:00:56.160> no<00:00:56.399> timeframe<00:00:56.820> was<00:00:57.030> given

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
relatively soon no timeframe was given

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.119 
relatively soon no timeframe was given
but<00:00:57.539> they<00:00:57.870> said<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> stay<00:00:58.410> tuned<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:59.010> more

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
but they said to stay tuned for more

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.830 
but they said to stay tuned for more
information<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.329> expect<00:01:00.690> more

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
information so we expect more

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.439 
information so we expect more
information<00:01:01.379> it'll<00:01:01.949> eventually<00:01:02.340> come<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
information it'll eventually come and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.520 
information it'll eventually come and
then<00:01:03.809> we'll<00:01:03.960> learn<00:01:04.049> about<00:01:04.260> when<00:01:04.409> it's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
then we'll learn about when it's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.350 
then we'll learn about when it's
playable<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.760> know<00:01:05.909> will

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
playable and that you know will

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
playable and that you know will
eventually<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> play<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> anyways<00:01:07.979> it's

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
eventually get to play it anyways it's

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.649 
eventually get to play it anyways it's
pretty<00:01:08.310> exciting<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.760> think<00:01:08.970> transistor<00:01:09.420> looks

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
pretty exciting I think transistor looks

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.380 
pretty exciting I think transistor looks
amazing<00:01:10.409> i<00:01:10.530> love<00:01:10.560> Bastion<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:12.210> they

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
amazing i love Bastion I really they

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.820 
amazing i love Bastion I really they
haven't<00:01:12.720> done<00:01:12.840> me<00:01:12.960> wrong<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.350> far<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.770> I'm

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
was bit of development since 2007 I did

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.880 
was bit of development since 2007 I did
not<00:04:10.950> know<00:04:11.160> about<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:12.230> want<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.440> play<00:04:13.680> this

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
visuals I've taken a look at some of the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.250 
visuals I've taken a look at some of the
screen<00:04:17.850> shots<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.419> were<00:04:18.539> released<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:19.049> looks

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
screen shots that were released it looks

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.409 
screen shots that were released it looks
and<00:04:19.470> pretty<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.919> mean<00:04:20.100> it's<00:04:20.519> CryEngine<00:04:21.030> too<00:04:21.209> so

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
and pretty I mean it's CryEngine too so

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.480 
and pretty I mean it's CryEngine too so
it<00:04:21.510> looks<00:04:21.660> like<00:04:21.750> CryEngine<00:04:22.410> too<00:04:22.590> but<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.340> take

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
it looks like CryEngine too but to take

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.740 
it looks like CryEngine too but to take
to<00:04:23.940> make<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.150> seamless<00:04:24.690> recreation<00:04:25.410> of<00:04:25.620> this

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
to make this seamless recreation of this

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.780 
to make this seamless recreation of this
