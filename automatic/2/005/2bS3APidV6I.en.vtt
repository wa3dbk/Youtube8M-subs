00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 as for the speed of the phone it 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.200
 I used performance 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.460
 phone in favor of the phone a few 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.420
 days and noted the following points myself 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.000
 interface, he often lags then 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.630
 there is here when scrolling desktops 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.560
 braking is often observed 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.510
 some slowing down jerks here 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.510
 it is not much noticeable now but 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.920
 The interface lags, that is, you can see yes 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.879
 what 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:47.750
 jerking happens scrolling even here in 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.910
 menu, well, it is clear that the phone is still 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.600
 middle class though basically here 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.969
 installed an eight mediatek 6592 with 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.739
 mali 450 graphics 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:05.280
 4 cores all the same and believed that in this 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.500
 the phone in terms of the interface will be 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.420
 great i.e. the scrolling will be 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.939
 smooth without brakes 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.100
 however, this is not the case 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.350
 brakes and jerks they manifest on 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.600
 this phone 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:27.360
 often enough and again I want 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 compare htc one m8 speed 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 that is, I will repeat again that this 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.240
 flagship for you maybe this is probably not 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.490
 would be an incorrect comparison well I 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.810
 I compare what I have 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.770
 if for example compared with htc one m8 then 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.430
 principle, you can clearly see how to 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:55.979
 GUI on redmi 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.979
 the notes slows down that is the sheet they come 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.740
 It is jerky, that is, on htc one m8 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.700
 in this regard, everything is just perfect that is 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.049
 no jerks 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.840
 scrolling through us is just perfect 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:14.129
 absolutely no brakes 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.840
 wherever the settings go all 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:23.489
 smart enough yes in principle in any 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.190
 points here on redmi laptop still need 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.459
 work on optimizing the firmware 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.519
 I hope I hope these future firmware 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.440
 moments will be fixed here but 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.739
 I currently have installed 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.019
 twenty third version of firmware and 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:47.519
 I want to note that the speed 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:49.260
 This firmware is still not at the height of 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.010
 performance plan 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.000
 that is, if measured by benchmarks then 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.799
 antutu this phone is robbing 27 thousand 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.670
 parrots 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:05.430
 can si there about 36,000 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.370
 I would like to note this moment by 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.739
 3d graphics that is in the same benchmark 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.060
 antutu 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:19.440
 when I passed the test for 3d graphics redmi 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:23.400
 laptop showed the result there is 1718 fps that 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.690
 In principle, a little here at the same time htc 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.599
 one m8 there he fps rolls over 50 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.769
 i.e. 50 60 fps betrayed it with his 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.940
 full hd screen 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:39.900
 here , after all, the screen is not full hd hd 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.239
 Here we are, along with quad-core graphics 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.209
 mali 450 I thought all the same 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:51.440
 fps will be ok enough here but 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.540
 it was still not enough 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.940
 performance I still noticed when 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.890
 Watching a video on a tube, that is, when 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:04.460
 i watch youtube video 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.920
 choosing full hd format there sometimes 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.890
 Still, jams are observed and not 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.020
 I know this is due to the lack of 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.080
 performance led with optimization 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.870
 firmware but we are moments 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.010
 have a place to be this is about 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.570
 speed and performance and 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.820
 I do not play games on phones 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.490
 so I test 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:37.970
 games will not but the principle judging by the reviews 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.900
 in gaming performance on gaming on 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.900
 3d games missing 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.280
 this is about performance and 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.280
 phone speed
