00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
through the basic setup of the violet

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.529 
through the basic setup of the violet
camp<00:00:29.010> stoves<00:00:29.310> really<00:00:29.699> simple<00:00:30.090> reflect<00:00:30.420> as

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
much light into the camera as possible

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.930 
much light into the camera as possible
it's<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.309> simple<00:00:35.700> straightforward

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
it's a really simple straightforward

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.119 
it's a really simple straightforward
setup<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.230> dig<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.800> grilling

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
setup I really dig that the grilling

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.860 
setup I really dig that the grilling
surface<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.360> whenever<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
surface here and whenever you have a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.920 
surface here and whenever you have a
flame<00:00:46.140> coming<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:47.460> thing<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
flame coming up this thing here is a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
flame coming up this thing here is a
flame<00:00:49.500> spreader<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> little<00:00:50.399> holes

flame spreader with all the little holes
drilled<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.510> that'll<00:00:52.110> take<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.590> help

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
drilled in it so that'll take and help

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.250 
drilled in it so that'll take and help
disperse<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.850> flame<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.449> evenly<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:55.140> gonna

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
disperse the flame out evenly I'm gonna

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.630 
disperse the flame out evenly I'm gonna
let<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.530> heat<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.160> then<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.340> gonna<00:00:56.399> add

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
let this heat up and then I'm gonna add

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.069 
let this heat up and then I'm gonna add
some<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:56.910> fuel<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:57.989> we'll

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
some more fuel to it and then we'll

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.779 
some more fuel to it and then we'll
start<00:00:58.260> grilling<00:00:58.469> two<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.100> these<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.579> bare

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
still a little medium-rare in the middle

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.330 
still a little medium-rare in the middle
should<00:02:12.470> let<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.710> cook<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.010> little<00:02:13.040> bit<00:02:13.250> longer

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
should let it cook a little bit longer

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.390
