00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.700 
batter up and you can see we got tiny
little<00:01:49.940> chunks<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:51.140> all<00:01:51.350> we're<00:01:51.500> doing<00:01:51.619> with

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
little chunks and all we're doing with

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.080 
little chunks and all we're doing with
these<00:01:51.830> chunks<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.280> batter<00:01:52.460> them<00:01:52.670> up<00:01:52.729> inside

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
these chunks is batter them up inside

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.270 
these chunks is batter them up inside
this<00:01:53.240> little<00:01:53.510> batter<00:01:53.720> box<00:01:53.990> do<00:01:54.800> you<00:01:54.890> drop<00:01:55.070> right

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
this little batter box do you drop right

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.969 
this little batter box do you drop right
in<00:01:55.369> with<00:01:55.460> your<00:01:55.490> preheated<00:01:55.790> oil<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:57.500> cooks<00:01:57.710> very

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
in with your preheated oil it cooks very

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.160 
in with your preheated oil it cooks very
efficiently<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.729> usually<00:01:59.180> put<00:01:59.390> in<00:01:59.509> maybe<00:01:59.690> a

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
efficiently I usually put in maybe a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.469 
efficiently I usually put in maybe a
dozen<00:02:00.800> or<00:02:01.070> 15<00:02:01.460> pieces<00:02:01.700> depend<00:02:02.090> on<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.270> size

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
dozen or 15 pieces depend on the size

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.330 
dozen or 15 pieces depend on the size
but<00:02:03.259> as<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.470> get<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.680> hang<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:03.979> this<00:02:04.130> tool

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
but as you get the hang of this tool

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.550 
but as you get the hang of this tool
you'll<00:02:04.610> see<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:05.330> opening<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.869> diameter<00:02:06.290> here

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
you'll see the opening the diameter here

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.960 
you'll see the opening the diameter here
you<00:02:07.040> don't<00:02:07.220> want<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.400> put<00:02:07.520> too<00:02:07.640> much<00:02:07.759> in<00:02:07.940> there

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
you don't want to put too much in there

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.060 
you don't want to put too much in there
and<00:02:08.149> won't<00:02:08.209> cook<00:02:08.450> as<00:02:08.630> efficiently<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.979> I'll

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
and won't cook as efficiently so I'll

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.770 
and won't cook as efficiently so I'll
put<00:02:10.250> about<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.459> dozen<00:02:10.700> or<00:02:10.910> 15<00:02:11.300> pieces<00:02:11.660> in<00:02:11.780> there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
put about a dozen or 15 pieces in there

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.479 
put about a dozen or 15 pieces in there
and<00:02:14.780> I'll<00:02:14.900> let<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.170> cook<00:02:15.440> for<00:02:15.500> let's<00:02:15.830> say<00:02:16.010> a

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
and I'll let that cook for let's say a

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.550 
and I'll let that cook for let's say a
couple<00:02:17.300> minutes<00:02:17.450> I'll<00:02:17.810> flip<00:02:18.170> them<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.350> little

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
couple minutes I'll flip them a little

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.080 
couple minutes I'll flip them a little
bit<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.860> couple<00:02:19.100> minutes<00:02:19.340> flip<00:02:19.730> them<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> little

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
bit a couple minutes flip them a little

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.330 
bit a couple minutes flip them a little
bit<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.510> then<00:02:21.350> after<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.650> mauled<00:02:21.860> I'll<00:02:22.040> take

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
bit and then after I mauled I'll take

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.150 
bit and then after I mauled I'll take
them<00:02:22.489> off<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.600> you'll<00:02:23.750> see<00:02:23.959> here<00:02:24.290> you'll<00:02:24.890> sit

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
them off and you'll see here you'll sit

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.440 
them off and you'll see here you'll sit
perfectly<00:02:25.370> running<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:25.940> side<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.300> got<00:02:26.390> up

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
perfectly running that side so I got up

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.560 
perfectly running that side so I got up
all<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.600> dozen<00:02:26.900> or<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.019> 15<00:02:27.560> pieces<00:02:27.769> in<00:02:27.980> there

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
all the dozen or so 15 pieces in there

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.930 
all the dozen or so 15 pieces in there
you<00:02:29.570> can<00:02:29.720> see<00:02:29.900> what's<00:02:30.709> cooking<00:02:30.860> next<00:02:31.070> nice<00:02:31.700> and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
you can see what's cooking next nice and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.670 
you can see what's cooking next nice and
evenly<00:02:32.209> another<00:02:32.900> important<00:02:33.440> piece

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.010 

surface<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.970> oils<00:02:39.240> dispersed<00:02:39.660> equally

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
surface so the oils dispersed equally

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.170 
surface so the oils dispersed equally
you<00:02:40.470> get<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> nice<00:02:40.800> cookie<00:02:41.040> mug<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.030> see

you get a nice cookie mug so you can see
there<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:42.450> bubbling<00:02:42.780> nice<00:02:42.990> or<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.410> preheated

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
there it's bubbling nice or is preheated

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.430 
there it's bubbling nice or is preheated
and<00:02:44.190> away<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:44.970> go<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.420> that's<00:02:45.840> kinda<00:02:46.050> simple<00:02:46.230> is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
and away we go so that's kinda simple is

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.950 
and away we go so that's kinda simple is
to<00:02:46.560> cook<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:47.490> will<00:02:47.640> show<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:47.940> what<00:02:48.600> we<00:02:48.720> do<00:02:48.930> with
