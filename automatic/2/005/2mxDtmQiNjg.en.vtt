off<00:00:44.700> without<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.390> gathering<00:00:46.110> he<00:00:46.200> just

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
off without really gathering he just

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.959 
off without really gathering he just
does<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:47.070> almost<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.430> part<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.850> his

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
does it it's almost like part of his

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.819 
does it it's almost like part of his
dribble<00:00:48.329> he<00:00:48.390> gets<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> off<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.079> quick<00:00:49.379> before

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the defense can even react and that's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.360 
the defense can even react and that's
something<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> small<00:00:52.410> player<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.949> use<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370

either way quote-unquote works the goal

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539 
either way quote-unquote works the goal
of<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> move<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> ball<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.400> the
