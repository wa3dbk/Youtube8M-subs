00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
you know they'll hold a pot it will set

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.950 
you know they'll hold a pot it will set
down<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.970> there<00:00:18.330> they're<00:00:18.510> not<00:00:18.630> going<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.840> hold

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
down in there they're not going to hold

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.200 
down in there they're not going to hold
dirt<00:00:19.289> themselves<00:00:20.039> obviously<00:00:20.189> everything<00:00:20.970> we

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
dirt themselves obviously everything we

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.929 
dirt themselves obviously everything we
just<00:00:21.420> fall<00:00:22.080> out<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> was<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> fun

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
just fall out of it but it was a fun

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.330 
just fall out of it but it was a fun
little<00:00:24.060> project<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.660> try<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.529> cutting

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
little project to try this with cutting

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.960 
little project to try this with cutting
the<00:00:26.460> day<00:00:26.849> toes<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.420> each<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> joint<00:00:28.439> here

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
the day toes in each of the joint here

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.400 
the day toes in each of the joint here
but<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.090> not<00:00:30.269> held<00:00:30.660> together<00:00:30.869> completely

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
but it's not held together completely

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.920 
but it's not held together completely
with<00:00:31.769> dedos<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.759> day<00:00:32.940> toes<00:00:33.149> are<00:00:33.329> mainly<00:00:33.510> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
with dedos the day toes are mainly to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.920 
with dedos the day toes are mainly to
square<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.530> each<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:35.219> tier<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.090> then<00:00:36.630> all

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
square up each little tier and then all

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.600 
square up each little tier and then all
of<00:00:36.960> those<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.559> glued<00:00:37.950> together<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
of those I just glued together but I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.040 
of those I just glued together but I
think<00:00:38.760> it'll<00:00:38.879> be<00:00:38.910> fine<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.420> now<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.719> need

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
think it'll be fine so now I just need

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.360 
think it'll be fine so now I just need
to<00:00:40.320> run<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.710> hardware<00:00:40.980> store<00:00:41.129> this

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
to run up to the hardware store this

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.720 
to run up to the hardware store this
afternoon<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.329> get<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.559> couple<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.040> hooks<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
afternoon and get a couple of hooks and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.750 
afternoon and get a couple of hooks and
some<00:00:45.390> chain<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.170> hang<00:00:46.829> them<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.370> want

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
some chain and hang them up and I want

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.190 
some chain and hang them up and I want
to<00:00:47.850> finish<00:00:48.000> them<00:00:48.300> somehow<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.719> haven't<00:00:49.079> really

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to finish them somehow I haven't really

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.270 
to finish them somehow I haven't really
decided<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:49.680> I'm<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.190> like

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
decided what I'm going to do it like

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.770 
decided what I'm going to do it like
gets<00:00:50.520> red<00:00:50.789> wood<00:00:50.969> stain<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.719> just

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
gets red wood stain you know and just

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.200 
gets red wood stain you know and just
put<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.230> there<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.670> guess<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.149> get

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
put it on there but I guess if I can get

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
put it on there but I guess if I can get
like<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> quart<00:00:54.809> size<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.710> would<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
like a quart size of it that would be a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.290 
like a quart size of it that would be a
lot<00:00:56.370> better<00:00:56.489> than<00:00:56.730> having<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> whole

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
lot better than having to get a whole

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.150 
lot better than having to get a whole
gallon<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.620> would<00:00:58.739> also<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.980> nice

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
gallon of it and it would also be nice

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.920 
gallon of it and it would also be nice
if<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.399> could<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.550> dump<00:00:59.910> those<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.690> because

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
if I could just dump those in it because

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.770 
if I could just dump those in it because
it's<00:01:01.320> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.649> kind<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.160> pain<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.780> go

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it's going to be kind of a pain to go

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.649 
it's going to be kind of a pain to go
through<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.379> those<00:01:04.890> little<00:01:05.100> slots<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.210> that

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
through all those little slots and that

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.090 
through all those little slots and that
was<00:01:06.780> probably<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.110> most<00:01:07.290> boards<00:01:07.710> I've<00:01:07.860> ever

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
was probably the most boards I've ever

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.940 
was probably the most boards I've ever
cut<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.880> single<00:01:09.330> project<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:10.049> are<00:01:10.170> all<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
cut in a single project that are all the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.500 
cut in a single project that are all the
same<00:01:11.130> well<00:01:11.369> they're<00:01:11.490> different<00:01:11.610> lengths<00:01:12.210> see

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
same well they're different lengths see

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.330 
same well they're different lengths see
each<00:01:12.720> board<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> different<00:01:13.650> length<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
each board is a different length but I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.340 
each board is a different length but I
had<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.549> cut<00:01:14.700> dedos<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:16.200> that's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
had to cut dedos in all of them that's

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.880 
had to cut dedos in all of them that's
all<00:01:16.500> 64<00:01:17.369> boards<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.509> make<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.900> two<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.740> these

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
all 64 boards to make up two of these

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.100 
all 64 boards to make up two of these
but<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.060> data<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> easy<00:01:21.689> thing<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
but all the data is the easy thing is

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
but all the data is the easy thing is
it's<00:01:22.290> all<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> datas<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.670> inch

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
it's all of the datas are just one inch

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.200 
it's all of the datas are just one inch
from<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> end<00:01:24.810> now<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.979> had<00:01:26.220> actually<00:01:26.460> dated

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
from the end now if I had actually dated

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.340 
from the end now if I had actually dated
all<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.229> individual<00:01:29.070> tears<00:01:29.460> together

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
all of the individual tears together

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.179 
all of the individual tears together
well<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.470> would<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.829> been<00:01:31.950> madness

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
well that would have just been madness

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.109

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
them are clearly emerging clearly i like

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.950 
them are clearly emerging clearly i like
to<00:02:41.040> say<00:02:41.220> clearly<00:02:41.610> by<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:41.940> way<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.480> just<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
to say clearly by the way this is just a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.140 
to say clearly by the way this is just a
sidebar<00:02:43.500> my<00:02:44.010> son<00:02:44.250> told<00:02:44.430> me<00:02:44.550> if<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.760> ever<00:02:44.790> want

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
sidebar my son told me if you ever want

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.550 
sidebar my son told me if you ever want
to<00:02:45.210> sound<00:02:45.450> smart<00:02:45.720> when<00:02:46.140> you're<00:02:46.290> writing

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
to sound smart when you're writing

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.690 
to sound smart when you're writing
things<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.640> say<00:02:47.850> clearly<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.860> i<00:02:50.250> started

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
things you say clearly and i started

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.250 
things you say clearly and i started
noticing<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.540> people<00:02:51.630> were<00:02:51.930> writing

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
noticing that and people were writing

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.800 
noticing that and people were writing
things<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:52.980> they<00:02:53.040> would<00:02:53.190> put<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.460> clearly<00:02:54.120> so

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
things and they would put in clearly so

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.840 
things and they would put in clearly so
i<00:02:55.170> guess<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.770> makes<00:02:55.920> me<00:02:56.070> sound<00:02:56.250> smarter<00:02:56.700> by

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
i guess it makes me sound smarter by

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.900 
i guess it makes me sound smarter by
saying<00:02:57.120> clearly<00:02:57.950> wow<00:02:58.950> I've<00:02:59.370> got<00:02:59.430> really
