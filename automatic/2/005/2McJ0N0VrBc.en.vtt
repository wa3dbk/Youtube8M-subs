what's up clashers it is Wiggy here and
in<00:00:02.040> this<00:00:02.190> video<00:00:02.490> I'm<00:00:02.639> going<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.790> be<00:00:02.879> showing

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
in this video I'm going to be showing

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.670 
in this video I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:03.179> guys<00:00:03.300> how<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.540> farm<00:00:03.810> millions<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.350> loot<00:00:04.529> in

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
you guys how to farm millions of loot in

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.920 
you guys how to farm millions of loot in
just<00:00:04.950> minutes<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.370> clash<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.700> clans<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.540> this

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
just minutes and clash of clans so this

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.049 
just minutes and clash of clans so this
utilizes<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.770> BAM<00:00:08.010> attack<00:00:08.400> strategy<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.000> if

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
utilizes the BAM attack strategy and if

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.430 
utilizes the BAM attack strategy and if
you're<00:00:09.179> unsure<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.630> what<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:09.990> stands<00:00:10.320> for

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
you're unsure of what that stands for

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.830 
you're unsure of what that stands for
stands<00:00:11.099> for<00:00:11.280> barbarian<00:00:11.880> Archer<00:00:12.120> minion<00:00:12.660> and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
stands for barbarian Archer minion and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.209 
stands for barbarian Archer minion and
the<00:00:12.900> idea<00:00:13.170> behind<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.710> since<00:00:13.950> you're<00:00:14.070> using

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
the idea behind it is since you're using

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.220 
the idea behind it is since you're using
all<00:00:14.460> six<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.969> your<00:00:15.120> barracks<00:00:15.450> rather<00:00:15.960> than

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
all six of your barracks rather than

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.840 
all six of your barracks rather than
just<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.529> four<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:16.949> regular<00:00:17.310> elixir<00:00:17.699> you

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
just the four for regular elixir you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.340 
just the four for regular elixir you
will<00:00:18.000> be<00:00:18.090> able<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.510> attack<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> lot<00:00:19.170> more

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
will be able to attack a lot more

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
will be able to attack a lot more
frequently<00:00:19.770> now<00:00:20.279> I'm<00:00:20.369> also<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> show

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
you guys one that works just as well but

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.950 
you guys one that works just as well but
it<00:00:23.070> will<00:00:23.189> take<00:00:23.460> slightly<00:00:23.910> longer<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.779> is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
it will take slightly longer and this is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.269 
it will take slightly longer and this is

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
that in mind guys the BAM strategy is

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.920 
that in mind guys the BAM strategy is
going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.550> quicker<00:00:32.820> than<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.420> barbarian

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
going to be quicker than the barbarian

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.870 
going to be quicker than the barbarian
Archer<00:00:34.110> Goblin<00:00:34.770> or<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.309> straight-up<00:00:35.610> our

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
Burien Archer this way you're not using

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.290 
Burien Archer this way you're not using
dark<00:00:37.920> elixir<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.579> know<00:00:38.640> some<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.180> may

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
dark elixir and I know some of you may

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.060 
dark elixir and I know some of you may
prefer<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.809> especially<00:00:40.410> those<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.770

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
attacks what I want to let you know is

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.660 
attacks what I want to let you know is
probably<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> most<00:00:46.890> important<00:00:47.460> tips

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
probably one of the most important tips

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.000 
probably one of the most important tips
when<00:00:47.879> doing<00:00:48.149> these<00:00:48.300> strategies<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:49.110> you're<00:00:49.649> in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
when doing these strategies if you're in

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.470 
when doing these strategies if you're in
clash<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.670> you're<00:00:50.820> planning<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.180> doing<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
clash and you're planning on doing a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.060 
clash and you're planning on doing a
long<00:00:51.660> session<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.410> got<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> lot<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> time

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
long session and you got a lot of time

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.439 
long session and you got a lot of time
so<00:00:53.340> you're<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.820> lots<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.149> attacks

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
so you're going to do lots of attacks

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.970 
so you're going to do lots of attacks
and<00:00:54.719> you're<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.140> all-out<00:00:55.379> maybe

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and you're just going all-out maybe

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.560 
and you're just going all-out maybe
you're<00:00:56.100> having<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.340> marathon<00:00:56.670> whatever<00:00:57.059> that's

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you're having a marathon whatever that's

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.910 
you're having a marathon whatever that's
when<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> strategy<00:00:58.050> works<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> best<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
when the strategy works the best it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.319 
when the strategy works the best it
works<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.250> best<00:00:59.370> when<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.699> attack<00:01:00.090> more

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
works the best when you can attack more

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
works the best when you can attack more
frequently<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:01.020> you're<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.500> planning<00:01:01.680> on

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
frequently if you're not planning on

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.380 
frequently if you're not planning on
attacking<00:01:02.340> too<00:01:02.670> much<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> day<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.300> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
attacking too much in the day and you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
attacking too much in the day and you
have<00:01:03.600> longer<00:01:04.080> times<00:01:04.379> between<00:01:04.680> your<00:01:05.040> attacks

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
have longer times between your attacks

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.890 
have longer times between your attacks
then<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:05.970> more<00:01:06.119> recommended<00:01:06.689> using

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
then it's more recommended using

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.719 
then it's more recommended using
something<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.530> my<00:01:07.680> easy<00:01:07.890> farming<00:01:08.369> strategy

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
something like my easy farming strategy

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.700 
something like my easy farming strategy
if<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.939> guys<00:01:09.090> saw<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.290> utilizes

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
if you guys saw that one that utilizes

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.320 
if you guys saw that one that utilizes
giants<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.430> wall<00:01:11.580> breakers<00:01:11.970> because

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
giants and wall breakers because

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.789 
giants and wall breakers because
although<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:13.020> does<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.200> slightly<00:01:13.650> longer

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
although it does take slightly longer

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.800 
although it does take slightly longer
you<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.640> able<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> lot<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.630> loot

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you are able to get a lot of the loot

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.420 
you are able to get a lot of the loot
that's<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> center<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> bases<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that's in the center of bases and

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.399 
that's in the center of bases and
storages<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> lot<00:01:18.780> harder<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.200> get<00:01:19.320> in

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
storages it is a lot harder to get in

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.690 
storages it is a lot harder to get in
the<00:01:19.470> center<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.890> base<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> kind<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the center of a base with this kind of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.999 
the center of a base with this kind of
attack<00:01:20.939> even<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.570> rage<00:01:21.780> spells<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.860> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
attack even with rage spells so this is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
attack even with rage spells so this is
more<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.670> those<00:01:23.939> bases<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.810> find<00:01:25.140> where

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
more for those bases that you find where

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.200 
more for those bases that you find where
players<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.220> been<00:01:26.400> playing<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.759> game<00:01:26.939> for

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
players have not been playing a game for

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.660 
players have not been playing a game for
a<00:01:27.270> long<00:01:27.450> time<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.259> what<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> mean<00:01:28.829> by<00:01:29.070> doing<00:01:29.520> all

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
a long time so what I mean by doing all

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.520 
a long time so what I mean by doing all
your<00:01:29.790> barracks<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.540> let's<00:01:30.750> say<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.140> are<00:01:31.290> doing

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
your barracks so let's say we are doing

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.830 
your barracks so let's say we are doing
the<00:01:31.920> BAM<00:01:32.220> strategy<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.000> what<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.689> is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the BAM strategy so what I like to do is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.679 
the BAM strategy so what I like to do is
I'll<00:01:34.290> take<00:01:35.009> two<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.430> them<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.030> use<00:01:36.479> them<00:01:36.659> for

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
I'll take two of them and use them for

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.060 
I'll take two of them and use them for
straight<00:01:37.049> barbarians<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.680> I'll<00:01:37.770> fill<00:01:37.950> them

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
straight barbarians and I'll fill them

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770 
straight barbarians and I'll fill them
all<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> way<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.820> then<00:01:39.210> I'll<00:01:39.299> take<00:01:39.540> two

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
all the way up and then I'll take two

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.780 
all the way up and then I'll take two
more<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.290> I'll<00:01:40.650> use<00:01:40.829> those<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.250> archers<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
more and I'll use those for archers and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.190 
more and I'll use those for archers and
fill<00:01:41.880> them<00:01:42.030> all<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> way<00:01:42.329> up<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:42.840> with

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
fill them all the way up and then with

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
fill them all the way up and then with
my<00:01:43.380> dark<00:01:43.680> barracks<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.729> want<00:01:44.939> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
my dark barracks here you just want to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.789 
my dark barracks here you just want to
train<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.360> much<00:01:45.479> minions<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.350> this

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
train as much minions as you can this

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.499 
train as much minions as you can this
means<00:01:47.070> while<00:01:47.430> you're<00:01:47.670> leaving<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> you're

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
means while you're leaving and you're

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.210 
means while you're leaving and you're
attacking<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.140> you're<00:01:49.229> using<00:01:49.409> troops<00:01:49.799> you're

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
attacking and you're using troops you're

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.520 
attacking and you're using troops you're
also<00:01:50.399> getting<00:01:50.670> troops<00:01:51.060> trained<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.720> when<00:01:52.439> you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
also getting troops trained and when you

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.139 
also getting troops trained and when you
come<00:01:52.740> back<00:01:52.890> you'll<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.189> quite<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.790> few<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
come back you'll have quite a few of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.090 
come back you'll have quite a few of
them<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.630> half<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.049> army<00:01:55.500> camp<00:01:55.680> already

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
them if not half your army camp already

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.010 
them if not half your army camp already
full<00:01:56.369> up<00:01:56.520> again<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.479> only<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.780> few

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
full up again and then it's only a few

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.450 
full up again and then it's only a few
more<00:01:58.140> minutes<00:01:58.320> before<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.009> go<00:01:59.100> ahead<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
more minutes before you can go ahead and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.190 
more minutes before you can go ahead and
attack<00:01:59.759> now<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.810> probably<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.140> most

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
attack now this is probably the most

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810 
attack now this is probably the most
important<00:02:01.829> part<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.189> strategy<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.610> why

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
important part of the strategy and why

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.639 
important part of the strategy and why
it<00:02:02.880> works<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.390> best<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.810> because<00:02:04.380> you're<00:02:04.500> able

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
it works the best is because you're able

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.709 
it works the best is because you're able
to<00:02:04.890> attack<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.399> frequently<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.390> although<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
to attack so frequently so although you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.449 
to attack so frequently so although you
won't<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.079> able<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.500> all<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.039> loot<00:02:08.250> that's

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
won't be able to get all the loot that's

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.219 
won't be able to get all the loot that's
in<00:02:08.640> storages<00:02:09.209> or<00:02:09.360> anything<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.750> that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in storages or anything like that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.260 
in storages or anything like that
the<00:02:10.470> attack<00:02:10.800> time<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> lot<00:02:11.489> quicker<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.209> as

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the attack time is a lot quicker so as

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.910 
the attack time is a lot quicker so as
long<00:02:12.420> as<00:02:12.480> you're<00:02:12.629> finding

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
long as you're finding

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.320 
long as you're finding
Mace's<00:02:13.220> where<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> lot<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.760> loot<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.090> stuck

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
Mace's where a lot of the loot is stuck

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.880 
Mace's where a lot of the loot is stuck
outside<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:14.990> collectors<00:02:15.470> you're<00:02:15.770> going

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
outside and the collectors you're going

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.930 
outside and the collectors you're going
to<00:02:15.950> be<00:02:16.040> good<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.250> go<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.520> you'll<00:02:16.610> be<00:02:16.700> able<00:02:16.790> to

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
to be good to go and you'll be able to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.000 
to be good to go and you'll be able to
get<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.090> ton<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.360> loot<00:02:17.599> this<00:02:17.720> way<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.709> let's<00:02:18.890> get

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
get a ton of loot this way so let's get

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.290 
get a ton of loot this way so let's get
started<00:02:19.310> with<00:02:19.430> some<00:02:19.550> attacks<00:02:19.880> here<00:02:20.090> now<00:02:20.239> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
started with some attacks here now the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.120 
started with some attacks here now the
other<00:02:20.540> strategy<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.380> talked<00:02:21.620> about<00:02:21.770> guys

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
other strategy that I talked about guys

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.130 
other strategy that I talked about guys
is<00:02:22.489> pretty<00:02:22.910> much<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.330> same<00:02:23.510> thing<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:24.020> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
is pretty much the same thing it's the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.140 
is pretty much the same thing it's the
same<00:02:24.349> idea<00:02:24.530> you're<00:02:25.130> using<00:02:25.370> your<00:02:25.640> troops

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
same idea you're using your troops

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.729 
same idea you're using your troops
and<00:02:26.239> you're<00:02:26.569> just<00:02:26.750> trying<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.110> get<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.500> easy

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
and you're just trying to get the easy

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.040 
and you're just trying to get the easy
loot<00:02:28.130> that's<00:02:28.459> unprotected<00:02:29.390> in<00:02:29.540> the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
loot that's unprotected in the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.770 
loot that's unprotected in the
collectors<00:02:30.590> along<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.280> outside<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.910> bases<00:02:32.540> or

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
collectors along the outside of bases or

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.750 
collectors along the outside of bases or
just<00:02:33.319> within<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.860> little<00:02:34.160> bit<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.489> protection

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
just within a little bit of protection

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.059 
just within a little bit of protection
so<00:02:35.450> when<00:02:35.630> you're<00:02:35.750> using<00:02:35.959> those<00:02:36.230> two<00:02:36.560> troops<00:02:36.860> or

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
so when you're using those two troops or

all of it if I have 2 million Gold's in
my<00:04:22.130> storages<00:04:22.700> someone<00:04:23.300> will<00:04:23.419> probably<00:04:23.539> only

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
my storages someone will probably only

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.300 
my storages someone will probably only
be<00:04:24.080> able<00:04:24.289> to<00:04:24.409> get<00:04:24.770> about<00:04:25.250> 200,000

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
be able to get about 200,000

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.100 
be able to get about 200,000
most<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:26.940> really<00:04:27.090> just<00:04:27.330> depends<00:04:27.630> what

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
most and it really just depends what

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.810 
most and it really just depends what
Town<00:04:28.350> Hall<00:04:28.560> level<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:28.980> are<00:04:29.100> in<00:04:29.250> comparison

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
Town Hall level you are in comparison

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.640 
Town Hall level you are in comparison
because<00:04:30.030> there<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:30.360> drop-off<00:04:31.050> range<00:04:31.410> and

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
because there is that drop-off range and

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.470 
because there is that drop-off range and
that's<00:04:32.040> why<00:04:32.280> people<00:04:32.580> don't<00:04:32.790> try<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.030> rush<00:04:33.270> town

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
that's why people don't try to rush town

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.909 
that's why people don't try to rush town
halls<00:04:33.750> these<00:04:33.990> days<00:04:34.169> is<00:04:34.380> because<00:04:34.650> when<00:04:34.800> you're

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
halls these days is because when you're

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.370 
halls these days is because when you're
farming<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:35.790> get<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.210> bonus<00:04:36.600> if<00:04:37.020> you're

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
farming you get a bonus if you're

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.590 
farming you get a bonus if you're
attacking<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:38.160> higher<00:04:38.460> level<00:04:38.850> Town<00:04:39.150> Hall<00:04:39.389> and

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
attacking a higher level Town Hall and

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.990 
attacking a higher level Town Hall and
you<00:04:39.660> get<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.560> little<00:04:41.040> bit<00:04:41.160> of<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.400> penalty<00:04:41.700> if

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
you get a little bit of a penalty if

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.430 
you get a little bit of a penalty if
you're<00:04:42.120> attacking<00:04:42.330> Lower<00:04:42.690> Town<00:04:42.780> Hall's<00:04:43.169> for

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
you're attacking Lower Town Hall's for

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.470 
you're attacking Lower Town Hall's for
loot<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.040> finding<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.490> optimal<00:04:44.880> trophy<00:04:45.270> range

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
loot so finding the optimal trophy range

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.360 
loot so finding the optimal trophy range
can<00:04:45.780> be<00:04:45.810> quite<00:04:46.200> difficult<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:46.889> I<00:04:46.980> find<00:04:47.220> it

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
can be quite difficult and I find it

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.280 
can be quite difficult and I find it
fluctuates<00:04:47.850> especially<00:04:48.389> for<00:04:48.570> me<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:49.139> what<00:04:49.260> I

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
fluctuates especially for me so what I

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.170 
fluctuates especially for me so what I
recommend<00:04:49.440> doing<00:04:49.860> is<00:04:50.100> just<00:04:50.400> do<00:04:50.550> your<00:04:50.820> normal

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
recommend doing is just do your normal

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.090 
recommend doing is just do your normal
attacks<00:04:51.270> see<00:04:51.810> what<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.080> find<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.590> if<00:04:52.919> it's

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
attacks see what you find and if it's

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.760 
attacks see what you find and if it's
worse<00:04:53.370> or<00:04:53.730> if<00:04:54.270> it's<00:04:54.600> better<00:04:54.960> then<00:04:55.500> obviously

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
worse or if it's better then obviously

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.620 
worse or if it's better then obviously
you're<00:04:56.460> doing<00:04:56.490> something<00:04:57.000> right<00:04:57.150> but<00:04:57.300> if<00:04:57.450> it

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
you're doing something right but if it

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.719 
you're doing something right but if it
is<00:04:57.780> worse<00:04:58.080> then<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.680> recommend<00:04:59.130> going<00:04:59.280> up<00:04:59.580> in

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
is worse then I recommend going up in

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.610 
is worse then I recommend going up in
trophies<00:05:00.120> usually<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.720> higher<00:05:00.900> end<00:05:01.229> trophies

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
trophies usually the higher end trophies

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.010 
trophies usually the higher end trophies
you<00:05:01.650> are<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.400> more<00:05:02.580> likely<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:03.479> are<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.660> find

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
you are the more likely you are to find

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.080 
you are the more likely you are to find
good<00:05:04.320> loot<00:05:04.590> but<00:05:04.950> at<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:05.190> same<00:05:05.370> time<00:05:05.669> the<00:05:05.850> lower

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
good loot but at the same time the lower

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.640 
good loot but at the same time the lower
the<00:05:06.360> trophy<00:05:06.750> range<00:05:06.960> where<00:05:07.169> you're<00:05:07.470> more

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
the trophy range where you're more

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.990 
the trophy range where you're more
likely<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:08.010> find<00:05:08.100> people<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:08.669> haven't<00:05:08.850> been

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
likely to find people that haven't been

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.100 
likely to find people that haven't been
playing<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.360> game<00:05:09.479> for<00:05:09.540> a<00:05:09.750> while

playing the game for a while

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.110 
playing the game for a while
so<00:05:10.350> there's<00:05:10.590> kind<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:10.919> split<00:05:11.160> there<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.580> find

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
so there's kind of a split there I find

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.719 
so there's kind of a split there I find
that<00:05:12.240> some<00:05:12.479> people<00:05:12.810> in<00:05:13.080> Crystal<00:05:13.740> often<00:05:14.460> find

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.890 
range for you does take a while guys and
don't<00:05:26.460> expect<00:05:26.760> it<00:05:27.000> to<00:05:27.180> happen<00:05:27.330> right<00:05:27.570> away<00:05:27.720> if

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
don't expect it to happen right away if

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.360 
don't expect it to happen right away if
you're<00:05:28.050> not<00:05:28.169> finding<00:05:28.380> bases<00:05:28.919> and<00:05:29.100> stuff<00:05:29.280> like

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
you're not finding bases and stuff like

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.950 
you're not finding bases and stuff like
that<00:05:29.580> just<00:05:29.729> play<00:05:30.180> around<00:05:30.330> with<00:05:30.570> it<00:05:30.690> because

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
that just play around with it because

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.690 
that just play around with it because
you<00:05:31.229> will<00:05:31.380> eventually<00:05:31.590> find<00:05:32.070> a<00:05:32.190> trophy<00:05:32.490> range

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
you will eventually find a trophy range

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.340 
you will eventually find a trophy range
that<00:05:32.910> works<00:05:33.060> for<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.390> right<00:05:33.810> now<00:05:33.930> I'm<00:05:34.080> in<00:05:34.229> them

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
that works for you right now I'm in them

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.500 
that works for you right now I'm in them
about<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.650> 1900s<00:05:35.340> which<00:05:35.490> I<00:05:35.640> find<00:05:35.940> gold<00:05:36.240> one

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.570 
about the 1900s which I find gold one
and<00:05:36.780> crystal<00:05:37.410> three<00:05:37.590> are<00:05:37.740> really<00:05:38.039> good<00:05:38.250> for

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
and crystal three are really good for

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.640 
and crystal three are really good for
Town<00:05:39.240> Hall<00:05:39.390> 9<00:05:39.600> players<00:05:39.870> right<00:05:40.140> now<00:05:40.200> but

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
Town Hall 9 players right now but

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.140 
Town Hall 9 players right now but
sometimes<00:05:41.039> it<00:05:41.190> really<00:05:41.280> just<00:05:41.580> boils<00:05:41.700> down<00:05:41.970> to

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
sometimes it really just boils down to

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.330 
sometimes it really just boils down to
the<00:05:42.720> elements<00:05:43.169> of<00:05:43.260> luck<00:05:43.590> because<00:05:43.979> finding

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
the elements of luck because finding

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.070 
the elements of luck because finding
bases<00:05:44.729> like<00:05:44.880> these<00:05:45.060> isn't<00:05:45.510> always<00:05:45.600> easy<00:05:45.900> but

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
bases like these isn't always easy but

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.350 
bases like these isn't always easy but
trust<00:05:46.650> me<00:05:46.710> if<00:05:47.039> you're<00:05:47.220> determined<00:05:48.180> you<00:05:48.330> will

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
trust me if you're determined you will

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.240 
trust me if you're determined you will
eventually<00:05:48.660> find<00:05:48.960> them<00:05:49.350> so<00:05:49.740> to<00:05:49.800> talk<00:05:50.190> about

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
eventually find them so to talk about

look<00:06:08.760> for<00:06:08.940> it<00:06:09.030> so<00:06:09.180> much<00:06:09.360> just<00:06:09.600> because<00:06:09.750> I<00:06:09.900> find

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
look for it so much just because I find

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.960 
look for it so much just because I find
that<00:06:10.410> it<00:06:10.620> does<00:06:10.770> go<00:06:11.010> up<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:11.520> down<00:06:11.669> and

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
with dark elixir you will get quite a

with dark elixir you will get quite a
bit<00:06:26.940> this<00:06:27.270> one<00:06:27.510> for<00:06:27.660> example<00:06:28.020> I<00:06:28.080> wouldn't<00:06:28.320> get

bit this one for example I wouldn't get

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.960 
bit this one for example I wouldn't get
that<00:06:28.560> much<00:06:28.770> but<00:06:28.979> most<00:06:29.190> of<00:06:29.280> it<00:06:29.430> was<00:06:29.610> in<00:06:29.669> his

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
that much but most of it was in his

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.879 
that much but most of it was in his
collectors<00:06:30.419> but<00:06:30.900> the<00:06:31.110> ones<00:06:31.350> where<00:06:31.590> they<00:06:31.710> have

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
collectors but the ones where they have

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.040 
collectors but the ones where they have
really<00:06:32.400> stocked<00:06:32.729> full<00:06:33.000> storages<00:06:33.780> that<00:06:33.960> you

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
really stocked full storages that you

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.110 
really stocked full storages that you
can<00:06:34.229> see<00:06:34.440> drop<00:06:34.979> a<00:06:35.010> few<00:06:35.220> lightnings<00:06:35.610> on<00:06:35.789> it<00:06:35.940> and

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
can see drop a few lightnings on it and

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.430 
can see drop a few lightnings on it and
you're<00:06:36.270> definitely<00:06:36.539> going<00:06:36.930> to<00:06:36.990> get<00:06:37.080> some<00:06:37.260> dark
