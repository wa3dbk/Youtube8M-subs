00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.759 

what's<00:03:33.940> that<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:36.000> think<00:03:37.000> this<00:03:37.120> will<00:03:37.269> require

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
what's that I think this will require

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.339 
what's that I think this will require
the<00:03:38.769> base<00:03:38.980> screws<00:03:39.400> on<00:03:39.609> the<00:03:40.209> four<00:03:40.510> screws<00:03:40.840> also

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
the base screws on the four screws also

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.210 
the base screws on the four screws also
included<00:03:44.190> two<00:03:45.190> on<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.519> right<00:03:45.670> until<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.450> left

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
included two on the right until the left

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.360 
included two on the right until the left
use<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.370> Phillips<00:03:48.609> head<00:03:48.849> so<00:03:50.190> let's<00:03:51.190> make<00:03:51.340> sure

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
use a Phillips head so let's make sure

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.830 
use a Phillips head so let's make sure
you<00:03:51.549> have<00:03:51.669> it<00:03:51.819> nice<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.359> tight<00:03:54.030> or<00:03:55.030> else<00:03:55.209> it's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
you have it nice and tight or else it's

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.370 
you have it nice and tight or else it's
just<00:03:56.109> going<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.380> tip<00:03:56.560> over<00:03:56.709> forward<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:58.380> there

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
just going to tip over forward and there

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.740 
just going to tip over forward and there
goes<00:03:59.590> your<00:03:59.970> new<00:04:00.970> TV

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.000 

so<00:04:04.750> if<00:04:04.810> ice<00:04:04.930> pretty<00:04:05.139> lights<00:04:05.410> all<00:04:05.650> together

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
so if ice pretty lights all together

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.000 
so if ice pretty lights all together
with<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.310> base<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.730> weighs<00:04:06.849> about<00:04:06.970> 57<00:04:07.450> pounds

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
with the base it weighs about 57 pounds

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.970 
with the base it weighs about 57 pounds
so<00:04:09.010> from<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.220> 55<00:04:09.639> inch<00:04:09.669> TV<00:04:10.060> this<00:04:10.269> is<00:04:10.329> actually<00:04:10.980> so

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
so from a 55 inch TV this is actually so

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.089 
so from a 55 inch TV this is actually so
the<00:04:12.700> back<00:04:12.879> panel<00:04:13.269> of<00:04:13.329> your<00:04:13.480> TV<00:04:13.959> you<00:04:14.620> have<00:04:14.829> your

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
the back panel of your TV you have your

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.370 
the back panel of your TV you have your
land<00:04:15.430> input<00:04:15.790> which<00:04:16.630> basically<00:04:16.989> is<00:04:17.199> for

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
land input which basically is for

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.909 
land input which basically is for
Ethernet<00:04:17.799> you've<00:04:18.549> got<00:04:18.789> your<00:04:18.970> avian<00:04:19.919> and

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
Ethernet you've got your avian and

Ethernet you've got your avian and
optical<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.609> got<00:04:22.270> ups<00:04:22.449> go<00:04:22.599> out<00:04:22.830> antenna<00:04:23.830> if

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
optical and got ups go out antenna if

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.120 
optical and got ups go out antenna if
you<00:04:24.099> still<00:04:24.310> use<00:04:24.490> that<00:04:24.930> headphone<00:04:25.930> jack<00:04:26.260> and

it's<00:05:20.459> not<00:05:20.580> automatic<00:05:21.059> so<00:05:21.449> you<00:05:21.479> have<00:05:21.929> to

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
it's not automatic so you have to

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.749 
it's not automatic so you have to
manually<00:05:22.349> pull<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:22.860> up<00:05:22.979> pull<00:05:23.249> it<00:05:23.279> down

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
of course pulling it down so you can

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.449 
of course pulling it down so you can
protect<00:05:25.349> from<00:05:25.469> dust<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:26.099> things<00:05:26.219> like<00:05:26.399> that
