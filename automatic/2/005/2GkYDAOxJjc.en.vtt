00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
and a quarter down from the top the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.180 
and a quarter down from the top the
stitching<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:32.880> should<00:00:33.480> always<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:34.190> very

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
stitching here should always be very

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.430 
stitching here should always be very
uniform<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.540> keeping<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.170> rest<00:00:37.290> of

uniform and in keeping with the rest of
the<00:00:37.530> stitching<00:00:37.950> what<00:00:38.879> you'll<00:00:39.030> find<00:00:39.300> often

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the stitching what you'll find often

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.080 
the stitching what you'll find often
with<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> fakes<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.579> manufacture

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
with the fakes is that they manufacture

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
with the fakes is that they manufacture
the<00:00:42.540> jeans<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:43.079> they<00:00:43.200> put<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.559> label<00:00:44.100> in

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the jeans and then they put the label in

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.049 
the jeans and then they put the label in
afterwards<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.320> happens<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.370> day

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
afterwards so what happens is the day

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.970 
afterwards so what happens is the day
unpick<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> stitching<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.260> they<00:00:49.680> stitch

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
unpick the stitching and they stitch

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.729 
unpick the stitching and they stitch
back<00:00:50.250> over<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.640> top<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.350> look<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.559> for

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
back over the top and look out for

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.229 
back over the top and look out for
things<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.250> different<00:00:53.699> colored<00:00:53.969> stick

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
things like a different colored stick

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.270 
things like a different colored stick
tune<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.690> even<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:55.949> doesn't<00:00:56.039> look

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
tune or even if it just doesn't look

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.220 
tune or even if it just doesn't look
quite<00:00:56.520> right<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:57.180> not<00:00:57.360> stray<00:00:57.750> or<00:00:58.050> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
quite right it's not stray or it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.139 
quite right it's not stray or it's
there's<00:00:58.829> two<00:00:58.980> bigger<00:00:59.250> gaps<00:00:59.550> between<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
there's two bigger gaps between the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.500 
there's two bigger gaps between the
stitches<00:01:02.870> these<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.619> pair<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.189> has<00:01:05.670> Levi's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
stitches these this pair here has Levi's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.179 
stitches these this pair here has Levi's
and<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.680> small<00:01:07.950> registered<00:01:08.460> marking<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
and the small registered marking on and

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
and the small registered marking on and
one<00:01:11.189> obvious<00:01:11.939> thing<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.420> I've<00:01:12.720> seen<00:01:12.960> with

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
one obvious thing that I've seen with

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.870 
one obvious thing that I've seen with
fakes<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.860> they<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.490> Levi's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
fakes is that they can just have Levi's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.050 
fakes is that they can just have Levi's
without<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> S<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.130> that's<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.310> definite

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
without the S on and that's a definite

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
without the S on and that's a definite
indicator<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.140> pair<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> fake

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
indicator that it's a pair of fake

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.390 
indicator that it's a pair of fake
Levi's<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:22.470> pair<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.220> does<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
Levi's this pair here just does a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.730 
Levi's this pair here just does a
registered<00:01:23.970> mark<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.229> one

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
registered mark on that's because one

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130 
registered mark on that's because one
out<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.890> every<00:01:26.130> hundred<00:01:26.400> pairs<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.810> is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
out of every hundred pairs that is

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.460 
out of every hundred pairs that is
manufactured<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.750> they<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.079> change<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
manufactured and they have to change the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
manufactured and they have to change the
ribbon<00:01:31.619> over<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> machine<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.820> they<00:01:33.150> run

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
ribbon over on the machine and they run

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.620 
ribbon over on the machine and they run
through<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.259> label<00:01:35.009> without<00:01:35.460> putting<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
through and a label without putting the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.530 
through and a label without putting the
the<00:01:36.659> Levi's<00:01:37.619> stitching<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.299> that's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the Levi's stitching on so that that's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.069 
the Levi's stitching on so that that's
fine<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.860> got<00:01:40.979> an<00:01:41.070> iron<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.079> moving

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
fine if it's just got an iron and moving

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.560 
fine if it's just got an iron and moving
on<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.439> label<00:01:43.909> you<00:01:44.909> should<00:01:45.060> always<00:01:45.210> find

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
on to the label you should always find

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.149 
on to the label you should always find
that<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.070> model<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.820> width<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.390> leg

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
that the model and the width and leg

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.069 
that the model and the width and leg
waist<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.399> leg<00:01:50.549> measurements<00:01:51.360> are<00:01:51.540> always<00:01:51.960> in

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
waist and leg measurements are always in

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.130 
waist and leg measurements are always in
black<00:01:52.320> text<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.549> that's<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.750> they<00:01:54.869> print

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
black text and that's because they print

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.679 
black text and that's because they print
nails<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.820> afterwards<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.119> make<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.420> label

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
nails on afterwards they make the label

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.240 
nails on afterwards they make the label
at<00:01:57.780> first<00:01:58.079> put<00:01:58.320> them<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> Jean<00:01:58.860> stitch

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250

at first put them on the Jean stitch
stitch<00:02:00.030> around<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:00.810> print<00:02:01.110> knee

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
stitch around and then they print knee

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.029 
stitch around and then they print knee
and<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:03.210> style<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.960> sizes<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:07.039> one

other thing to look out for is on the
501s<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.810> quality<00:02:13.290> clothing

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
501s the quality clothing

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.600 
501s the quality clothing
XX<00:02:14.550> should<00:02:15.090> be<00:02:15.350> curved<00:02:16.350> down<00:02:16.890> once<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.400> this

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
XX should be curved down once like this

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.949 
XX should be curved down once like this
in<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.420> sort<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.110> upside-down<00:02:19.410> arch

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
in a in a sort of upside-down arch

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.120 
in a in a sort of upside-down arch
you'll<00:02:21.959> find<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.470> newer<00:02:22.650> styles

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
you'll find with the newer styles

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.110 
you'll find with the newer styles
they're<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> lot<00:02:23.790> more<00:02:23.819> uniform<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.670> it's<00:02:26.670> not

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
they're a lot more uniform and it's not

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.740 
they're a lot more uniform and it's not
a<00:02:27.150> definite<00:02:27.569> indicator<00:02:29.480> generally<00:02:30.480> because

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
a definite indicator generally because

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.030 
a definite indicator generally because
there's<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.020> many<00:02:31.170> different<00:02:31.500> styles<00:02:31.709> it's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
there's that many different styles it's

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.090 
there's that many different styles it's
difficult<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.610> remember<00:02:33.030> where<00:02:33.840> which<00:02:34.290> which

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
difficult to remember where which which

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.550 
difficult to remember where which which
gene<00:02:35.520> should<00:02:35.790> have<00:02:35.940> which<00:02:36.120> style<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.750> I'd

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
gene should have which style so I'd

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.400 
gene should have which style so I'd
maybe<00:02:37.950> leave<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:38.970> back<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.570> just<00:02:39.840> just

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
maybe leave the back of that just just

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.309 
maybe leave the back of that just just
look<00:02:40.560> at<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.940> color<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.300> printed<00:02:43.110> text

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
look at the color of the printed text

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.390 
look at the color of the printed text
and<00:02:44.989> one<00:02:45.989> other<00:02:46.140> thing<00:02:46.470> actually<00:02:46.739> with<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
and one other thing actually with the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.220 
and one other thing actually with the
label<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.450> color<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.400> brown<00:02:51.120> color<00:02:51.420> of

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
label is the color of the brown color of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.460 
label is the color of the brown color of
the<00:02:52.380> label<00:02:52.530> itself<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.630> if<00:02:54.630> it's<00:02:54.959> very<00:02:55.170> dark

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
the label itself and if it's very dark

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.560 
the label itself and if it's very dark
in<00:02:55.709> color<00:02:55.980> that's<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.700> pretty<00:02:56.910> good<00:02:57.120> indicator

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
in color that's a pretty good indicator

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.770 
in color that's a pretty good indicator
that<00:02:57.690> it's<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:58.140> fake<00:02:59.090> also<00:03:00.090> if<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:00.330> white<00:03:00.570> in

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
that it's a fake also if it's white in

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.420 
that it's a fake also if it's white in
color<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.320> generally<00:03:01.760> not<00:03:02.760> genuine<00:03:03.209> per<00:03:03.450> and

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
color it's generally not genuine per and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.640 
color it's generally not genuine per and
these<00:03:05.430> sort<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.390> four<00:03:06.660> pairs<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.140> denim<00:03:07.620> jeans

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
these sort of four pairs of denim jeans

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.150 
these sort of four pairs of denim jeans
that<00:03:08.010> I've<00:03:08.130> got<00:03:08.340> here<00:03:08.489> are<00:03:08.700> all<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.000> different

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
that I've got here are all in different

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.310 
that I've got here are all in different
states<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.400> repair<00:03:12.390> if<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:12.840> these<00:03:13.050> are

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
states of repair if you like these are

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.259 
states of repair if you like these are
being<00:03:14.250> worn<00:03:14.340> twice<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:15.000> think

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
being worn twice I think

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.280 
being worn twice I think
and<00:03:15.440> so<00:03:16.440> this<00:03:16.620> labels<00:03:17.310> pretty<00:03:17.519> neat<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.290> you

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
and so this labels pretty neat and you

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.259 
and so this labels pretty neat and you
can<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.100> five<00:03:20.310> are<00:03:20.489> ones<00:03:20.730> which<00:03:21.030> have

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
can see the five are ones which have

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.660 
can see the five are ones which have
worn<00:03:21.860> for<00:03:22.860> about<00:03:23.070> five<00:03:23.310> years

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
worn for about five years

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.120 
worn for about five years
the<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:26.100> edging<00:03:26.549> sort<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:26.970> very<00:03:27.799> worn<00:03:28.799> on<00:03:28.980> it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130

with these five one two is here the logo
itself<00:03:37.350> fades<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.220> color<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.790> label
