00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.119 
why we're here Corvette this is the 1984
now<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.420> guys<00:00:45.570> remember<00:00:45.840> correctly<00:00:46.559> there

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
now if you guys remember correctly there

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.029 
now if you guys remember correctly there
was<00:00:47.309> no<00:00:47.520> 1983<00:00:48.270> Corvette<00:00:49.260> that's<00:00:49.710> because

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
was no 1983 Corvette that's because

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.310 
was no 1983 Corvette that's because
there<00:00:50.219> were<00:00:50.340> parts<00:00:50.820> supply<00:00:51.180> delays<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.170> this

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
there were parts supply delays so this

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.130 
there were parts supply delays so this
became<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.829> 1984<00:00:53.610> Corvette<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.870> this

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
became the 1984 Corvette and what this

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.310 
became the 1984 Corvette and what this
was<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:56.219> an<00:00:56.340> entirely<00:00:56.820> new<00:00:57.390> departure<00:00:58.109> for

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
