having<00:00:50.040> a<00:00:50.100> bit<00:00:50.220> of<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> tough<00:00:50.520> run<00:00:50.700> at<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
having a bit of a tough run at the

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.580 
having a bit of a tough run at the
moment<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.330> still<00:00:51.990> think<00:00:52.230> they're<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.470> of<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
moment I still think they're one of the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.290 
moment I still think they're one of the
premier<00:00:52.980> squads<00:00:53.400> in<00:00:53.580> this<00:00:53.700> thing<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.150> can

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
premier squads in this thing if they can

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
premier squads in this thing if they can
just<00:00:54.450> turn<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.720> around<00:00:54.810> I<00:00:55.290> think<00:00:56.130> England<00:00:56.400> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
just turn it around I think England a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.900 
just turn it around I think England a
building<00:00:57.260> you<00:00:58.260> saw<00:00:59.010> France<00:00:59.370> obviously<00:00:59.760> what

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
building you saw France obviously what

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.640 
building you saw France obviously what
they<00:01:00.000> did<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> us<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> work<00:01:00.840> first<00:01:01.200> game<00:01:01.470> I

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
they did to us in the work first game I

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.750 
they did to us in the work first game I
think<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.920> probably<00:01:02.100> got<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> best<00:01:02.430> set

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
think they probably got the best set

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.219 
think they probably got the best set
piece<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.240> of<00:01:03.360> any<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.630> sides<00:01:03.870> going

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
piece out of any of the sides going

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.920 
piece out of any of the sides going
round<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.430> um<00:01:05.610> look<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.330> hard<00:01:06.600> pressed<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930

each<00:01:10.320> other<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.799> fair<00:01:11.070> run<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> moment<00:01:11.820> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
each other a fair run at the moment and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.609 
each other a fair run at the moment and
anyone<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.810> knock<00:01:12.990> anyone<00:01:13.890> off<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:15.150> um

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.410 
so I think I may be in the Christmas
holidays<00:01:29.429> when<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.609> get<00:01:29.789> up<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.090> might<00:01:30.299> be

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
a bit of a trim and that'll probably

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.279 
a bit of a trim and that'll probably
involve<00:01:32.969> shaving<00:01:33.359> the<00:01:33.450> mall<00:01:33.630> off<00:01:33.780> too<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.200> I'm

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
roof over the top me right

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.380 
roof over the top me right
on<00:02:28.950> top<00:02:29.130> it's<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> great<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.849> ground<00:02:30.060> made

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390
