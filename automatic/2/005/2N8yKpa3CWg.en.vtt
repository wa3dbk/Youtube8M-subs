00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
out so they have the perception of being

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
others I just went with the black

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.390 
others I just went with the black
because<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.960> neutral<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.070> goes<00:02:20.190> well

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
because it's neutral and it goes well

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.010 
because it's neutral and it goes well
with<00:02:20.550> my<00:02:20.580> phone<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.330> I'm<00:02:21.570> gonna<00:02:21.660> put<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.960> on

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
with my phone so I'm gonna put it on

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.710 
with my phone so I'm gonna put it on
right<00:02:22.260> now<00:02:22.410> just<00:02:22.680> installed<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.490> it's<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> very

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
right now just installed it it's a very

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.920 
right now just installed it it's a very
snug<00:02:25.410> fit<00:02:25.710> which<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.490> something<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.910> want<00:02:27.270> in

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
snug fit which is something you want in

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.410 
snug fit which is something you want in
a<00:02:28.080> bumper<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.500> don't<00:02:28.650> want<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.100> loose

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
a bumper you don't want it to be loose

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.600 
a bumper you don't want it to be loose
the<00:02:30.420> reason<00:02:30.630> why<00:02:30.750> I'm<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.930> big<00:02:31.110> fan<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.650> not

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
the reason why I'm a big fan of this not

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.360 
the reason why I'm a big fan of this not
just<00:02:32.880> for<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.300> protection<00:02:33.870> but<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.920> buttons

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
just for the protection but the buttons

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.120 
just for the protection but the buttons
so<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.300> get<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.350> easier<00:02:38.270> way<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.830> depress<00:02:40.830> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
so you get a easier way to depress the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.490 
so you get a easier way to depress the
power<00:02:41.940> button<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.530> volume<00:02:43.560> keys

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
power button and the volume keys

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.900 
power button and the volume keys
something<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:46.980> noticed<00:02:47.190> with<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.580> iPhone

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
something that I noticed with the iPhone

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.630 
something that I noticed with the iPhone
it's<00:02:48.090> really<00:02:48.870> hard<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.230> press<00:02:49.470> them<00:02:49.710> they're

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
it's really hard to press them they're

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.620

almost<00:02:51.270> as<00:02:51.660> bad<00:02:51.810> as<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.050> Nexus<00:02:52.410> 9<00:02:52.470> but<00:02:53.630> this

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
almost as bad as the Nexus 9 but this

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.720 
almost as bad as the Nexus 9 but this
gives<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.140> tactile<00:02:55.970> response<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:58.730> can

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
gives you that tactile response that can

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.420 
gives you that tactile response that can
definitely<00:03:00.000> help

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
where the volume rocker is and you cut

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.469 
where the volume rocker is and you cut
out<00:04:26.280> for<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:27.590> mute<00:04:28.590> switch<00:04:29.180> there's<00:04:30.180> this

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
out for the mute switch there's this

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.189 
out for the mute switch there's this
right<00:04:30.750> here<00:04:31.050> now<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:32.099> don't<00:04:32.820> know<00:04:33.060> why<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:33.690> is

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
right here now I don't know why this is

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.510 
right here now I don't know why this is
here<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.800> don't<00:04:34.830> know<00:04:34.979> if<00:04:35.039> they<00:04:35.130> wanted<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.400> go

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
here I don't know if they wanted to go

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.060 
here I don't know if they wanted to go
for<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.789> two-tone<00:04:36.300> kind<00:04:36.599> of<00:04:36.780> thing<00:04:36.990> but<00:04:37.740> this<00:04:38.010> is

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
for a two-tone kind of thing but this is

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.760 
for a two-tone kind of thing but this is
the<00:04:38.550> weakest<00:04:39.150> part<00:04:39.479> of<00:04:39.599> the<00:04:39.750> entire<00:04:40.169> bumper

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
the weakest part of the entire bumper

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.839 
the weakest part of the entire bumper
it's<00:04:41.669> very<00:04:41.970> flexible<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:44.460> don't<00:04:44.639> know<00:04:44.729> if

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
it's very flexible and I don't know if

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.670 
it's very flexible and I don't know if
they<00:04:45.000> did<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.479> make<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.110> easier<00:04:46.440> for<00:04:46.470> you

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
they did that to make it easier for you

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.140 
they did that to make it easier for you
to<00:04:46.740> put<00:04:46.949> on<00:04:46.979> cuz<00:04:47.310> it's<00:04:47.490> kind<00:04:47.669> of<00:04:47.699> hard<00:04:47.909> to<00:04:47.940> put

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
to put on cuz it's kind of hard to put

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.579 
to put on cuz it's kind of hard to put
on<00:04:48.240> but<00:04:49.789> when<00:04:50.789> I<00:04:50.849> put<00:04:51.090> this<00:04:51.240> on

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:52.589 
on but when I put this on

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:55.369 
on but when I put this on
plugging<00:04:53.309> a<00:04:53.399> struggle<00:04:53.939> to<00:04:54.029> put<00:04:54.179> it<00:04:54.269> on<00:04:54.389> on<00:04:55.319> a

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
it so there's a cool concept but one

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.500 
it so there's a cool concept but one
thing<00:06:47.230> that<00:06:47.260> I've<00:06:47.500> learned<00:06:47.910> when<00:06:48.910> it<00:06:49.060> comes<00:06:49.270> to

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
thing that I've learned when it comes to

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.770 
thing that I've learned when it comes to
accessories<00:06:50.370> if<00:06:51.370> it's<00:06:51.580> not<00:06:51.730> from<00:06:51.940> Apple<00:06:52.360> it's

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
accessories if it's not from Apple it's

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.600 
accessories if it's not from Apple it's
not<00:06:53.230> going<00:06:53.650> to<00:06:53.830> fit<00:06:55.710> as<00:06:56.710> it<00:06:56.980> was<00:06:57.100> intended<00:06:57.490> to

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
not going to fit as it was intended to

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.520 
not going to fit as it was intended to
there's<00:06:57.880> gonna<00:06:58.000> be<00:06:58.270> that<00:06:58.810> slight<00:06:59.200> chance

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
there's gonna be that slight chance

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.230 
there's gonna be that slight chance
that's<00:06:59.860> not<00:07:00.070> gonna<00:07:00.190> give<00:07:00.400> you<00:07:00.490> a<00:07:00.550> nice<00:07:00.760> tight
