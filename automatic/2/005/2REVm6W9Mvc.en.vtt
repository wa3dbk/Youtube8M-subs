with<00:01:10.090> small<00:01:10.330> maps<00:01:10.510> that<00:01:10.660> you're<00:01:10.810> used<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.140> we

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
with small maps that you're used to we

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.840 
with small maps that you're used to we
really<00:01:11.770> give<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:11.980> this<00:01:12.130> huge<00:01:12.400> playground

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
really give you this huge playground

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.820 
really give you this huge playground
you're<00:01:13.300> not<00:01:13.450> constrained<00:01:14.110> by<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.410> normal

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
you're not constrained by the normal

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.850 
you're not constrained by the normal
boundaries<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.250> unit<00:01:15.610> c<00:01:15.820> with<00:01:16.120> map<00:01:16.450> design

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
boundaries that unit c with map design

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.109 
boundaries that unit c with map design
so<00:01:17.860> while<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:18.070> may<00:01:18.220> start<00:01:18.520> out<00:01:18.670> on<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.880> coast

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
so while you may start out on the coast

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.940 
so while you may start out on the coast

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
maybe to a farm and then even further

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.800
