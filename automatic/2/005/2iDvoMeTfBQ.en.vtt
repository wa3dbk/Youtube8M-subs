00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.250
 you have to meditate friends of youtube like 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.900
 they are waiting for me very well 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.790
 hi friends today 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.400
 I'm just going to show you in a 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.800
 video is something quick a subject that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.230
 just updated for the 17th of this 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.060
 theme is called 'no such as they hear it 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.040
 it's called I 'm going and so this topic what 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.710
 you are mainly icons 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.300
 modified or customized in color 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.579
 white how can you see we have what 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.200
 which is the application of messages and good 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.600
 it's practically not going to change all 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.220
 icons that default crop brings 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.810
 a few will not change us 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.370
 it's just going to leave us just like 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.820
 they are but as you can see several and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.760
 known and we change it and then almost 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.490
 completely and well this topic and has 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.829
 a weight I think of 10 12 miles 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.680
 around that and we can also 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.930
 download a small pack of widgets that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.370
 We can configure to our liking in 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.079
 this case I 'm going to show you 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.880
 we just passed an application towards 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.340
 upstairs to allow me to put another 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.400
 page and we simply give cap on the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.070
 screen and well as you can see here 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.440
 they give many types of widgets for this 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.640
 theme when I put 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.110
 this cycle that we add and there we are 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.659
 add a watch 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.609
 well 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.829
 it looks good also in white 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:32.340
 we can also eat a kind of 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.710
 animations with images 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.240
 on this side to give enough 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.979
 ok these widgets 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.890
 but also take into account that 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.340
 the more types of widget they have 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.430
 you then more will consume what is 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.820
 the battery here can also see what 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.740
 which is a weather widget and still 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.119
 is loading but I do not know if it's going to 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.070
 load well since I do not have much 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.590
 internet and then how can you see this 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.149
 type of aluche is very very good 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.350
 can not see this the widget 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.080
 photography where he was passing images is 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.479
 pretty good it looks very good and like 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.410
 can see in the added several images 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.150
 in this type of widgets and good for that 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.069
 simply so that you can 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.959
 have the theme we're just going to have 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.640
 that add a small repo that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.230
 I will leave in the direction of the video 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.000
 for you to have it and once you 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.610
 they add simply we are going to look for 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.239
 by the name of both and how can you see 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.350
 there we have that 'no radius of 7 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.299
 it just makes a small effort 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.040
 up to the subject and on the top in 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.230
 of pressure modify you are going to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.480
 appear to install and also confirm 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.790
 this topic and that goal 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.590
 it will download what is winterboard 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.230
 and we can also tell you how 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.209
 download what is a small pad and 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.640
 Well, if you have an iphone or a 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.159
 ipod download this one that says' there's no 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.739
 iphone widget and I this destination in a 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:01.120
 ipad then say do this that says 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:04.209
 something we will be able to see this as 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.410
 says' no color keyboard I use these 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.299
 are for versions prior to 17 and 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.910
 Well, you can also download 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.890
 this paraguay pad theme and good as you 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.780
 I say simply give it to download 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.489
 thin download to winter because 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.370
 we're just going to direct some 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.190
 I have to activate it 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.610
 and we go here and how can they see us 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.170
 they are going to download two or three types of folders 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.030
 so to speak simply 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.640
 we select the main theme that is 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.730
 the subject that is up but those that are 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.590
 the icons brings us two types of icons 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.599
 I put this that you can steal 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.860
 because it was logos that they like and 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.390
 we are simply going to see that they are 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.980
 small answer but we did so that 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.590
 grow to apply the change of 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.720
 topic and then since I came back I had to 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.790
 apply them so that their icons look 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.900
