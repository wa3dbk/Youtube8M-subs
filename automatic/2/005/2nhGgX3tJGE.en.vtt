preview<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.800> when<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.040> using<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> PC<00:00:35.760> gameplay

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
preview is when we using the PC gameplay

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.880 
preview is when we using the PC gameplay
because<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.690> PC<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.140> few<00:00:37.320> plates<00:00:37.559> ahead<00:00:37.800> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
because the PC is a few plates ahead of

hardened<00:01:20.400> clay<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.880> die<00:01:21.119> together<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
hardened clay and a die together in the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.510 
hardened clay and a die together in the
column<00:01:22.110> table<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.860> then<00:01:22.979> make<00:01:23.159> stained

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
column table you can then make stained

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.980 
column table you can then make stained
clay<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.030> stained<00:01:24.330> clay<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.659> where<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.900> gets

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
clay and stained clay is where it gets

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.149 
clay and stained clay is where it gets
really<00:01:25.409> cool<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.740> my<00:01:25.770> opinion

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
really cool in my opinion

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.410 
really cool in my opinion
and<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.520> why<00:01:26.640> builders<00:01:27.119> should<00:01:27.150> be

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and this is why builders should be

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.090 
and this is why builders should be
really<00:01:27.689> excited<00:01:28.080> because<00:01:28.409> basically<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
really excited because basically a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.069 
really excited because basically a
stained<00:01:29.579> clay<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.240> new<00:01:30.450> alternative<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
stained clay is a new alternative to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.810 
stained clay is a new alternative to

make sense whereas we make a house have
whoa<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.819> just<00:02:33.000> looks<00:02:33.150> fake<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.810> weird<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
whoa it just looks fake and weird and

whoa it just looks fake and weird and
you<00:02:34.680> know<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:34.920> not<00:02:35.069> particularly<00:02:35.310> likeable

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
you know it's not particularly likeable

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.640 
you know it's not particularly likeable
so<00:02:36.060> yeah<00:02:36.780> that's<00:02:36.989> what's<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.319> be<00:02:37.470> going

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
so yeah that's what's going to be going

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.240 
so yeah that's what's going to be going
on<00:02:37.890> with<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.640> stain<00:02:39.209> claim<00:02:39.450> or<00:02:39.630> not<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.019> um

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
basically now we'll be going into how

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.210 
basically now we'll be going into how
you<00:02:42.989> actually<00:02:43.170> make<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:43.620> because<00:02:43.920> it's<00:02:44.129> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
you actually make it because it's a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.680 
you actually make it because it's a
slightly<00:02:44.489> complex<00:02:44.819> process<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.390> takes<00:02:45.540> quite

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
slightly complex process it takes quite

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.750 
slightly complex process it takes quite
a<00:02:45.780> few<00:02:45.959> steps<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:47.040> not<00:02:47.190> quite<00:02:47.400> as<00:02:47.610> easy

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
a few steps and it's not quite as easy

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.460 
a few steps and it's not quite as easy
as<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.030> might<00:02:48.150> imagine<00:02:48.299> see<00:02:49.170> yeah<00:02:49.290> let's

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
as you might imagine see yeah let's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.259 
as you might imagine see yeah let's
quickly<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:49.769> head<00:02:50.340> over<00:02:50.370> hits<00:02:50.730> some<00:02:50.940> Clayton

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
quickly just head over hits some Clayton

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.370 
quickly just head over hits some Clayton
let's<00:02:51.360> show<00:02:51.569> so<00:02:51.720> first<00:02:51.959> fort<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.290> gonna

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
let's show so first fort you're gonna

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.259 
let's show so first fort you're gonna
want<00:02:52.590> some<00:02:52.620> clay<00:02:52.980> I've<00:02:53.340> used<00:02:53.549> us<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.150> know

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
want some clay I've used us you know

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.809 
want some clay I've used us you know
silk<00:02:54.510> touch<00:02:55.349> pickaxe<00:02:55.799> or<00:02:56.099> axe<00:02:56.400> or<00:02:56.579> whatever

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
silk touch pickaxe or axe or whatever

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.460 
silk touch pickaxe or axe or whatever
this<00:02:57.030> make<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.360> easier<00:02:57.569> but<00:02:57.599> for<00:02:58.110> now<00:02:58.200> we'll

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
this make it easier but for now we'll

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.470 
this make it easier but for now we'll
just<00:02:58.500> zoom<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:58.920> don't<00:02:59.160> Clay<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.670> found<00:03:00.000> at<00:03:00.209> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
just zoom you don't Clay is found at the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.390 
just zoom you don't Clay is found at the
edge<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.930> near<00:03:01.260> water<00:03:01.530> essentially<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.310> can

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
edge like near water essentially you can

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.530 
edge like near water essentially you can
usually<00:03:02.519> find<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.880> underwater<00:03:03.090> like<00:03:03.360> there's

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
usually find it underwater like there's

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.420 
usually find it underwater like there's
a<00:03:03.599> patch<00:03:03.780> just<00:03:04.049> there<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.890> can<00:03:05.010> also<00:03:05.130> find<00:03:05.280> it

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
a patch just there you can also find it

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.430 
a patch just there you can also find it
near<00:03:05.610> beaches<00:03:05.940> like<00:03:06.299> this<00:03:06.599> and<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.230> will<00:03:07.290> get

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
near beaches like this and it will get

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.470 
near beaches like this and it will get
sixty<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> shall<00:03:08.130> get<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> tena<00:03:08.579> fit<00:03:08.819> because<00:03:09.120> you

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
sixty I shall get a tena fit because you

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.479 
sixty I shall get a tena fit because you
need<00:03:09.630> at<00:03:09.780> least<00:03:09.810> like<00:03:10.650> eight<00:03:10.860> blocks<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.310> play

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
need at least like eight blocks of play

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.100 
need at least like eight blocks of play
the<00:03:11.910> list<00:03:12.090> have<00:03:12.269> really<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.540> effective<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.019> get

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
the list have really be effective to get

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.289 
the list have really be effective to get
stainless<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.799> we've<00:03:14.040> got<00:03:14.220> 32<00:03:14.700> little<00:03:15.150> clay

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
stainless so we've got 32 little clay

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.420 
stainless so we've got 32 little clay
bit<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.720> smoke<00:03:16.230> clears<00:03:16.470> it's<00:03:16.530> cool<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:17.310> we're

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
bit so smoke clears it's cool and we're

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.099 
bit so smoke clears it's cool and we're
gonna<00:03:17.519> put<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.209> furnace<00:03:18.660> right<00:03:18.930> now

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
gonna put this in the furnace right now

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.390 
gonna put this in the furnace right now
so<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.440> mean<00:03:19.620> we're<00:03:19.769> not<00:03:19.829> can<00:03:19.980> put<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.160> in<00:03:20.280> but

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
so I mean we're not can put this in but

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.680 
so I mean we're not can put this in but
can<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.579> put<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.880> crafting<00:03:21.239> table<00:03:21.510> and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
can you put this in crafting table and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.030 
can you put this in crafting table and
we're<00:03:21.989> gonna<00:03:22.079> make<00:03:22.290> ourselves<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:23.010> little

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
we're gonna make ourselves a little

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.030 
we're gonna make ourselves a little
block<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.150> clay<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.690> basically<00:03:25.380> clay<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.739> made

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
block of clay so basically clay is made

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.069 
block of clay so basically clay is made
with<00:03:26.250> four<00:03:26.519> blocks<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.819> clay<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.209> right<00:03:27.959> now

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
with four blocks of clay and right now

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.170 
with four blocks of clay and right now
you<00:03:28.139> do<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.920> then<00:03:29.760> what<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.940> know<00:03:30.060> what

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
you do that and then what you know what

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.000 
you do that and then what you know what
to<00:03:30.239> do<00:03:30.329> is<00:03:30.510> put<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.900> clay<00:03:31.079> in<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.560> form<00:03:31.859> in

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
to do is put the clay in that form in

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.309 
to do is put the clay in that form in
the<00:03:32.340> furnace<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.030> once<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:33.600> place<00:03:33.810> melts<00:03:34.230> in

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
the furnace so once this place melts in

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.780 
the furnace so once this place melts in
the<00:03:34.410> furnace<00:03:34.739> you'll<00:03:34.920> end<00:03:35.069> up<00:03:35.130> with<00:03:35.280> hardened

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the furnace you'll end up with hardened

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.129 
the furnace you'll end up with hardened
clay<00:03:36.000> edge<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.389> can<00:03:36.480> see<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.720> takes<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.989> while

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
clay edge you can see it takes a while

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.420 
clay edge you can see it takes a while
because<00:03:37.500> obviously<00:03:37.650> that's<00:03:37.980> how<00:03:38.069> burns<00:03:38.280> this

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
because obviously that's how burns this

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.640 
because obviously that's how burns this
works<00:03:38.609> so<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:39.060> harden<00:03:39.600> plate<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.049> really<00:03:40.470> cool

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
works so a harden plate is a really cool

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.530 
works so a harden plate is a really cool
material<00:03:40.920> by<00:03:41.130> itself<00:03:41.459> it's<00:03:41.760> an<00:03:42.030> alternative

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
material by itself it's an alternative

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.479 
material by itself it's an alternative
to<00:03:42.600> brick<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.109> you<00:03:43.200> want<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.380> make<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> house<00:03:43.799> or

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
to brick if you want to make a house or

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.830 
to brick if you want to make a house or
you<00:03:44.670> want<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.850> make<00:03:44.940> something<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.480> know<00:03:45.569> play

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
you want to make something you know play

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.479 
you want to make something you know play
like<00:03:46.079> but<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.440> don't<00:03:46.739> really<00:03:47.010> want<00:03:47.310> yeah

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
like but you don't really want yeah

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.099 
like but you don't really want yeah
regular<00:03:47.730> flakes<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.239> has<00:03:48.329> this<00:03:48.450> ugly<00:03:48.660> kind<00:03:49.019> of

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
regular flakes it has this ugly kind of

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.809 
regular flakes it has this ugly kind of
colors<00:03:49.380> color<00:03:49.739> that's<00:03:50.280> what<00:03:50.459> hardened<00:03:50.760> clay

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
colors color that's what hardened clay

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.220 
colors color that's what hardened clay
so<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.239> put<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.450> in<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.630> kiln<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.079> get

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
so you put it in the kiln and you get

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.110 
so you put it in the kiln and you get
this<00:03:52.380> stuff<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:52.950> yeah<00:03:53.700> that's<00:03:53.910> what<00:03:54.090> a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
this stuff so yeah that's what a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.479 
this stuff so yeah that's what a
hardened<00:03:54.569> clay<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.810> good<00:03:55.079> for<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:56.250> also

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
hardened clay is good for and it's also

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.580 
hardened clay is good for and it's also
mined<00:03:56.849> with<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.090> pickaxe<00:03:57.389> instead<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:58.079> you<00:03:58.560> know

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
mined with a pickaxe instead of you know

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.830 
mined with a pickaxe instead of you know
shears<00:03:58.950> like<00:03:59.190> with<00:03:59.370> walks<00:03:59.730> so<00:04:00.000> now<00:04:00.660> you've<00:04:00.810> got

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
shears like with walks so now you've got

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.720 
shears like with walks so now you've got
yourself<00:04:01.079> some<00:04:01.470> hot<00:04:01.650> plate<00:04:01.980> we'll<00:04:02.099> just<00:04:02.220> flip

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
yourself some hot plate we'll just flip

mean<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:44.760> know<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:45.180> it's<00:04:45.540> slightly

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
mean that you know it's it's slightly

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.480 
mean that you know it's it's slightly
hard<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.200> get<00:04:46.350> in<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.590> rarer<00:04:46.770> color<00:04:47.040> so<00:04:47.280> if<00:04:47.370> you

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
hard to get in the rarer color so if you

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.130 
hard to get in the rarer color so if you
want<00:04:47.670> something<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.150> requires<00:04:48.480> squids<00:04:48.840> die

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
want something that requires squids die

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.540 
want something that requires squids die
you're<00:04:49.620> gonna<00:04:49.710> have<00:04:49.890> to<00:04:49.950> either<00:04:50.010> have<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.220> squid

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
you're gonna have to either have a squid

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.920 
you're gonna have to either have a squid
farm<00:04:50.820> where<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.150> have<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.360> go<00:04:51.420> manually<00:04:51.780> get

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
farm where you have to go manually get

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.630 
farm where you have to go manually get
squid<00:04:52.140> every<00:04:52.320> time<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.890> II<00:04:53.130> know<00:04:53.280> that<00:04:53.370> can<00:04:53.550> be

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
squid every time and II know that can be

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.700 
squid every time and II know that can be
problematic<00:04:53.940> sometimes<00:04:54.270> but<00:04:54.840> I<00:04:55.080> think<00:04:55.350> it

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
problematic sometimes but I think it

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.260 
problematic sometimes but I think it
adds<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:55.980> whole<00:04:56.280> bunch<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.730> new<00:04:56.880> varieties

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
adds a whole bunch of new varieties

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.910 
adds a whole bunch of new varieties
again<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.780> means<00:04:58.050> if<00:04:58.170> you<00:04:58.200> want<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.560> build<00:04:58.740> in

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
again it means if you want to build in

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.920 
again it means if you want to build in
survival<00:04:59.460> then<00:04:59.640> you<00:04:59.970> have<00:05:00.180> more<00:05:00.480> options<00:05:00.600> than

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
survival then you have more options than

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.590 
survival then you have more options than
just<00:05:01.110> you<00:05:01.500> know<00:05:01.530> doing<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.280> really<00:05:02.940> slow<00:05:03.180> way<00:05:03.330> or

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
just you know doing a really slow way or

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.510 
just you know doing a really slow way or
cheating<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.230> stuff<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:04.890> think<00:05:04.950> you<00:05:05.460> know

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
cheating and stuff and I think you know

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.860 
cheating and stuff and I think you know
it's<00:05:05.670> a<00:05:05.790> really<00:05:05.940> nice<00:05:06.150> balance<00:05:06.360> right<00:05:06.630> there

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
it's a really nice balance right there

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.660 
it's a really nice balance right there
so<00:05:07.080> that's<00:05:07.800> what's<00:05:08.040> going<00:05:08.130> on<00:05:08.490> with

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
so that's what's going on with

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.150 
so that's what's going on with
distinctly<00:05:09.240> it's<00:05:09.540> really<00:05:09.810> cool<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.230> one<00:05:10.890> more

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
distinctly it's really cool and one more

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.410 
distinctly it's really cool and one more
quick<00:05:11.280> thing<00:05:11.340> is<00:05:11.730> if<00:05:11.850> you<00:05:11.940> look<00:05:11.970> at<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.210> pink

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
quick thing is if you look at the pink

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.030 
quick thing is if you look at the pink
stink<00:05:12.750> light<00:05:12.930> over<00:05:13.200> here<00:05:13.230> and<00:05:13.590> also<00:05:13.920> over

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
stink light over here and also over

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.370 
stink light over here and also over
there<00:05:14.310> you<00:05:14.670> can<00:05:14.880> really<00:05:15.330> really<00:05:15.750> see<00:05:15.930> how<00:05:16.350> it

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
there you can really really see how it

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.620 
there you can really really see how it
like<00:05:16.680> it's<00:05:16.890> it's<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.190> perfect<00:05:17.370> lamp<00:05:17.730> one-ball

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
like it's it's the perfect lamp one-ball

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.240 
like it's it's the perfect lamp one-ball
color<00:05:18.870> in<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.080> UK<00:05:19.380> and<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.650> think<00:05:19.860> that's<00:05:20.010> kind

color in the UK and I think that's kind

if you're if you only build exclusively

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.100 
if you're if you only build exclusively
it's<00:05:32.640> probably<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.180> single<00:05:33.630> most<00:05:33.660> exciting

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110
