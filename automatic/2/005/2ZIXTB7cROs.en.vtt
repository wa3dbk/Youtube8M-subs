00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
american-made hundred watt heads we

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.019 
american-made hundred watt heads we
wanted<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.859> do<00:00:22.980> something<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.400> was<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> little

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
wanted to do something that was a little

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.759 
wanted to do something that was a little
bit<00:00:24.150> different<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:24.840> us<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.260> aesthetics<00:00:25.710> a

little<00:00:25.949> different<00:00:26.220> departure<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.240> a

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
little different departure and so is a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.720 
little different departure and so is a
totally<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> little<00:00:28.529> different<00:00:28.830> departure<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
totally a little different departure and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.609 
totally a little different departure and
that<00:00:30.330> instead<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.689> doing<00:00:30.840> something<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.410> little

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that instead of doing something a little

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.650 
that instead of doing something a little
bit<00:00:31.740> more<00:00:31.920> modern<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:33.149> wanted<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.540> do

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
bit more modern we wanted to do

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.870 
bit more modern we wanted to do
something<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.190> bent<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.309> little<00:00:35.340> bit<00:00:35.550> more

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.389 
something that bent a little bit more
traditional<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> little<00:00:36.899> more<00:00:37.020> British<00:00:37.399> so

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
traditional and a little more British so

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.860 
traditional and a little more British so
we<00:00:38.550> came<00:00:38.700> out<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> hammersmith<00:00:39.629> which

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
we came out with the hammersmith which

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.119 
we came out with the hammersmith which
is<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> two-channel<00:00:40.559> hundred<00:00:40.770> watt<00:00:40.920> head

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
is a two-channel hundred watt head

and<00:01:20.979> like<00:01:21.640> I<00:01:21.670> said<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:22.060> channel<00:01:22.360> design<00:01:22.659> with<00:01:23.289> a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
and like I said to channel design with a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:50.250 
and like I said to channel design with a
variable<00:01:23.860> deep<00:01:24.130> switch<00:01:24.369> in<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:24.610> back

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.740 

so<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.370> was<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.490> Hammersmith<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.330> on<00:01:52.420> top<00:01:52.600> of

so that was a Hammersmith and on top of

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.600 
so that was a Hammersmith and on top of
that<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.110> new<00:01:53.410> assassin<00:01:53.890> yes<00:01:54.370> the

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
know this is gonna map in the US for

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.250 
know this is gonna map in the US for
about<00:02:57.000> five<00:02:57.209> hundred<00:02:57.480> forty<00:02:57.659> nine<00:02:57.870> dollars

but it's gonna give you 18 watts of full
distortion<00:03:01.319> which<00:03:01.469> is<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.799> something<00:03:01.980> that

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
distortion which is just something that

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.860 
distortion which is just something that
hasn't<00:03:02.400> been<00:03:02.519> available<00:03:02.670> yet<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.689> we're

really<00:03:03.989> excited<00:03:04.290> about<00:03:04.439> this<00:03:04.709> product<00:03:04.980> and

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
really excited about this product and

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.300 
really excited about this product and
now<00:03:05.640> what<00:03:05.879> was<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.090> person<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.480> humours

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
now what was the person the humours

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.509 
now what was the person the humours

heretic NEX which is another one of our
new<00:03:14.609> hundred<00:03:15.000> watts<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.870> what<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.560> was<00:03:16.739> saying

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
new hundred watts so what I was saying

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.199 
new hundred watts so what I was saying
is<00:03:17.159> the<00:03:17.340> other<00:03:17.459> hundred<00:03:17.760> watt<00:03:17.879> head<00:03:18.060> that

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
is the other hundred watt head that

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.849 
is the other hundred watt head that
we've<00:03:18.299> got<00:03:18.480> out<00:03:18.629> this<00:03:18.810> year<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.170> new<00:03:19.319> one<00:03:19.530> is

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
we've got out this year the new one is

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.059 
we've got out this year the new one is
the<00:03:19.889> heretic<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.659> heretic<00:03:22.049> was<00:03:22.260> similar<00:03:22.950> to

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
the heretic the heretic was similar to

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.709 
the heretic the heretic was similar to
the<00:03:23.129> hammersmith<00:03:23.579> in<00:03:23.879> that<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.269> another

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:24.719 
the hammersmith in that it's another

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.990 
the hammersmith in that it's another
heavy<00:03:25.290> distortion<00:03:25.620> amp<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.609> we<00:03:26.700> wanted<00:03:26.909> to

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
heavy distortion amp but we wanted to

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.640 
heavy distortion amp but we wanted to
have<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> little<00:03:27.269> bit<00:03:27.480> more<00:03:27.689> modern<00:03:28.079> vibe<00:03:28.379> you

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
know the Spitfire ii had been really

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.789 
know the Spitfire ii had been really
well<00:03:30.150> received<00:03:30.389> for<00:03:30.659> us<00:03:30.780> what<00:03:31.260> we<00:03:31.349> wanted<00:03:31.620> was

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
well received for us what we wanted was

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.140 
well received for us what we wanted was
an<00:03:31.919> ant<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:32.220> picked<00:03:32.430> up<00:03:32.579> where<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.790> left

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
an ant that picked up where that left

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.170 
an ant that picked up where that left
off<00:03:33.419> and<00:03:33.689> gave<00:03:34.500> distortion<00:03:35.459> beyond<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:36.030> but

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
off and gave distortion beyond that but

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.550 
off and gave distortion beyond that but
still<00:03:36.329> retained<00:03:36.659> some<00:03:36.810> clarity<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.379> some

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
still retained some clarity and some

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.050 

so<00:04:01.020> that<00:04:01.200> was<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.440> heretic<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.819> yeah

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060
