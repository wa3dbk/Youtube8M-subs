00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.019
 in the phenomenon brigades gialloblù you are 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.300
 occupied political psychologist sociologists 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.490
 prosecutors judges priests of course 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.230
 journalists said it all and the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.270
 contrary to everything often without 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.220
 really know the facts the spirit e 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.869
 the intentions of those who started in 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.260
 movement and those with the passing of the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.449
 years 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.029
 I find a style in the Gialloblù brigades 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.269
 of life a passion a faith we start 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.489
 from the beginning 30 November 1971 the verona 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.770
 of the president garonzi is in series to a 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.950
 group of young people not yet of age 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.290
 already at the beginning of the previous championship 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.090
 1970 71 met during the week 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.469
 to organize cohesive choreographies 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.500
 stage the stadium on Sunday 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.690
 to support the Verona axis on 30 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 November of 71 is formalized the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.530
 birth of the gialloblù brigades as 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.160
 group of the coordination center of the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.350
 football club 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.329
 this in fact is the first historian 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.039
 banner of the first brigades 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.940
 president maximum touch one of the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.100
 founders 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.210
 in the initial intentions we speak of a 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.430
 apolitical group 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.479
 three years later he disappears on the banner 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.700
 the written soccer club 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.530
 also because the creators of the group do not 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.990
 they were interested in being part of the center 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.000
 coordination to better understand 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.950
 we must contextualize the phenomenon 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.460
 early seventies the so-called years of 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.290
 lead 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.180
 the state is under siege by 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.979
 extremist groups between attacks if 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.380
 these of people manifestations of 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.659
 square violent rivalries between 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.340
 fans with a lot of fistfights rice 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.650
 with strokes of sticks in a period like this 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.090
 difficult for our country pass into 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.680
 second floor and probably the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.500
 phenomenon at least at the beginning comes 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.720
 underestimated the south curve becomes 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.040
 soon a center of aggregation for many 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.200
 young people from verona and province 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.659
 unity of passion for hellas and from a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.600
 different way to cheer not simple 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.270
 passive spectators but an active part at 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.979
 sometimes too much together with the game 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.040
 a match is also played on the field 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.470
 terraces with choirs of teasing 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.330
 all shouted or written goliardic slogans 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.550
 on banners addressed to the fans 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.230
 rivals but also demonstrations of 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.380
 affection and sincere friendship if in front 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.970
 there are twin appearance supporters 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.619
 brigade violence but more 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.110
 general of the ultrà world you are 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.850
 wasted rivers of words too little 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.650
 instead it has been said about originality 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.090
 choruses and beautiful choreographies le 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.370
 friendships that you are in the south curve 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.710
 consolidated among young people united by colors 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.970
 gialloblù exponents of the brigades have 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.070
 followed the team in every corner 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.870
 of Italy and of Europe proud to raise 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.059
 scarves and flags 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.059
 [Music] 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.680
 inside the bentegodi stadium the south bend 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.170
 passionate animate the whole audience 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.660
 of the verona its heat its extruded 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.220
 his goliardia his songs had 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.140
 a contagious and thick effect 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.730
 extraordinary but not possible 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.440
 forget the events of 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.000
 protests the sharp banners 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.980
 strong position statements 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.010
 disputes with management coaches 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.080
 players and even institutions in the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.239
 80's however the violent side of the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.430
 curve on the worrying proportions with 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.610
 the real hooligan raids in 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.510
 occasion of almost all the trips 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.489
 officially the heads of the brigades 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.320
 they distance themselves from troublemakers but 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.420
 some groups present in the south corner do not 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.000
 hide their violent way of 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.560
 interpret typhus and then increase the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.970
 infiltration of real 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.580
 criminals who have nothing to do 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.440
 with the verona it is the game of soccer 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.360
 they simply want to create disorder 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.489
 putting the healthy part in a bad light 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.130
 of the fans the company is the whole city 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.130
 of verona the climax is reached with 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.500
 the trip to Brescia in December of 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.750
 1986 the area between the station and the stadium 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.910
 car is literally devastated 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.290
 damaged bins burned shop windows 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.880
 crashed clashes with the police 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.400
 assaults on passers-by 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.230
 the mayor sboarina threatens to close 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.670
 the south curve the bell president

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.310
 from the championship 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.160
 and meanwhile the power of attorney moves 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.650
 republic that the first of February of 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.780
 1987 arrested 12 fans with the grave 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.150
 accusation of criminal association 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.280
 on the Sunday after the south bend he answers 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.530
 with this banner leaving the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.750
 central sector 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.760
 but the attempted repression by 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.040
 law enforcement is not calmed 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.870
 indeed in the last years of life of the 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.660
 brigades continue the riots 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.280

 decide to dissolve officially 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.760
 after twenty years of life 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.070
 November 14, 1991 tired of 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.840
 be the scapegoat for problems 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.730
 of public order that go beyond the 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.169
 sport supporter but above all not

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.020
 a yellow-blue scarf around the neck 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.970
 on the occasion of the Verona Genoa match 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.220
 the railings of the south after twenty years 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.560
 they remain desperately empty while a

 the historical group disappeared the south curve 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.630
 however, she remained alive by getting organized 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.790
 otherwise continuing over the years to 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.680
 animate the bentegodi by supporting the
