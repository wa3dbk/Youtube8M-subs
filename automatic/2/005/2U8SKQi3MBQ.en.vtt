00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.769
 Hello and welcome to the sixth season of the 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.169
 there are people my set technical topic 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.989
 As I know, I had mini-pcs z but this one is available 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.419
 once as a concept advertising and once as a complete system 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.649
 who will give me a lot of items on the table and over this 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.989
 Half a year, one percent is a mini-pc because living in a complete system 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.899
 that will be the dogs he can take over for us if that is now step 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.050
 track by step 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.150
 it's Hannah that worried the five and what you do as a finished concept 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.280
 is afraid 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.380
 what is not to buy then because that's what it is 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.140
 the 5 as the moon stand out for them you get this means 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.549
 Black aluminum housing 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.289
 the preinstalled amounts board a cooling system rendered the well-known city 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.209
 has cooling system and powerful network sharing that is one of the municipalities 

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.899
 with us 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.189
 you need to turn that into a complete system now 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.509
 so they also fish in a processor memory modules with a hard disk 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.399
 optical drive we pull a dvd burner card reader and we too 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.880
 for fast 3d games or for that and percent for playgrounds for 3d 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.400
 Need performance with Rafi card 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.030
 it can not be denied together 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.549
 Karina gang advertising with the house parked the all-rounder I already have 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.380
 contributing to inflation is the Quick Install Eichen was Driver CD Sven 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.010
 Krause material power cord under the mattress to install the CDU then 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:38.979
 I have everything together 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.530
 You can dry everything 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.380
 Opening the case is quite easy 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.600
 which on the back will shrink 30 percent which will be without 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.800
 Screwdrivers just solved with their fingers the Dresdner are out 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.810
 you can easily plus the big terrain allowed 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.929
 The first step would be to install the drives 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.709
 here comes this ran once the optical drive of the Kappeler and 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.300
 screwing the hard drive to expand this frame nations 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.300
 At the end of the course jump emerge 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:22.249
 4 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:23.939
 even solved differently 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.969
 that's easy these days 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.029
 remove 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.430
 so i have them the installation framework of the hand kloten you could the hard drive 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.989
 Card reader and optical drive ranks 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.150
 in this order 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
 and that although it will have been to date 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:42.569
 right no 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.779
 and here 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.369
 until new little ones 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.519
 open around 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.679
 the side is HDD on it 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:51.679
 then there sit the screws for mounting 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.899
 I'm off the start 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:01.410
 offset the World Cup and built in the optical drive 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.359
 if now the last screw has turned tight 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.739
 can carry on with the installation of CDU memory of the video card 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.410
 the next step for the installation of the processor 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.510
 to expanded to the suppleness 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.560
 which consists of this pattern and the iPad Cool Lament 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.659
 4 of the statute of the process is very important that heat up on the processor 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.379
 the key on tricks what happens if I omit the times 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.769
 the thermal paste ensures the heat transfer between them 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.309
 Covert PET and the process should be left out that works well 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.030
 System no longer reasonable 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.730
 and then you have a very low cooling performance so that's pretty much 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.459
 important 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.320
 User should be too easy in the socket on the Rhine 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.379
 it is not easy we have to mark 18 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.409
 and then can 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.409
 close the lid 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.279
 according to the statute of the processor and the station popularity whereby we of course 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:51.459
 also thought of the thermal grease 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.729
 it's the rule that's the two 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.069
 The elongated black shirt come exactly the Prussians 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.659
 Noses are opened and then you can 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.409
 a little effort 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.109
 Plug the modules into Switzerland 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.279
 the shoot will automatically close correctly 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:23.119
 as a penultimate step we come back to our attentive back of that very nice 

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:26.439
 the dvd burner the cup for Dirk and the hard drive installed this 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.159
 grows up the frame as it is we now start here 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:30.400
 you can do that 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.140
 the cables herein 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.140
 fit it to match 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.650
 this is the power cable for the hard drive 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.240
 Western Conference to her clockwork 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.340
 the data cable for the hard disk 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.539
 under power can for the civilian victim 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.800
 exactly now the whole wants to sink in the housing 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.909
 he can do it all 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.610
 be pushed forward 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.610
 your two rows of storms could rage again 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.740
 Last but not least, build Estate 82 is now a graphics card 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.229
 but there was already on the account but then said that so much 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.380
 3d games want to play at the Vienna very nice fast 3d graphics card 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.129
 we picked Petibon numbers 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.490
 to his back wrote this 2 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.860
 despite screws 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.860
 in these countries 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.240
 and there you can open the folding mechanism upwards 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.110
 and the Plendl - Red 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.749
 David Kotter was able to get in on the spot 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:57.749
 which are you stuck in the black box Express is running 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.819
 that corresponds to 9 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.099
 separate them 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.530
 to the video recorder still with the power connection 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.920
 Daiger started a lot of power also needed reasonable with electricity 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.930
 is supplied 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.289
 For traffic jams with the whole squad still reasonable would be advertising 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:21.639
 and that changes 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.839
 then completely-pc made 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.119
 I am amazed that it is just uncomplicated to go with just one 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.929
 Screwdrivers my own hands and now I'm curious if that 

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:31.810
 works there I am also curious 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.150
 his complete missing for student anything or nothing for them to do 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.150
 instead of a 14 and close the man 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.550
 What is the test to make an example for that are 14 company pc with power 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.550
 supplied we look if we are concerned 

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:55.899
 See live 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:04.020
 the debut screen wonderful it was a long often Matrix is â€‹â€‹dementia he 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.050
 not from the heads too large on 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.990
 have fun with it 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.780
 that he has watched that promotes Saxon over Kaarst 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.210
 they do not even scream again 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.689
 until then
