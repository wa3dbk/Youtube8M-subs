00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
it works well against each other so the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.090

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
or too underpowered as an example is if

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.990 
or too underpowered as an example is if
you're<00:03:40.769> tired<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.190> sensor<00:03:41.459> grenades<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.880> know

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
you're tired of sensor grenades you know

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.610 
you're tired of sensor grenades you know
use<00:03:42.209> emps<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.900> take<00:03:43.049> out<00:03:43.170> sensor<00:03:43.500> grenades

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
use emps to take out sensor grenades

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.949 
use emps to take out sensor grenades
it's<00:03:44.489> just<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.880> easy<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.390> also<00:03:45.630> think<00:03:45.900> that

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
it's just that easy I also think that

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.259 
it's just that easy I also think that
the<00:03:46.140> MEP<00:03:46.290> design<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.890> also<00:03:47.190> very<00:03:47.489> good<00:03:47.760> the

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
the MEP design is also very good the

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.880 
the MEP design is also very good the
maps<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.630> are<00:03:48.690> small<00:03:49.049> aren't<00:03:49.320> too<00:03:49.470> small<00:03:49.769> the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
maps that are small aren't too small the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.470 
maps that are small aren't too small the
maps<00:03:50.070> are<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.459> are<00:03:50.580> big<00:03:50.760> aren't<00:03:51.090> too<00:03:51.209> big

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
maps are that are big aren't too big

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.539 
maps are that are big aren't too big
there's<00:03:52.230> plenty<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.500> flanking<00:03:52.890> positions<00:03:53.370> and

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
there's plenty of flanking positions and

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.070 
there's plenty of flanking positions and
good<00:03:53.700> defending<00:03:54.120> points<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.690> it's<00:03:54.870> very

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
good defending points so it's very

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.080 
good defending points so it's very
competitive<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:55.950> know<00:03:56.400> very<00:03:56.670> well<00:03:56.880> done

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
competitive and you know very well done

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.300 
competitive and you know very well done
the<00:03:57.450> classes<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.019> play<00:03:58.530> as<00:03:58.709> are<00:03:59.100> either

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
because if you play a rifleman you're

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.860 
because if you play a rifleman you're

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.290 
the map a lot easier and sneakier and
it's<00:04:33.680> also<00:04:33.830> very<00:04:34.070> worth<00:04:34.400> mentioning<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:34.940> the

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
it's also very worth mentioning that the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.610 
it's also very worth mentioning that the
customization<00:04:35.990> in<00:04:36.050> this<00:04:36.140> game<00:04:36.320> is<00:04:36.470> absolutely

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
customization in this game is absolutely

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.650 
customization in this game is absolutely
incredible<00:04:37.070> there's<00:04:37.850> multiple<00:04:38.240> points<00:04:38.600> on

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
incredible there's multiple points on

that<00:04:46.310> they<00:04:46.460> really<00:04:46.490> went<00:04:46.820> all<00:04:47.000> out<00:04:47.030> with<00:04:47.360> that

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
that they really went all out with that

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.210 
that they really went all out with that
and<00:04:47.720> it<00:04:48.050> really<00:04:48.230> makes<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.740> wish<00:04:48.890> that<00:04:49.070> more

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
and it really makes you wish that more

and it really makes you wish that more
games<00:04:49.520> will<00:04:49.670> implement<00:04:50.000> this<00:04:50.330> type<00:04:50.570> of

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
games will implement this type of

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.660 
games will implement this type of
customization<00:04:51.500> now<00:04:52.070> in<00:04:52.190> this<00:04:52.310> point<00:04:52.460> in<00:04:52.550> time

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
customization now in this point in time

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.670 
customization now in this point in time
I<00:04:52.730> can<00:04:52.940> only<00:04:52.970> think<00:04:53.180> of<00:04:53.300> really<00:04:53.540> two<00:04:53.870> cons<00:04:54.320> the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
I can only think of really two cons the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.590 
I can only think of really two cons the
multiplayer<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.370> first<00:04:55.640> one<00:04:55.850> being<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.210> in

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
multiplayer the first one being that in

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.540 
multiplayer the first one being that in
conflict<00:04:57.110> sometimes<00:04:57.470> it<00:04:57.590> feels<00:04:57.740> like<00:04:57.920> the

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
conflict sometimes it feels like the

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.520 
conflict sometimes it feels like the
objective<00:04:59.180> is<00:04:59.300> favoring<00:04:59.780> one<00:04:59.930> side<00:04:59.990> where

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
objective is favoring one side where

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.410 
objective is favoring one side where
well<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.010> objective<00:05:01.400> will<00:05:01.520> be<00:05:01.640> on<00:05:01.850> your<00:05:02.060> spawn

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
well the objective will be on your spawn

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.390 
well the objective will be on your spawn
and<00:05:02.840> it's<00:05:02.960> easier<00:05:03.230> for<00:05:03.410> you<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.500> cap<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:04.010> or<00:05:04.280> the

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
and it's easier for you to cap it or the

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.500 
and it's easier for you to cap it or the
exemption<00:05:04.760> will<00:05:04.850> be<00:05:04.940> all<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.210> way<00:05:05.270> in<00:05:05.300> their

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
exemption will be all the way in their

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.510 
exemption will be all the way in their
spawn<00:05:05.810> at<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.020> start<00:05:06.350> and<00:05:06.560> it's<00:05:07.160> easier<00:05:07.490> for

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
spawn at the start and it's easier for

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.830 
spawn at the start and it's easier for
than<00:05:07.790> the<00:05:07.850> cap<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.180> get<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.450> under<00:05:08.630> they<00:05:08.720> get

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
than the cap and get it under they get

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.660 
than the cap and get it under they get
the<00:05:08.930> lead<00:05:09.140> real<00:05:09.440> fast<00:05:09.740> so<00:05:10.280> I<00:05:10.310> think<00:05:10.460> that's

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
the lead real fast so I think that's

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.980 
the lead real fast so I think that's
something<00:05:10.880> they<00:05:10.970> willing<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.270> change<00:05:11.510> up

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
something they willing to change up

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.450 
something they willing to change up
don't<00:05:12.260> get<00:05:12.380> me<00:05:12.440> wrong<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.770> do<00:05:12.830> realize<00:05:13.250> that

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
don't get me wrong I do realize that

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.400 
don't get me wrong I do realize that
it's<00:05:13.580> kind<00:05:13.850> of<00:05:14.000> difficult<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.200> know<00:05:15.320> you

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
it's kind of difficult and you know you

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.800 
it's kind of difficult and you know you
run<00:05:15.650> out<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.830> places<00:05:16.100> to<00:05:16.580> play<00:05:16.790> a<00:05:16.970> objective<00:05:17.570> on

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
run out of places to play a objective on

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.360 
run out of places to play a objective on
one<00:05:18.050> map<00:05:18.320> but<00:05:18.830> you<00:05:18.920> know<00:05:19.010> I<00:05:19.040> think<00:05:19.160> there

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
one map but you know I think there

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.400 
one map but you know I think there
should<00:05:19.400> be<00:05:19.520> less<00:05:19.790> objective<00:05:20.210> spots<00:05:20.900> that<00:05:21.230> are

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
should be less objective spots that are

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.620 
should be less objective spots that are
closer<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:22.040> your<00:05:22.190> spawn<00:05:22.490> or<00:05:22.940> closer<00:05:23.270> to<00:05:23.420> with

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
closer to your spawn or closer to with

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.510 
closer to your spawn or closer to with
the<00:05:23.750> other<00:05:24.320> people's<00:05:24.770> spawn<00:05:24.980> so<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.250> know<00:05:25.370> it

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
the other people's spawn so you know it

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.220 
the other people's spawn so you know it
brings<00:05:25.880> a<00:05:26.030> little<00:05:26.090> a<00:05:26.270> little<00:05:26.570> bit<00:05:26.780> more<00:05:26.990> of

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
brings a little a little bit more of

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.350 
brings a little a little bit more of
balance<00:05:28.190> if<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.520> other<00:05:28.670> thing<00:05:28.880> I've<00:05:29.000> noticed

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
balance if the other thing I've noticed

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.810 
balance if the other thing I've noticed
that<00:05:29.510> it's<00:05:29.660> frightfully<00:05:30.410> easy<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:31.010> spawn<00:05:31.490> trap

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
that it's frightfully easy to spawn trap

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.320 
that it's frightfully easy to spawn trap
people<00:05:32.360> now<00:05:32.630> there<00:05:32.900> is<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.440> you<00:05:34.040> know<00:05:34.070> a<00:05:34.610> safety

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
people now there is a you know a safety

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.730 
people now there is a you know a safety
thing<00:05:35.540> where<00:05:35.810> that<00:05:36.080> if<00:05:36.169> you<00:05:36.290> spawn<00:05:36.500> trap

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
thing where that if you spawn trap

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.170 
thing where that if you spawn trap
someone<00:05:37.010> team<00:05:37.400> too<00:05:37.580> much<00:05:37.610> they<00:05:37.940> will<00:05:38.060> have

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
someone team too much they will have

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.000 
someone team too much they will have
alternate<00:05:38.600> spawn<00:05:38.900> behind<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:39.440> but<00:05:39.919> it's

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
alternate spawn behind you but it's

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.700 
alternate spawn behind you but it's
still<00:05:40.630> it's<00:05:41.630> it's<00:05:42.050> a<00:05:42.140> good<00:05:42.290> thing<00:05:42.500> and<00:05:42.620> a<00:05:42.680> bad

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
still it's it's a good thing and a bad

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.010 
still it's it's a good thing and a bad
thing<00:05:42.890> you<00:05:43.340> mean<00:05:43.490> it's<00:05:43.760> a<00:05:43.970> part<00:05:44.330> of<00:05:44.390> a<00:05:44.510> tactical

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
thing you mean it's a part of a tactical

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.510 
thing you mean it's a part of a tactical
way<00:05:45.140> to<00:05:45.200> lock<00:05:45.680> someone<00:05:45.890> in<00:05:45.980> their<00:05:46.100> spawn<00:05:46.340> but

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
way to lock someone in their spawn but

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.310 
way to lock someone in their spawn but
you<00:05:46.610> know<00:05:46.730> it's<00:05:47.210> it's<00:05:47.570> also<00:05:47.750> kind<00:05:48.050> of<00:05:48.110> annoying

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
you know it's it's also kind of annoying

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.780 
you know it's it's also kind of annoying
for<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:48.560> other<00:05:48.710> team<00:05:48.919> but<00:05:49.280> it's<00:05:49.400> also<00:05:49.520> cool

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
for the other team but it's also cool

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.159 
for the other team but it's also cool
that<00:05:49.820> they<00:05:50.060> did<00:05:50.240> something<00:05:50.600> so<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:50.810> can<00:05:51.020> get

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
that they did something so you can get

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.690 
that they did something so you can get
out<00:05:51.320> of<00:05:51.440> a<00:05:51.500> spawn<00:05:51.740> trap<00:05:52.010> so<00:05:52.130> you're<00:05:52.280> not<00:05:52.370> stuck

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
out of a spawn trap so you're not stuck

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.610 
out of a spawn trap so you're not stuck
there<00:05:52.940> for<00:05:53.090> the<00:05:53.150> entire<00:05:53.419> game<00:05:53.660> now<00:05:54.260> the<00:05:54.380> last

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
there for the entire game now the last

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.220 
there for the entire game now the last
thing<00:05:54.860> I<00:05:54.980> figured<00:05:55.430> that<00:05:55.730> is<00:05:56.000> that<00:05:56.360> the

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
thing I figured that is that the

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.380 
thing I figured that is that the
sometimes<00:05:57.710> it<00:05:57.860> picks<00:05:58.040> a<00:05:58.160> very<00:05:58.490> bad<00:05:58.700> host<00:05:59.000> and

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
sometimes it picks a very bad host and

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.480 
sometimes it picks a very bad host and
it's<00:05:59.540> a<00:05:59.660> very<00:05:59.900> laggy<00:06:00.140> game<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:00.740> it<00:06:00.830> ruins<00:06:01.190> the

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
it's a very laggy game and it ruins the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.730 
it's a very laggy game and it ruins the
entire<00:06:01.580> experience<00:06:02.419> it<00:06:03.140> doesn't<00:06:03.440> seem<00:06:03.590> to

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
entire experience it doesn't seem to

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.070 
entire experience it doesn't seem to
have<00:06:03.919> a<00:06:03.980> host<00:06:04.490> migration<00:06:04.760> where<00:06:05.330> if<00:06:05.570> it's<00:06:05.990> a

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
have a host migration where if it's a

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.630 
have a host migration where if it's a
bad<00:06:06.230> connection<00:06:06.380> it<00:06:06.860> automatically<00:06:07.400> hosts

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
bad connection it automatically hosts

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.400 
bad connection it automatically hosts
migrates<00:06:08.000> to<00:06:08.150> a<00:06:08.180> different<00:06:08.450> player<00:06:08.630> it's<00:06:09.169> more

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
migrates to a different player it's more

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.650 
migrates to a different player it's more
like<00:06:09.620> it<00:06:09.860> waits<00:06:10.100> so<00:06:10.280> the<00:06:10.370> player<00:06:10.580> leaves<00:06:10.910> all

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
like it waits so the player leaves all
