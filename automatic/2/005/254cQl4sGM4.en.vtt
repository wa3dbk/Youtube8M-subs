00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.480
 who deals with plastic guitars on guitar 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.490
 hero never quite wanted to make friends 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.410
 he can join Rocksmith now 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.690
 similar principle to real klampfen 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.310
 Again, we have to move to the right 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.169
 time to get the right note 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.330
 but not by hitting a colorful one 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.860
 taste but by being quite old fashioned 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.590
 grab the correct page and 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.930
 strike each guitar or with one 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.430
 pickup equipped acoustic guitar 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.380
 can do that with a supplied one 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.840
 cable are connected 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.239
 and bassist in the us version 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.190
 wait for $ 30 addon 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.080
 had to be the four since then 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.690
 directly part of the game and get 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.700
 your own career mode something 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.470
 Curiosity is the makeshift one 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.630
 normal guitar only by use of 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.690
 four sides to use as a bass replacement 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.550
 but better than no matter no matter 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.560
 which suitable picking tool we use 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.840
 Play the basic principle is the same 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.729
 a song will behave us in individual 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.800
 notes or chords disassembled as 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.050
 come open to the reaction game 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.180
 unlike the key system of guitar 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.290
 hero are the six strings and 22 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.119
 Günther a bit 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.979
 to implement more extensively 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.810
 Nevertheless, the survey remains in place and 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.700
 Helpful little arrows help us 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.560
 if we in the Bund or in the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.170
 side have got the grip for the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.399
 to correct the next note also the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.110
 difficulty level is skillful 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.940
 regulated and analyzed how flexible 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.679
 our fingers are already around us with the 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.200
 Note not to overwhelm but 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.369
 not too bored 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.020
 next to the career mode and the 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.970
 possibility simply to lust and whim 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.100
 the unfortunately a little clearer row 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.509
 Classics by rock offers 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.399
 rocksmith another series of 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.800
 entertaining learning games the kindergarten 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.600
 kate here like pensions or shoot 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.610
 zombies from each other by you 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.860
 to strike correct notes or chords 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.800
 this helps grips even without looking 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.209
 to find on the guitar neck 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.220
 Overall , Rocksmith leaves the pure 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.720
 Party games area of ​​a guitar hero 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.149
 and has significantly more edutainment 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.160
 components teaches us good pieces for 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.810
 piece new techniques or turn on more 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.190
 possibilities freely over simulated 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.170
 pedals and other knickknacks 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.390
 to change our sound 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.800
 the mini-games pronounced 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.599
 practical voice helper and the 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.790
 adjusted level of difficulty 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.079
 certainly one both 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.420
 entertaining as well as meaningful help there 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.740
 if you want to learn guitar 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.780
 of course that can be real lessons 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.670
 not replace nobody looks at us 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.110
 Reasonably mature or not knot in 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.760
 our fingers do that once 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.980
 ingrained unlearned again 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.690
 who can already be with the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.700
 guitar has grown up in the hands 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.620
 must turn a tutorial after the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.900
 Others push aside for reasonable 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.819
 to be able to strum what the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.980
 musical part is rocksmith 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.660
 but overall very mature 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.250
 a good sound recognition and creates 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.720
 a sensible balancing act between 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.640
 entertainment and claim 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.440
 who wants to rock to several 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.390
 after all, with two players at the same time 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.860
 compete and get on guitar either 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.680
 and bass or of lead and rhythm 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.180
 Guitar is technical 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.930
 Rocksmith, however, is not quite up 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.239
 currently 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.380
 The loading times are tiring and let 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.870
 not synonymous with an installation 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.610
 shorten and if you have the look of 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.080
 the approaching floating notes to page 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.269
 lets wander remind that 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.160
 two-dimensional audience of loveless 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.350
 Clone on the background of a 90s 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.660
 years beat'em ups that's for sure 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.299
 not the focus of the game but better 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.019
 that would have gone already 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.580
 last but not least 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.140
 respect the hat to draw that one here 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.420
 reasonable connection between music 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.459
 and their game is German 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.100
 localization including bass guitars 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.930
 career absolutely convinced who by the way 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.120
 not yet in possession of an electric 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.829
 In the practical case, the price is 200 euros 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.380
 bundle to the game also directly one more 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.690
 beginner guitar from pv to get 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.220
 the fun is the overall rating 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.220
 total at 82 percent 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.560
 8th
