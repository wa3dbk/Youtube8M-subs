00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.099 
it's a pretty good case it's got a nice
thin<00:00:16.500> form<00:00:16.890> factor<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> keyboard<00:00:18.000> case<00:00:18.300> it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
thin form factor for a keyboard case it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.320 
thin form factor for a keyboard case it
folds<00:00:19.590> up<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.010> has<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> magnetic<00:00:20.609> back<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.270> you

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
folds up it has a magnetic back and you

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.060 
folds up it has a magnetic back and you
fold<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.810> back<00:00:22.020> there's<00:00:22.590> kind<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.920> little

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
fold it back there's kind of a little

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.269 
fold it back there's kind of a little
rubberized<00:00:23.689> clasp<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.170> detach<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
rubberized clasp that you detach the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.609 
rubberized clasp that you detach the
iPad<00:00:26.640> from<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.150> then<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.630> fold<00:00:28.050> back<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
iPad from and then you fold back the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.320 
iPad from and then you fold back the
cover<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.160> that's<00:00:29.369> how<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.550> get<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.000> fold

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
cover and that's how you get it to fold

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.250 
cover and that's how you get it to fold
into<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> stand<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.309> does<00:00:32.640> weigh<00:00:33.000> around<00:00:33.300> 11

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
into a stand this does weigh around 11

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.130 
into a stand this does weigh around 11
ounces<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.160> does<00:00:35.550> double<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.570> weight<00:00:36.870> of

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
ounces so it does double the weight of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.770 
ounces so it does double the weight of
your<00:00:37.200> iPad<00:00:38.160> Mini<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
your iPad Mini that is one of the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.900 
your iPad Mini that is one of the
drawbacks<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.590> case<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.640> that's<00:00:41.760> what

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
drawbacks to this case but that's what

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
drawbacks to this case but that's what
you<00:00:41.969> expect<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.600> keyboard<00:00:43.020> case<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you expect from a keyboard case the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.979 
you expect from a keyboard case the
other<00:00:44.070> drawback<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.539> little<00:00:45.870> bit

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
other drawback is that it's a little bit

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.600 
other drawback is that it's a little bit
cramped<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.590> did<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> keys<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.370> are

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
cramped I did like the keys that are

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.130 
cramped I did like the keys that are
pretty<00:00:47.760> tactile<00:00:48.210> they're<00:00:48.360> hard<00:00:48.690> keys<00:00:48.960> they're

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
pretty tactile they're hard keys they're

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.360 
pretty tactile they're hard keys they're
not<00:00:49.260> those<00:00:49.379> kind<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.680> rubberized<00:00:50.039> soft

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
not those kind of rubberized soft

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.549 
not those kind of rubberized soft
buttons<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.570> use<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
buttons so you can use this as a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.010 
buttons so you can use this as a
keyboard<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.600> cramped

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
keyboard but it is a little bit cramped

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.220 
keyboard but it is a little bit cramped
it's<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.649> full<00:00:56.039> sized<00:00:56.399> iPad<00:00:56.699> keyboard<00:00:57.230> in

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
it's not a full sized iPad keyboard in

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.420 
it's not a full sized iPad keyboard in
order<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.710> you'd<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.190> sort<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
order to do that you'd have to sort of

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.790 
order to do that you'd have to sort of
have<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.609> butterfly<00:01:00.510> style<00:01:00.840> keyboard<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
have a butterfly style keyboard the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.439 
have a butterfly style keyboard the
other<00:01:01.949> drawback<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.520> keyboard<00:01:03.030> layout

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
other drawback is the keyboard layout

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.719 
other drawback is the keyboard layout
for<00:01:03.660> instance<00:01:03.899> there<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.110> no<00:01:04.700> apostrophe<00:01:05.700> key

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
for instance there is no apostrophe key

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.000 
for instance there is no apostrophe key
the<00:01:06.270> apostrophe<00:01:06.720> key<00:01:06.750> also<00:01:07.320> has<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> quotes

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the apostrophe key also has the quotes

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.460 
the apostrophe key also has the quotes
key<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.060> no<00:01:09.240> dedicated<00:01:09.600> key<00:01:10.260> for

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
key and there is no dedicated key for

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.170 
key and there is no dedicated key for
that<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.460> hit<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> function

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that and you have to hit the function

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.140 
that and you have to hit the function
button<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.500> an<00:01:13.770> apostrophe<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.610> that's<00:01:14.970> a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
button to get an apostrophe and that's a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.050 
button to get an apostrophe and that's a
little<00:01:15.299> bit<00:01:15.479> irritating<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.909> been

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
little bit irritating so there have been

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
little bit irritating so there have been
some<00:01:18.299> compromises<00:01:19.110> made<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:19.710> this

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
some compromises made to get this

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.850 
some compromises made to get this
keyboard<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.490> small<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.350> result

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
keyboard as small as it is as a result

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.770 
keyboard as small as it is as a result
this<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.400> those<00:01:23.490> funny<00:01:23.729> products<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
this is one of those funny products that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.929 
this is one of those funny products that
is<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> good<00:01:25.500> product<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> does<00:01:26.729> have

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
is a good product but it does have

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.399 
is a good product but it does have
enough<00:01:27.090> drawbacks<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> would<00:01:28.140> give<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
enough drawbacks that it would give you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.679 
enough drawbacks that it would give you
pause<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.280> one<00:01:29.490> especially<00:01:30.299> because<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
pause to get one especially because it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.450 
pause to get one especially because it
cost<00:01:30.869> 70<00:01:31.290> dollars<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.159> what<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> would

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
cost 70 dollars so what I would

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.219 
cost 70 dollars so what I would
recommend<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.240> only<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:33.990> case

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
recommend is that you only get this case

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.719 
recommend is that you only get this case
if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.470> really<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.250> you're<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> use

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
if you really think you're going to use

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.580 
if you really think you're going to use
the<00:01:35.880> keyboard<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.390> lot<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.869> keyboard<00:01:37.229> isn't

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the keyboard a lot the keyboard isn't

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.870 
the keyboard a lot the keyboard isn't
removable<00:01:37.979> from<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> case<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
removable from the case if you have to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
removable from the case if you have to
keep<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> keyboard<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.630> there<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
keep the keyboard in there and that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.380
