eager has to work acoustically and so
the<00:00:03.179> two<00:00:03.389> teams<00:00:03.419> had<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.929> understand<00:00:04.770> each

the two teams had to understand each
other's<00:00:05.730> disciplines<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:07.189> the<00:00:08.189> result<00:00:08.580> is

but<00:01:04.260> feel<00:01:04.680> free<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.129> walk<00:01:05.430> around<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.840> welding

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
but feel free to walk around the welding

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.830 
but feel free to walk around the welding
and<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.189> polishing<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> extremely<00:01:09.479> high<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and the polishing is extremely high and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.679 
and the polishing is extremely high and
it's<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.220> becomes<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.970> piece<00:01:12.470> very<00:01:13.470> very

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
it's like it becomes one piece very very

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.800 
it's like it becomes one piece very very
precise<00:01:15.689> work<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.290> very<00:01:16.409> expensive<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> do

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
precise work and very expensive to do

precise work and very expensive to do
last<00:01:18.810> thing<00:01:19.759> this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.939> aluminium<00:01:21.650> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.830> tell

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
last thing this is aluminium if you tell

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700 
last thing this is aluminium if you tell
a<00:01:23.070> minium<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.670> with<00:01:24.090> drivers<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.320> would<00:01:25.590> be

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
a minium and with drivers in it would be

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.749 
a minium and with drivers in it would be
terrible<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> loudspeaker<00:01:28.040> but<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.579> would

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
terrible as a loudspeaker but it would

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.740 
terrible as a loudspeaker but it would
ring<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.180> about

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.850 

inside<00:01:34.750> this<00:01:35.080> speaker<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.880> lighting<00:01:37.860> are

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
inside this speaker the lighting are

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.180 
inside this speaker the lighting are
it's<00:01:39.550> padded<00:01:40.150> with<00:01:41.520> bags<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.790> sausages<00:01:43.420> of

it's padded with bags and sausages of

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.320 
it's padded with bags and sausages of
granules<00:01:45.190> of<00:01:45.310> carbon<00:01:47.010> which<00:01:48.010> actually<00:01:48.730> has<00:01:49.270> a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
granules of carbon which actually has a

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.930 
granules of carbon which actually has a
big<00:01:49.660> acoustic<00:01:50.320> benefit<00:01:50.800> it's<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.520> technology

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
big acoustic benefit it's a technology

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.210 
big acoustic benefit it's a technology
of<00:01:52.390> ours<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.900> could<00:01:53.110> talk<00:01:53.320> for<00:01:53.530> hours<00:01:53.560> I'm<00:01:53.979> not

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
of ours I could talk for hours I'm not

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.240 
of ours I could talk for hours I'm not
going<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.550> bore<00:01:54.790> you<00:01:55.000> with<00:01:55.240> it<00:01:56.070> basically<00:01:57.070> what

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
going to bore you with it basically what

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.090 
going to bore you with it basically what
it<00:01:57.280> means<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.970> speaker<00:01:58.560> actually<00:01:59.560> thinks

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
it means is the speaker actually thinks

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.760 
it means is the speaker actually thinks
it's<00:02:00.790> much<00:02:01.180> bigger<00:02:01.450> than<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:01.930> so<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.620> can

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
it's much bigger than it is so it can

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.850 
it's much bigger than it is so it can
make<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.920> closed<00:02:03.400> box<00:02:03.900> which<00:02:04.900> is<00:02:04.930> quick<00:02:05.410> in

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
make a closed box which is quick in

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.610 
make a closed box which is quick in
response<00:02:06.340> but<00:02:07.300> goes<00:02:07.479> very<00:02:07.690> deep<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:11.200> will<00:02:11.380> live

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
response but goes very deep we will live

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.190 
response but goes very deep we will live
