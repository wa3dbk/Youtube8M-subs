well<00:00:03.010> there's<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:04.540> willow<00:00:04.720> trees<00:00:04.990> I'm

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.109 
well there's the willow trees I'm

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.170 
well there's the willow trees I'm
holding<00:00:05.470> and<00:00:05.649> I<00:00:05.710> just<00:00:05.890> thought<00:00:06.040> if<00:00:06.640> over<00:00:06.970> here

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.180 
holding and I just thought if over here

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.240 
holding and I just thought if over here
to<00:00:07.419> where<00:00:07.600> there's<00:00:08.350> some<00:00:08.500> old<00:00:08.620> willow<00:00:08.980> trees

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
to where there's some old willow trees

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.400 
to where there's some old willow trees
that<00:00:09.460> have<00:00:09.550> been<00:00:09.730> left<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.990> haven't<00:00:11.290> been

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
that have been left that haven't been

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.310 
that have been left that haven't been
Paulo<00:00:11.650> did<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:13.300> you<00:00:13.540> can<00:00:13.660> see<00:00:13.840> what<00:00:13.990> happens

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
Paulo did and you can see what happens

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.510 
Paulo did and you can see what happens
if<00:00:14.440> they're<00:00:14.620> just<00:00:14.800> left<00:00:15.040> and<00:00:15.280> they're<00:00:15.400> not

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
if they're just left and they're not

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.060 
if they're just left and they're not
pollarded<00:00:15.970> at<00:00:16.150> all<00:00:16.410> after<00:00:17.410> someone<00:00:17.710> started

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
pollarded at all after someone started

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.339 
pollarded at all after someone started
that<00:00:18.220> regime<00:00:18.599> here<00:00:19.599> we<00:00:19.720> go<00:00:19.839> there's<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.109> big

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
that regime here we go there's a big

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.540 
that regime here we go there's a big
trunk<00:00:21.220> there<00:00:21.609> of<00:00:22.599> an<00:00:22.839> old<00:00:22.990> willow<00:00:23.400> when<00:00:24.400> you

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
trunk there of an old willow when you

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.429 
trunk there of an old willow when you
get<00:00:24.730> the<00:00:24.939> sort<00:00:25.390> where<00:00:25.539> the<00:00:25.689> crown<00:00:25.929> is<00:00:26.140> like<00:00:26.320> it

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
get the sort where the crown is like it

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.349 
get the sort where the crown is like it
is<00:00:26.499> on<00:00:26.679> the<00:00:26.769> ones<00:00:26.919> I'm<00:00:27.099> holding<00:00:27.279> you<00:00:28.029> can<00:00:28.210> see

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
is on the ones I'm holding you can see

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.019 
is on the ones I'm holding you can see
it's<00:00:28.480> all<00:00:28.599> split<00:00:28.960> off<00:00:29.369> there's<00:00:30.369> big<00:00:30.579> branches

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
it's all split off there's big branches

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.810 
it's all split off there's big branches
come<00:00:31.269> across<00:00:31.599> here<00:00:32.430> basically<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.550> trees

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
come across here basically the trees

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.430 
come across here basically the trees
collapsed<00:00:34.390> it's<00:00:34.540> only<00:00:34.720> where<00:00:34.870> they<00:00:34.960> branches

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
collapsed it's only where they branches

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.690 
collapsed it's only where they branches
have<00:00:35.530> fallen<00:00:35.710> down<00:00:35.950> there<00:00:36.190> this<00:00:36.400> holding

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
have fallen down there this holding

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.730 
have fallen down there this holding
trunk<00:00:37.000> cut<00:00:37.240> and<00:00:38.050> we've<00:00:38.170> got<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.380> same<00:00:38.530> issue

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
trunk cut and we've got the same issue

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.210 
trunk cut and we've got the same issue
here<00:00:39.870> these<00:00:40.870> these<00:00:40.930> branches<00:00:41.740> are<00:00:41.770> now<00:00:41.980> nearly

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
here these these branches are now nearly

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.390 
here these these branches are now nearly
horizontal<00:00:42.910> on<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.090> ground<00:00:43.360> and<00:00:44.350> this<00:00:45.070> is<00:00:45.280> the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
horizontal on the ground and this is the

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.750 
horizontal on the ground and this is the
trunk<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.850> an<00:00:45.940> old<00:00:46.060> willow<00:00:46.420> here<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:48.430> it<00:00:48.580> is

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
trunk of an old willow here there it is

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.080 
trunk of an old willow here there it is
that's<00:00:49.120> where<00:00:49.360> it<00:00:49.480> comes<00:00:49.630> out<00:00:49.840> of<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:49.990> ground

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that's where it comes out of the ground

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.040 
that's where it comes out of the ground
going<00:00:52.090> up<00:00:52.360> there<00:00:54.120> hard<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.240> make<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.600> guess

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
going up there hard to make it I guess

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.990 
going up there hard to make it I guess
on<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.320> film<00:00:56.590> but<00:00:56.830> from<00:00:57.400> my<00:00:57.640> point<00:00:57.880> of<00:00:57.940> view

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
on the film but from my point of view

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.080 
on the film but from my point of view
that<00:00:58.330> trees<00:00:59.020> a<00:00:59.050> bit<00:00:59.320> of<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.470> gun<00:00:59.650> owner<00:00:59.890> hey<00:01:00.090> it's

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
that trees a bit of a gun owner hey it's

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.730 
that trees a bit of a gun owner hey it's
basically<00:01:01.420> there<00:01:01.690> there's<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.200> crane<00:01:02.470> there

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
basically there there's the crane there

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.560 
basically there there's the crane there
trees<00:01:03.520> gone<00:01:03.670> right<00:01:03.880> over<00:01:04.059> on<00:01:04.150> its<00:01:04.299> side<00:01:04.359> and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
trees gone right over on its side and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.950 
trees gone right over on its side and
the<00:01:04.899> branches<00:01:05.289> are<00:01:05.350> right<00:01:05.649> up<00:01:05.890> here<00:01:06.280> I<00:01:06.960> mean

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
the branches are right up here I mean

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.469 
the branches are right up here I mean
it's<00:01:08.049> not<00:01:08.109> gonna<00:01:08.259> hurt<00:01:08.469> it<00:01:08.530> left<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:09.100> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
it's not gonna hurt it left in the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.179 
it's not gonna hurt it left in the
that's<00:01:10.479> part<00:01:10.689> of<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.869> common<00:01:11.200> there<00:01:11.409> but<00:01:12.100> if

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
that's part of the common there but if

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.620 
that's part of the common there but if
that<00:01:12.310> was<00:01:12.429> in<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.579> field<00:01:12.820> you'd<00:01:13.210> be<00:01:13.299> no<00:01:13.450> good

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
that was in a field you'd be no good

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.270 
that was in a field you'd be no good
you'd<00:01:13.899> have<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.109> kill<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.439> up<00:01:14.590> because<00:01:15.070> we<00:01:15.189> in

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
you'd have to kill it up because we in

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.330 
you'd have to kill it up because we in
the<00:01:15.369> way<00:01:15.490> everything<00:01:15.909> here's<00:01:16.359> another<00:01:16.659> one

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the way everything here's another one

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.779 
the way everything here's another one
another<00:01:18.340> old<00:01:18.670> willow<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:21.130> see<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.369> big<00:01:21.609> old

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
another old willow you see a big old

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.230 
another old willow you see a big old
gnarly<00:01:22.030> trunk<00:01:22.539> there<00:01:23.249> again<00:01:24.249> it's<00:01:24.850> leaning

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
gnarly trunk there again it's leaning

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.239 
gnarly trunk there again it's leaning
over<00:01:25.329> now<00:01:25.719> you<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.020> kraang's<00:01:26.319> split<00:01:26.740> there<00:01:27.009> at

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
over now you the kraang's split there at

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.219 
over now you the kraang's split there at
the<00:01:27.310> top<00:01:27.549> and<00:01:27.759> these<00:01:28.210> old<00:01:28.450> branches<00:01:28.689> have<00:01:29.109> all

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
the top and these old branches have all

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.219 
the top and these old branches have all
come<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.770> huge<00:01:30.340> they've<00:01:31.210> come<00:01:31.479> off<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:35.170> this

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
come a huge they've come off this this

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.050 
come a huge they've come off this this
is<00:01:35.679> something<00:01:35.889> that<00:01:35.979> it's<00:01:36.249> just<00:01:36.340> sort<00:01:36.819> of<00:01:36.909> one

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
is something that it's just sort of one

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.399 
is something that it's just sort of one
of<00:01:37.149> those<00:01:37.240> things<00:01:37.539> really<00:01:37.749> I<00:01:37.899> mean<00:01:38.139> people

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
of those things really I mean people

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.870 
of those things really I mean people
aren't<00:01:38.560> polishing<00:01:39.130> willow<00:01:39.340> trees<00:01:39.549> like<00:01:39.759> they

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
aren't polishing willow trees like they

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.469 
aren't polishing willow trees like they
used<00:01:40.119> to

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
used to

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.679 
used to
and<00:01:41.639> that's<00:01:42.639> what<00:01:42.789> happened<00:01:43.090> these<00:01:43.179> are<00:01:43.539> just

and that's what happened these are just
I've<00:01:43.899> left<00:01:44.139> these<00:01:44.350> because<00:01:44.649> they're<00:01:44.770> on<00:01:44.889> the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
I've left these because they're on the

I've left these because they're on the
side<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.310> common<00:01:45.670> not<00:01:46.389> doing<00:01:46.569> any<00:01:46.689> harm

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.859 
really that's a shame I mean it they're
still<00:01:50.020> alive<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.490> they<00:01:52.030> still<00:01:52.209> got<00:01:52.329> a<00:01:52.359> habitat

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
still alive so they still got a habitat

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.569 
still alive so they still got a habitat
for<00:01:53.109> wildlife<00:01:53.439> they're<00:01:53.829> not<00:01:53.950> hurting<00:01:54.340> but<00:01:54.459> you

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
for wildlife they're not hurting but you

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:55.709 
for wildlife they're not hurting but you
imagine<00:01:54.909> like<00:01:55.030> steady<00:01:55.270> factors<00:01:55.569> in<00:01:55.659> your

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
imagine like steady factors in your

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.649 
imagine like steady factors in your
field<00:01:56.490> tree<00:01:57.490> be<00:01:57.609> down<00:01:57.759> on<00:01:57.789> its<00:01:57.999> side<00:01:58.060> all<00:01:58.420> over

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
field tree be down on its side all over

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.830 
field tree be down on its side all over
the<00:01:58.749> home<00:01:58.869> there'll<00:01:59.350> be<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.499> right<00:01:59.679> mess<00:02:00.840> so

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
the home there'll be a right mess so

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.539 
the home there'll be a right mess so
that's<00:02:02.079> why<00:02:02.289> I'm<00:02:02.499> carrying<00:02:02.770> on<00:02:03.009> pollen<00:02:03.340> in<00:02:03.459> the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
that's why I'm carrying on pollen in the

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.059 
that's why I'm carrying on pollen in the
willow<00:02:03.759> trees<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:05.049> few<00:02:05.289> that<00:02:05.380> we've<00:02:05.560> got<00:02:05.770> over

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
willow trees the few that we've got over

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.620 
willow trees the few that we've got over
there<00:02:06.219> I<00:02:06.249> think<00:02:06.579> it's<00:02:06.759> worth<00:02:06.909> keeping<00:02:07.149> them<00:02:07.420> go

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
there I think it's worth keeping them go

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.160 
there I think it's worth keeping them go
in<00:02:08.939> there<00:02:09.939> we<00:02:10.030> go<00:02:10.209> there's<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.479> one<00:02:10.629> I<00:02:10.659> did<00:02:10.989> and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
in there we go there's the one I did and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.270 
in there we go there's the one I did and
there's<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.439> one<00:02:11.530> I've<00:02:11.680> got<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.890> do<00:02:12.129> in<00:02:12.220> a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
there's the one I've got to do in a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.830 
there's the one I've got to do in a
minute

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.120 

and<00:02:17.840> there's<00:02:18.020> my<00:02:18.140> tripod<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.680> can<00:02:18.800> just<00:02:18.980> see

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
and there's my tripod you can just see

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.170 
and there's my tripod you can just see
them<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.720> there<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:23.930> go<00:02:23.960> that's<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.560> last

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
them so there we go that's the last

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.020 
them so there we go that's the last
willow<00:02:26.180> tree<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.570> do<00:02:28.060> I've<00:02:29.060> done<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.450> one

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
willow tree to do I've done that one

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.170 
willow tree to do I've done that one
I've<00:02:32.030> done<00:02:32.240> these<00:02:32.420> two<00:02:32.690> over<00:02:32.960> here<00:02:33.880> my<00:02:34.880> sight

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
I've done these two over here my sight

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.780 
I've done these two over here my sight
not<00:02:35.480> one<00:02:35.600> up<00:02:35.720> there<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.890> just<00:02:37.130> this<00:02:37.250> last<00:02:37.520> one

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
not one up there and just this last one

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.690 
not one up there and just this last one
it's<00:02:38.360> in<00:02:38.510> particularly<00:02:38.780> awkward<00:02:38.990> corner

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
it's in particularly awkward corner

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.080 
it's in particularly awkward corner
right<00:02:40.700> above<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.090> stream<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:43.090> hedgerow

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
right above the stream and hedgerow

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.790 
right above the stream and hedgerow
around<00:02:44.570> two<00:02:44.810> sides<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.320> barbed<00:02:45.560> wire

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
around two sides of it and barbed wire

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.530 
around two sides of it and barbed wire
so<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.220> not<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> particularly<00:02:46.640> great<00:02:46.880> jar<00:02:47.300> and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
so it's not a particularly great jar and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.970 
so it's not a particularly great jar and
really<00:02:47.780> not<00:02:47.900> looking<00:02:47.990> forward<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.440> the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
really not looking forward to that the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.890 
really not looking forward to that the
only<00:02:49.190> positive<00:02:49.400> thing<00:02:49.880> is<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.510> branches

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
only positive thing is that the branches

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.590 
only positive thing is that the branches
aren't<00:02:51.170> too<00:02:51.320> big<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:53.120> I'm<00:02:53.180> gonna<00:02:53.300> get<00:02:53.480> up

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
aren't too big on it so I'm gonna get up

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.900 
aren't too big on it so I'm gonna get up

there with my ladder and try and whip
that<00:02:55.940> down
