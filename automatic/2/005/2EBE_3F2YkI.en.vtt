00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:13.259 
I'm going to pull towards myself and
spin<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:04.179> turntable<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.790> more<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.120> you

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
spin the turntable and the more that you

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.030 
spin the turntable and the more that you
do<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.959> more<00:02:14.379> they're<00:02:14.650> going<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.830> blend

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
do it the more they're going to blend

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.860 
do it the more they're going to blend
into<00:02:15.190> each<00:02:15.340> other<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:16.000> just<00:02:16.299> depends<00:02:16.690> on

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
into each other so it just depends on

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:26.309 
into each other so it just depends on
how<00:02:16.930> much<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.500> strike<00:02:17.799> you<00:02:18.010> want<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:26.290> just

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
keep going until it's blended the way

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.210 
keep going until it's blended the way
you<00:02:28.540> want<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:28.989> can<00:02:29.140> see<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:30.010> kept
