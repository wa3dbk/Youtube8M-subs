doing that here but you can try some
different<00:00:32.610> things<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:34.110> good<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.590> make<00:00:34.739> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
different things and it's good to make a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.819 
different things and it's good to make a
board<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.840> I've<00:00:36.840> written<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.559> with

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
board like this I've written on it with

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.389 
board like this I've written on it with
Sharpie<00:00:38.300> what<00:00:39.300> mediums<00:00:40.230> I've<00:00:40.440> used<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.190> I've

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
Sharpie what mediums I've used and I've

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.450 
Sharpie what mediums I've used and I've
written<00:00:41.550> down<00:00:41.730> also<00:00:42.440> what<00:00:43.440> colors<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.010> put<00:00:44.250> in

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
written down also what colors I put in

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.490 
written down also what colors I put in
and<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.270> kind<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.600> thing<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.020> other<00:00:46.140> places

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and that kind of thing in other places

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.369 
and that kind of thing in other places
but<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.550> good<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.120> kind<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.480> keep<00:00:48.690> some<00:00:49.110> sort

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
but it's good to kind of keep some sort

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.770 
but it's good to kind of keep some sort
of<00:00:49.410> basic<00:00:49.590> record<00:00:50.160> until<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.820> sort<00:00:51.719> of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
of basic record until you just sort of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.200 
of basic record until you just sort of
understand<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.739> you're<00:00:52.860> doing<00:00:53.219> okay<00:00:54.180> so

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
understand what you're doing okay so

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.209 
understand what you're doing okay so
this<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> matte<00:00:54.989> medium<00:00:55.170> now<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.829> has

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
this is the matte medium now this has

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.810 
this is the matte medium now this has
paint<00:00:56.820> mixed<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.829> has<00:00:58.829> phthalo<00:00:59.340> turquoise

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
paint mixed in it has phthalo turquoise

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.560 
paint mixed in it has phthalo turquoise
mixed<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:00.870> matte<00:01:01.170> medium<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:02.180> then<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> drop

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
mixed with matte medium and then I drop

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.890 
mixed with matte medium and then I drop
the<00:01:03.750> other<00:01:03.899> colors<00:01:04.409> into<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.720> moved<00:01:06.720> it

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the other colors into it and moved it

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.770 
the other colors into it and moved it
around<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.250> clay<00:01:08.490> sculpting<00:01:08.880> tool<00:01:09.240> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
around with the clay sculpting tool that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710 
around with the clay sculpting tool that
looks<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:11.000> just<00:01:12.000> or<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.540> use<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
looks like this just or you can use a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.920 
looks like this just or you can use a
nail<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.010> use<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> toothpick<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.720> let's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
nail you can use a toothpick so let's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.190 
nail you can use a toothpick so let's
see<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.409> looks<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.860> underneath<00:01:17.280> just

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
see what it looks like underneath just

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.020 
see what it looks like underneath just
pull<00:01:19.200> gently<00:01:19.409> around<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> edges<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.670> really

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
pull gently around the edges it's really

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.670 
pull gently around the edges it's really
pretty<00:01:21.270> easy<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> problem

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
pretty easy to get up it's not a problem

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
pretty easy to get up it's not a problem
and<00:01:23.060> there<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.210> go<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.490> see<00:01:26.729> how

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
and there you go so you can see how

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.649 
and there you go so you can see how
different<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:27.990> underneath<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:30.030> one<00:01:30.540> of

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
different it is underneath now it one of

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.840 
different it is underneath now it one of
the<00:01:30.750> reasons<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.590> looks<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the reasons that it looks like this is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.630 
the reasons that it looks like this is
because<00:01:33.540> when<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.229> mix<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.740> paint<00:01:35.040> with<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
because when you mix the paint with the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.450 
because when you mix the paint with the
medium<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:37.020> base<00:01:37.229> instead<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.100> using

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
medium as your base instead of using

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.080 
medium as your base instead of using
just<00:01:38.790> medium<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.930> base<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:41.009> media<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
just medium as the base the media the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.280 
just medium as the base the media the
paint<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:43.740> little<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.130> thicker<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:45.290> denser

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
paint is a little bit thicker a denser

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.249 
paint is a little bit thicker a denser
and<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:47.070> holds<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.970> paint<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.600> top<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.990> it

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and it holds this paint on top of it

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.289 
and it holds this paint on top of it
more<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.619> that's<00:01:52.619> why<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.610> little<00:01:54.090> less

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
more so that's why you get a little less

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.520 
more so that's why you get a little less
color<00:01:54.630> coming<00:01:55.140> through<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.680> other<00:01:55.890> side

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
color coming through to the other side

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.219 
color coming through to the other side
so<00:01:58.610> that's<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.939> now<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.930> matte

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
so that's that now this is the matte

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.490 
so that's that now this is the matte
medium<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.520> showed<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.899> with<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
medium like I showed you with just the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.100 
medium like I showed you with just the
medium<00:02:04.920> laid<00:02:05.159> down<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:06.210> colors<00:02:06.570> dropped<00:02:06.869> into

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
medium laid down the colors dropped into

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.290 
medium laid down the colors dropped into
it<00:02:07.409> moved<00:02:07.680> around<00:02:08.009> essentially<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> same<00:02:09.090> way

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
it moved around essentially the same way

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.260 
it moved around essentially the same way
I<00:02:09.330> move<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.810> around<00:02:10.640> with<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> toothpick<00:02:12.209> a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
I move this around with a toothpick a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.020 
I move this around with a toothpick a
nail<00:02:12.830> sculpt

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
nail sculpt

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.340 
nail sculpt
so<00:02:14.530> there's<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.770> back<00:02:16.630> though<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.780> color<00:02:17.990> sat

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
so there's the back though the color sat

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.810 
so there's the back though the color sat
on<00:02:18.500> top<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.920> medium<00:02:19.280> they're<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.520> little

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
on top of the medium they're a little

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.730 
on top of the medium they're a little
more<00:02:19.910> than<00:02:20.180> they<00:02:20.300> usually<00:02:20.480> do<00:02:20.900> if<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.500> hadn't

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
more than they usually do if I hadn't

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.430 
more than they usually do if I hadn't
wanted<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.520> be<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.700> little<00:02:23.150> more<00:02:23.600> have<00:02:24.410> the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
wanted this to be a little more have the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.380 
wanted this to be a little more have the
colors<00:02:24.800> come<00:02:25.040> through<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.310> little<00:02:25.580> more<00:02:25.760> than<00:02:26.270> I

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
colors come through a little more than I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.820 
colors come through a little more than I
would<00:02:26.600> have<00:02:26.630> mixed<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.170> with<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.320> pouring

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
would have mixed it with a pouring

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.520 
would have mixed it with a pouring
medium<00:02:28.280> or<00:02:28.580> little<00:02:29.090> water<00:02:29.330> but<00:02:30.110> I<00:02:30.170> wanted<00:02:30.470> to

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
medium or little water but I wanted to

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.800 
medium or little water but I wanted to
show<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.830> how<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.250> matte<00:02:31.580> medium<00:02:31.730> holds<00:02:32.630> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
show you how the matte medium holds the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.500 
show you how the matte medium holds the
paint<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.520> just<00:02:34.700> depends<00:02:35.000> on<00:02:35.090> what<00:02:35.240> kind<00:02:35.450> of

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
paint so it just depends on what kind of

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.080 
paint so it just depends on what kind of
effect<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.050> want<00:02:36.340> okay<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.520> is<00:02:37.700> pouring

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
effect you want okay this is pouring

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.690 
effect you want okay this is pouring
medium<00:02:38.420> now<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.630> can<00:02:38.930> see<00:02:39.290> how<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:40.340> pouring

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
medium now you can see how the pouring

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.420 
medium now you can see how the pouring
medium<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.480> colors<00:02:41.900> mix<00:02:42.260> together<00:02:42.470> they're

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
medium the colors mix together they're

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.850 
medium the colors mix together they're
just<00:02:43.700> completely<00:02:44.150> mixed<00:02:44.570> together<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:45.140> didn't

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
just completely mixed together I didn't

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.199 
just completely mixed together I didn't
do<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.950> whole<00:02:46.220> lot<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.489> mixing<00:02:46.820> with<00:02:47.000> this

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
do a whole lot of mixing with this

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.830 
do a whole lot of mixing with this
because<00:02:47.870> they<00:02:48.050> will<00:02:48.170> do<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.470> themselves<00:02:49.840> so

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
because they will do it themselves so

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.490 
because they will do it themselves so
I'm<00:02:51.140> going<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.350> pull<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.709> off<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:54.170> colors

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
I'm going to pull it off and the colors

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.890 
I'm going to pull it off and the colors
basically<00:02:54.800> have<00:02:55.280> sunk<00:02:55.610> down<00:02:56.180> through<00:02:56.660> the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
basically have sunk down through the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.770 
basically have sunk down through the
medium<00:02:57.850> so<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:58.880> gives<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.390> different

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
medium so that gives you a different

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.780 
medium so that gives you a different
technique<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.920> gloss<00:03:01.160> medium<00:03:01.459> the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
technique this is the gloss medium the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.479 
technique this is the gloss medium the
gloss<00:03:01.970> medium<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.570> colors<00:03:02.840> mix<00:03:03.170> too<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.860> it

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
gloss medium the colors mix too and it

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.330 
gloss medium the colors mix too and it
really<00:03:04.700> mix<00:03:05.000> them<00:03:05.410> but<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.739> can<00:03:06.920> see<00:03:07.160> the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
really mix them but you can see the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.190 
really mix them but you can see the
difference<00:03:07.760> between<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.480> pouring<00:03:08.840> medium

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
difference between the pouring medium

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.040 
difference between the pouring medium
which<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.500> just<00:03:09.860> everywhere<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.810> gloss

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
which is just everywhere and the gloss

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.430 
which is just everywhere and the gloss
medium<00:03:12.320> where<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.730> paint<00:03:14.080> holds<00:03:15.080> a<00:03:15.200> little

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
medium where the paint holds a little

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.100 
medium where the paint holds a little
bit<00:03:15.560> more<00:03:15.830> but<00:03:16.040> still<00:03:16.160> mixes<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:17.660> let's<00:03:17.900> see

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
bit more but still mixes so let's see

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.830 
bit more but still mixes so let's see
what<00:03:18.320> that<00:03:18.350> looks<00:03:18.739> like<00:03:18.830> underneath<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:20.690> can

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
what that looks like underneath you can

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.460 
what that looks like underneath you can
see<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.320> gloss<00:03:21.530> medium<00:03:21.830> is<00:03:22.160> very<00:03:22.220> transparent

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
see the gloss medium is very transparent

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.410 
see the gloss medium is very transparent
where<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.739> color<00:03:24.950> where<00:03:25.880> there's<00:03:26.060> no<00:03:26.180> color

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
where the color where there's no color

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.570 
where the color where there's no color
so<00:03:27.200> if<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.350> wanted<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.680> just<00:03:28.010> use<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.400> gloss

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
so if you wanted to just use the gloss

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.400 
so if you wanted to just use the gloss
medium<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.450> little<00:03:29.750> bit<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:29.959> color<00:03:30.140> you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
medium and a little bit of color you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.110 
medium and a little bit of color you
could<00:03:30.530> really<00:03:30.799> layer<00:03:31.100> them<00:03:31.459> because<00:03:31.970> they're

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
could really layer them because they're

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.620 
could really layer them because they're
very<00:03:32.330> clear<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.700> that's<00:03:34.940> what<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.239> looks<00:03:35.420> like

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
very clear so that's what it looks like

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.509 
very clear so that's what it looks like
on<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.280> back<00:03:39.670> this<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:40.940> matte<00:03:41.239> medium<00:03:42.519> also

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
on the back this is matte medium also

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.090 
on the back this is matte medium also
now<00:03:44.450> this<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:44.840> where<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.049> took<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.560> sculpting

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
now this is where I took the sculpting

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.800 
now this is where I took the sculpting
tool<00:03:47.560> like<00:03:48.560> this<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.239> drug<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.480> colors

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
tool like this and drug the colors

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.130 
tool like this and drug the colors
together<00:03:51.049> so<00:03:52.239> let's<00:03:53.239> see<00:03:53.390> how<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:53.720> came<00:03:53.900> out

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
together so let's see how that came out

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.660 
together so let's see how that came out
so<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:54.650> can<00:03:54.799> see<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:56.120> colors<00:03:56.660> are<00:03:57.670> sort

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
so you can see the the colors are sort

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.810 
so you can see the the colors are sort
of<00:03:58.700> they're<00:03:59.060> just<00:03:59.750> mixed<00:04:00.230> but<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.440> mix<00:04:00.799> them<00:04:01.660> so

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
of they're just mixed but I mix them so

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.509 
of they're just mixed but I mix them so
look<00:04:04.820> at<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:04.970> isn't<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.780> interesting

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
look at that isn't that interesting

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.710 
look at that isn't that interesting
that's<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:08.170> pretty<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.820> really<00:04:11.180> like<00:04:11.510> that

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
that's so pretty and really like that

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.830 
that's so pretty and really like that
and<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:13.880> see<00:04:14.060> when<00:04:14.239> you're<00:04:14.390> using<00:04:14.630> the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
and you can see when you're using the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.259 
and you can see when you're using the
Gold's<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.320> Gold's<00:04:15.739> really<00:04:16.100> sink<00:04:16.430> more<00:04:17.120> than

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
Gold's the Gold's really sink more than

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.539 
Gold's the Gold's really sink more than
the<00:04:17.390> other<00:04:17.540> colors<00:04:17.780> do<00:04:18.140> so<00:04:18.919> this<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.370> last

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
the other colors do so this is the last

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.779 
the other colors do so this is the last
one<00:04:19.820> this<00:04:19.970> is<00:04:20.030> glazing<00:04:20.660> medium<00:04:20.810> glazing<00:04:21.789> lazy

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
medium is a little more opaque like the

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.640 
medium is a little more opaque like the
matte<00:04:25.550> medium<00:04:25.729> is

matte medium is
almost<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.370> frosted<00:04:29.000> look<00:04:29.180> you<00:04:30.020> can<00:04:30.169> see<00:04:30.350> the

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
almost a frosted look you can see the

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.140 
almost a frosted look you can see the
matte<00:04:30.620> medium<00:04:30.770> has<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.370> kind<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.610> frosted

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
matte medium has that kind of frosted

matte medium has that kind of frosted
look<00:04:32.270> glazing<00:04:33.110> medium<00:04:33.230> not<00:04:33.590> as<00:04:33.800> much<00:04:34.960> but<00:04:35.960> it's

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
look glazing medium not as much but it's

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.570 
look glazing medium not as much but it's
more<00:04:36.230> of<00:04:36.290> a<00:04:36.410> crackle<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:37.070> don't<00:04:37.280> know<00:04:37.370> if<00:04:37.490> you

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
more of a crackle I don't know if you

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.400 
more of a crackle I don't know if you
can<00:04:37.730> see<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.330> but<00:04:38.540> it's<00:04:38.720> got<00:04:38.840> more<00:04:38.990> of<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.169> much

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
can see that but it's got more of a much

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.650 
can see that but it's got more of a much
more<00:04:39.620> of<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.740> crackle<00:04:40.190> a<00:04:40.310> glaze<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.940> it<00:04:41.510> will

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
more of a crackle a glaze and it will

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.540 
more of a crackle a glaze and it will
keep<00:04:41.900> as<00:04:42.139> it<00:04:42.380> dries<00:04:42.650> getting<00:04:43.130> more<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.460> more

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
keep as it dries getting more and more

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.020 
keep as it dries getting more and more
crackly<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:45.190> that's<00:04:46.190> what<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.460> looks<00:04:46.490> like<00:04:46.820> on

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
crackly and that's what it looks like on

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.450 
crackly and that's what it looks like on
the<00:04:47.090> bottom<00:04:47.300> so<00:04:48.290> here's<00:04:48.530> a<00:04:48.590> board<00:04:48.889> of<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.220> few

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
the bottom so here's a board of a few

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.890 
the bottom so here's a board of a few
others<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:49.790> I<00:04:49.970> did<00:04:50.210> that<00:04:50.389> I<00:04:50.450> just<00:04:50.720> thought

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
others that I did that I just thought

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.210 
others that I did that I just thought
were<00:04:51.050> interesting<00:04:51.590> these<00:04:51.770> have<00:04:51.950> been<00:04:52.040> done

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
were interesting these have been done

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.460 
were interesting these have been done
over<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.610> past<00:04:52.820> few<00:04:53.030> months

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
over the past few months

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.030 
over the past few months
this<00:04:54.470> is<00:04:54.650> matte<00:04:54.860> medium<00:04:55.480> done<00:04:56.480> with<00:04:56.720> a

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
this is matte medium done with a

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.780 
this is matte medium done with a
sculpting<00:04:58.040> tool<00:04:58.070> and<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.930> back<00:05:00.169> is<00:05:00.790> really

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
sculpting tool and the back is really

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.740 
sculpting tool and the back is really
interesting<00:05:02.530> really<00:05:03.530> a<00:05:03.830> very<00:05:04.370> abstract

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
interesting really a very abstract

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.550 
interesting really a very abstract
looking<00:05:05.750> I<00:05:06.010> just<00:05:07.010> really<00:05:07.310> like<00:05:07.490> that<00:05:07.990> this<00:05:08.990> one

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
looking I just really like that this one

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
looking I just really like that this one
that's<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.190> bat<00:05:11.110> this<00:05:12.110> is<00:05:12.169> a<00:05:12.710> glazing<00:05:13.190> medium

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
that's the bat this is a glazing medium

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.450 
that's the bat this is a glazing medium
now<00:05:13.940> you<00:05:14.000> can<00:05:14.240> see<00:05:14.479> how<00:05:14.780> that<00:05:15.229> it's<00:05:15.380> older<00:05:15.830> it's

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
now you can see how that it's older it's

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.820 
now you can see how that it's older it's
starting<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:17.030> crackle<00:05:17.389> it's<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.320> you<00:05:18.650> could

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
starting to crackle it's it you could

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.219 
starting to crackle it's it you could
tear<00:05:19.160> it<00:05:19.240> it's<00:05:20.240> very<00:05:20.690> brittle<00:05:22.780> so<00:05:23.780> you<00:05:23.870> have<00:05:24.110> to

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
tear it it's very brittle so you have to

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.540 
tear it it's very brittle so you have to
keep<00:05:24.350> that<00:05:24.530> in<00:05:24.590> mind<00:05:24.889> if<00:05:25.070> you're<00:05:25.190> using<00:05:25.370> a

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
keep that in mind if you're using a

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.670 
keep that in mind if you're using a
glazing<00:05:26.000> medium<00:05:26.200> some<00:05:27.200> people<00:05:27.470> like<00:05:27.650> that

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
glazing medium some people like that

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.030 
glazing medium some people like that
some<00:05:27.950> people<00:05:28.220> don't<00:05:28.700> just<00:05:29.600> depends<00:05:30.139> but<00:05:30.919> you

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
some people don't just depends but you

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.620 
some people don't just depends but you
can<00:05:31.190> see<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.580> colors<00:05:31.940> don't<00:05:32.270> some<00:05:32.419> really

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
can see the colors don't some really

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.360 
can see the colors don't some really
interesting<00:05:32.870> things<00:05:33.110> but<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:33.710> love<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.190> back

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
interesting things but I love the back

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.580 
interesting things but I love the back
there<00:05:35.150> again<00:05:35.270> it's<00:05:35.600> very<00:05:35.690> very<00:05:36.110> abstract<00:05:38.590> this

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
there again it's very very abstract this

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.370 
there again it's very very abstract this
is<00:05:39.800> a<00:05:40.039> pouring<00:05:40.880> medium<00:05:41.240> it's<00:05:41.960> real

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
is a pouring medium it's real

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.909 
is a pouring medium it's real
translucent<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.550> less<00:05:43.760> the<00:05:44.330> less<00:05:44.650> color<00:05:45.650> you

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
translucent the less the less color you

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.500 
translucent the less the less color you
use<00:05:46.130> the<00:05:46.550> more<00:05:46.789> you're<00:05:47.000> going<00:05:47.120> to<00:05:47.210> have<00:05:47.360> that

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
use the more you're going to have that

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.260 
use the more you're going to have that
kind<00:05:47.720> of<00:05:47.780> glassy<00:05:48.260> effect<00:05:48.760> that's<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.970> front

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
kind of glassy effect that's the front

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.610 
kind of glassy effect that's the front
and<00:05:50.539> that's<00:05:50.600> the<00:05:50.780> back<00:05:50.900> they<00:05:51.320> don't<00:05:51.500> really

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
and that's the back they don't really

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.760 
and that's the back they don't really
look<00:05:51.830> that<00:05:51.890> different<00:05:52.630> this<00:05:53.630> is<00:05:53.930> done<00:05:54.560> on<00:05:54.740> a

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
look that different this is done on a

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.969 
look that different this is done on a
mirror<00:05:55.310> I<00:05:55.460> want<00:05:56.300> to<00:05:56.479> show<00:05:56.720> you<00:05:56.780> how<00:05:57.110> thin<00:05:57.710> it<00:05:57.860> is

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
mirror I want to show you how thin it is

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.360 
mirror I want to show you how thin it is
it's<00:05:58.280> very<00:05:58.370> very<00:05:58.910> thin<00:05:59.900> like<00:06:00.710> I<00:06:00.860> said<00:06:01.100> when<00:06:01.280> you

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
it's very very thin like I said when you

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.719 
it's very very thin like I said when you
use<00:06:01.610> a<00:06:01.639> mirror<00:06:02.180> this<00:06:02.570> is<00:06:02.780> pouring<00:06:03.229> medium<00:06:03.729> when

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
use a mirror this is pouring medium when

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.400 
use a mirror this is pouring medium when
you<00:06:04.850> use<00:06:05.090> a<00:06:05.120> mirror<00:06:05.570> it<00:06:05.660> just<00:06:05.870> it<00:06:06.110> does

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
you use a mirror it just it does

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.010 
you use a mirror it just it does
different<00:06:06.950> things<00:06:07.220> than<00:06:07.750> with<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:11.150> plastic

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
different things than with the plastic

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.290 
different things than with the plastic
so<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:12.979> colors<00:06:13.280> are<00:06:13.460> just<00:06:13.490> sitting<00:06:14.030> right<00:06:14.270> on

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
so the colors are just sitting right on

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.610 
so the colors are just sitting right on
top<00:06:14.919> the<00:06:15.919> back<00:06:16.130> is<00:06:16.310> pretty<00:06:16.550> too<00:06:17.410> but<00:06:18.410> there's

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
top the back is pretty too but there's
