talk about a an Apple watch that which

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.420 
talk about a an Apple watch that which
is<00:02:39.900> going<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.349> fitness<00:02:40.590> integrate<00:02:41.129> with

is going to have fitness integrate with

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.220 
is going to have fitness integrate with
it<00:02:41.610> now<00:02:41.760> what<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.030> think<00:02:42.390> may<00:02:42.540> be<00:02:42.569> happening<00:02:42.900> is

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it now what I think may be happening is

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.960 
it now what I think may be happening is
they're<00:02:43.769> going<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.980> push<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.190> technology

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
they're going to push this technology

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.509 
they're going to push this technology
into<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.989> iWatch<00:02:46.440> or<00:02:46.650> some<00:02:46.860> other<00:02:47.010> Fitness

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
into the iWatch or some other Fitness

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.600 
into the iWatch or some other Fitness
centric<00:02:47.880> device<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.980> like<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.130> because<00:02:50.340> it's

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
centric device I like this because it's

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.920 
centric device I like this because it's
durable<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.959> had<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:53.489> know<00:02:53.780> let's<00:02:54.780> say<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
durable if I had a you know let's say a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.619 
durable if I had a you know let's say a
glass<00:02:55.739> or<00:02:56.069> curved<00:02:56.459> glass<00:02:56.610> screen<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.420> would<00:02:57.540> be

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
glass or curved glass screen I would be

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.509 
glass or curved glass screen I would be
hesitant<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:58.110> scratch<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.129> I<00:02:59.310> hope<00:02:59.489> they

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
hesitant to scratch it and I hope they

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.460 
hesitant to scratch it and I hope they
can<00:02:59.790> figure<00:02:59.970> out<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.180> way<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.930> keep<00:03:01.079> something

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
can figure out a way to keep something

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.589 
can figure out a way to keep something
like<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:02.099> which<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.489> very<00:03:02.760> simple<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.299> looks

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
like this which is very simple and looks

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.410 
like this which is very simple and looks
honestly<00:03:03.840> just<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.379> a<00:03:04.410> wristband<00:03:05.209> keep<00:03:06.209> it

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
honestly just like a wristband keep it

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.550 
honestly just like a wristband keep it
very<00:03:06.900> fitness<00:03:07.680> centric<00:03:09.170> myself<00:03:10.170> I'm<00:03:10.260> probably

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
very fitness centric myself I'm probably

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.110 
very fitness centric myself I'm probably
going<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.040> get<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.310> iWatch<00:03:11.670> when<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:12.000> is

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
going to get the iWatch when it is

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.600 
going to get the iWatch when it is
announced<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.720> released<00:03:12.930> but<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.860> am<00:03:14.430> looking

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
announced and released but I am looking

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.699 
announced and released but I am looking
for<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> device<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.629> does<00:03:16.079> everything<00:03:16.379> that

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
for a device that does everything that

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.559 
for a device that does everything that
this<00:03:16.980> does<00:03:17.250> now<00:03:17.970> there<00:03:18.120> are<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.239> lot<00:03:18.359> of<00:03:18.389> other

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
this does now there are a lot of other

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.199 
this does now there are a lot of other
devices<00:03:18.930> out<00:03:19.290> there<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:20.609> Fitbit<00:03:20.970> force

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
devices out there the Fitbit force

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.970 
devices out there the Fitbit force
unfortunately<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:21.989> was<00:03:22.109> recalled<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:22.769> it's<00:03:22.920> not

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
unfortunately I was recalled so it's not

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.580 
unfortunately I was recalled so it's not
really<00:03:23.040> an<00:03:23.370> option<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.940> then<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.540> jawbone<00:03:25.079> up

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
really an option and then the jawbone up

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.509 
really an option and then the jawbone up
I<00:03:25.950> believe<00:03:26.340> which<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:26.670> just<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.120> band<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:29.010> looks

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
I believe which is just a band it looks

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.550 
I believe which is just a band it looks
like<00:03:29.609> a<00:03:29.700> just<00:03:29.970> little<00:03:30.120> drawstring<00:03:30.780> tie<00:03:31.079> it

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
like a just little drawstring tie it

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.930 
like a just little drawstring tie it
goes<00:03:31.709> around<00:03:31.950> your<00:03:32.099> wrist<00:03:32.370> not<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.609> problem

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
goes around your wrist not a problem

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.150 
goes around your wrist not a problem
with<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.120> these<00:03:34.019> device<00:03:34.620> or<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:34.950> problem

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
with that these device or the problem

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.620 
with that these device or the problem
with<00:03:35.280> these<00:03:35.370> devices<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:36.000> there's<00:03:36.269> not<00:03:36.569> a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
with these devices that there's not a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.370 
with these devices that there's not a
real<00:03:37.139> readout<00:03:38.269> well<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.359> fit<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.810> force<00:03:40.079> had

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
real readout well the fit that force had

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.949 
real readout well the fit that force had
a<00:03:40.620> small<00:03:41.430> color<00:03:41.819> read<00:03:42.180> out<00:03:42.359> here<00:03:42.599> did<00:03:42.810> have<00:03:42.930> a

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
a small color read out here did have a

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.659 
a small color read out here did have a
plastic<00:03:43.290> screen<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.069> got<00:03:44.280> scratched

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
plastic screen and that got scratched

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.229 
plastic screen and that got scratched
really<00:03:45.030> easily<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:47.310> jawbone<00:03:47.760> up<00:03:47.970> didn't

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
really easily the jawbone up didn't

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.420 
really easily the jawbone up didn't
really<00:03:48.450> have<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> readout<00:03:49.109> at<00:03:49.470> all<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:50.099> i

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
really have a readout at all and i

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.569 
really have a readout at all and i
believe<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.709> there's<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.829> fit<00:03:53.099> that<00:03:53.280> does<00:03:53.430> make

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
believe the there's a fit that does make

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.309 
believe the there's a fit that does make
another<00:03:53.970> device<00:03:54.329> but<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.660> only<00:03:54.750> has<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.290> few

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
another device but that only has a few
