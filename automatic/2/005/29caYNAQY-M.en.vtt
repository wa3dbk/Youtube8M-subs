care<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:15.800> before<00:00:16.800> activating<00:00:17.460> make<00:00:17.940> sure

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
care so before activating make sure

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.560 
care so before activating make sure
you've<00:00:18.300> got<00:00:18.330> them<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.840> hand<00:00:20.210> second<00:00:21.210> tip<00:00:21.420> is

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you've got them in hand second tip is

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.660 
you've got them in hand second tip is
notice<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> right<00:00:22.560> hand<00:00:22.890> side<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
notice on the right hand side you have a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.080 
notice on the right hand side you have a
little<00:00:23.970> menu<00:00:24.350> okay<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:26.310> green<00:00:26.490> things<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
little menu okay the green things in the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.029 
little menu okay the green things in the
menu<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.510> things<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:27.930> build<00:00:28.230> when<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
menu of things you can build when the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.299 
menu of things you can build when the
red<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.429> can't<00:00:29.670> build<00:00:29.910> them<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.349> suggest

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
red you can't build them so I suggest

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.010 
red you can't build them so I suggest
that<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.940> soon<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.390> you've<00:00:33.510> got<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> resources

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
that as soon as you've got the resources

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.680 
that as soon as you've got the resources
you<00:00:34.500> build<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.860> solar<00:00:35.040> panel<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.700> your

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you build a solar panel and your

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.530 
you build a solar panel and your
capacitor<00:00:37.260> okay<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:38.790> these<00:00:38.969> help<00:00:39.210> keep<00:00:39.420> your

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
capacitor okay now these help keep your

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.260 
capacitor okay now these help keep your
shields<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.230> your<00:00:40.350> guns<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.950> order<00:00:41.309> or<00:00:41.930> care

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
shields and your guns in order or care

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.549 
shields and your guns in order or care
by<00:00:45.270> keeping<00:00:45.690> them<00:00:45.809> charged<00:00:48.140> get<00:00:49.140> them<00:00:49.289> weird

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
by keeping them charged get them weird

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.400 
by keeping them charged get them weird
as<00:00:49.860> soon<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:54.079> that<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.199> happen

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
as soon as you can and that will happen

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:05.570 
as soon as you can and that will happen
a<00:00:55.590> lot<00:00:55.770> less<00:01:02.149> also<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.439> the<00:01:04.439> capacitor<00:01:05.250> how<00:01:05.430> it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
a lot less also and the capacitor how it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.850 
a lot less also and the capacitor how it
works<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.450> capacitor<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.200> solar<00:01:07.500> panel

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
works the capacitor and solar panel

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.460 
works the capacitor and solar panel
solar<00:01:08.670> panel<00:01:09.000> takes<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> charge<00:01:09.659> through<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
solar panel takes the charge through the

solar panel takes the charge through the
dear<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.549> see<00:01:11.700> charging<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.360> 12

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
dear as you can see charging up 12

dear as you can see charging up 12
charges<00:01:13.189> discharges<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.790> your<00:01:14.970> capacitor

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
charges discharges in your capacitor

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.020 
charges discharges in your capacitor
charge<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.170> narrow<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.909> your

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
charge and narrow now you can get your

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.390 
charge and narrow now you can get your
power<00:01:18.240> from<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.170> solar<00:01:19.439> panel<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.220> it's

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
power from your solar panel but it's

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.600 
power from your solar panel but it's
very<00:01:20.640> slow<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> capacitor<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.250> quick

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
very slow so the capacitor is for quick

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.240 
very slow so the capacitor is for quick
recharges<00:01:24.600> as<00:01:24.960> you'll<00:01:25.170> notice<00:01:25.380> watch<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.070> gun

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
recharges as you'll notice watch the gun

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.359 
recharges as you'll notice watch the gun
at<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> bottom<00:01:27.630> right<00:01:27.860> charges<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:28.979> very

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
at the bottom right charges up very

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.030 
at the bottom right charges up very
quickly<00:01:29.670> also<00:01:30.600> charges<00:01:31.020> your<00:01:31.170> shields<00:01:31.530> care

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
quickly also charges your shields care

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
quickly also charges your shields care
and<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> solar<00:01:33.900> panel<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.500> would

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and if that was a solar panel it would

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.819 
and if that was a solar panel it would
be<00:01:34.829> very<00:01:35.130> very<00:01:35.310> slow<00:01:35.850> okay<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.960> get<00:01:37.200> them<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.650> in

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
be very very slow okay so get them to in

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.020 
be very very slow okay so get them to in
order<00:01:38.130> first<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.829> if<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.159> starts<00:01:41.460> harmony<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
order first and if this starts harmony a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.719 
order first and if this starts harmony a
lot<00:01:47.149> then<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.360> need<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> health<00:01:48.780> station<00:01:49.490> now<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
lot then you need a health station now a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.580 
lot then you need a health station now a
health<00:01:50.939> station<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.689> only<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:52.020> built<00:01:52.259> when
