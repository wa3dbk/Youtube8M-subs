00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.040 

way<00:01:42.430> beyond<00:01:42.970> anything<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.900> can<00:01:44.110> imagine<00:01:46.050> but

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
way beyond anything I can imagine but

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.800 
way beyond anything I can imagine but
this<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.979> best<00:01:48.160> to<00:01:48.400> use<00:01:48.610> for<00:01:48.910> any<00:01:49.060> robust

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
this is the best to use for any robust

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.250 
this is the best to use for any robust
surgery<00:01:50.229> now<00:01:50.650> I<00:01:51.240> will<00:01:52.240> just<00:01:52.270> get<00:01:52.780> rid<00:01:52.869> of<00:01:52.930> that

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.410 

I<00:01:55.640> need<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:57.000> remove<00:01:57.350> more<00:01:58.350> bone<00:01:59.240> from<00:02:00.240> this

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
I need to remove more bone from this

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.460 
I need to remove more bone from this
carcass<00:02:01.730> because<00:02:02.730> otherwise<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.480> would<00:02:03.600> make

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
carcass because otherwise it would make

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.350 
carcass because otherwise it would make
the<00:02:04.650> surgery<00:02:05.010> absolutely<00:02:05.250> impossible<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the surgery absolutely impossible the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.150 
the surgery absolutely impossible the
left<00:02:09.630> side<00:02:11.300> seems<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.890> little<00:02:13.890> bit<00:02:14.070> of

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
left side seems to be a little bit of

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.210 
left side seems to be a little bit of
trouble<00:02:14.790> sorry<00:02:15.510> that

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.920 

by<00:02:20.730> mine<00:02:21.240> okay

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
by mine okay

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.550 
by mine okay
so<00:02:23.530> just<00:02:23.950> make<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:24.610> here<00:02:25.090> antigravity<00:02:26.080> can

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
so just make this here antigravity can

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.899 
so just make this here antigravity can
be<00:02:26.739> handy<00:02:27.159> sometimes<00:02:27.750> it's<00:02:28.750> not<00:02:28.930> always<00:02:29.170> an

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
be handy sometimes it's not always an

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.640 
be handy sometimes it's not always an
annoyance<00:02:32.640> now<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:33.849> thing<00:02:34.319> seems<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.500> have

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
annoyance now this thing seems to have

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.479 
annoyance now this thing seems to have
no<00:02:35.830> purpose<00:02:36.129> whatsoever<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.830> I'm<00:02:39.129> just<00:02:39.280> going

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
no purpose whatsoever so I'm just going

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.580 
no purpose whatsoever so I'm just going
to<00:02:39.579> throw<00:02:39.819> this<00:02:40.000> away<00:02:42.540> now<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.569> think<00:02:43.900> now<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
to throw this away now I think now I

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:52.020 
to throw this away now I think now I
need<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> scalpel<00:02:45.909> oh<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:50.500> appears<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:51.129> worked

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
need a scalpel oh it appears that worked

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.750 
need a scalpel oh it appears that worked
I<00:02:52.329> didn't<00:02:52.540> expect<00:02:52.840> back<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.079> work

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
I didn't expect back to work

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.030 
I didn't expect back to work
now<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.720> believe<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.950> center<00:02:57.519> organ<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:59.590> this

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
now I believe the center organ of this

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.910 
now I believe the center organ of this
gray<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:02.140> called<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.500> gobble<00:03:03.190> shaft<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.890> a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
gray it's called the gobble shaft it's a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.300 
gray it's called the gobble shaft it's a
little<00:03:06.129> very<00:03:08.099> saws<00:03:09.099> can<00:03:09.970> be<00:03:10.150> troublesome

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
little very saws can be troublesome

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.850 
little very saws can be troublesome

going to need to remove these six blue
membranes<00:03:46.690> on<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.140> left<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.730> on<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.299> right

membranes on the left and on the right

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.460 
membranes on the left and on the right
I<00:03:50.690> can<00:03:51.320> just<00:03:51.470> position<00:03:51.920> my<00:03:52.070> life<00:03:52.900> or<00:03:53.900> scalpel

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
I can just position my life or scalpel

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.570 
I can just position my life or scalpel
in<00:03:54.620> such<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:54.860> way<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.720> that's<00:03:56.960> um<00:03:57.460> at<00:03:58.460> the

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
in such a way and that's um at the

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.270 
in such a way and that's um at the
bottom

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.490 

and<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.700> top<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:02.810> Burges<00:04:03.440> borax<00:04:03.950> organ

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
and the top of the Burges borax organ

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.620 
and the top of the Burges borax organ
again<00:04:06.500> I'm<00:04:06.950> not<00:04:07.130> sure<00:04:07.430> as<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.790> its<00:04:07.910> purpose<00:04:08.420> but

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
again I'm not sure as to its purpose but

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.900 
again I'm not sure as to its purpose but
if<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:09.530> was<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.770> make<00:04:09.890> an<00:04:10.070> estimation<00:04:10.490> I<00:04:10.760> would

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
if I was to make an estimation I would

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.539 
if I was to make an estimation I would
say<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:13.240> would<00:04:14.240> say<00:04:14.450> it's<00:04:14.660> probably<00:04:15.549> the

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
say I would say it's probably the

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.210 
say I would say it's probably the
stomach<00:04:17.060> for<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.989> digestive<00:04:18.530> system

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
stomach for the digestive system

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.410 
stomach for the digestive system
this<00:04:19.940> is<00:04:20.090> proving<00:04:20.420> quite<00:04:20.570> their<00:04:21.470> mind<00:04:22.420> with

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
this is proving quite their mind with

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.700 
this is proving quite their mind with
enough<00:04:23.660> force<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:24.140> can<00:04:24.290> make<00:04:24.440> anything

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
enough force you can make anything

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.549 
enough force you can make anything
happen<00:04:27.730> okay

00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:31.559 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:36.589 

I'm<00:04:32.099> not<00:04:32.459> quite<00:04:32.729> sure<00:04:32.789> I<00:04:34.099> think<00:04:35.179> the<00:04:36.179> organ<00:04:36.509> on

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
I'm not quite sure I think the organ on

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.200 
I'm not quite sure I think the organ on
the<00:04:36.689> top<00:04:36.959> right<00:04:38.179> it's<00:04:39.179> called

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
the top right it's called

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.050 
the top right it's called
science<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.230> concentrating<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:43.010> I<00:04:43.190> think<00:04:43.910> that

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
science is concentrating it I think that

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.400 
science is concentrating it I think that
Albin<00:04:44.300> in<00:04:44.420> the<00:04:44.510> top<00:04:44.720> line<00:04:44.930> is<00:04:45.080> called<00:04:45.320> the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
Albin in the top line is called the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.299 
Albin in the top line is called the
gavotte<00:04:45.860> rule

00:04:47.299 --> 00:04:47.309 
gavotte rule

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:51.499 
gavotte rule
and<00:04:47.519> appears<00:04:48.509> I<00:04:48.689> just<00:04:49.309> poisoned<00:04:50.309> myself<00:04:50.509> on

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
and appears I just poisoned myself on

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:57.309 
and appears I just poisoned myself on
one<00:04:52.379> of<00:04:52.409> their<00:04:52.679> spikes<00:04:54.739> very<00:04:55.739> peculiar<00:04:56.249> noise

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:57.319 
one of their spikes very peculiar noise

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.099 
one of their spikes very peculiar noise
so<00:04:58.319> if<00:04:58.919> I<00:04:59.039> could<00:04:59.219> just<00:04:59.369> make<00:05:00.179> an<00:05:00.329> incision<00:05:00.689> on

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:01.109 
so if I could just make an incision on

00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:07.639 
so if I could just make an incision on
the<00:05:02.069> left<00:05:02.219> of<00:05:02.879> the<00:05:03.029> Gavit<00:05:03.389> oh<00:05:05.689> I'm<00:05:06.689> not<00:05:06.899> really

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:07.649 
the left of the Gavit oh I'm not really

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:09.229 
the left of the Gavit oh I'm not really
sure<00:05:08.009> this<00:05:08.159> is<00:05:08.339> essential<00:05:08.909> to<00:05:09.119> the

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:09.239 
sure this is essential to the

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:10.819 
sure this is essential to the
replacement<00:05:09.869> of<00:05:09.899> the<00:05:10.019> verge<00:05:10.199> of<00:05:10.349> all<00:05:10.589> necks

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:10.829 
replacement of the verge of all necks

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:14.419 
replacement of the verge of all necks
but<00:05:12.169> I've<00:05:13.169> started<00:05:13.559> now<00:05:13.889> I<00:05:13.919> might<00:05:14.279> as<00:05:14.399> well

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:14.429 
but I've started now I might as well

but I've started now I might as well
finish<00:05:17.059> this<00:05:18.059> is<00:05:18.209> proving<00:05:18.599> extremely

completely unnecessary part of this but
it<00:06:10.070> is<00:06:10.360> extraterrestrial<00:06:11.360> surgery<00:06:11.750> so<00:06:12.080> there

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
it is extraterrestrial surgery so there

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.580 
it is extraterrestrial surgery so there
is<00:06:12.440> always<00:06:12.620> a<00:06:12.740> learning<00:06:13.070> curve<00:06:14.260> my<00:06:15.260> fingers

just fell out of my hands

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.580 
just fell out of my hands
colleges<00:06:23.410> so<00:06:24.410> break<00:06:24.680> this<00:06:24.919> I<00:06:26.500> should<00:06:27.500> have

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
colleges so break this I should have

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.990 
colleges so break this I should have
thrown<00:06:27.830> that<00:06:27.860> away<00:06:27.979> but<00:06:28.340> never<00:06:28.430> mind

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
thrown that away but never mind
