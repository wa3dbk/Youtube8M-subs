00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
if it couldn't handle if I was going too

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.369 
if it couldn't handle if I was going too
fast<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:32.299> actually<00:02:32.569> pushed<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.109> snow<00:02:33.319> and

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379

on<00:02:39.409> me<00:02:39.590> okay<00:02:39.920> what<00:02:40.010> about<00:02:40.189> at<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.310> end<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.519> the

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
on me okay what about at the end of the

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.129 
on me okay what about at the end of the
driveway<00:02:40.849> when<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.239> plow<00:02:41.389> comes<00:02:41.719> through<00:02:41.959> did

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
driveway when the plow comes through did

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
actually broke it up due to these are

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.199 
actually broke it up due to these are
activists<00:02:49.099> kind<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.400> like<00:02:49.489> blades<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.060> just

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
activists kind of like blades and just

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.270 
activists kind of like blades and just
kind<00:02:50.389> of<00:02:50.450> chipped<00:02:50.720> away<00:02:50.840> at<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.409> and<00:02:51.560> serrated

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
kind of chipped away at it and serrated

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.089 
kind of chipped away at it and serrated
off<00:02:52.609> threw<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.209> out<00:02:53.359> nice<00:02:53.900> okay<00:02:54.739> well<00:02:54.980> let's

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
off threw it out nice okay well let's

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.920 
off threw it out nice okay well let's
get<00:02:55.220> into<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.639> design<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.269> guess<00:02:56.510> right<00:02:56.750> off

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
get into the design I guess right off

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.580 
get into the design I guess right off
the<00:02:57.079> bat<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.939> joystick<00:02:59.540> every<00:03:00.200> gamers

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
the bat this the joystick every gamers

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.860 
the bat this the joystick every gamers
delight<00:03:00.859> step<00:03:01.730> behind<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.419> and<00:03:02.540> show<00:03:02.659> me<00:03:02.780> how

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
delight step behind it and show me how

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.569 
delight step behind it and show me how
that<00:03:03.019> thing<00:03:03.169> works<00:03:03.230> yeah<00:03:03.859> so<00:03:04.040> basically<00:03:04.189> it's

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
that thing works yeah so basically it's

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.699 
that thing works yeah so basically it's
it's<00:03:04.969> a<00:03:05.060> locked<00:03:05.329> mechanism<00:03:06.169> until<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:06.469> push

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
it's a locked mechanism until you push

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.399 
it's a locked mechanism until you push
the<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.280> top<00:03:07.489> down<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.000> then<00:03:08.569> it<00:03:08.659> goes<00:03:08.840> up<00:03:09.109> up

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
the the top down and then it goes up up

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.709 
the the top down and then it goes up up
down<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.099> then<00:03:10.639> each<00:03:10.879> direction<00:03:11.120> left<00:03:11.569> and

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
down and then each direction left and

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.479 
down and then each direction left and
right<00:03:11.900> yeah<00:03:12.379> but<00:03:12.560> if<00:03:12.650> you're<00:03:12.769> handling<00:03:13.250> these

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
right yeah but if you're handling these

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
blade it automatically will disengage

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.869 
blade it automatically will disengage
this<00:03:24.859> is<00:03:24.919> what<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.159> does<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.489> has<00:03:25.639> this<00:03:25.760> the

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
this is what it does it has this the

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.159 
this is what it does it has this the
mechanism<00:03:26.329> or<00:03:26.419> if<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:26.599> have<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.810> throttle

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
mechanism or if you have the throttle

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.930 
mechanism or if you have the throttle
down<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:27.680> don't<00:03:27.859> keep<00:03:27.979> the<00:03:28.280> front<00:03:28.639> blades

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
down you don't keep the front blades

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.899 
down you don't keep the front blades
going<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.049> can<00:03:30.079> actually<00:03:30.319> work<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.909> the

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
going so you can actually work the the

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.430 
going so you can actually work the the
joystick<00:03:32.389> and<00:03:32.419> change<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.930> direction<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.319> the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
joystick and change the direction of the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.309 
joystick and change the direction of the
shoe<00:03:33.650> okay<00:03:34.069> I'll<00:03:34.340> see<00:03:34.489> six<00:03:35.120> speeds<00:03:35.419> forward<00:03:35.840> to

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
shoe okay I'll see six speeds forward to

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.449 
shoe okay I'll see six speeds forward to
in<00:03:36.500> reverse<00:03:36.799> yep

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
in reverse yep

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.969 
in reverse yep
throttle<00:03:38.299> where's<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.829> throttles<00:03:39.829> down

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:39.979 
throttle where's that throttles down

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.830 
throttle where's that throttles down
here<00:03:40.189> on<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.370> motor<00:03:40.579> yeah<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.329> you<00:03:41.659> know<00:03:41.750> you

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
here on the motor yeah so you know you

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.420 
here on the motor yeah so you know you
have<00:03:41.930> your<00:03:42.109> turtle<00:03:42.470> in<00:03:42.530> your<00:03:42.620> bunny<00:03:42.799> rabbit<00:03:43.189> so

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
let's figure that one out okay how fast

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.899 
let's figure that one out okay how fast
does<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.530> go<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.709> mean<00:03:45.919> is<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.159> a<00:03:46.189> pretty<00:03:46.699> fast

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
does it go I mean is it a pretty fast

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.270 
does it go I mean is it a pretty fast
machine<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.479> don't<00:03:48.139> know<00:03:48.199> how<00:03:48.319> fast<00:03:48.590> I'd<00:03:48.829> go<00:03:49.009> but

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
machine I don't know how fast I'd go but

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.399 
machine I don't know how fast I'd go but
walking<00:03:49.790> speed<00:03:50.299> I<00:03:50.329> would<00:03:50.569> say<00:03:50.750> probably<00:03:50.989> three

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
walking speed I would say probably three

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.969 
walking speed I would say probably three
it<00:03:51.769> was<00:03:51.919> 3.5<00:03:52.729> oh<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:53.269> just<00:03:53.659> walk<00:03:53.900> behind<00:03:54.680> it

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:54.979 
it was 3.5 oh you just walk behind it

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.289 
it was 3.5 oh you just walk behind it
comfortably<00:03:55.280> behind<00:03:55.549> it<00:03:55.639> all<00:03:55.939> right<00:03:56.060> what

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
comfortably behind it all right what
