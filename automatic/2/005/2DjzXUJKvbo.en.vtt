00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:10.530
 fábio all mister dhabi talking to 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.120
 You again with another video is like 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.240
 we know where he was not expected 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.820
 for xbox 360 the second should be 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.699
 black ops 2 is the deadline then it's over 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.769
 go out and I wanted to bring some show 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.449
 something with some things for you not 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.640
 I'll be able to make all the maps is 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.500
 more than it caught my attention and is 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.969
 this map right here is one of the guys 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.280
 better to the second a transformation 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.399
 that was not done with fighting 2025 on the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.190
 map firewind né this is the name of the map 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.700
 It's called a studio and it's totally the same. 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.890
 thing of the first Firewind 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.410
 black ops on then we go there last 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.719
 quick he smoked very good for me one 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.449
 best maps of the black ops one 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.460
 whether it was the fire and fills and think of 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.170
 many players also decoud and they 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.930
 They brought you back, it's just that now how 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.390
 as I already said it is the same way 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.280
 that was made when you choose 2025 the new 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 version of firefox now with the name 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.909
 studio that she's the first stage in 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.680
 world already knows fifa the first 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.570
 flag in the case of domain chan already with 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.290
 This is not the first 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.750
 at first the firewind black hawk was 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.450
 a jeep right and by then you go in that match 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.770
 here this point here very much say 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.659
 for you to get the snip here 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.270
 mainly in cinema sant only 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.950
 This time they've imported more here. 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.530
 just not for you I think this 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.600
 point is that you find the enemy there and 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.729
 already the building was already tried to climb 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.840
 sometimes here but we can not go 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.229
 following here we follow the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.119
 left that kind of trailer 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.710
 that everything was changed here. 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.130
 in that part you can see that everything 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.890
 well futuristic same business well way 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.700
 is to enter that match I told you 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.380
 trailer and find this mirror here 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.439
 it's a lot of camera point that a lot of people 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.840
 already speak several pieces entry here 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.849
 to catch an enemy here every window 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.110
 custom a or tones the flag ben ali 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.990
 you get 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.970
 it's all the same way and if this point 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.570
 glitch network here that has not changed too 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.550
 You already leave here, you already have 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.740
 this side there that side here has a lot 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.660
 confrontation with this flag of the 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.460
 kind of I 'll be around here I'll do it 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.140
 the way out to get better 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.640
 plus a grid point of the same 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.380
 So you had to snack those 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.630
 two points here right? 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.780
 let's go and in the same way these 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.090
 moving objects in the same way as the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.570
 firewind first that whole house there 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.970
 made of wood in the same way as 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.400
 facing the bottom entrance that 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.260
 hut half of the bottom another the second 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.690
 main point is that this is the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.430
 second team in the case is a serve and 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.100
 another in the trap the way I 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.050
 I said that on that side there is another 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.480
 had you could you could see the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.550
 enemy d'Aquino in the Flemish and already in 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.209
 Studio can not already take it anymore. 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.980
 hence 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.970
 Here commenting within the same 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.580
 way the same scenario it was is for 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.790
 Have you noticed the size is over? 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.160
 space in relation to the first map is the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.989
 paths are larger you can see here is 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.090
 was already in the corner of the 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.470
 wall already a little tight and here you 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.220
 there's plenty of space 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.049
 The size is much bigger, right? 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.010
 passing through that second second 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.049
 point here that it was a jeep to those of the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.209
 time of that time I do not know if there is a future 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.700
 without saying that it is a mixture of funk and 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.330
 future with that half-western era 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.650
 I can not even explain why you came up here. 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.930
 at this point here from the middle of this tower 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.690
 where the peasants like to stay too 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.709
 here already that part here three 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.610
 crates here came the other point of 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.650
 Redbridge too much like I already said 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.630
 part of the direct confrontation is delivered 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.380
 in the same part we will go down here 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.070
 Second flags and I passed here looks 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.769
 on here 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.010
 I juraci parks even then they park 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.280
 of dinosaurs 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.560
 inside is not just one only time the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.260
 head of ours upon receiving space 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.359
 in that game he came in here one more 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.300
 does not take rex soil here within that 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.460
 according to another point that has here broken 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.530
 the glass of your a match and I found it well 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.530
 cool with that part of the background 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.400
 here was nothing was just a certain and 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.380
 already off the map here also off the map 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.550
 more with a much better scenery 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.690
 Coolest of prettiest ones are already much more 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.539
 pretty 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.020
 the inside here that part 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.490
 it is also very basic even of the same 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.139
 The way it was the other did not change much. 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.120
 Not much has changed here. 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.780
 in that game I already saw there the points 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.120
 Hindu sings coming back here and this only 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.449
 You do not feel like a giant here in this 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.080
 scenery here this movie scene well 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.669
 The same way is dividing up in the 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.360
 I said a studio has no part 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.039
 futuristic juraci father who has part of 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:19.560
 similar to pirates of the caribe and here already 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:21.810
 much more movie demonstrates great 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.000
 coming back here our main one that 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.460
 second point that was here that 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.710
 is where you climb up the boxes continues 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.570
 the same way with this one you go up 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.880
 also another glide network point and 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.380
 here you also take the enemy and another 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.960
 thing they took is from here you 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.090
 could get his enemies to go 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.070
 be up there already this world you 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.320
 Can not see them, not only can they 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.160
 even if it's here and very little 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.110
 almost in the low limit in the same way and 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.490
 if you are biting yourself and exploding 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.310
 I also think I had the first 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:57.210
 Throw the team, yes, I do not know if 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.250
 had no relatives in the same way as 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.780
 We started out, guys, I just wanted to 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.520
 wanted to bring all brands like 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.930
 but it was going to be very time consuming and stay 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.090
 too complicated for this map because 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.889
 the map that everyone knows but also 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.840
 because of the videos that showed nobody 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.570
 I had little idea of what would be than 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.419
 I wanted to be this map here of a 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.979
 already shown to you very fast very 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.780
 good very good anyway but not yet 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:24.330
 I had the opportunity to play so I'm going 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.270
 do it now thank you very much guys 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:31.669
 Yours on the channel is a big hug that 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.669
 call in the next video beauty was worth it
