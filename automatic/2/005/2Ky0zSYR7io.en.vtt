00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.800
 How about today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:13.420
 change a gear lever a 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:16.500
 Corsica sedan on 2005 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.540
 good this video I do it because 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.460
 I did not find videos on how to change the 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:26.730
 lever and then I decided to make one and good 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:30.340
 good to start you put the lever 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.820
 normal looks like those of the chevy 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.580
 and well let's start first of all 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.940
 you have to change it 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.890
 Some have tried it with a hacksaw 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.820
 I entered him I understand him with the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.820
 pressure clamps 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.210
 and good and luckily I was already 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.190
 loose then since they removed it what 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.450
 they have to turn strong has no thread 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.270
 you have to throw it out because 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.070
 well no no no thread then it is 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.220
 with pure good pressure 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.080
 as you can see it is separated has the 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.850
 is cooked that is the one that puts the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.570
 dipstick 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.570
 and good 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.880
 if they are not able to take off, it would be 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.360
 everything together in my case is separate and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.760
 good since they have this little yellow thing 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.440
 I also took it out with the tweezers if I did not 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.450
 they want to break because sometimes it breaks 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.250
 for the force that must be occupied then 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.320
 just turn line as I did 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.410
 until obviously this is already loose 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.009
 because then I did it then it's going to 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.600
 to be this this is like the rod this 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.030
 spring is very important to leave it 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.170
 when they leave, no pressure will come out 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.030
 that something that I also had the doubt 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.479
 it's important because it's for the reverse 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.799
 if they do not put well if they do not leave the spring 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.090
 It will take a lot of work to put the 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.200
 reverse 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.469
 good 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.070
 since it has this here is the lever 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.760
 old we do 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.760
 and good 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.709
 in my case I bought a 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.180
 a new lever a good see in shape 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.160
 of skull you can buy the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 design they want does not matter 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.430
 and then most come with two 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.060
 adapters that are like cylinders 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.880
 plastic 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.360
 and good since they have the cylinders of 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:34.190
 plastic choose the one that best fits 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.430
 the lever well like this that is also 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.930
 the biggest one that has 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.670
 and then it is now and now the step that 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.519
 follow as you can see come in the cylinder 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.560
 the spring down do not try to put it 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.959
 much much the cylinder because if the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.900
 They have a hard time getting the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.659
 reverse is very short and you have to do 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.840
 much effort then what can 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.219
 do is leave it a little higher for 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.600
 leave the same space that I had with the 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.820
 previous lever 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.230
 and good in this case this one has 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:12.070
 allen that are the pressure screws 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.070
 what you have is to place it 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.220
 the position you want that depends on 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.220
 your 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.770
 As you can see there is a little more 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.940
 high of the normal with the previous 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.040
 and already have to adjust the screws 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.200
 well I will not do it for the time 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.540
 I have and good as you can see well 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.380
 would finally be left 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.410
 separation 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.360
 if you can see how horrible it looks 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.300
 good is all they can do that 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.710
 You can also cut the rod to 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.800
 that you do not want that ugly space 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.230
 and thus occupy another spring also more I 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.200
 I think I buy another new one or cut out 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.520
 this for the reverse because if they follow it 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.980
 oppressing the same thing that I tell you 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.130
 Reverse will be very short and is very 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.550
 hard 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.440
 then one is everything I hope there is 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.200
 been of help and any doubt the 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.740
 I will answer as soon as possible 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.740
 Thank you
