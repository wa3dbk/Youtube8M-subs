00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.230
 we return in the senate to special report this week 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:12.609
 on the table relations between Spain and Venezuela after those 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.929
 statements of King don Juan Carlos from 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.919
 why do not you shut up guasave accident and also to 4 topic that we would like 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.569
 deal in this program and s 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.279
 five sets and in which venezuela face 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.619
 to December 2 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.339
 has known the opinion of my four guests, until the 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.830
 species cites seems 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.450
 is the first question why 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.350
 center to area of ​​5 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.050
 for that reason it will be to win the battle of dialectical waterloo as it has said fidel 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.450
 Castro in an article made such an impact 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.940
 in that line and she 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.920
 there are interesting constants that to me it seems that 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.290
 that come off state 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.990
 controversial this exchange of words of iniesta culminated 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.790
 It is the first time that the whole world has realized 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.620
 that Chavez is a character 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.000
 while still tolerant 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.790
 p 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.790
 what adda abel aguilar and adrián 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.310
 in a continuous monologue very similar by the way also the castro said 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 that is not a monologue the time flies and solano 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.620
 we are punished every Sunday, entry that is bad or president what 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.470
 Sunday 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.640
 sure but it can also be on any other day in the serna 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.900
 they have done to pray 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.960
 of course you can move but for now looks for now there may be 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.890
 for now but good because we still have 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.600
 some private channels are believed that can change forever 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.000
 this is good one as a journalist has lost one so that the work comprises 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 you have to know that what the president says does not 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.490
 it blew for seven hours 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.290
 one thing was made the distinction to repeat 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.190
 but good is the first thing is or not 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.050
 I think it's that the country that the incident 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.720
 the cable has shown to 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.550
 when the city intolerance and the monologue of disqualifications that 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.930
 always has chávez 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.930
 this not only to your work when a truck 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880
 they also ask that I find it very interesting said 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.859
 it is true that for chávez 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.559
 everyone who thinks differently from him 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.709
 this girl and colpisa 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.599
 had had a program 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.749
 the one that once we come from the same counting we will say it like this 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.540
 as I do to myself there I wanted to try to close an agreement so they qualified 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.309
 suddenly 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.499
 upon learning that television 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:32.700
 it's more when you work you collaborated 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.080
 he did not agree to the work experience hit 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.150
 not so much to add that there is no paradise for the blow to beat him 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.610
 to go out on the street and arriving with the good ones in life is short because 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.499
 we agree that he loves 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.359
 when the only golpista who had decayed in recent times 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.579
 Chávez who rose to February 4 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:52.930
 the Czech race finished 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.239
 despite that tails 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.409
 federation has yet to attempted presented yet recent elect 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.559
 democratically in haiti have a castle 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.579
 what a strong carlos andrés pérez 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.239
 the only goal of javi casares 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.409
 the last decade 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.129
 everything was all but that sortu will be Carlos andrada belongs to him 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.699
 He still has not liked being like other places 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.680
 who speak in Spain last Saturday the rest of Spain 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.949
 president chávez 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.949
 none 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:30.109
 Nancy Clear for last Saturday 40 previous years cow models 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.110
 listen to 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.529
 to discount the general of the republic by making a list attached 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.859
 with this strike it is very easy to agree everyone in the enemy area 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.739
 and now square something 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.680
 we would continue to work, I think we should focus the annual debate 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.970
 problems that a series of social changes is taking place in venezuela 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:48.199
 and politicians 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.739
 the world obviously we have observed that the country is happening in venezuela 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.589
 in Latin America 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.369
 the Venezuelan to also 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:59.769
 produce their own constitutional changes and start from the base of 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.259
 parameters that people like people who do not like people do not like recurs 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.979
 to home 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.009
 berdeja alarms and arguments 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.009
 a little depth to the easy disqualification that if chávez 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.499
 his personal use if he is a golpista that is owed to us in this country 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.260
 We already informed President Chávez, now I have 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.300
 the use of the word the one respected for his saving to respect 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.539
 heath r here there are television shows in this country in venezuela 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.770
 same 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.720
 they do not refer to giving President Chávez as present in how the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.629
 dictator 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.999
 Chávez is a dictator and his 90 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:36.989
 Chávez has won 9 to 10 electoral processes digital + conaculta rapallo 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.010
 Chaves actually made a pronouncement a military coup for the 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.309
 which was judged and sentenced not so 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.849
 those who gave him the April 2002 coup d'etat that is not known any 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.539
 world mythical sentence 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.280
 or not but I have not stolen 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.010
 but I think there is no relationship to the serious problems of pressure to know 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.490
 that is criticized so much 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.479
 and that's where they're going to get over is that of Chavez is very common in the 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.050
 Venezuelans as we are seeing 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.710
 and I say this because of this case with Venezuelan and I'm also fine but 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.940
 for the debates because it is a thing or frankly it seems to me that you can not 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.450
 throw present chávez because i do it if you want to do it and pep and lose 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.669
 the certificates program made this 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.669
 n removed from the electoral process 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:27.639
 on the one hand the electoral processes 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.669
 7 What is certain is that the current constitutional reform and that is what 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:32.699
 important 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.229
 is a constitutional reform that is going to be submitted 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.889
 to all the controls established in the current constitution and subject to 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.419
 referendum so it will be 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.340
 the Venezuelan society the color but that distant the one that decides if that 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.059
 constitution is reformed with us 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.709
 and it's a fallacy and an incredible lie to say this is a reform 

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:53.360
 to perpetuate himself in power that always chávez 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.270
 the constitutional model of art that includes the reform that makes possible 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.819
 that any citizen shows up the times he wanted to tell him time is 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.729
 the same model and yesterday the Spanish constitution of 1900 78 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.139
 and this same model that there are in many other European constitutions among 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.659
 others the one from germany 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:20.039
 the sweden the vitality of belgium the de luxembourg st three decades ago 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.529
 With which 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:25.400
 that constitutional reform is a totalitarian reform what you 

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:28.829
 are saying is that all these countries including Spain we have a 

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:30.710
 totalitarian model and that is not true 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.449
 facebook cool to the governed 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:33.250
 Germany 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.529
 18 years 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:39.419
 felipe gonzález governed in spain 14 years have been shrinking because I 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.220
 I remember lost an election I could not stop to show up 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.720
 if I can not talk about the good another 18 years 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.180
 and here nobody would dream of honor that they have called me today to 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.330
 the aurinegro 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.719
 is what he has done is now the great challenge arséne wenger tarija 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:58.169
 it was the best way to support the cheap sack that come to the race but 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.330
 nor is it proportional to what another window partner in the 

00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:05.349
 raid press have assured that it is not widespread 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:08.939
 and thanks for the invitation but balancing 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:13.909
 I am going to say before referring to the last intention that some things 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:15.969
 from it happened to ee 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.449
 - the mayor of cudillero pravia 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.800
 it has to do with the inclusion to the program 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.960
 p 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.069
 he reiterated President Chávez of Venezuela 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:29.379
 that his attack on the Venezuelan Spanish colony 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:32.270
 they are absolutely from that 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.110
 I suggest the head of state in my country 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.449
 to remove 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:39.129
 those initiatives that you have invented 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:41.199
 to the Spanish colony but also 

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.080
 lebanon 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.879
 that if you want to say to companies 

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:49.459
 the law would protect him the idea of ​​actually being met monthly by his own 

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:50.169
 government 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:52.479
 but that reminds President Chávez 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:55.949
 that has handled the Venezuelan financial system 

00:07:55.949 --> 00:08:00.870
 especially the banking system as a sector our clients and associates of 

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.909
 the capitalist economy 

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:05.520
 the president who proclaims himself socialist 

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.719
 amaral financial system 

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:12.139
 allowing the most gargantuan profit rate in the entire history of the 

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:12.949
 country 

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:15.710
 and we will have to find out why and what is the reason 

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.690
 who saw government
