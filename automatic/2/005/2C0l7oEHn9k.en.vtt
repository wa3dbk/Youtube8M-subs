 I will have my own section here on youtube 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.550
 and I would like to give tutorials to do 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.840
 things I 'm going to teach you to do something 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.500
 basic that every woman has to know 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.640
 perfectly how to do how to manage 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.739
 that situation 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.739
 Video excuse me half trip 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.800
 perfect ar if this is listÃ­simo for 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.610
 start good because today we are going 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.700
 to see how some eggs become like 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.190
 handle some big eggs or 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.800
 little ones the joke is to know how 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.430
 handle them first of all take out your 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.700
 basket of eggs remove eggs from 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.930
 where you have them saved and take it out 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.050
 up here 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.060
 now we have a variety of games 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.430
 Now it's up to your taste if you 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.670
 Eggs like white eggs 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.880
 rositas the black eggs of course 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.789
 that each one has its different flavor 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.979
 but it really looks like they are very 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.539
 similar we also have a question 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.690
 of the size of the eggs ok then 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:38.509
 let's start saving the eggs for 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.000
 see then how big we like what 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.580
 so small so we can choose the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.830
 ideal that we are going to swallow 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.330
 there are some eggs that look like they have 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.120
 stains 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.970
 here we can see they are like small 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.890
 the eggs that does not influence the product 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.500
 of course what matters is what 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.450
 is inside this web site that here 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.790
 the difference of what I was saying there is 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.090
 darker eggs there are more eggs 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.350
 whites which do you like the tan or the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.680
 white 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.609
 today I can be the egg 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.000
 to millions now we have three different 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:24.680
 colors of eggs the bench was pine 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.540
 side and the brunette and what a rich 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.450
 suppose as I am already a little 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.790
 tired and the big eggs are 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.560
 play a little one to turn it off to 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.519
 see how well you have to know 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.049
 how many do not want eggs are average 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:46.159
 two eggs not per person with that remains 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:48.349
 satisfied you are filled yes but if you are a 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.290
 person who is doing very fast 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.510
 because you can eat only about one and take 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.209
 the problems since you have an egg 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.049
 chosen the only thing you have to do is 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.049
 turn on the heater 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.620
 medium fire please do not want fire 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:09.329
 very high because they are going to burn us 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.700
 eggs and a little bit burned the same here 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.120
 comes the hardest of all 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.700
 do not break my balls, you have to break 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.730
 the egg of course he has his 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.580
 grace to break the eggs me from 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.920
 The truth is that I could not not 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.030
 I could no more hold games and 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.459
 eggs and broke them and broke them on the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.010
 I pressed with my hand and he told them 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.980
 a stream of things and they always surround 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:43.349
 to ok not broken already almost almost 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.080
 We break, look, it even slips 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:51.290
 a tear the huevito 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:55.129
 by God I think I already did it and for God 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.319
 and now you have to choose what kind of 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.120
 eggs you like or because there are eggs 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.200
 crashed that is like the one here 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.230
 tonight it's the star and it's ready or 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.349
 the scrambled eggs that basically is 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.129
 make a mother with those eggs 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:15.370
 chairs there are ready and you do not come back is like 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.810
 that is already ready as with tape 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.449
 I really believe that it is proposed to see 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.080
 like a hockey and bringing to prove to 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:30.259
 put the eggs chocolate cream 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:33.099
 whipped cajeta maple ml chair all that 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.750
 kind of things for eggs is 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.840
 incredibly delicious I remind you if 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.349
 they like to give back is dad dad dad 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.070
 dad for we stir them little by little and 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.020
 ready 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.000
 little egg ready remember that it is very 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.849
 important to know how they have their 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.110
 eggs and where do they want their eggs 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.160
 where they want them served on a plate 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.880
 eat them as such 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.940
 as a director is art where they are wanted 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:08.420
 the egg is crouching every time 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:10.760
 which is done again to see how they are 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:15.590
 leaving our delicious egg this 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.790
 perfect state and since it was cooked super 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:25.430
 well we turn off here 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:29.190
 we turn for nothing and ready an egg 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:32.490
 wonderful please observe I have 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:36.210
 much more decisive and what eggs are there 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.940
 what games but rich is that rich I 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.740
 I know but like the raw egg yolks 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.110
 but I like raw eggs 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.390
 The recognized ones take away the 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.670
 juice cited of course name of 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.610
 heat more eggs because they explode 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.130
 that's how the eggs explode and there's no 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.010
 that leave them very cold because it continues 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.410
 you aliens the egg and it reaches its point and 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.960
 then they do not become cool 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.540
 blue eggs then we do not believe that 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.720
