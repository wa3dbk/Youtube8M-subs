snowshoe<00:01:27.380> extenders<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:28.829> would<00:01:29.009> click

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
snowshoe extenders so they would click

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.050 
snowshoe extenders so they would click
into<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.570> bottom<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.049> my<00:01:31.110> outriggers<00:01:32.060> being
