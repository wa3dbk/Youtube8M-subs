the inside of the eye you can see now a
sharpen<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.090> pencil<00:05:10.510> just<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:10.870> make<00:05:11.050> that

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
sharpen the pencil just to make that

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.010 
sharpen the pencil just to make that
brow<00:05:11.880> super<00:05:12.880> fierce<00:05:13.120> and<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.420> feel<00:05:13.660> like<00:05:13.840> that

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
brow super fierce and I feel like that

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.840 
brow super fierce and I feel like that
really<00:05:14.380> finish<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:14.890> off<00:05:15.010> because<00:05:15.580> he<00:05:15.730> always

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
really finish it off because he always

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.080 
really finish it off because he always
makes<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.740> inside<00:05:17.740> corners<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:18.670> the<00:05:18.820> brow

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
makes the inside corners of the brow

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.230 
makes the inside corners of the brow
almost<00:05:19.930> square<00:05:20.500> it<00:05:21.160> doesn't<00:05:21.490> round<00:05:21.850> them<00:05:22.060> off

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
almost square it doesn't round them off

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.660 
almost square it doesn't round them off
so<00:05:22.630> that<00:05:22.660> was<00:05:22.960> pretty<00:05:23.080> tricky<00:05:23.320> this<00:05:24.040> I<00:05:24.250> applied

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
so that was pretty tricky this I applied

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.390 
so that was pretty tricky this I applied
a<00:05:24.700> clear<00:05:25.120> gloss<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:25.900> then<00:05:26.170> I<00:05:26.440> used<00:05:26.950> eyes

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
shadow to create the shade that's in his

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.300

picture<00:05:30.760> yes<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.300> clear<00:05:32.050> gloss<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.680> then<00:05:33.190> I

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
picture yes a clear gloss and then I

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.640 
picture yes a clear gloss and then I
used<00:05:33.640> eyes<00:05:33.970> shadow<00:05:34.480> on<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.870> brush<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:35.500> just
