of<00:02:39.310> different<00:02:39.430> really<00:02:40.090> bright<00:02:40.330> lipsticks<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
of different really bright lipsticks the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.440 
of different really bright lipsticks the
first<00:02:41.980> one<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.520> use<00:02:42.610> on<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:43.120> day-to-day

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
first one that I use on a day-to-day

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.320 
first one that I use on a day-to-day
basis<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.380> this<00:02:44.560> one<00:02:44.830> now<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.610> think<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.120> one

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
basis is this one now I think it's one

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.990 
basis is this one now I think it's one
for<00:02:46.660> sex<00:02:47.080> maybe<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.680> number<00:02:48.070> but<00:02:48.490> it<00:02:48.670> rubbed

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
for sex maybe the number but it rubbed

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.850 
for sex maybe the number but it rubbed
off<00:02:49.180> because<00:02:49.690> i've<00:02:49.810> been<00:02:49.840> using<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.650> much

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
off because i've been using it so much

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.930 
off because i've been using it so much
it's<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.670> later<00:02:52.260> Peng<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:54.310> still<00:02:54.550> gives<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.910> a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
it's a later Peng but still gives you a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.250 
it's a later Peng but still gives you a
little<00:02:55.090> pop<00:02:55.480> just<00:02:55.870> not<00:02:56.110> as<00:02:56.260> much<00:02:56.500> as<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:58.260> one

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
little pop just not as much as this one

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.560 
little pop just not as much as this one
now<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.160> colors<00:03:00.580> do<00:03:00.820> look<00:03:01.000> quite<00:03:01.120> similar<00:03:01.360> but

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
now the colors do look quite similar but

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.410 
now the colors do look quite similar but
this<00:03:01.930> one<00:03:02.200> goes<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:02.650> really<00:03:03.190> bright<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.000> I

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
this one goes on really bright and I

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.680 
this one goes on really bright and I
think<00:03:04.750> that's<00:03:05.170> like<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> 50<00:03:06.160> ear<00:03:06.670> or<00:03:06.940> 50<00:03:07.360> steps

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
think that's like a 50 ear or 50 steps

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.380 
think that's like a 50 ear or 50 steps
color<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.530> because<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:09.520> party<00:03:09.970> time<00:03:10.000> you

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
color and because it's party time you

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.180 
color and because it's party time you
can<00:03:10.570> get<00:03:10.750> away<00:03:10.840> with<00:03:11.350> being<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.800> little<00:03:11.980> more

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
can get away with being a little more

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.000 
can get away with being a little more
bright<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.660> I'm<00:03:13.870> going<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.230> use<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.709> brighter

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
bright so I'm going to use the brighter

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.930 
bright so I'm going to use the brighter
lipstick<00:03:16.860> now<00:03:17.860> because<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.430> one's<00:03:18.730> so

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940
