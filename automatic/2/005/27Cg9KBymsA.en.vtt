 quickly identify yourself via who are you 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.640

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.280
 and point and learn but see and then 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.750
 Adi Maatje drove many careers so that 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 is why i need your bach 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.869

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.729
 dope shit watch them who is one or the other 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.460
 huge part in itself but that 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.610
 then close to the decision they say here 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.619
 but and then that will start dropping somewhat 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.689

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.080
