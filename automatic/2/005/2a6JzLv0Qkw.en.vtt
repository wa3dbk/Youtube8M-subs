00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
it's nice and gentle in one direction

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.910 
it's nice and gentle in one direction
and<00:00:04.760> literally<00:00:05.210> try<00:00:05.930> to<00:00:05.990> keep<00:00:06.229> it<00:00:06.439> so<00:00:06.620> I've<00:00:06.740> got

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:06.920 
and literally try to keep it so I've got

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.950 
and literally try to keep it so I've got
the<00:00:07.040> actual<00:00:07.279> pad<00:00:07.519> flat<00:00:07.790> when<00:00:08.480> I'm<00:00:08.570> doing<00:00:08.840> it

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
the actual pad flat when I'm doing it

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.690 
the actual pad flat when I'm doing it
now<00:00:09.680> so<00:00:09.920> we're<00:00:10.040> not<00:00:10.100> really<00:00:10.280> doing<00:00:10.400> a<00:00:10.490> little

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
now so we're not really doing a little

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.140 
now so we're not really doing a little
area<00:00:10.880> here<00:00:11.150> as<00:00:11.600> in<00:00:11.840> a<00:00:11.870> safe<00:00:12.470> topic<00:00:12.920> and<00:00:13.280> you

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
area here as in a safe topic and you

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.460 
area here as in a safe topic and you
could<00:00:14.330> just<00:00:14.450> do<00:00:14.540> a<00:00:14.570> localized<00:00:14.960> little<00:00:15.230> spot

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
could just do a localized little spot

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.929 
could just do a localized little spot
just<00:00:15.680> for<00:00:15.769> the<00:00:15.950> nature<00:00:16.189> of<00:00:16.219> it<00:00:16.340> you<00:00:16.880> should

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
just for the nature of it you should

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.259 
just for the nature of it you should
think<00:00:17.839> it's<00:00:18.050> better<00:00:18.230> to<00:00:18.380> do<00:00:18.589> it<00:00:18.759> flat<00:00:19.759> area<00:00:20.119> so

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
think it's better to do it flat area so

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.489 
think it's better to do it flat area so
that<00:00:20.300> you<00:00:20.480> can<00:00:20.599> polish<00:00:20.839> it<00:00:20.929> out<00:00:20.960> a<00:00:21.019> larger<00:00:21.380> area

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:21.499 
that you can polish it out a larger area

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:32.380 
that you can polish it out a larger area
so<00:00:24.369> that's<00:00:25.369> up<00:00:25.489> to<00:00:25.579> 4,000<00:00:30.640> that's<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.729> 4,000

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
so that's up to 4,000 that's a 4,000

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.299 
so that's up to 4,000 that's a 4,000
starting<00:00:32.780> with<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.020> finest<00:00:33.980> first<00:00:34.359> yeah<00:00:36.309> now

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
starting with the finest first yeah now

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.279 
starting with the finest first yeah now
what<00:00:37.579> you<00:00:37.670> can<00:00:37.820> officially<00:00:38.480> spend<00:00:39.109> a<00:00:39.140> bit<00:00:39.260> of

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.330 

yeah<00:04:14.840> I<00:04:15.050> mean<00:04:15.140> you<00:04:15.290> know<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.560> wouldn't<00:04:15.950> work<00:04:16.160> on

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
yeah I mean you know I wouldn't work on

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.310 
yeah I mean you know I wouldn't work on
a<00:04:16.370> clear<00:04:16.910> coat<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.120> paint<00:04:17.299> finish<00:04:17.660> with<00:04:18.049> a<00:04:18.080> wet

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
a clear coat of paint finish with a wet

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.170 
a clear coat of paint finish with a wet
Android<00:04:18.620> there's<00:04:18.890> anything<00:04:19.130> less<00:04:19.400> than<00:04:19.610> the

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.030 

2002<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.570> aggressive<00:04:27.020> in<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.170> clear<00:04:27.350> coat<00:04:27.590> I

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
2002 to aggressive in the clear coat I

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.310 
2002 to aggressive in the clear coat I
will<00:04:28.490> do<00:04:28.670> it<00:04:28.760> Rajasthan<00:04:29.330> 1500<00:04:29.930> in<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.080> minute

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
will do it Rajasthan 1500 in a minute

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.140 
will do it Rajasthan 1500 in a minute
that's<00:04:31.130> for<00:04:31.280> different<00:04:31.520> reason<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.880> now<00:04:35.000> we've

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
that's for different reason so now we've

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.850 
that's for different reason so now we've
actually<00:04:35.270> used<00:04:35.420> to<00:04:35.630> take<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:35.870> out<00:04:36.050> mm<00:04:36.680> James

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
actually used to take it out mm James

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.770 
actually used to take it out mm James
was<00:04:37.040> saying<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.430> like<00:04:37.640> the<00:04:37.730> I<00:04:37.790> did<00:04:38.030> will<00:04:38.480> only<00:04:38.630> go

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
was saying I like the I did will only go

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.550 
was saying I like the I did will only go
this<00:04:38.960> way<00:04:39.200> with<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.740> actual<00:04:39.980> 4000<00:04:41.350> and<00:04:42.350> again

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
this way with the actual 4000 and again

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.020 
this way with the actual 4000 and again
the<00:04:42.680> theory<00:04:42.920> being<00:04:43.100> that<00:04:43.220> any<00:04:43.400> particles<00:04:43.940> I've

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
the theory being that any particles I've

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.820 
the theory being that any particles I've
taken<00:04:44.270> off<00:04:44.510> are<00:04:44.780> gonna<00:04:44.870> be<00:04:45.050> in<00:04:45.170> this<00:04:45.290> water<00:04:45.560> and

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
taken off are gonna be in this water and

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.190 
taken off are gonna be in this water and
floating<00:04:46.550> about<00:04:46.850> rather<00:04:47.060> than<00:04:47.210> directly<00:04:48.020> on

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
floating about rather than directly on

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.330 
floating about rather than directly on
the<00:04:48.320> panel<00:04:50.200> sweet<00:04:51.200> Don's<00:04:51.380> right<00:04:51.530> now<00:04:51.860> that

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
the panel sweet Don's right now that

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.160 
the panel sweet Don's right now that
types<00:04:52.610> not<00:04:52.820> walk<00:04:52.970> proof<00:04:53.240> is<00:04:53.420> it<00:04:56.020> that's<00:04:57.020> the

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
types not walk proof is it that's the

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.630 
types not walk proof is it that's the
abrasion<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.650> me<00:04:57.740> hitting<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.250> without<00:04:58.460> pad

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
abrasion of me hitting that without pad

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.190 
abrasion of me hitting that without pad
but<00:04:58.970> it<00:04:59.060> will<00:04:59.150> it<00:04:59.330> would<00:04:59.450> absorb<00:04:59.570> it<00:05:00.640> but<00:05:01.640> the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
but it will it would absorb it but the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.750 
but it will it would absorb it but the
how<00:05:03.200> long<00:05:03.440> should<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:03.740> be<00:05:03.890> it<00:05:04.430> is<00:05:04.550> through

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
how long should you be it is through

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.950 
how long should you be it is through
that<00:05:05.000> kind<00:05:05.090> of<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.240> rule<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:05.570> should<00:05:05.690> be<00:05:05.750> doing

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
that kind of a rule you should be doing

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.020 
that kind of a rule you should be doing
it<00:05:06.050> for<00:05:06.169> say<00:05:06.320> like<00:05:06.350> 30<00:05:06.770> strokes<00:05:07.220> or<00:05:07.640> two

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
it for say like 30 strokes or two

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.790 
it for say like 30 strokes or two
minutes

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
minutes

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.100 
minutes
you<00:05:10.669> could<00:05:10.819> easily<00:05:10.909> there<00:05:11.240> all<00:05:11.389> day<00:05:11.539> you<00:05:12.050> know

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
you could easily there all day you know

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.140 
you could easily there all day you know
fast<00:05:12.409> you'll<00:05:12.650> get<00:05:12.919> used<00:05:13.159> to<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.490> yeah<00:05:13.729> you<00:05:13.909> use

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
fast you'll get used to it yeah you use

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.670 
fast you'll get used to it yeah you use
it<00:05:14.300> as<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.419> go<00:05:14.569> I<00:05:14.599> don't<00:05:14.990> know<00:05:15.289> how

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
it as a go I don't know how

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.110 
it as a go I don't know how
effectiveness<00:05:16.159> it's<00:05:16.280> gonna<00:05:16.370> be<00:05:16.580> probably

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
effectiveness it's gonna be probably

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.059 
effectiveness it's gonna be probably
take<00:05:17.419> me<00:05:17.509> a<00:05:17.569> few<00:05:17.780> panels<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.319> actually<00:05:18.560> get<00:05:18.710> an

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
take me a few panels to actually get an

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.210 
take me a few panels to actually get an
idea<00:05:19.190> of<00:05:19.490> how<00:05:19.729> long<00:05:20.349> also<00:05:21.349> same<00:05:21.740> does<00:05:22.039> anything

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
idea of how long also same does anything

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.790 
idea of how long also same does anything
it'll<00:05:22.669> all<00:05:23.240> vary<00:05:23.599> on<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.840> paint<00:05:24.199> side<00:05:24.440> and

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
it'll all vary on the paint side and

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.119 
it'll all vary on the paint side and
defects<00:05:25.220> you<00:05:25.310> getting<00:05:25.610> out<00:05:25.759> have<00:05:26.030> a<00:05:26.060> stuff

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 
defects you getting out have a stuff

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.409 
defects you getting out have a stuff
that's<00:05:28.129> how's<00:05:28.340> that<00:05:28.460> destroyed<00:05:28.879> any

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
that's how's that destroyed any

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.740 
that's how's that destroyed any
off<00:05:29.569> I<00:05:29.840> can<00:05:30.530> see<00:05:30.560> already<00:05:30.830> look<00:05:31.129> there's<00:05:31.280> some

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
off I can see already look there's some

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.129 
off I can see already look there's some
mm<00:05:32.750> going<00:05:33.050> this<00:05:33.199> way<00:05:33.409> I<00:05:33.650> haven't<00:05:33.949> got<00:05:34.159> out<00:05:35.139> with

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
mm going this way I haven't got out with

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.240 
mm going this way I haven't got out with
the<00:05:36.229> 4001<00:05:36.860> going<00:05:37.099> that<00:05:37.250> way<00:05:37.370> so<00:05:39.039> you<00:05:40.039> can<00:05:40.190> see

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
the 4001 going that way so you can see

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.980 
the 4001 going that way so you can see
everyone's<00:05:40.520> going<00:05:40.729> this<00:05:40.879> way<00:05:41.030> you<00:05:41.629> can<00:05:41.840> still

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
everyone's going this way you can still

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:53.089 
everyone's going this way you can still
see<00:05:42.139> underneath<00:05:42.349> for<00:05:42.650> some<00:05:42.830> going

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.469 

and<00:05:53.520> just<00:05:53.699> to<00:05:53.789> give<00:05:53.909> a<00:05:53.939> guard<00:05:54.150> of<00:05:54.240> what<00:05:54.330> that

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
and just to give a guard of what that

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.909 
and just to give a guard of what that
actually<00:05:54.689> looks<00:05:54.719> like<00:05:54.900> compared<00:05:55.349> with<00:05:55.469> the

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
actually looks like compared with the

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:20.550 
actually looks like compared with the
paint<00:05:56.129> that<00:05:56.249> we<00:05:56.309> started<00:05:56.610> with<00:05:58.759> see<00:05:59.759> how

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.540 

can't<00:06:21.560> really<00:06:21.710> see<00:06:21.860> it<00:06:21.919> really<00:06:22.190> sitting<00:06:22.400> there

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
can't really see it really sitting there

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:32.200 
can't really see it really sitting there
okay<00:06:22.790> that<00:06:23.000> would<00:06:23.090> get<00:06:25.240> finished
