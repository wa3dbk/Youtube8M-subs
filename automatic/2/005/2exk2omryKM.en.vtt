00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.710 
and when it comes to boosting I go a bit
more<00:01:32.070> risky<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> base<00:01:32.939> elections<00:01:33.450> because

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
more risky on the base elections because

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.450 
more risky on the base elections because
i<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.290> i<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.380> use<00:01:34.560> my<00:01:34.680> barbarian<00:01:35.189> king

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
i know that i can use my barbarian king

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.039 
i know that i can use my barbarian king
and<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.729> he<00:01:35.880> will<00:01:36.000> regen<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> faster<00:01:37.020> time

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and that he will regen in a faster time

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.960 
and that he will regen in a faster time
and<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.979> goes<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> same<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.460> when<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> am

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and that goes the same for when I am

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.490 
and that goes the same for when I am
boosting<00:01:39.329> my<00:01:39.450> lightning<00:01:39.810> spells<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
boosting my lightning spells because I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.620 
boosting my lightning spells because I
can<00:01:40.829> use<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> lot<00:01:41.310> more<00:01:41.340> because<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.600> I

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
can use a lot more because I know that I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.810 
can use a lot more because I know that I
have<00:01:42.869> enough<00:01:43.229> elixir<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:44.070> train<00:01:44.310> them<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.610> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
have enough elixir to train them up and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.280 
have enough elixir to train them up and
since<00:01:45.210> they're<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.509> boost<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
since they're on boost I know that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.630 
since they're on boost I know that
they'll<00:01:46.530> finish<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.070> quick<00:01:47.250> amount<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.579> time

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
they'll finish in a quick amount of time

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.730 
they'll finish in a quick amount of time
so<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.750> space<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> pretty

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
so this space right here is a pretty

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.770 
so this space right here is a pretty
easy<00:01:50.009> base<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.549> bartsch<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.210> notice<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
easy base to bartsch you can notice that

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.480 
easy base to bartsch you can notice that
he<00:01:51.990> does<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.380> very<00:01:52.530> centralized<00:01:53.159> wizard

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
he does have very centralized wizard

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
he does have very centralized wizard
towers<00:01:53.850> which<00:01:54.360> aren't<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> attack<00:01:55.110> any

towers which aren't going to attack any

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560 
towers which aren't going to attack any
of<00:01:55.530> my<00:01:55.619> troops<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> outside<00:01:56.670> he<00:01:57.240> also<00:01:57.360> had

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
of my troops on the outside he also had

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.940 
of my troops on the outside he also had
the<00:01:57.659> same<00:01:57.840> thing<00:01:57.869> for<00:01:58.200> his<00:01:58.320> motors<00:01:58.680> two<00:01:58.860> of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the same thing for his motors two of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.709 
the same thing for his motors two of
them<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.250> top<00:01:59.490> are<00:01:59.670> pretty<00:02:00.180> centralized

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
them on the top are pretty centralized

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.120 
them on the top are pretty centralized
not<00:02:01.290> really<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.710> cause<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> problem

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
not really going to cause a problem

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.950 
not really going to cause a problem
though<00:02:02.340> because<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.909> motor<00:02:03.119> coverage<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
though because the motor coverage on the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.139 
though because the motor coverage on the
top<00:02:04.290> don't<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.040> cover<00:02:05.369> all<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.909> way<00:02:06.000> on

top don't really cover all the way on

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.150 
top don't really cover all the way on
the<00:02:06.240> outside<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.259> allows<00:02:07.469> my<00:02:07.680> arches<00:02:07.979> to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
the outside so it allows my arches to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.889 
the outside so it allows my arches to
pick<00:02:08.310> off<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.670> free<00:02:08.879> buildings<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
pick off the free buildings and that of

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.540 
pick off the free buildings and that of
course<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.410> apply<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.160> bottom

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
course they do not apply to the bottom

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.890 
course they do not apply to the bottom
mortar<00:02:11.819> which<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.090> lightning<00:02:12.420> strike<00:02:12.599> at<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
mortar which I lightning strike at the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.700 
mortar which I lightning strike at the
beginning<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.349> this

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
beginning of this

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.010 
beginning of this
before<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.370> learned<00:02:14.910> out<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.270> barbarian<00:02:15.810> King

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
before I learned out the barbarian King

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.870 
before I learned out the barbarian King
so<00:02:16.710> I'm<00:02:16.770> working<00:02:17.040> my<00:02:17.100> way<00:02:17.160> all<00:02:17.520> around<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
so I'm working my way all around the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.760 
so I'm working my way all around the
base<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.210> started<00:02:18.600> on<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> side<00:02:18.960> away<00:02:19.200> from<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
base I started on the side away from the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.740 
base I started on the side away from the
clan<00:02:19.920> castle<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.580> course<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.390> number<00:02:21.600> one

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
clan castle of course the number one

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
clan castle of course the number one
rule<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.410> attack<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.950> side<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> clan

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
rule is to attack the side with the clan

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.670 
rule is to attack the side with the clan
castle<00:02:23.610> last<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:24.930> got<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.170> fifty<00:02:25.380> percent

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
castle last and I got the fifty percent

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.130 
castle last and I got the fifty percent
before<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.430> clan<00:02:26.790> castle<00:02:26.820> even<00:02:27.300> came<00:02:27.480> out<00:02:27.660> so

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
before the clan castle even came out so

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.750 
before the clan castle even came out so
it<00:02:28.230> was<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> pretty<00:02:28.530> easy<00:02:28.920> rate<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.520> I'm<00:02:29.610> going

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it was a pretty easy rate and I'm going

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.520 
it was a pretty easy rate and I'm going
to<00:02:29.790> deploy<00:02:30.120> my<00:02:30.360> arch<00:02:30.540> Queen<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.170> bottom

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
especially up at the higher leagues you

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.090 
especially up at the higher leagues you
saw<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.060> space<00:02:54.360> very<00:02:54.750> familiar<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.560> first

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
saw the space very familiar in the first

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.000 
saw the space very familiar in the first

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
far located compartments you see those

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.960 
far located compartments you see those
four<00:03:01.380> rectangular<00:03:02.040> compartments<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
four rectangular compartments on the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.610 
four rectangular compartments on the
outside<00:03:03.330> which<00:03:03.540> cover<00:03:03.840> around<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.350> top<00:03:04.590> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
outside which cover around the top and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.680 
outside which cover around the top and
also<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> bottom<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.790> this<00:03:05.910> base<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:06.630> the

also the bottom of this base now the
reason<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.050> like<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.410> setup<00:03:07.770> is<00:03:08.040> because<00:03:08.460> it's

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
reason I like this setup is because it's

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.520 
reason I like this setup is because it's
very<00:03:08.730> far<00:03:09.060> away<00:03:09.180> from<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.480> core<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> lot

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
very far away from the core so not a lot

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.290 
very far away from the core so not a lot
of<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.800> core<00:03:11.010> defenses<00:03:11.520> can<00:03:11.670> help<00:03:11.880> out<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
of the core defenses can help out on the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300 
of the core defenses can help out on the
outside<00:03:12.780> makes<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.380> really<00:03:13.620> easy<00:03:13.740> for<00:03:14.070> my

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
outside makes it really easy for my

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.100 
outside makes it really easy for my
archers<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.850> pick<00:03:14.880> off<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.360> buildings<00:03:15.660> inside

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
archers to pick off the buildings inside

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.720 
archers to pick off the buildings inside
those<00:03:16.290> compartments<00:03:16.710> without<00:03:17.490> being

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730

completely destroyed by the core

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.170

and<00:03:21.360> also<00:03:21.990> just<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.410> tip<00:03:22.440> even<00:03:22.980> though<00:03:23.070> someone

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
and also just a tip even though someone

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.700 
and also just a tip even though someone
has<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.670> similar<00:03:24.150> basis<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.080> does<00:03:25.230> not<00:03:25.380> mean

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
has a similar basis on it does not mean

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.080 
has a similar basis on it does not mean
you<00:03:25.740> should<00:03:25.860> barge<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.370> right<00:03:26.550> away<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.850> have

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
you should barge it right away you have

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.820 
you should barge it right away you have
to<00:03:27.210> notice<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.750> building<00:03:28.230> placements

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
to notice the building placements

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.020 
to notice the building placements
especially<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.520> wizard<00:03:29.790> tie<00:03:29.910> replacements

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
especially the wizard tie replacements

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.580 
especially the wizard tie replacements
if<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.690> notice<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.020> wizard<00:03:31.290> tower<00:03:31.410> is

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
if you notice the wizard tower is

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.170 
if you notice the wizard tower is
covering<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.980> lot<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.550> buildings<00:03:32.880> on<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
covering a lot of the buildings on the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.580 
covering a lot of the buildings on the
outside<00:03:33.630> or<00:03:33.870> they're<00:03:34.170> covering<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
outside or they're covering the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.500 
outside or they're covering the
compartments<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.310> really<00:03:35.850> recommend<00:03:36.000> not<00:03:36.450> to

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
compartments I really recommend not to

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.510 
compartments I really recommend not to
attack<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.350> base<00:03:37.590> especially<00:03:37.920> with<00:03:38.190> bartsch

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
attack that base especially with bartsch

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.640 
attack that base especially with bartsch
and<00:03:38.820> also<00:03:39.390> another<00:03:39.630> tip<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.110> conclude<00:03:40.500> this

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
and also another tip to conclude this

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.740 
and also another tip to conclude this
raid<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.400> most<00:03:41.640> percentage<00:03:42.210> will<00:03:42.390> always<00:03:42.630> be

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
raid the most percentage will always be

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.810 
raid the most percentage will always be
at<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.930> bottom<00:03:43.110> or<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.470> sides<00:03:43.830> not<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.610> lot<00:03:44.790> of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
at the bottom or the sides not a lot of

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.250 
at the bottom or the sides not a lot of
people<00:03:45.030> put<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.330> lot<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.540> percentage<00:03:46.020> on<00:03:46.170> the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
people put a lot of percentage on the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.990 
people put a lot of percentage on the
top<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:46.860> that's<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.100> little<00:03:47.310> bit<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.520> a<00:03:47.580> heads<00:03:47.850> up

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
top so that's a little bit of a heads up

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.220 
top so that's a little bit of a heads up
if<00:03:48.030> you're<00:03:48.240> coming<00:03:48.420> down<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.750> those<00:03:48.870> clutch

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
if you're coming down to those clutch

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.260 
if you're coming down to those clutch
situations<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.490> always<00:03:50.730> place<00:03:50.940> down<00:03:51.120> your

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
situations to always place down your

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.380 
situations to always place down your
heroes<00:03:51.630> or<00:03:51.870> your<00:03:52.770> clan<00:03:53.040> castle<00:03:53.250> on<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:54.120> left

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
heroes or your clan castle on the left

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.830 
heroes or your clan castle on the left
or<00:03:54.690> right<00:03:55.080> or<00:03:55.590> bottom<00:03:56.070> of<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.670> base<00:03:56.910> so

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
or right or bottom of that base so

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.510 
or right or bottom of that base so
here's<00:03:58.110> another<00:03:58.320> common<00:03:58.920> base<00:03:59.070> design<00:03:59.370> that

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
here's another common base design that

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.340 
here's another common base design that
you<00:03:59.610> see<00:03:59.790> up<00:03:59.820> at<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.240> higher<00:04:00.450> leagues<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:01.050> lot

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
you see up at the higher leagues a lot

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.780 
you see up at the higher leagues a lot
of<00:04:01.380> people<00:04:01.560> tend<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.070> use<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.670> it's

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
of people tend to use this and it's

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.060 
of people tend to use this and it's
usually<00:04:03.030> seen<00:04:03.600> turned<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.350> its<00:04:04.500> side<00:04:04.770> I<00:04:04.800> think

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
usually seen turned to its side I think

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.890 
usually seen turned to its side I think
it's<00:04:05.400> because<00:04:05.520> a<00:04:05.730> lot<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:05.970> people<00:04:06.150> saw<00:04:06.390> j-rod

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
it's because a lot of people saw j-rod

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.720 
it's because a lot of people saw j-rod
uses<00:04:07.320> space<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:07.830> it's<00:04:07.980> become<00:04:08.220> pretty<00:04:08.250> popular

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
uses space so it's become pretty popular

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.640 
uses space so it's become pretty popular
up<00:04:09.240> at<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.480> higher<00:04:09.690> leagues<00:04:09.990> and<00:04:10.290> it's<00:04:10.590> a

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
up at the higher leagues and it's a

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.320 
up at the higher leagues and it's a
really<00:04:10.890> easy<00:04:10.980> basic<00:04:11.580> at<00:04:11.670> than<00:04:11.790> fifty<00:04:12.000> percent

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
really easy basic at than fifty percent

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.780 
really easy basic at than fifty percent
because<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:13.440> core<00:04:13.650> defenses<00:04:14.190> are<00:04:14.430> really

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
because the core defenses are really

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.820 
because the core defenses are really
separated<00:04:15.360> from<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.780> outside<00:04:16.260> buildings

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
separated from the outside buildings

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.380 
separated from the outside buildings
which<00:04:17.250> makes<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.609> really<00:04:17.670> easy<00:04:17.910> for<00:04:18.150> me<00:04:18.359> to

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
which makes it really easy for me to

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.450 
which makes it really easy for me to
pick<00:04:18.600> off<00:04:18.780> now<00:04:19.260> this<00:04:19.410> base<00:04:19.560> in<00:04:19.799> particular<00:04:20.340> was

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
pick off now this base in particular was

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.790 
pick off now this base in particular was
pretty<00:04:20.760> hard<00:04:21.030> first<00:04:21.630> off<00:04:21.810> because<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.530> heroes

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
pretty hard first off because the heroes

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.970 
pretty hard first off because the heroes
were<00:04:22.919> basically<00:04:23.250> unlevel<00:04:24.030> in<00:04:24.870> some<00:04:25.169> aspects<00:04:25.800> I

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
were basically unlevel in some aspects I

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.510 
were basically unlevel in some aspects I
had<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.220> deploy<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.520> lot<00:04:26.790> of<00:04:26.910> barbary

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
on the bottom and he did have some tests

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.839 
on the bottom and he did have some tests
on<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.830> bottom<00:04:30.099> which<00:04:30.220> were<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.400> pain<00:04:30.699> in<00:04:30.819> the

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849

that's something to keep in mind
especially<00:04:39.220> if<00:04:39.490> you're<00:04:39.580> going<00:04:39.669> to<00:04:39.729> be<00:04:39.849> bar

tomorrow<00:04:59.470> so<00:05:00.310> right<00:05:00.490> here<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:00.909> is<00:05:00.970> coming

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
tomorrow so right here this is coming

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.580 
tomorrow so right here this is coming
down<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.509> a<00:05:01.539> clutch<00:05:01.780> situation<00:05:02.409> it's

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
down to a clutch situation it's

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.290 
down to a clutch situation it's
basically<00:05:02.889> screwed<00:05:03.310> up<00:05:03.430> because<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.970> mortars

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
basically screwed up because the mortars

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.149 
basically screwed up because the mortars
on<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.539> outside<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.169> also<00:05:05.650> I<00:05:05.680> think<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.009> main

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
on the outside and also I think the main

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.800 
on the outside and also I think the main
cause<00:05:06.400> of<00:05:06.430> this<00:05:06.699> was<00:05:06.880> because<00:05:07.030> of<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.389> Tesla's

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
cause of this was because of the Tesla's

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.330 
cause of this was because of the Tesla's
just<00:05:07.990> taking<00:05:08.229> out<00:05:08.319> those<00:05:08.470> troops<00:05:08.860> as<00:05:09.039> quick<00:05:09.220> as

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
just taking out those troops as quick as

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.070 
just taking out those troops as quick as
possible<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:10.270> came<00:05:10.360> down<00:05:10.569> to<00:05:10.720> a<00:05:10.750> clutch

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
possible so it came down to a clutch

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.960 
possible so it came down to a clutch
situation<00:05:11.710> I<00:05:11.800> had<00:05:11.949> all<00:05:12.130> four<00:05:12.370> spells<00:05:12.699> I

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
situation I had all four spells I

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.300 
situation I had all four spells I
lightning<00:05:13.659> strike<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:13.960> altars<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:14.650> also<00:05:15.220> the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
lightning strike the altars and also the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.100 
lightning strike the altars and also the
builder<00:05:15.550> huts<00:05:15.729> and<00:05:15.970> that<00:05:16.419> came<00:05:16.659> away<00:05:16.900> with

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
builder huts and that came away with

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.920 
builder huts and that came away with
around<00:05:17.380> 45<00:05:17.919> to<00:05:18.069> 46<00:05:18.460> percent<00:05:18.969> which<00:05:19.419> just<00:05:19.719> left

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
around 45 to 46 percent which just left

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.140 
around 45 to 46 percent which just left
enough<00:05:20.229> percent<00:05:20.830> for<00:05:21.099> my<00:05:21.280> heroes<00:05:21.639> to<00:05:21.759> clean<00:05:21.969> up

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
enough percent for my heroes to clean up

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.360 
enough percent for my heroes to clean up
so<00:05:22.690> I<00:05:22.719> place<00:05:22.930> down<00:05:23.139> both<00:05:23.409> of<00:05:23.680> my<00:05:23.889> heroes<00:05:24.219> on

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
so I place down both of my heroes on

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.800 
so I place down both of my heroes on
this<00:05:24.490> left-hand<00:05:24.759> side<00:05:25.090> because<00:05:25.419> that's<00:05:25.599> where

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
this left-hand side because that's where

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.439 
this left-hand side because that's where
a<00:05:25.840> lot<00:05:25.900> of<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.199> buildings<00:05:26.379> were<00:05:27.090> also<00:05:28.090> because

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
a lot of the buildings were also because

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.550 
a lot of the buildings were also because
of<00:05:28.569> the<00:05:28.599> Wizards<00:05:28.930> were<00:05:29.020> on<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.199> right-hand

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
of the Wizards were on the right-hand

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.020 
of the Wizards were on the right-hand
side<00:05:29.650> so<00:05:30.340> it's<00:05:30.460> going<00:05:30.580> to<00:05:30.639> take<00:05:30.789> them<00:05:30.909> a<00:05:31.000> while

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
side so it's going to take them a while

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.790 
side so it's going to take them a while
for<00:05:31.389> them<00:05:31.479> to<00:05:31.539> travel<00:05:31.870> on<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.229> left-hand<00:05:32.680> side

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800
