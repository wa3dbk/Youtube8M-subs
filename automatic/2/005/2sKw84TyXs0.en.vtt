00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.130 
is once you're done is this and you can
catch<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.960> neck<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.560> stuff<00:02:10.130> like<00:02:10.310> that

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
catch it in the neck and stuff like that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.650 
catch it in the neck and stuff like that
but<00:02:12.340> that's<00:02:13.340> how<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.580> do<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.270> second

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
but that's how to do it in the second

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.390 
but that's how to do it in the second
one<00:02:14.780> long<00:02:15.440> distance<00:02:15.830> spinner<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.100> don't<00:02:16.280> like

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
one long distance spinner I don't like

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.820 
one long distance spinner I don't like

these three fingers you're gonna have to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.530 
these three fingers you're gonna have to
wrap<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.990> up<00:02:21.410> on<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.640> deck<00:02:22.820> like<00:02:23.030> this

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
wrap it up on the deck like this

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.059

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
grip you're gonna have to try to do it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.690 
grip you're gonna have to try to do it

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
that and this is all done in a quick

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.020 
that and this is all done in a quick
motion<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.260> first<00:02:51.439> time<00:02:51.650> it'll<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.670> it'll

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
motion and the first time it'll do it'll

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.470 
motion and the first time it'll do it'll
kind<00:02:53.389> of<00:02:53.500> just<00:02:54.500> go<00:02:54.650> like<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:54.799> but<00:02:55.480> once

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
kind of just go like that but once

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.119 
kind of just go like that but once
you've<00:02:56.629> gotten<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.959> down<00:02:57.079> what<00:02:57.409> it<00:02:57.530> does<00:02:57.739> is

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
you've gotten it down what it does is

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.369 
you've gotten it down what it does is
this<00:02:58.430> finger<00:02:59.060> holds<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.659> for<00:02:59.689> about<00:03:00.019> split

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
this finger holds it for about split

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.170 
this finger holds it for about split
second<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:00.859> it<00:03:00.950> caused<00:03:01.340> lots<00:03:01.549> of<00:03:01.669> friction

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
second and it caused lots of friction

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.979 
second and it caused lots of friction
and<00:03:02.389> it'll<00:03:03.200> shoot<00:03:04.040> up<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:04.819> you<00:03:05.569> just<00:03:05.689> have<00:03:05.930> to

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
and it'll shoot up so you just have to

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.089 
and it'll shoot up so you just have to
practice<00:03:06.139> an<00:03:06.379> island<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.680> one's<00:03:06.889> a<00:03:06.950> little

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
practice an island that one's a little

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:13.179 
practice an island that one's a little
bit<00:03:07.310> harder<00:03:07.700> than<00:03:09.970> this<00:03:10.970> one<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.530> but<00:03:12.530> that's

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
bit harder than this one so but that's

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:23.059 
bit harder than this one so but that's
draw<00:03:13.489> for<00:03:13.669> the<00:03:13.760> long<00:03:13.939> distance<00:03:14.299> spinner<00:03:14.329> and

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.129 

you
