a battery low whatever it says this is

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.710 
a battery low whatever it says this is
not<00:02:14.310> enough<00:02:14.610> energy<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.330> says<00:02:15.480> twenty

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
not enough energy and it says twenty

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.929

percent<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.110> juice<00:02:16.349> left<00:02:16.549> so<00:02:17.549> that's<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.849> little

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
percent of juice left so that's a little
