00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.920 

I<00:00:05.450> love<00:00:06.450> these

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
I love these

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.460 
I love these
$0.99<00:00:07.740> windmill

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.470 
$0.99 windmill

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.660 
$0.99 windmill
whoa<00:00:09.680> and<00:00:10.420> I<00:00:11.420> was<00:00:12.140> thinking<00:00:12.260> of<00:00:12.560> ways<00:00:12.800> to<00:00:12.830> make

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
whoa and I was thinking of ways to make

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.380 
whoa and I was thinking of ways to make
this<00:00:13.880> better

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.390 
this better

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.690 
this better
they<00:00:14.930> already<00:00:15.290> turned<00:00:15.740> very<00:00:15.890> nicely<00:00:16.190> in<00:00:16.580> the

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
they already turned very nicely in the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.730 
they already turned very nicely in the
wind<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:18.010> so<00:00:19.010> what<00:00:19.490> I<00:00:19.520> did<00:00:19.640> was<00:00:20.029> I<00:00:20.600> added<00:00:21.350> an

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
wind and so what I did was I added an

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.929 
wind and so what I did was I added an
LED<00:00:22.340> and<00:00:22.640> this<00:00:23.420> would<00:00:23.660> be<00:00:23.869> powered<00:00:24.200> by<00:00:24.439> the

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
LED and this would be powered by the

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.600 
LED and this would be powered by the
Qatar<00:00:25.939> windmill

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
Qatar windmill

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.160 
Qatar windmill
so<00:00:30.700> basically<00:00:31.700> when<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.060> window<00:00:32.419> turns<00:00:32.780> the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
so basically when the window turns the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.650 
so basically when the window turns the
LED<00:00:33.650> would<00:00:33.829> come<00:00:34.040> on<00:00:36.820> I'm<00:00:37.820> surprised<00:00:38.329> they

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
LED would come on I'm surprised they

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.930 
LED would come on I'm surprised they
haven't<00:00:40.000> mixed<00:00:41.000> something<00:00:41.420> like<00:00:41.660> this

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
haven't mixed something like this

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.110 
haven't mixed something like this
something<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:43.970> doesn't<00:00:44.870> need<00:00:45.020> a<00:00:45.050> battery<00:00:47.230> is

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
something that doesn't need a battery is

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.760 
something that doesn't need a battery is
very<00:00:50.120> simple<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:50.870> make<00:00:53.350> basically<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:54.620> have

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
very simple to make basically you have

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.540 
very simple to make basically you have
to<00:00:54.950> whine<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.220> coil<00:00:56.110> about<00:00:57.110> a<00:00:57.590> thousand<00:00:58.220> turns

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
to whine a coil about a thousand turns

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:07.210 
to whine a coil about a thousand turns
and<00:01:02.530> let<00:01:03.530> me<00:01:03.650> take<00:01:03.890> this<00:01:04.070> apart<00:01:05.950> plastic<00:01:06.950> pot

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
and let me take this apart plastic pot

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.179 
and let me take this apart plastic pot
where<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:07.909> can<00:01:08.229> what<00:01:09.229> I<00:01:09.259> did<00:01:09.470> I<00:01:09.500> just<00:01:09.590> put<00:01:10.040> in

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
where you can what I did I just put in

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.340 
where you can what I did I just put in
hot<00:01:10.400> glue<00:01:10.729> if<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.420> want<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:11.689> make<00:01:11.780> it<00:01:11.930> more

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
hot glue if you want to make it more

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.660 
hot glue if you want to make it more
permanent<00:01:12.619> of<00:01:12.979> course<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.400> have<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.640> use

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
permanent of course you have to use

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.840 
permanent of course you have to use
epoxy<00:01:14.360> like<00:01:15.670> lucidi

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
epoxy like lucidi

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.410 
epoxy like lucidi
there<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.110> glue<00:01:18.470> some<00:01:19.250> magnets<00:01:19.700> neodymium

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
there and I glue some magnets neodymium

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.410 
there and I glue some magnets neodymium
methods<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:22.330> this<00:01:23.330> part<00:01:24.370> will<00:01:25.370> fit<00:01:25.729> into<00:01:26.000> the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
methods and this part will fit into the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.360 
methods and this part will fit into the
spindle<00:01:26.750> here<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.880> construction<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:33.370> this

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
spindle here the construction of this

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.200 
spindle here the construction of this
part<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:35.090> just<00:01:35.810> put<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:38.180> coil<00:01:38.479> on<00:01:38.990> one<00:01:39.890> side

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
part is I just put the coil on one side

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:48.820 
part is I just put the coil on one side
of<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:43.030> CD<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.979> I<00:01:45.979> use<00:01:46.520> two<00:01:47.120> CD<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.260> just

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
of the CD and I use two CD so I just

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.660 
of the CD and I use two CD so I just
sandwich<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:50.090> coil<00:01:50.390> inside<00:01:51.080> and<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:52.400> just

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
sandwich the coil inside and I just

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.560 
sandwich the coil inside and I just
temporarily<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:53.780> just<00:01:54.110> use<00:01:54.380> tapes<00:01:55.310> got<00:01:55.700> scotch

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
temporarily I just use tapes got scotch

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.350 
temporarily I just use tapes got scotch
tape<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.110> just<00:01:57.140> tape<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.799> together<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.430> you

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
tape and just tape it together and you

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.510 
tape and just tape it together and you
would<00:01:59.510> have<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.690> service<00:02:00.200> where<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:01.070> know<00:02:01.190> your

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
would have a service where you know your

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.580 
would have a service where you know your
magnets<00:02:03.190> can<00:02:04.190> rotate<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:05.000> get<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:05.600> close<00:02:06.110> to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
magnets can rotate and get as close to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.949 
magnets can rotate and get as close to
the<00:02:06.710> coil<00:02:06.979> as<00:02:07.250> possible<00:02:07.939> this<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:08.569> is<00:02:08.750> less

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
the coil as possible this this is less

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.259 
the coil as possible this this is less
than<00:02:09.229> 1/16<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.979> an<00:02:10.159> inch<00:02:10.340> brighter

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
than 1/16 of an inch brighter

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.199 
than 1/16 of an inch brighter
you<00:02:11.629> can<00:02:11.780> put<00:02:12.200> another<00:02:12.470> coil<00:02:12.830> there<00:02:13.159> so<00:02:14.000> you

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
you can put another coil there so you

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.360 
you can put another coil there so you
can<00:02:14.420> have<00:02:14.540> two<00:02:14.720> coils<00:02:14.989> you<00:02:15.409> can<00:02:15.530> put<00:02:16.189> them<00:02:16.340> in

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
can have two coils you can put them in

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.520 
can have two coils you can put them in
parallel<00:02:17.090> or<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.420> can<00:02:17.569> put<00:02:17.720> them<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:17.990> series

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
parallel or you can put them in series

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.960 
parallel or you can put them in series
and<00:02:19.000> your<00:02:20.000> LED<00:02:20.540> would<00:02:20.780> be<00:02:20.930> brighter<00:02:21.819> since<00:02:22.819> I'm

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
and your LED would be brighter since I'm

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.940 
and your LED would be brighter since I'm
just<00:02:23.000> used

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
just used

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.110 
just used
once<00:02:24.370> more<00:02:25.860> red<00:02:26.860> LED<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.340> think<00:02:27.700> they're<00:02:27.879> about

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
once more red LED I think they're about

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.300 
once more red LED I think they're about
two<00:02:28.900> volts<00:02:29.670> 1.8<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:31.000> 2<00:02:31.299> volts<00:02:31.780> or<00:02:32.680> maybe<00:02:33.220> a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
two volts 1.8 to 2 volts or maybe a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.550 
two volts 1.8 to 2 volts or maybe a
little<00:02:33.610> higher<00:02:33.760> if<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.989> wanted<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:36.150> light

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
little higher if you wanted to light

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.920 
little higher if you wanted to light
better<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.190> use<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.700> green<00:02:40.090> LEDs<00:02:40.659> I

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
better you can use the green LEDs I

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.100 
better you can use the green LEDs I
think<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.290> voltage<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.489> forward<00:02:42.900> fold<00:02:43.900> is

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
think the voltage the forward fold is

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.180 
think the voltage the forward fold is
just<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.379> little<00:02:44.620> lower<00:02:45.989> like<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:50.190> there's

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
just a little lower like so and there's

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:00.809 
just a little lower like so and there's
a<00:02:51.280> retaining<00:02:54.000> clip<00:02:55.000> here<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:59.430> that's<00:03:00.430> it

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
a retaining clip here and that's it

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.890 
a retaining clip here and that's it
you<00:03:01.420> press<00:03:01.690> it<00:03:01.720> back<00:03:02.049> in<00:03:02.319> as<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.900> magnets

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
you press it back in as the magnets

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.680 
you press it back in as the magnets
rotate<00:03:05.410> over<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.890> coil<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.660> generate<00:03:07.660> a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
rotate over the coil you generate a

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.119 
rotate over the coil you generate a
small<00:03:08.019> amount<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.590> electricity<00:03:10.920> which<00:03:11.920> is

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
small amount of electricity which is

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.479 
small amount of electricity which is
enough<00:03:12.519> to<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.890> light<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.340> LED<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:18.310> don't

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
enough to to light the LED and you don't

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.640 
enough to to light the LED and you don't
have<00:03:18.579> to<00:03:18.700> worry<00:03:18.940> about<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.440> polarity<00:03:20.440> because

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
have to worry about the polarity because

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.379 
have to worry about the polarity because
this<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.159> AC<00:03:24.450> probably<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:26.790> think<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.180> probably

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
this is AC probably I think it probably

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:37.620 
this is AC probably I think it probably
generated<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.200> two<00:03:29.440> volts<00:03:29.829> or<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:37.299> it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
generated the two volts or so so it

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.599 
generated the two volts or so so it
doesn't<00:03:38.019> really<00:03:38.200> require<00:03:38.859> a<00:03:39.160> lot<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:39.609> RPM<00:03:40.540> to

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
doesn't really require a lot of RPM to

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:49.930 
doesn't really require a lot of RPM to
to<00:03:42.609> light<00:03:42.819> up<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.239> small<00:03:43.419> LED

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.510 

I<00:03:51.730> have<00:03:52.730> three<00:03:53.120> here<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:54.140> have<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.470> make<00:03:55.340> sure

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
I have three here you have to make sure

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.980 
I have three here you have to make sure
the<00:03:55.670> polarity<00:03:56.360> is<00:03:56.540> opposite<00:03:57.410> of<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:59.120> when

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
the polarity is opposite of this so when

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.620 
the polarity is opposite of this so when
you<00:04:00.110> put<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.290> magnet<00:04:00.740> against<00:04:01.730> this<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.150> repels

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
you put a magnet against this it repels

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.430 
you put a magnet against this it repels
so<00:04:03.110> this<00:04:03.320> is<00:04:04.330> this<00:04:05.330> is<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.750> side<00:04:05.990> that<00:04:06.020> you

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
so this is this is the side that you

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.990 
so this is this is the side that you
want<00:04:07.000> facing<00:04:08.000> down<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:11.500> about<00:04:12.500> midway

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
want facing down and about midway

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.280 
want facing down and about midway
between<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:16.670> center<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.420> the<00:04:17.540> edge<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.170> the

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
between the center and the edge of the

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.020 
between the center and the edge of the
CD<00:04:19.000> because<00:04:20.170> this<00:04:21.170> is<00:04:21.380> how<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.680> coil<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.610> in

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
CD because this is how the coil is in

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.750 
CD because this is how the coil is in
the<00:04:23.240> Centers<00:04:23.690> here<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:24.260> want<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.650> center<00:04:25.520> of

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
the Centers here you want the center of

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.030 
the Centers here you want the center of
the<00:04:26.030> magnet<00:04:26.450> to<00:04:26.480> pass<00:04:26.840> over<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.380> center<00:04:27.770> of

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
the magnet to pass over the center of

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:36.490 
the magnet to pass over the center of
the<00:04:28.220> coil<00:04:29.180> there<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.870> now<00:04:33.200> I<00:04:33.500> have<00:04:33.950> two<00:04:35.500> CDs

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
the coil there so now I have two CDs

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.290 
the coil there so now I have two CDs
here<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.100> I<00:04:37.220> send<00:04:37.580> which<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.870> coil<00:04:39.680> in

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
here and I send which the coil in

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.810 
here and I send which the coil in
between<00:04:41.300> it<00:04:41.600> has<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:42.070> 1,000<00:04:43.070> turn<00:04:43.310> I<00:04:43.640> think

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
between it has a 1,000 turn I think

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.960 
between it has a 1,000 turn I think
these<00:04:43.940> are<00:04:44.000> 32<00:04:44.720> gauge<00:04:44.990> wires<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:46.690> I<00:04:48.730> strip<00:04:49.730> and

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
these are 32 gauge wires and I strip and

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.250 
these are 32 gauge wires and I strip and
clean<00:04:50.270> both<00:04:50.600> ends<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.470> enamel<00:04:51.950> wire<00:04:53.260> so

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
clean both ends of the enamel wire so

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:07.800 
clean both ends of the enamel wire so
that<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:55.850> will<00:04:56.919> make<00:04:57.919> good<00:04:58.130> contact

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.870
