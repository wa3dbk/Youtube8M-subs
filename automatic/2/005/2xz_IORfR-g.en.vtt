00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.260
 to the half 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.790

 with an ease 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.920
 to be able to later 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.430
 and this we are going to put to the fire and we are going 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.880
 to be aware that we do not miss 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.880
 cooking 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.450
 and then we will continue with the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.450
 following explanation 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.069
 the writer the meat the shell takes 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.640
 then to proceed to get him a little 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.640
 of meat 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.890
 centralist the meat the shell then 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.970
 and then then 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.100
 we started 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.590
 not massify the fork well so that 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:06.510
 the meat may be well separated 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.510
 the fund we press 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.050
 we can review to make it 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.050
 well separated 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.540

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.949
