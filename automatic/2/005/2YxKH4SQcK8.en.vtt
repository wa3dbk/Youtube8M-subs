00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.580
 Hello, welcome to a new video 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.080
 of teacher will remember our 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.330
 website we have thousands of exercises 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.730
 to try and get very good grades in 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.980
 physical math and there you have the 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.570
 button and I like it and today we are going to do 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.700
 an exercise that is a classic vale 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.160
 interesting to tackle the ax pilla with 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.240
 a couple of concepts of this exercise 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.060
 well first of all you have to read it 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.270
 is to calculate the mass of the sun knowing that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.110
 the distance from the earth to the sun is 1 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.239
 496 by 10 to 11 meters give us data 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.500
 from the earth the earth the earth and the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.530
 gravity then let's do the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.050
 drawing that we have in the sun what 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.449
 you see we do not have here the earth without 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.590
 no lowercase t orbiting around 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.210
 of the sun 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.580
 then an important thing I give 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.290
 very many in the sheets is the mass 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.820
 capital letter in the tiny mass now the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.489
 tiny mass in the mass of the earth 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.699
 weighs very large the tiny mass and the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.400
 Mass capital is the mass of the sun well 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.680
 that we know is orbiting the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.320
 earth around the sun then that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.780
 we know we know the period is worth 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.659
 remember that the period is the time 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.610
 it takes a turn before the then 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.280
 the time it takes the earth to give a 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.490
 back to the sun is a year true then 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.010
 we have the time is a year the period 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.049
 it is a year but the period in which it is measured 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.280
 the period is measured in seconds then 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.289
 we have to do a factor of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.770
 conversion because you do not come that in case 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.000
 the year is leap year 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.240
 to transform years pass in seconds 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.640
 then we have a year 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.680
 365 days are worth it for now we make a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.979
 day if we remember conversion factor 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.580
 They include 24 hour days and days they leave me 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.240
 drugs in the boom year after year if a 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 3600 seconds 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.490
 ok and we take the calculator and me that 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.070
 gave me 31 million a few positives of 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.240
 seconds 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.479
 557 thousand 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.670
 600 seconds 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.599
 that would be the period that is to say is the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.000
 time it takes to give the earth a 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.400
 full turn around the sun that is 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.900
 a year but you have to pass it to seconds 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.640
 ok then we have the period 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.040
 then let's go to the formulas of 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.910
 period we know that it's the same 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.720
 a 2 pig si x r 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.700
 match this formula we show it 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.070
 previously we can also 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.230
 learn by heart and then we have 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.640
 two pi on the radio the radio what 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.960
 we know and the radio we know because 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.790
 the distance from the sun if to the earth but 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.310
 we do not know the speed of orbit is worth 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.380
 we can calculate it yes but it is not 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.670
 necessary because it is not necessary because 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.980
 we know that the speed of 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.870
 orbit if how much is the speed of 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.460
 orbit because I do not remember how much the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.560
 orbit speed we remember the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.960
 formula a luxury that I forget or what 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.620
 we do the show we know that here 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.750
 there is a gravitational force yes truth the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.840
 gravitational force equals mass 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.280
 by speed squared match was 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.950
 then g per m per m split the real 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.170
 square equals am by 1 squared 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.120
 radio party this mass with this mass is 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.040
 we are going this radio with this radio 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.300
 goes and we get that the speed of 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.420
 orbit is equal to square root 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.980
 puts uppercase letter m lowercase 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.350
 worth or discount what I want to say 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.110
 with which to marry well the demonstration is 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.590
 we put it in there then it implies that 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.690
 the period is equal to 2 pi by the radius 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.470
 if the match at orbit speed that 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.450
 square root of g per m match makes 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.070
 ok but we do not like it in 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.170
 true the square roots then what 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.190
 we are going to do the lifting 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.190
 all to the channel 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.110
 square root of gm match r all 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.860
 this with this move and we already get 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:10.480
 that squared equals 4 and the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.650
 square put square gm match 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.290
 match 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.120
 we would make the rule of the ear is already 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.970
 go over and up multiplying it and then 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.489
 I would stay and it is real and I will 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.259
 touch up yes for not giving us much more 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.270
 the sheet for demonstration and now 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.979
 we would have the demonstration that only 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.210
 they have that this is a r of my beings 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.920
 they are special 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.840
 and we have the period is good 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.000
 so now we ask ourselves in this 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.880
 formula that we know let's cut the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.500
 period without calculating value when we have 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.550
 on 2 we also know the 4 also 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.010
 we know the square foot too 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.560
 we know the radius of orbits and we the 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.030
 diada is a fact of the problem we know 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.430
 yes because it is the universal constant 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.800
 so let's calculate the m 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.950
 capital letter lm who comes in 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.570
 house is the mass of the sun in this case what 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.610
 we had said at the beginning because 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.500
 we clear the uppercase m remember 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.160
 whenever the unknown is here 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:09.150
 below if this is changed to another 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:12.650
 here then the m will be equal to 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:16.170
 4 and squared by the radius to the cube 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.890
 party g for the period squared is 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:24.840
 say m equals 4 and squared 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:27.550
 by the radius which is 1.4 96 by 10 to 11 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.330
 raised to the cube 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.180
 667 party most beautiful numbers 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.920
 by 10 at least 11 for the period to 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.220
 square that the period we said it was 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:46.300
 which is going to break the calculator 31 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:49.000
 million 557 thousand 600 seconds raised to 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.130
 what is it worth and how much does that give me? 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.780
 delete the playlist here and 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.970
 we take the calculator you have to have 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.960
 very in tune the calculator and control 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.430
 maquis very easy and make mistakes in 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.020
 this kind of exercises and it gives me 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.750
 approximately 2 x 10 raised to 30 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.580
 kilograms is worth and I'm going to put a very 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.680
 well to find me now all in the 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.129
 wikipedia 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.729
 what is the mass of the sun to see yes 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:20.159
 we have calculated it well worth something else 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:21.899
 very important to tell me down there how 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.149
 is the subject if the form is going well 

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:25.649
 and above all give account one thing I will 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:27.959
 given the radius the earth the mass the 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:30.899
 land and we have not used it at all 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:33.989
 you have to get used to the data 

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:36.300
 that I call ghosts data that they give us 

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:38.759
 and they are to make us doubt in the 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.239
 exams but we do not use them at all 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:44.909
 you have to be very confident in an exam 

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:47.490
 to say this is not worth anything 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:50.029
 and eliminate it come see you in the 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.029
 next video
