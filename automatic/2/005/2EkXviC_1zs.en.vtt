look at serving with it I found that yes

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.899 
look at serving with it I found that yes
you<00:01:34.470> could<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.950> very<00:01:34.979> accurate<00:01:35.400> with<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.700> but

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you could be very accurate with it but

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.249 
you could be very accurate with it but
when<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.150> tried<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.689> put<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> heater<00:01:37.049> on

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
when you really tried to put a heater on

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.319 
when you really tried to put a heater on
it<00:01:37.409> unless<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.400> hit<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.640> very<00:01:38.670> flat<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
it unless you hit it very flat and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.330 
it unless you hit it very flat and
really<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> racket<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> work<00:01:41.009> for

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
really get the racket do the work for

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.280 
really get the racket do the work for
you<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.299> was<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> little<00:01:42.750> bit<00:01:43.020> difficult

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you then it was a little bit difficult

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.109 
you then it was a little bit difficult
to<00:01:43.530> generate<00:01:43.979> huge<00:01:44.159> amounts<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.610> pace<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:45.000> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
to generate huge amounts of pace with it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.450 
to generate huge amounts of pace with it
but<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> very<00:01:45.899> consistent<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.680> various<00:01:47.130> spin

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
but a very consistent and various spin

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.630 
but a very consistent and various spin
friendly<00:01:48.259> groundstrokes<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.500> enjoyed<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.130> think

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
friendly groundstrokes I enjoyed I think

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.690 
friendly groundstrokes I enjoyed I think
again<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.240> lot<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> spin<00:01:52.020> off<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.320> racket<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.189> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
again a lot of spin off the racket and I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.280 
again a lot of spin off the racket and I
really<00:01:53.970> wanted<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> hit<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> flat<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.869> did<00:01:55.140> have

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
really wanted to hit it flat I did have

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.289 
really wanted to hit it flat I did have
to<00:01:55.439> really<00:01:55.740> flatten<00:01:55.950> my<00:01:56.280> stroke<00:01:56.549> out<00:01:56.759> much

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
to really flatten my stroke out much

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.569 
to really flatten my stroke out much
more<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.689> than<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.200> another<00:01:58.500> racket

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
more so than I do another racket

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.340 
more so than I do another racket
think<00:02:00.240> that's<00:02:00.420> something<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.869> G<00:02:00.990> onyx<00:02:01.229> are

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
think that's something with G onyx are

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.929 
think that's something with G onyx are
very<00:02:01.500> good<00:02:01.649> at<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.890> producing<00:02:02.340> very<00:02:02.579> spin<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
very good at is producing very spin and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.130 
very good at is producing very spin and
friendly<00:02:03.210> rackets<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.780> one's<00:02:03.990> no

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
friendly rackets and this one's no

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560 
friendly rackets and this one's no
different<00:02:04.250> I<00:02:05.250> did<00:02:05.670> prefer<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.090> feel<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.299> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
different I did prefer the feel of the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.809 
different I did prefer the feel of the
89<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.380> felt<00:02:07.560> more<00:02:07.740> solid<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.700> is

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
89 it felt more solid but this is

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.750 
89 it felt more solid but this is
definitely<00:02:09.270> more<00:02:09.420> forgiving<00:02:09.869> than<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.080> 89

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
definitely more forgiving than the 89

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.980 
definitely more forgiving than the 89
overall

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
overall

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.720 
overall

racket you're looking to create let's

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.420 
racket you're looking to create let's
spin<00:02:20.840> get<00:02:21.290> some<00:02:21.410> power<00:02:21.620> over<00:02:21.830> quite<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.160> thin

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
spin get some power over quite a thin

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.950 
spin get some power over quite a thin
frame<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:23.150> he's<00:02:23.270> still<00:02:23.420> keeping<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.780> set

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
frame so he's still keeping the set

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.450 
frame so he's still keeping the set
there's<00:02:24.140> some<00:02:24.500> good<00:02:24.680> control<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.370> is

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
there's some good control this is

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.530
