00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.330
 unfortunately yes little time 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.740
 after the announcement of the thriller of the house 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.150
 wolves who all wrapped us up I 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.880
 you admit myself I was super show 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.920

 day we released the trailer of

 the house of the wolves I hope you 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.570
 have enjoyed we have several 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.800
 details to provide you throughout the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.000
 month we will reveal exactly what 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.940
 that you will find in the house of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.440
 louhans but as you have been able to 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.920
 account to the various in our 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.770
 various small news we have there we have 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.570
 planned to ask you to post yourself from 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.860
 the most important details about 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.409
 bungie.net this is I am doing you 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.420
 of approximate brief thing 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.820
 who went around and who packs 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.280
 the web right now the house of the wolves 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.259
 will not have raiding activities 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.880
 here you have of course there will be 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.439
 no raid in the house of the wolves 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.040
 we did not make that decision at 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.770
 the slight 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.869
 our team was informed of all the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.369
 receptions end all returns from 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.810
 players about raids whose 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.020
 destiny we decided to create a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.979
 new raid that will be available more 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.600
 late in the year 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.400
 so they do not say there is no 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.710
 raid but it will be available later 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.600
 so I think it must be deduced that 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.189
 they had feedbacks like what the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.259
 rules were too simple or buggy or 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.759
 what you want feasible solo from 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.680
 blow they decided maybe from everything 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.140
 resume from scratch and review everything 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.030
 short for the moment we'll say it's 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.799
 a semi good news that's just 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.049
 four months it will be five months in months 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.020
 of May we will do cropped in the end it 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.450
 there will be no raid against the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.000
 wolf house will have 2 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.979
 2 a new endgame cooperative mode 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.930
 so the endgame is at activity level 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.819
 based on the variety the replayability and 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.069
 ski good ski have it destiny 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.239
 in short, a new battle arena 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.099
 called the veterans prison this is in 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.330
 below you will find the information 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.489
 of the calendar for the house of the wolves 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.650
 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.360
 announces two new events for 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.980
 this add-on which will be the test 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.760
 osiris a video that I had you 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.680
 makes no day a little 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.180
 notification that will have come on if 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.250
 never have you any information and 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.900
 the prison of veterans who will be 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.269
 new activities so then they 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.530
 we put a schedule on April 22 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.709
 as you can see already we see a 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.750
 Grim Reaper wrote 300,365 they 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.290
 will then do I think it's just that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.489
 stream 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.400
 I do not know I can not tell you 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.840
 I have a person who told me sure sure 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.250
 sure my personal stream that told me 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.180
 that it actually helps it estrie but actually 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.940
 they're going they're going to stream us and these 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.069
 events a little tour on the reef 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.170
 with a live 10 q discussions of the coup 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.480
 a discussion about them the brave 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.590
 Wholesale weapons design your 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.459
 equipment including weapons and 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.599
 equipment as you can see a 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.609
 photo with the grim reaper who passes 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.739
 of 300 365 so that seems to be a 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.709
 very very good news 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.359
 April 29th they will show some gameplay 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.120
 light gameplay the revelation and the 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.010
 gameplay of the osiris test so 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.019
 here and his collection of and game gear 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.489
 so the end of the game equipment so I 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.010
 think the milk proof of realism 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.709
 will pass a higher level 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.470
 May 6th of the blow of the blow with the small photo 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.380
 which interests us a live on the prison 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.569
 veterans here's kunar was able to reda 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.549
 six players but we have ra this activity 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.859
 which will be 3 hours three players 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.030
 cooperative so these are the people for the 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.799
 house of wolves there will be more 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.540
 of six-player activities so your 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.069
 customers your friends company 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.780
 it falls a little bit in the water it will take 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.970
 see what it gives me I think to do 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.989
 a little horde fashion like gears of war 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.310
 we face waves of enemies 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.079
 maybe I do not know I'm saying a 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.190
 stupidity yesterday at 50 wave of the top ten 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.530
 if we end up wandering 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.660
 I can win a weapon if we come 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.639
 to finish the wines wave we win a 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.739
 equipment a glove a thing i know 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.750

 stay tuned he gives us us they 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.670

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.319
 information the uimm and thank you for your 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.569
 time and your attention and thank you for

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.050
 comments what you have 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.830
 thought 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.739
 if you find it's a good 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.489
 new or not if we redo all the 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.019
 rest is rather good news 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.390
 but for once it's still a 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.810
 big cold shower of not having 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.970
 raiding 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.890
 at the release of the dlc they make us 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.850
 really wait and concretely they 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.710
 do not have interest to us out a dlc 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.210
 sloppy and we go out a raid 6 months 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.950
 later completely bugged otherwise I 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.650
 you even tell me I think I 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.840
 would put an end to destiny because there 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.480
 too much is too much and I confess that it 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.320
 is struggling to spend short do not hesitate to 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.660
 tell me what you think 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.160
 pity too if you did not like 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.380
 this news is not worth it to me 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.800
 put a dislike me it's not my 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.630
 fault 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.400
 so that's short I make you plenty of 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.900
 big kisses do not hesitate to like 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.430

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.540
