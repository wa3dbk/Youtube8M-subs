project<00:00:06.270> with<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.540> 2.7<00:00:07.230> liter<00:00:07.259> v6<00:00:07.890> engine<00:00:08.090> so

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
project with the 2.7 liter v6 engine so

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.129 
project with the 2.7 liter v6 engine so
you<00:00:09.179> may<00:00:09.360> recall<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:10.469> was<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> donor<00:00:11.610> motor

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
you may recall this was a donor motor

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.300 
you may recall this was a donor motor

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.040 
2.7 liter out of a 99 intrepid the
engine<00:00:17.670> did<00:00:17.850> run<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.300> originally<00:00:18.810> we

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
engine did run and originally we

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.320 
engine did run and originally we
suspected<00:00:19.680> or<00:00:19.890> he<00:00:20.039> suspected<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.880> noise

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
suspected or he suspected that the noise

defective
unfortunately<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.710> found<00:00:34.950> another<00:00:35.280> issue

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
unfortunately we found another issue

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.280 
unfortunately we found another issue
that's<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> gate<00:00:36.780> our<00:00:36.960> ability<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
that's going to the gate our ability to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.250 
that's going to the gate our ability to
get<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.590> project<00:00:37.829> underway<00:00:38.280> quickly<00:00:39.260> when

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
get this project underway quickly when

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.810 
get this project underway quickly when
he<00:00:40.379> drained<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> oil<00:00:40.860> out<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> pan<00:00:41.579> he

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
he drained the oil out of the pan he

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.840 
he drained the oil out of the pan he
found<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.329> trash<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.110> pan<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:44.610> all

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
found some trash in the pan which we all

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.810 
found some trash in the pan which we all
went<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
went there it is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.799 
went there it is
found<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:49.200> whatever<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.399> looks<00:00:50.640> like

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
found this whatever that is looks like

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.889 
found this whatever that is looks like
maybe<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.930> piece<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.500> valve<00:00:53.489> cover<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.660> these

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
maybe a piece of a valve cover but these

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.430 
maybe a piece of a valve cover but these
little<00:00:55.079> guys<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:56.129> look<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.120> little

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
little guys right here look like little

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.080 
little guys right here look like little
little<00:00:58.440> bearings<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.340> would<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.969> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
little bearings that you would get in a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
little bearings that you would get in a
sealed<00:01:01.640> bearing<00:01:02.640> I'm<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.539> sure<00:01:03.750> entirely

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
sealed bearing I'm not sure entirely

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.810 
sealed bearing I'm not sure entirely
where<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> came<00:01:04.710> from<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.159> suffice<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.790> say

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
where that came from but suffice to say

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.660 
where that came from but suffice to say
it<00:01:06.689> prompted<00:01:07.170> him<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.500> pull<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> pan<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it prompted him to pull the pan to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.380 
it prompted him to pull the pan to
discover<00:01:09.150> what's<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:11.180> upon<00:01:12.180> doing

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
discover what's going on and upon doing

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.020 
discover what's going on and upon doing
so<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:13.680> discovered<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:16.460> spun<00:01:17.460> rod<00:01:17.700> bearing

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
so we discovered a spun rod bearing

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.789 
so we discovered a spun rod bearing
there's<00:01:18.180> basically<00:01:18.570> no<00:01:18.869> bearing<00:01:19.350> left<00:01:19.560> on

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
there's basically no bearing left on

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.039 
there's basically no bearing left on
this<00:01:20.009> at<00:01:20.220> all<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> other<00:01:21.540> bearings<00:01:21.960> are

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this at all all the other bearings are

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
this at all all the other bearings are
tight<00:01:22.259> right<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.970> other<00:01:24.000> bearings

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
tight right so all the other bearings

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.060 
tight right so all the other bearings
are<00:01:24.540> tight<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.080> what's<00:01:25.530> cylinder<00:01:25.920> does

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
are tight and what what's cylinder does

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.219 
are tight and what what's cylinder does
that<00:01:26.189> go<00:01:26.340> teetee<00:01:26.580> though

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
that go teetee though

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.730 
that go teetee though
well<00:01:28.229> what's<00:01:28.470> cylinder<00:01:28.829> number<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.280> don't<00:01:29.490> know

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
well what's cylinder number I don't know

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.609 
well what's cylinder number I don't know
one<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.979> mid<00:01:32.780> mid<00:01:33.780> cylinder<00:01:34.200> towards<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
one of the mid mid cylinder towards the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.740 
one of the mid mid cylinder towards the
back<00:01:36.110> obviously<00:01:37.110> there's<00:01:37.590> no<00:01:37.979> bearing<00:01:38.460> left

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
back obviously there's no bearing left

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.590 
back obviously there's no bearing left
so<00:01:39.750> we're<00:01:39.930> gonna<00:01:40.049> take<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.979> cap<00:01:41.280> off<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.850> if

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
so we're gonna take this cap off here if

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.389 
so we're gonna take this cap off here if
we<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.290> before<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.740> battery<00:01:44.159> dies

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
we can do so before this battery dies

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.149 
we can do so before this battery dies
and<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.780> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.649> got<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:47.100> on

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and and kind of see what we got going on

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.289 
and and kind of see what we got going on
here<00:01:48.409> okay<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.500> we've<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.250> bearing<00:01:51.060> cap

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
here okay so we've got the bearing cap

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.569 
here okay so we've got the bearing cap
off<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.720> think<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.079> rod<00:01:52.649> number<00:01:53.009> four<00:01:53.280> for

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
off I think it's rod number four for

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.179 
off I think it's rod number four for
cylinder<00:01:53.909> four<00:01:54.229> we<00:01:55.229> got<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.560> off<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
cylinder four we got it off here and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.249 
cylinder four we got it off here and
there's<00:01:56.310> there's<00:01:56.700> there's<00:01:57.030> no<00:01:57.180> bearing<00:01:57.540> left

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
there's there's there's no bearing left

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.980 
there's there's there's no bearing left
per<00:01:58.770> se<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.280> here<00:01:59.640> at<00:01:59.820> all<00:02:01.100> here's<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> rod

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
per se on here at all here's the rod

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.109 
per se on here at all here's the rod
it's<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.350> scuffed<00:02:04.759> it's<00:02:05.759> got<00:02:05.909> some

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
it's a little scuffed it's got some

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.429 
it's a little scuffed it's got some
grooves<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.869> feel<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.290> my

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
grooves so I can feel it with my

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.219 
grooves so I can feel it with my
fingernail<00:02:07.970> but<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.360> there's<00:02:10.080> no

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
fingernail but there is there's no

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.190 
fingernail but there is there's no
bearing<00:02:10.679> left<00:02:10.890> on

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
bearing left on

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.360 
bearing left on
here's<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.620> rod<00:02:12.160> itself<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:14.709> mean<00:02:15.160> there's

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
here's the rod itself and I mean there's

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.979 
here's the rod itself and I mean there's
just<00:02:15.400> no<00:02:15.670> bearing<00:02:16.090> left<00:02:16.330> here<00:02:17.200> at<00:02:17.349> all<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.860> this

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
just no bearing left here at all on this

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.770 
just no bearing left here at all on this
on<00:02:19.989> this<00:02:20.230> rod<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.920> yeah<00:02:21.280> we've<00:02:21.550> obviously<00:02:22.269> got

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
on this rod so yeah we've obviously got

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.350 
on this rod so yeah we've obviously got
a<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:23.280> bearing<00:02:24.280> issue<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.879> question<00:02:25.330> now

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
a a bearing issue so the question now

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.509 
a a bearing issue so the question now
becomes<00:02:26.019> do<00:02:26.349> we<00:02:26.530> tear<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.610> all<00:02:27.819> down<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:29.519> buy

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
becomes do we tear this all down and buy

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.880 
becomes do we tear this all down and buy
a<00:02:30.550> complete<00:02:31.090> crank<00:02:31.569> kit<00:02:32.130> with<00:02:33.630> crankin

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
a complete crank kit with crankin

oversized of course four bearings and go
that<00:02:54.760> route<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.329> we're<00:02:55.630> not<00:02:55.750> sure<00:02:56.049> exactly

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
what we're going to be doing on this

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.870 
what we're going to be doing on this
engine<00:02:57.970> yet<00:02:58.319> there's<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.440> financial<00:03:00.250> aspect<00:03:00.610> to

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
engine yet there's a financial aspect to

engine yet there's a financial aspect to
this<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.209> just<00:03:01.420> came<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.660> light<00:03:02.049> which<00:03:02.380> is

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
this that just came to light which is

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.380 
this that just came to light which is
cut<00:03:03.130> his<00:03:03.840> available<00:03:04.840> liquid<00:03:04.959> assets<00:03:05.560> down

cut his available liquid assets down

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.650 
cut his available liquid assets down
substantially<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:09.130> I'm<00:03:10.060> not<00:03:10.180> sure<00:03:10.239> exactly

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660

substantially so I'm not sure exactly
what<00:03:11.019> direction<00:03:11.319> we're<00:03:11.590> gonna<00:03:11.680> go<00:03:11.920> with<00:03:12.069> this

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190

engine as of yet one good thing is the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.160 
engine as of yet one good thing is the
person<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:15.579> no<00:03:15.700> longer<00:03:15.760> asking<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.720> original

engine he's no longer asking that
because<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.420> was<00:03:25.569> on<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:26.049> contingency<00:03:26.739> that

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
because that was on the contingency that

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.340 
because that was on the contingency that
this<00:03:26.950> was<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.160> good<00:03:27.400> engine<00:03:27.730> clearly<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:29.260> not

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
this was a good engine clearly it's not

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.170 
this was a good engine clearly it's not
a<00:03:29.470> good<00:03:29.680> engine<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:31.170> anyway<00:03:32.170> there's<00:03:32.470> our<00:03:32.650> most

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
a good engine so anyway there's our most

water pump why they decided to design it
this<00:04:15.669> way<00:04:15.940> I<00:04:15.970> have<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.329> a<00:04:16.479> clue<00:04:16.660> but<00:04:17.099> that's

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
this way I have it a clue but that's

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.890 
this way I have it a clue but that's
what<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.489> is<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.030> can<00:04:19.239> just<00:04:19.359> imagine<00:04:19.630> how

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
what it is and I can just imagine how

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.710 
what it is and I can just imagine how
much<00:04:20.019> a<00:04:20.079> shop<00:04:20.440> would<00:04:20.680> charge<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:22.419> perform

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
much a shop would charge you to perform

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.450 
much a shop would charge you to perform
a<00:04:22.930> water<00:04:23.110> pump<00:04:23.349> replacement<00:04:23.590> on<00:04:23.979> this<00:04:24.159> to

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
a water pump replacement on this to

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.029 
a water pump replacement on this to
one<00:04:24.550> seven<00:04:24.940> not<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.080> smartest<00:04:26.410> design<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:26.889> my

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
one seven not the smartest design in my

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.219 
one seven not the smartest design in my
idea<00:04:27.400> but<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.449> is<00:04:28.569> what<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.870> is

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229
