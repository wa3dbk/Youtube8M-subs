which<00:01:57.370> raises<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.970> question<00:01:58.090> how<00:01:58.570> can<00:01:59.050> you

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
which raises the question how can you

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.870 
which raises the question how can you
medicate<00:01:59.920> something<00:02:00.400> that<00:02:00.550> is<00:02:00.670> not

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
medicate something that is not

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.830 
medicate something that is not
physically<00:02:01.480> there

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
physically there

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.880 
physically there
the<00:02:03.409> answer<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:04.520> can't<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.890> furthermore

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
the answer is you can't and furthermore

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.979 
the answer is you can't and furthermore
because<00:02:07.479> psychotropic<00:02:08.479> drugs<00:02:08.780> are

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
because psychotropic drugs are

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.259 
because psychotropic drugs are
specifically<00:02:09.709> designed<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.399> get<00:02:10.640> past<00:02:10.970> the

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
specifically designed to get past the

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.449 
specifically designed to get past the
