00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.420
 that is, you can say rush went to 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:22.759
 we need to take us to the base quickly 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.869
 to drive fast and help our cafes 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.869

 nifiga 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:45.810
 do not suffer much 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.590
 even though the enemy was more tanks here 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.720
 this was not much 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:59.760
 picks up a blast just bk 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:03.420

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.660
 grumpy score 50 so here neatly 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.980
 just accepted this time so if

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.370
 globalku stable stable though 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.180
 sixth level but these are their just 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.819
 profile it is their specialty win rate 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.120
 in the same strong at the sixth levels 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.709
 very good quality I play 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.910
 Better than merge on dozens 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:49.519
 it is better to stick it in the sixth 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.090
 It is my opinion but guys too as 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.070
 think and calmly roll farmed as it were in 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.900
 fortified compartments series more like brazenly 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.930
 Butterfly little town that's well 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.790

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.610

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.140
 complain to these guys who 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.099
 photo 1 they also have a VKontakte group 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:28.260
 can go see what they write 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.989
 read out of the base moving down the enemy square-85 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.049
 for some reason, climbed the mountain 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:39.120
 it is not clear why he went to the mountain right now, his 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.120
 there will just be punished 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.250
 actually finished off to 85 and 70 to account 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.160
 dry dry dragged 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:59.500
 u have gone another fight in the same video 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.280
 look and keep bending the cards or 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.730
 choirs 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.950
 such an open card in it already 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.030
 fortified caresses here interesting 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:14.560
 number 6 trunks new six tanks and 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.470
 enemy clan 348 there generally see 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:23.460
 these guys are weak with you 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:26.050
 and have their main punish punish 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.710
 we throw off the water after all 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.670
 the rest neatly shoot all 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.670
 what will light up 

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:48.639
 let's do 2x 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.979
 went to 85 starts to get a little 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.810
 course was nevertheless too 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.130
 not bad 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.130
 type continues to shine 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:07.780
 the only report I suggested is medium 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:12.710
 rotah reduce time 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:16.460
 took the type of 15 minutes for 6 barking was it 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.320
 too general fortification did 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.660
 here are dozens 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.180
 20 minutes of your let champions there 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.100
 you can either also 15 or 10 even minutes 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:34.010
 on the champions do a middle race and 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:37.060
 boxing was much more interesting fast 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:41.540
 roll back those medium mouths and what happens 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.790
 will rise in dfa100 brightness stimulus Baba 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.120
 move move both teams that 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.120

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:54.790
 two champions 15 minutes this is also dead 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.270
 hp little tanks little pile with arson 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:04.370
 imprinting aru 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:11.390
 with arson the advantage is already on our side 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:15.070
 3 more ur from nenko goes over 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:18.500

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:51.020
 it turns out as it turned out and not through 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:53.270
 the top is already at our base and well, that is, here 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.610

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.780
 glowed still that is, they are right here 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:01.730
 quietly pass and call in to the base 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:06.790
 at least needed by color and immediately from here 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.790
 from the dunes throw them back from the knees 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:16.750
