00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.999 
that in itself is actually one of the
leading<00:01:24.509> reasons<00:01:24.990> why<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.290> amazing<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:25.830> I

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
leading reasons why it's amazing but I

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.109 
leading reasons why it's amazing but I
find<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.430> there's<00:01:26.610> actually<00:01:26.729> more

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
find that there's actually more

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.190 
find that there's actually more
compelling<00:01:27.570> reasons<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.110> actually

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
compelling reasons and it's actually

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.170 
compelling reasons and it's actually
upgrades<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> most<00:01:29.430> part<00:01:29.579> these<00:01:29.820> sites

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
upgrades for the most part these sites

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.609 
upgrades for the most part these sites
you<00:01:30.390> know<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> first<00:01:30.840> third<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> second<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you know the first third a second and

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.050 
you know the first third a second and
third<00:01:31.770> all<00:01:32.009> very<00:01:32.220> much<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> same<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.880> first

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
third all very much the same the first

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.940 
third all very much the same the first
one<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.450> blew<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.140> second<00:01:34.470> one<00:01:34.560> has<00:01:34.770> like

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
one is just blew the second one has like

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.410 
one is just blew the second one has like
a<00:01:34.979> diagonal<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> third<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
a diagonal on a third one it's just a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.880 
a diagonal on a third one it's just a
square<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.960> prefer<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.409> second<00:01:37.680> lunch<00:01:37.770> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
square I prefer the second lunch is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.499 
square I prefer the second lunch is
because<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> diagonals<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.909> makes<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
because the diagonals it makes it so you

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.359 
because the diagonals it makes it so you
can<00:01:39.659> actually<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.650> horizontal

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
can actually see more of a horizontal

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.010 
can actually see more of a horizontal
type<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.700> thing<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> most<00:01:42.930> part

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
type of thing but for the most part

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.590 
type of thing but for the most part
those<00:01:43.290> those<00:01:43.619> are<00:01:43.649> very<00:01:44.040> very<00:01:44.340> unneeded<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
those those are very very unneeded and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.060 
those those are very very unneeded and
it<00:01:45.659> could<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.899> been<00:01:45.990> used<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.619> actual<00:01:46.890> like

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
it could have been used for actual like

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.100 
it could have been used for actual like
barrel<00:01:47.460> extensions<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.210> stuff<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.990> for

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
barrel extensions all this stuff but for

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.060 
barrel extensions all this stuff but for
the<00:01:49.170> most<00:01:49.259> part<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.590> upgrades<00:01:49.860> you're<00:01:49.950> going

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the most part the upgrades you're going

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.469 
the most part the upgrades you're going
to<00:01:50.130> want<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> look<00:01:50.579> at<00:01:50.729> are<00:01:50.880> actually<00:01:51.240> called

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
to want to look at are actually called

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.450 
to want to look at are actually called
firefly<00:01:52.020> explosive<00:01:52.590> rounds<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> reload

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
firefly explosive rounds and the reload

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.160 
firefly explosive rounds and the reload
so<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.700> reason<00:01:54.329> why<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> great<00:01:55.020> weapon

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
so the reason why this is a great weapon

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.600 
so the reason why this is a great weapon
is<00:01:55.380> because<00:01:55.560> they<00:01:55.649> first<00:01:55.890> upgrade<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.490> you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
is because they first upgrade on it you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.060 
is because they first upgrade on it you
explosive<00:01:57.240> headshots<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.049> Jets<00:01:58.860> just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
explosive headshots that's Jets just

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.499 
explosive headshots that's Jets just
insane<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.850> if<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.000> get<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.180> kill<00:02:00.390> with

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
insane so if you get a kill with

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.120 
insane so if you get a kill with
precision<00:02:00.840> damage<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.530> weapon<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
precision damage with this weapon the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.880 
precision damage with this weapon the
enemy<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:02.670> explode<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> think<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:04.380> looks<00:02:04.740> like

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
enemy will explode I think it looks like

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.530 
enemy will explode I think it looks like
it<00:02:05.040> does<00:02:05.189> solar<00:02:05.460> damage<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.000> enemy<00:02:06.450> has

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
it does solar damage but the enemy has

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.150 
it does solar damage but the enemy has
actually<00:02:06.780> burn<00:02:07.020> up<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.350> arc<00:02:07.649> damage<00:02:08.039> so

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
actually burn up with arc damage so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.690 
actually burn up with arc damage so
they'll<00:02:08.280> actually<00:02:08.399> be<00:02:08.550> blue<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.000> burn<00:02:09.360> up

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
they'll actually be blue and burn up

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.010 
they'll actually be blue and burn up
ash<00:02:09.879> with<00:02:10.239> blue<00:02:10.479> which<00:02:10.599> is<00:02:10.690> kind<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:10.899> weird

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
ash with blue which is kind of weird

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.110 
ash with blue which is kind of weird
because<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:12.040> does<00:02:12.160> look<00:02:12.340> late<00:02:12.489> explodes<00:02:12.970> in

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
because it does look late explodes in

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.270 
because it does look late explodes in
solar<00:02:13.720> but<00:02:13.989> for<00:02:14.170> four<00:02:14.769> in<00:02:14.830> fact<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.250> actually

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
solar but for four in fact it actually

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.640 
solar but for four in fact it actually
does<00:02:15.640> arc<00:02:15.879> damage<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:17.019> will<00:02:17.230> blow<00:02:17.440> up<00:02:17.530> in

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
does arc damage so it will blow up in

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.110 
does arc damage so it will blow up in
solar<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.099> don't<00:02:18.250> expect<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.670> actually<00:02:19.000> do

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
solar so don't expect this actually do

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.820 
solar so don't expect this actually do
fire<00:02:19.390> damn<00:02:19.599> it<00:02:19.629> it<00:02:19.810> does<00:02:19.959> do<00:02:20.110> our<00:02:20.410> damage<00:02:20.709> with

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
fire damn it it does do our damage with

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.440 
fire damn it it does do our damage with
the<00:02:20.920> explosion<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.519> course<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.209> got<00:02:22.330> your

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the explosion of course you got your

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.790 
the explosion of course you got your
damage<00:02:22.750> upgrade<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:23.290> actually<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.530> couple<00:02:23.650> of

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
damage upgrade it's actually a couple of

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.520 
damage upgrade it's actually a couple of
upgrades<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.370> first<00:02:25.090> ladder<00:02:25.690> here<00:02:26.319> that

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
upgrades in this first ladder here that

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
upgrades in this first ladder here that
are<00:02:26.590> actually<00:02:26.800> pretty<00:02:26.890> cool<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.190> first<00:02:27.400> one

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
are actually pretty cool the first one

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.710 
are actually pretty cool the first one
increases<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> amount<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.269> em'll<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.599> can

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
increases the amount of em'll you can

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.660 
increases the amount of em'll you can
carry<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:28.989> just<00:02:29.200> upgrades<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.769> by<00:02:29.860> one<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.430> in

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
carry it just upgrades it by one so in

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.160 
carry it just upgrades it by one so in
the<00:02:30.819> magazine<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.599> that's<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:31.870> really<00:02:31.989> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
the magazine so that's not really the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.930 
the magazine so that's not really the
important<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:32.830> also<00:02:32.950> increases<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.459> extra

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
important but also increases the extra

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.880 
important but also increases the extra
magazine<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.569> extra<00:02:35.019> ammo<00:02:35.349> so<00:02:35.530> goes<00:02:35.650> up<00:02:35.799> to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
magazine to extra ammo so goes up to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.580 
magazine to extra ammo so goes up to
like<00:02:35.920> 120<00:02:36.790> boulders<00:02:37.209> insane<00:02:37.750> second<00:02:38.349> upgrades

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
like 120 boulders insane second upgrades

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.900 
like 120 boulders insane second upgrades
not<00:02:38.799> that<00:02:38.980> great<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.340> last<00:02:39.549> upgrades

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
not that great in the last upgrades

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.030 
not that great in the last upgrades
words<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.360> gives<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:40.690> explosive<00:02:41.530> around<00:02:41.830> so

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
words that gives you explosive around so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.009 
words that gives you explosive around so
this<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.310> actually<00:02:42.400> my<00:02:42.730> favorite<00:02:42.940> if<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.840> did

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
this is actually my favorite if you did

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.990 
this is actually my favorite if you did
pretty<00:02:44.230> much<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.500> choice<00:02:45.190> between<00:02:45.370> explosive

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
pretty much a choice between explosive

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.809 
pretty much a choice between explosive
rounds<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.299> more<00:02:46.450> ammo<00:02:46.720> but<00:02:46.870> for<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.049> most<00:02:47.170> part

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
rounds a more ammo but for the most part

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.970 
rounds a more ammo but for the most part
for<00:02:48.819> me<00:02:49.000> explosive<00:02:49.840> rounds<00:02:50.079> every<00:02:50.200> time<00:02:50.590> for

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
for me explosive rounds every time for

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.259 
for me explosive rounds every time for
the<00:02:51.069> not<00:02:51.190> only<00:02:51.370> for<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.670> factor<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.000> can<00:02:52.120> get

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
the not only for the factor you can get

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.180 
the not only for the factor you can get
some<00:02:52.390> AOE<00:02:52.690> damage<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.319> also<00:02:53.349> do<00:02:53.709> extra

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
some AOE damage but you also do extra

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.650 
some AOE damage but you also do extra
damage<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.730> guys<00:02:54.880> don't<00:02:55.090> know<00:02:55.239> if<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.540> hit

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
damage you guys don't know if you hit

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.420 
damage you guys don't know if you hit
somebody<00:02:55.810> with<00:02:55.930> explosive<00:02:56.500> shock<00:02:56.769> you<00:02:57.130> do<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
somebody with explosive shock you do the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.009 
somebody with explosive shock you do the
initial<00:02:57.730> damage<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.209> explosive<00:02:58.930> damage

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
initial damage and the explosive damage

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.809 
initial damage and the explosive damage
actually<00:02:59.530> hits<00:02:59.680> on<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.980> second<00:03:00.340> time<00:03:00.549> so<00:03:00.760> if

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
actually hits on the second time so if

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.220

this such a good PVE weapon and the last

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.670 
this such a good PVE weapon and the last
upgrade<00:03:16.480> that's<00:03:16.900> been<00:03:17.049> really<00:03:17.170> important<00:03:17.590> is

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
upgrade that's been really important is

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.470 
upgrade that's been really important is
precision<00:03:18.190> kills<00:03:18.609> will<00:03:18.850> actually<00:03:19.299> increase

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
precision kills will actually increase

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.330 
precision kills will actually increase
your<00:03:19.840> reload<00:03:20.139> speed<00:03:20.350> so<00:03:20.739> if<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.010> go<00:03:21.130> for<00:03:21.310> the

your reload speed so if you go for the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.370 
your reload speed so if you go for the
precision<00:03:21.910> shots<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.180> get<00:03:22.329> explosive<00:03:22.750> damage

type of material it is other than that

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.000 
type of material it is other than that
those<00:03:41.170> are<00:03:41.319> pretty<00:03:41.440> much<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.650> upgrades

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
those are pretty much the upgrades

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
entire time so what I recommend is not

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.020 
entire time so what I recommend is not
just<00:03:51.040> spamming<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:51.489> into<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.700> group<00:03:51.940> of

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
just spamming this into a group of

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
about spamming it but that's just my

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.949 
about spamming it but that's just my
recommendation<00:04:15.479> again<00:04:16.479> if<00:04:16.599> I<00:04:16.690> had<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.870> compare

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
recommendation again if I had to compare

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.080 
recommendation again if I had to compare
this<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.650> weapons<00:04:18.070> like<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.370> thorn<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.909> fact

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
this to weapons like the thorn the fact

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.580 
this to weapons like the thorn the fact
that<00:04:19.150> if<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.390> legendary<00:04:19.930> just<00:04:20.229> makes<00:04:20.440> this

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
that if the legendary just makes this

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.030 
that if the legendary just makes this
weapon<00:04:20.950> way<00:04:21.190> better<00:04:21.430> than<00:04:21.640> pulling<00:04:21.849> you

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
weapon way better than pulling you

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.650 
weapon way better than pulling you
can<00:04:22.160> have<00:04:22.310> other<00:04:22.490> exotics<00:04:23.090> on<00:04:23.240> at<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.450> same

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
can have other exotics on at the same

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.690 
can have other exotics on at the same
time<00:04:23.920> foreign<00:04:24.920> does<00:04:25.040> a<00:04:25.070> little<00:04:25.340> bit<00:04:25.550> more

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
time foreign does a little bit more

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.940 
time foreign does a little bit more
damage<00:04:26.150> but<00:04:26.660> personally<00:04:27.170> I've<00:04:27.350> way<00:04:27.710> way

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
damage but personally I've way way

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.770 
damage but personally I've way way
prefer<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.910> explosive<00:04:29.390> damage<00:04:29.450> but

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
prefer the the explosive damage but

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.810 
prefer the the explosive damage but
sometimes<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.440> can<00:04:30.860> do<00:04:31.070> more<00:04:31.340> damage<00:04:31.520> than<00:04:31.760> the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
sometimes it can do more damage than the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.600 
sometimes it can do more damage than the
thorn<00:04:32.270> actually<00:04:33.200> can<00:04:33.440> do<00:04:33.710> but<00:04:33.980> and<00:04:34.280> again<00:04:34.490> the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
thorn actually can do but and again the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.890 
thorn actually can do but and again the
thorn<00:04:34.790> is<00:04:34.910> actually<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.180> lot<00:04:35.300> harder<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.690> get<00:04:35.780> in

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
thorn is actually a lot harder to get in

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.140 
thorn is actually a lot harder to get in
my<00:04:36.020> opinion<00:04:36.320> cuz<00:04:36.590> oh<00:04:36.770> my<00:04:37.190> god<00:04:37.430> that<00:04:37.700> much<00:04:37.850> void

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
my opinion cuz oh my god that much void

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.300 
my opinion cuz oh my god that much void
damage<00:04:38.540> in<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.720> crucible<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.320> whatever<00:04:40.070> we're

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
damage in the crucible of whatever we're

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.500 
damage in the crucible of whatever we're
not<00:04:40.430> going<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.610> talk<00:04:40.760> about<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.210> but<00:04:41.480> a

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
not going to talk about that but a

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.690 
not going to talk about that but a
comparatively<00:04:42.350> The<00:04:42.830> Thorn<00:04:43.010> is<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.250> little<00:04:43.610> bit

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
comparatively The Thorn is a little bit

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.130 
comparatively The Thorn is a little bit
more<00:04:43.820> damage<00:04:44.240> but<00:04:44.480> with<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.720> explosive

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
more damage but with the explosive

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.090 
more damage but with the explosive
damage<00:04:45.230> you're<00:04:45.500> probably<00:04:45.680> gonna<00:04:45.860> be<00:04:45.950> doing

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
damage you're probably gonna be doing

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.560 
damage you're probably gonna be doing
more<00:04:46.190> damage<00:04:46.310> with<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.610> paper<00:04:46.790> ER<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.210> it's<00:04:47.480> a

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
gun sucks don't don't even try it it's

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.890 
gun sucks don't don't even try it it's
compared<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:04.730> the<00:06:04.850> favoring<00:06:05.270> or<00:06:05.420> it<00:06:05.540> ain't<00:06:05.570> got

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
compared to the favoring or it ain't got

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.690 
compared to the favoring or it ain't got
shit<00:06:06.170> or<00:06:06.320> any<00:06:06.860> of<00:06:07.010> the<00:06:07.100> other<00:06:07.220> weapons<00:06:07.550> for

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
shit or any of the other weapons for

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.070 
shit or any of the other weapons for
that<00:06:07.820> fact<00:06:08.030> it<00:06:08.240> just<00:06:08.450> doesn't<00:06:08.660> do<00:06:08.930> enough

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
that fact it just doesn't do enough

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.720 
that fact it just doesn't do enough
damage<00:06:09.260> I<00:06:09.710> think<00:06:09.980> the<00:06:10.100> way<00:06:10.250> they<00:06:10.400> should<00:06:10.460> bump

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
damage I think the way they should bump

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.550 
damage I think the way they should bump
this<00:06:10.880> weapon<00:06:11.180> is<00:06:11.270> just<00:06:11.480> that<00:06:11.600> fact<00:06:11.960> that<00:06:12.140> just

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
this weapon is just that fact that just

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.680 
this weapon is just that fact that just
make<00:06:12.740> a<00:06:12.770> do<00:06:13.070> massive<00:06:13.520> critical<00:06:14.090> hit<00:06:14.240> damage<00:06:14.270> if

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
make a do massive critical hit damage if

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.270 
make a do massive critical hit damage if
this<00:06:14.840> weapon<00:06:15.140> did<00:06:15.290> like<00:06:15.560> more<00:06:15.860> damage

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
this weapon did like more damage

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.430 
this weapon did like more damage
critical<00:06:16.940> hit<00:06:17.270> wise<00:06:17.450> then<00:06:17.840> let's<00:06:18.140> say<00:06:18.290> the

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
critical hit wise then let's say the

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.020 
critical hit wise then let's say the
Ike's<00:06:18.650> breaker<00:06:19.010> then<00:06:19.340> it<00:06:19.430> would<00:06:19.520> be<00:06:19.550> a<00:06:19.640> viable

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
Ike's breaker then it would be a viable

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.550 
Ike's breaker then it would be a viable
weapon<00:06:20.240> the<00:06:20.630> iron<00:06:20.810> sights<00:06:21.110> would<00:06:21.260> be<00:06:21.380> a

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
weapon the iron sights would be a

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.230 
weapon the iron sights would be a
drawback<00:06:22.070> the<00:06:22.490> fire<00:06:22.760> rate<00:06:22.940> would<00:06:23.060> be<00:06:23.120> a

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
drawback the fire rate would be a

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.540 
drawback the fire rate would be a
drawback<00:06:23.570> but<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.200> damage<00:06:24.650> would<00:06:25.040> be<00:06:25.220> so

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
drawback but the damage would be so

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.190 
drawback but the damage would be so
phenomenal<00:06:26.120> maybe<00:06:26.270> body<00:06:26.540> shots<00:06:26.810> wouldn't<00:06:27.140> do

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
phenomenal maybe body shots wouldn't do

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.350 
phenomenal maybe body shots wouldn't do
as<00:06:27.350> much<00:06:27.590> but<00:06:28.040> i<00:06:28.190> think<00:06:28.550> that<00:06:28.610> the<00:06:28.820> precision

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
as much but i think that the precision

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.630 
as much but i think that the precision
damage<00:06:29.690> should<00:06:29.870> be<00:06:29.950> through<00:06:30.950> the<00:06:31.220> roof<00:06:31.400> on

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
damage should be through the roof on

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.220 
damage should be through the roof on
this<00:06:31.790> weapon<00:06:32.180> or<00:06:32.360> the<00:06:32.540> fact<00:06:32.750> that<00:06:32.840> it<00:06:33.050> may<00:06:33.200> be

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
this weapon or the fact that it may be

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.960 
this weapon or the fact that it may be
the<00:06:33.530> if<00:06:33.710> you<00:06:33.860> get<00:06:34.040> extra<00:06:34.250> precision<00:06:34.460> it<00:06:34.820> should

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
the if you get extra precision it should

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.629 
the if you get extra precision it should
just<00:06:35.060> continue

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
just continue

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.399 
just continue
stack<00:06:35.999> the<00:06:36.389> amount<00:06:36.629> of<00:06:36.689> damage<00:06:36.990> you<00:06:37.020> can<00:06:37.289> do

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
stack the amount of damage you can do

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:38.959 
stack the amount of damage you can do
with<00:06:37.590> the<00:06:37.680> weapon<00:06:37.979> I<00:06:38.099> think<00:06:38.460> that<00:06:38.669> would<00:06:38.789> make

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
with the weapon I think that would make

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:40.640 
with the weapon I think that would make
it<00:06:38.999> more<00:06:39.240> of<00:06:39.330> a<00:06:39.389> viable<00:06:39.780> weapon<00:06:39.840> but<00:06:40.439> from<00:06:40.560> the

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
it more of a viable weapon but from the

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.100 
it more of a viable weapon but from the
most<00:06:40.800> part<00:06:41.330> it's<00:06:42.330> a<00:06:42.419> bad<00:06:42.569> weapon<00:06:42.870> if<00:06:42.930> you<00:06:42.990> guys

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
most part it's a bad weapon if you guys
