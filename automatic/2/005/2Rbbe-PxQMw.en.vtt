it's<00:00:22.900> easiest<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:24.010> begin<00:00:24.430> by<00:00:24.910> cleaning<00:00:25.360> off

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
it's easiest to begin by cleaning off

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.929 
it's easiest to begin by cleaning off
the<00:00:25.540> mushroom<00:00:26.169> of<00:00:26.380> dirt<00:00:26.860> and<00:00:27.040> other<00:00:27.310> particles

the mushroom of dirt and other particles
that<00:00:28.060> actually<00:00:28.480> just<00:00:29.050> get<00:00:29.200> stuck<00:00:29.500> on<00:00:29.529> by<00:00:30.189> using

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
that actually just get stuck on by using

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.819 
that actually just get stuck on by using
a<00:00:30.669> paper<00:00:30.880> towel<00:00:31.210> and<00:00:31.240> wiping<00:00:31.900> it<00:00:31.990> off<00:00:32.110> water

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
a paper towel and wiping it off water

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.710 
a paper towel and wiping it off water
makes<00:00:33.160> them<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.370> little<00:00:33.640> bit<00:00:33.880> slimy<00:00:34.240> so<00:00:34.600> I'd

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
makes them a little bit slimy so I'd

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.230 
makes them a little bit slimy so I'd
stay<00:00:34.990> away<00:00:35.020> from<00:00:35.290> it<00:00:35.590> if<00:00:35.710> you<00:00:35.860> can<00:00:36.130> these<00:00:37.060> are
