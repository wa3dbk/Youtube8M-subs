00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello everyone my name is eduardo 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.400
 Castilians in this opportunity I will 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.069
 do a series of tutorials on this 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.700
 program the company is called micro 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.620
 anime study but in its version 10 this 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.020
 program was designed with the objective of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.510
 make digital animations in 2d of a 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.520
 Fast and professional way winning him 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.590
 for simplicity in the workflow 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.109
 to programs used for the same 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.360
 objective as they are flash av 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.400
 I'm going to a studio or after effects 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.340
 in this first tutorial we are going to make a 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.370
 slight travel on the interface of this 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.890
 anime program study like most 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.590
 of the animation programs we have 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.500
 almost always the same windows first 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.700
 we have a file where we handle everything 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.290
 what are the archives 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.170
 the edit window 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.470
 forest draw this window is for 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.940
 create bones later on let's look 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.900
 how can we use it animation 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.360
 scripts where we have saved the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.310
 items that come with the program 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.970
 we also have a window that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.570
 is the one that lets us look at the interface of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.120
 the program we can we can be 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.560
 changing our our windows 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.820
 to facilitate the work we can create 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.640
 floating windows of tools 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.490
 layers of timelines we can 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.020
 you can also close them we can close 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.689
 this we can change this 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.750
 the way we want to 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:44.490
 that the work is provided to us or of the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.439
 same way we can be calling them 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.670
 Usually, I like to have them 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.340
 as they come 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.290
 since we opened the program and we can 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.860
 work in a very easy way and 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.700
 simple this program called anime 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.909
 study but good on the left 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.209
 we have the window of 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.830
 tools where we have this box 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.450
 what is the selection box we have 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.680
 this little tool here that is 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.599
 with which we can add points 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.540
 let's make an example here these are 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.400
 this is a tool where we can 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.560
 find varied geometric shapes 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.660
 we can use for example this 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.310
 square then we can do this 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.989
 this rectangle let's do it we can 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.830
 start working with our series of 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.180
 tools we can start adding 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.900
 points 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.580
 with our selection tool 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.640
 we can move the points 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:01.900
 to give it some kind of form that 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:06.299
 we go let's design we can 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.660
 eliminate points with this tool 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.600
 called delights we can 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.950
 erase points but then we can like 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.300
 we can see we can also 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.790
 remove 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.340
 the lines of the route that we are 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.510
 adding the point again 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.970
 to close 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:35.860
 that figure we were doing 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.560
 we have this tool that is 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.250
 how does it help us 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.700
 to shape we have this other 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.849
 tool then this tool 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.110
 called perspective points that is us 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.849
 helps to change the perspective of the 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.520
 the image that we are doing 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.780
 to give you a little background 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.550
 three-dimensionality we can play with 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.970
 this amount of tools that 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.150
 we have here here we go I'm going to do 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.580
 a tutorial where we're going to do this 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.640
 type of exercises to whom they are going 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.840
 Tools section are the layers we can 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.060
 be handling the layers that we are 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.480
 working we can 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.030
 and move the point d 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.170
 of the layer that we are working 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.520
 we can 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.800
 with this other rotate the layer that we are 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.800
 working we have here in this section 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.360
 also on the left the maneuvers of 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.400
 cameras 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.570
 what we can also handle in this 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:52.139
 in this window is the workspace 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.050
 if we select here we can manage or 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.830
 we can enlarge our our space 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.759
 of work we can take it to be more 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.759
 small 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.100
 and we move our cursor left to 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.540
 we can enlarge it or reduce it 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.110
 we can rotate 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:19.820
 this what the tools window 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:24.370
 in the upper right we find 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.590
 two windows a window is called the 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:31.850
 wizard character is an assistant 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.770
 creation where there are some characters already 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:39.560
 predesigned and what we do 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:41.449
 is to start moving this series of cursor 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.639
 is 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:48.270
 to change the shape of the 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:52.150
 of the figure that we have there we have 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.310
 three characters predesigned by the 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:59.860
 program that is the 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:03.160
 the boy a creature or the mannequin that 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.740
 Well, it is usually used in this type 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.450
 good programs or programs 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.050
 3-d animation 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:15.210
 we can be driving them 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:19.389
 back to the boy that then from 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:23.250
 the size of the feet the size of the 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.250
 of the legs 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:31.200
 the space between the legs the shoulders 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:35.120
 we can be the arms the shoulders the 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:37.680
 we can be changing and then this 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.550
 assistant of characters because it is us 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.650
 creating a character that has several 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.199
 views 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:49.130
 we can be playing to create 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:52.460
 individual characters is an assistant 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.850
 that can serve us at some time 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.850
 and can you help us create something pretty 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.850
 nice
