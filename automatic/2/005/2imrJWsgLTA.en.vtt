00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.759
 hello today we answer to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.320
 this question should be prayed before 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:20.220
 to sit down at the table when we eat and is it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.699
 that this prayer benino foods then 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.740
 we read a verse from the Bible a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.269
 passage that is important in a team 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.170
 in t4 the verses 3 and 4 and this verse new 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.719
 deal that every creature is good and he 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.770
 says it with regard to those who 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:42.290
 possibly will not eat meat 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.489
 so he says 1 timothy 4 verse 3 all 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.219
 god creature is good is pouring 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.039
 4 and there is none that is rejected 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.039
 so we can eat meat is in 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.460
 taken with thanksgiving because she is 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.699
 sanctified by the word of God and by 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.109
 prayer and he says by proposing these 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.940
 things to the brother you'll be a good 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.790
 servant of christ jesus 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.439
 so these things are square is certain 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 so let's look at it a bit 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.909
 what can we do with his 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.520
 passages first it says all 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.080
 creature is good it means that one 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.509
 can not say he must eat the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.220
 meat or not eat such meat or by 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.689
 elsewhere there is no need to eat 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.979
 meat 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.180
 I believe that the question of being 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.210
 vegetarian here is completely revealed 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.799
 so any creature is good is in 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 taken with thanksgiving that means 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.240
 what is an action of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.030
 grace in the Greek New Testament 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.220
 thanksgiving to them caris theo who has 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.220
 given the Eucharist of the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 Mass mean operator and where that 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.549
 means to consider caris the grace of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.820
 God 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.780
 hum hum driver and charisma and them 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.659
 as good 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.570
 it's like in a good dead Asia 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.090
 or lodges good word and so 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.119
 the Eucharist is the fact of appreciating 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.909
 the grace that god makes us saying 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.850
 this is a grace so when we 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.399
 eat one is together and 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.260
 alone or with family 10 and this is what 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.510
 that I am eating is a 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.980
 grace of god a free thing is some 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.890
 what god is giving me this is 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.620
 really important to give thanks 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.810
 consider that what is given to me 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.030
 today a grace is by grace 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.090
 that I am alive it is by grace that 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.470
 I can breathe that I have health 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.360
 I have right now is by grace 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.860
 that I can eat is by grace that 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.630
 things are renewed of course 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.160
 I buy bread at the bakery but 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.500
 she's she where I come from where the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.620
 flour and earthly goods and why 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.050
 does the grain of wheat give the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.440
 public life with wheat have made the 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.819
 flour 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.489
 it's still because somewhere 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.620
 the create and give thanks is 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.590
 recognize that it is god who is the one 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.010
 who gives so that's a first thing 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.750
 is that the food I take 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.549
 must be taken with thanksgiving 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.430
 second thing is that she is 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.340
 sanctified by word and prayer 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.870
 oh what will it tell me felt proud 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.110
 means she sanctification 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.750
 that's the thing god did in 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.060
 allowing us to be in his presence 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.209
 is god call healthy and we have been 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.579
 hallowed says 1 Corinthians 6 11 and god 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.269
 call 5 from for example philippe yesterday 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.370
 a verse 1 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.690
 all those who are these children is that 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.660
 we are able to stand in 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.390
 his presence then any food any 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.500
 creature is sanctified by the word of 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.049
 god circus god gave us 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.060
 fish animals to eat them by 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.359
 example and so the food is us 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.060
 given as being in the presence of 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.560
 god and feel proud she can be 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.150
 in the presence of god as we are 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.370
 are in the presence of old tunes and 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.579
 to be amplified by the word is the Bible 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.739
 declare this creature good as and in 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.170
 presence of god and for prayer because 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.859
 that we associate ourselves with the declaration 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.560
 handball god ang lee this creature 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:09.290
 finally and sees another passage in 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.359
 a coron is in chapter 10 and in 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.590
 verse 31 tells us something of a 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.750
 little complementary bit that I'm going 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.109
 you read he says 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.640
 that you eat or that you eat or 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.580
 that you drink anything that 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.210
 you do everything for the glory of 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.680
 god so see her our attitude that 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.290
 we have to see when we will follow 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.370
 or camp nou camp nou dugongs that's all 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.920
 to do for the glory of god 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.050
 so we can say but me when I 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.090
 eat I eat when I eat late or 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.720
 I appreciate and I do not think necessarily 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.110
 radiant 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.450
 well I think it's wrong when 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.490
 I eat what I eat 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.800
 the general work of god god calls me 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.020
 by eating at fortified but also at 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.690
 take pleasure in being satisfied at 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.970
 to be with friends to share what 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.100
 I have and so what I do when I 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.060
 eats into the general work of 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.620
 god who in his sense so it's up to me 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.110
 do not let me go 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.750
 when I eat I eat I do not care 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.200
 meal when I drink so I think everything 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.760
 bottom of May 20 I do not see wine for 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.010
 new role currently I drink wine 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.320
 for pleasure I can drink wine from 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.240
 full way by rejoicing with 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.979
 people but what I do I do it 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.540
 for God's glory by doing 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.490
 maybe the difference between such or 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.620
 such go by associating this or that 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.720
 May 20 this or that dish it's where I 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.820
 I become aware because I'm doing 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.390
 to enter a general framework of the 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.310
 glory of god 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.710
 so did I have bathed them 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.080
 foods what someone to bless them 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.490
 food is that someone can 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.740
 make food better by 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.600
 prayer not at all by prayer we 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.880
 let's go before god and we do 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.729
 something by cons is what I 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.830
 can say good food bless them 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.870
 yes I can say that these foods are 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.300
 good and I can say it in front of God 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.250
 and in that moment before eating by 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.680
 example the prayer is a family moment 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.990
 where the things that are said are strong 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.400
 because together we can remember 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.770
 we are doing something 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.479
 before hard to win their place renews 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.340
 things for us or a I'm going 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.770
 live things together where god we 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.180
 it's all about grace and although 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.940
 this moment of prayer that can be 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.160
 very short be our rich family 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:24.980
 or all alone before 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.980
 yes of course that if it is
