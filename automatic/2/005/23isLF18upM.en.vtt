00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
to settle and you've calmed down you you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.730 
to settle and you've calmed down you you
hunger<00:00:27.750> after<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.320> want<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.529> go<00:00:28.650> and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
hunger after it and you want to go and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.060 
hunger after it and you want to go and
get<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.949> again<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.990> got<00:00:30.990> into<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.679> kind<00:00:31.920> of

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
get it again I got into this kind of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.470 
get it again I got into this kind of
pattern<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.520> fishing<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:32.880> fish<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.329> aren't

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
pattern of fishing for fish that aren't

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.060 
pattern of fishing for fish that aren't
caught<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> challenge<00:00:35.010> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
caught and I think the challenge of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
caught and I think the challenge of
finding<00:00:35.280> those<00:00:36.270> particular<00:00:36.840> fish<00:00:37.399> is<00:00:38.399> it's

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
finding those particular fish is it's

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.520 
finding those particular fish is it's
almost<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.450> much<00:00:39.540> as<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.780> fishing<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.230> me<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
almost as much as a fishing for me is a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.869 
almost as much as a fishing for me is a
bit<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.770> trying<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> get<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.219> rare-book<00:00:41.460> most

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
bit like trying to get a rare-book most

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.580 
bit like trying to get a rare-book most
collect<00:00:42.239> books<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.750> I've<00:00:43.079> got<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> lot<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.410> hard

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
collect books and I've got a lot of hard

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.889 
collect books and I've got a lot of hard
backs<00:00:43.800> now<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.450> don't<00:00:45.450> collect<00:00:45.629> letters

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.420 
backs now but don't collect letters
anymore<00:00:47.809> it<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.710> something<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.100> prefer

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
anymore it it's just something I prefer

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.670 
anymore it it's just something I prefer
you<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> wild<00:00:51.360> aspects<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you know I like the wild aspects of the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.290 
you know I like the wild aspects of the
unknown<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.250> not<00:00:53.430> ever<00:00:53.850> known<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.210> you're

unknown and not ever known what you're

going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.449> catch<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.840> think<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.110> why<00:00:55.260> fish

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
going to catch I think that's why fish

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.860 
going to catch I think that's why fish
determines<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> long<00:00:56.160> time<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:57.449> still<00:00:57.570> do

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
determines for a long time and still do

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.119 
determines for a long time and still do
it<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.170> never<00:00:58.469> know<00:00:58.739> what's<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.100> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it you just never know what's going to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.220 
it you just never know what's going to
be<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> other<00:00:59.520> end<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.109> I

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
be on the other end and it's it's just I

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.759 
be on the other end and it's it's just I
just<00:01:01.440> love<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> adventure<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:04.619> not

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
just love the adventure and and then not

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.800 
just love the adventure and and then not
knowing<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:05.790> fishing<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.540> rivers

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
knowing and I think fishing for rivers

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.350 
knowing and I think fishing for rivers
for<00:01:06.990> years<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> unique<00:01:08.430> kind<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.939> sense

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
for years you get a unique kind of sense

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.100 
for years you get a unique kind of sense
of<00:01:09.540> being<00:01:10.140> alone<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> point<00:01:11.760> where

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
of being alone and to the point where

of being alone and to the point where
particular<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> Midlands<00:01:13.560> rivers<00:01:13.860> which

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
particular on the Midlands rivers which

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.260 
particular on the Midlands rivers which
will<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.430> miles<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.760> countryside<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
will have miles of countryside you

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.179 
will have miles of countryside you
wouldn't<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.570> anybody<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.500> that's<00:01:16.799> made<00:01:17.070> it

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
wouldn't see anybody and that's made it

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.130 
wouldn't see anybody and that's made it
very<00:01:17.310> difficult<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:18.150> corphish<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.750> terms<00:01:18.930> for

very difficult in corphish in terms for

me now because if I see another angler

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.490 
me now because if I see another angler
on<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> water<00:01:21.000> I'll<00:01:21.900> feel<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.259> I'm<00:01:22.350> being

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
on a water I'll feel like I'm being

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
on a water I'll feel like I'm being
encroached<00:01:22.860> even<00:01:23.729> though<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> moment

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
encroached even though at the moment

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
encroached even though at the moment
it's<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.659> 25<00:01:24.990> acres<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:25.650> whatever<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
it's like 25 acres or whatever and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.890 
it's like 25 acres or whatever and
there's<00:01:26.790> only<00:01:26.880> three<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.210> us<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.689> still

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
there's only three of us on it I still

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.969 
there's only three of us on it I still
feel<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.320> haven't<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> myself

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
feel like I haven't got it to myself

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.069

anymore and that that doesn't feel this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:40.790 
anymore and that that doesn't feel this
night<00:01:32.119> itself<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.270> really<00:01:33.540> but

couple years a spot where I'm not gonna

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.050 
couple years a spot where I'm not gonna
guess<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.160> know<00:01:57.370> I<00:01:57.400> mean<00:01:57.610> definitely<00:01:57.760> when

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
guess so you know I mean definitely when

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.370 
guess so you know I mean definitely when
I<00:01:58.090> was<00:01:58.180> fishing<00:01:58.390> in<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.510> mirror<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:58.840> was<00:01:59.020> I<00:01:59.260> was

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
I was fishing in the mirror I was I was

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.600 
I was fishing in the mirror I was I was
hiding<00:01:59.590> better<00:01:59.920> than<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.100> was<00:02:00.190> fishing<00:02:00.460> to

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
hiding better than I was fishing to

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.370 
hiding better than I was fishing to
start<00:02:00.850> with<00:02:01.030> no<00:02:01.150> question<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:01.690> that<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:02.260> in

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
start with no question of that and in

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.720 
start with no question of that and in
the<00:02:02.470> end<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.710> just<00:02:02.740> start<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.130> accept<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.550> fact

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
the end I just start to accept the fact

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.640 
the end I just start to accept the fact
that<00:02:03.790> I've<00:02:04.570> decided<00:02:04.870> to<00:02:05.050> fish<00:02:05.290> there<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.560> if<00:02:05.620> I

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
that I've decided to fish there and if I

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.440 
that I've decided to fish there and if I
got<00:02:05.740> caught<00:02:05.980> or<00:02:06.100> got<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.250> call<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.760> I<00:02:07.180> fished<00:02:07.390> a

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
got caught or got a call and I fished a

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.030 
got caught or got a call and I fished a
lot<00:02:07.510> better<00:02:07.750> for<00:02:07.930> it<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.290> I<00:02:08.320> had<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> fish<00:02:08.649> very

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
lot better for it and I had a fish very

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.010 
lot better for it and I had a fish very
quickly<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.580> know<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.510> was<00:02:10.630> just<00:02:10.840> one<00:02:10.990> of

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
quickly you know and it was just one of

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.390 
quickly you know and it was just one of
those<00:02:11.140> things<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.500> just<00:02:11.530> kind<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:11.980> get<00:02:12.250> that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
those things you just kind of get that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.520 
those things you just kind of get that
kind<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.300> mindset<00:02:13.630> before<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.110> fish<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.350> lot<00:02:14.470> of

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
kind of mindset before you fish a lot of

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.020 
kind of mindset before you fish a lot of
water<00:02:14.800> like<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.400> you've<00:02:15.700> got<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:15.940> in

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
water like that and you've got it in

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.310 
water like that and you've got it in
your<00:02:16.120> head<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.510> has<00:02:16.630> if<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:16.990> put<00:02:17.200> your

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
your head that has if you put your

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.449 
your head that has if you put your
finger<00:02:17.560> up<00:02:17.770> from<00:02:17.920> behind<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.190> tree<00:02:18.220> you're

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
finger up from behind a tree you're

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:35.480 
finger up from behind a tree you're
gonna<00:02:18.580> get<00:02:18.730> an<00:02:18.850> 800<00:02:19.390> pound<00:02:19.690> fine

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.090 

generally<00:02:36.490> speaking<00:02:36.580> I'm<00:02:37.330> not<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.630> real<00:02:37.870> person

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
generally speaking I'm not a real person

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.380 
generally speaking I'm not a real person
and<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.160> think<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.520> generally<00:02:39.730> speaking<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and I think that generally speaking the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.300 
and I think that generally speaking the
fish<00:02:40.570> again<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.350> type<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.590> cop<00:02:41.890> got<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.100> fish

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
fish again the type of cop got a fish

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.440 
fish again the type of cop got a fish
for<00:02:43.020> if<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.230> goes<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.620> goes<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:45.370> know<00:02:45.520> I've

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
for if it goes it goes you know I've

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.270 
for if it goes it goes you know I've
only<00:02:46.600> have<00:02:46.780> really<00:02:46.870> fish<00:02:47.080> warm<00:02:47.320> water<00:02:47.500> when

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
only have really fish warm water when

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.680 
only have really fish warm water when
police<00:02:48.460> were<00:02:48.610> very<00:02:48.790> sensitive<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.360> rigs<00:02:49.540> that

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
police were very sensitive to rigs that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.690 
police were very sensitive to rigs that
was<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.840> car<00:02:50.020> part<00:02:50.290> like<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.190> think<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.490> over

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
was a car part like and I think I over

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.980 
was a car part like and I think I over
baked<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.030> on<00:02:52.150> there<00:02:52.360> I've<00:02:52.540> got<00:02:52.570> totally

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
caught up in me you know

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.830

gluing the light bottom to the legs you
know<00:02:59.770> and<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.070> think<00:03:00.370> all<00:03:00.460> those<00:03:00.610> things<00:03:00.670> we're

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
know and I think all those things we're

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.510 
know and I think all those things we're
positive<00:03:01.750> but<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.590> ended<00:03:02.800> up<00:03:02.890> chasing<00:03:03.100> my<00:03:03.340> tail

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
positive but I ended up chasing my tail

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.030 
positive but I ended up chasing my tail
I<00:03:03.580> think<00:03:03.880> if<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.030> just<00:03:04.270> stuck<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.600> our<00:03:04.870> fish<00:03:05.170> you

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
I think if I just stuck to our fish you

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.800 
I think if I just stuck to our fish you
know<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.880> just<00:03:07.090> concentrated<00:03:07.630> on<00:03:07.690> the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
know and just concentrated on the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.090 
know and just concentrated on the
watercraft<00:03:08.200> side<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.710> then<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:08.920> think

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
watercraft side of it then I think

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.020 
watercraft side of it then I think
things<00:03:09.250> would<00:03:09.460> have<00:03:09.550> been<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.670> little<00:03:09.910> bit

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
things would have been a little bit

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.780 
things would have been a little bit
different<00:03:10.510> I've<00:03:11.380> had<00:03:11.530> some<00:03:11.680> interesting<00:03:12.160> sort

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
different I've had some interesting sort

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.250 
different I've had some interesting sort

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
the cut there's people on the cons that

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.660 
the cut there's people on the cons that
catch<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.440> biggest<00:03:56.830> fish<00:03:56.980> in<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.220> lake<00:03:57.489> and

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
yet they don't catch many so you know

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.470 
yet they don't catch many so you know
twenty<00:04:00.280> pound<00:04:00.489> thirty<00:04:00.700> pound<00:04:01.000> fish<00:04:01.180> will<00:04:01.360> look

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
twenty pound thirty pound fish will look

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.840 
twenty pound thirty pound fish will look
at<00:04:01.630> someone<00:04:01.930> really<00:04:02.260> sort<00:04:02.770> of<00:04:02.830> obtrusive<00:04:03.550> and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
at someone really sort of obtrusive and

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.220 
at someone really sort of obtrusive and
horrible<00:04:04.300> like<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.840> just<00:04:04.870> won't<00:04:05.110> go

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
horrible like that and just won't go

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.870 
horrible like that and just won't go
near<00:04:05.440> it<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.950> then<00:04:06.160> they<00:04:06.250> get<00:04:06.370> one<00:04:06.430> bite<00:04:06.730> a

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
near it and then they get one bite a

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.910 
near it and then they get one bite a
year<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.120> it's<00:04:07.209> 55<00:04:07.660> pound<00:04:07.989> you<00:04:08.140> know<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:08.440> that

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
year and it's 55 pound you know and that

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.710 
year and it's 55 pound you know and that
makes<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.220> lot<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.370> sense<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.760> me<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:10.090> haven't<00:04:10.630> had

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
makes a lot of sense to me I haven't had

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.330 
makes a lot of sense to me I haven't had
the<00:04:10.780> guts<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:11.020> use<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.500> yet<00:04:11.620> line<00:04:11.830> but<00:04:12.070> I<00:04:12.160> think

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
the guts to use it yet line but I think

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.949 
the guts to use it yet line but I think
it<00:04:12.489> would<00:04:12.580> work<00:04:12.640> definitely<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.480> just<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:13.930> just

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
it would work definitely it just it just

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:25.010 
it would work definitely it just it just
makes<00:04:14.140> sense

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.890 

do<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.680> find<00:04:25.979> that<00:04:26.220> there's<00:04:26.880> sort<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.150> the

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
do you find that there's sort of the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.360 
do you find that there's sort of the
commercialization<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:28.860> carp<00:04:29.099> fishing

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
commercialization of carp fishing

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.950 
commercialization of carp fishing
there's<00:04:29.639> knocks<00:04:29.849> out<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.090> spirit<00:04:30.509> of<00:04:30.599> it<00:04:30.750> I

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
there's knocks out the spirit of it I

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.159 
there's knocks out the spirit of it I
think<00:04:31.380> it's<00:04:31.650> made<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.099> banal<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:33.780> certainly

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
think it's made it banal it certainly

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.350 
think it's made it banal it certainly
turns<00:04:34.440> out<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.770> same<00:04:34.979> thing<00:04:35.370> on<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.030> monthly

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
turns out the same thing on a monthly

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.110 
turns out the same thing on a monthly
basis<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.340> as<00:04:38.340> I<00:04:38.430> say<00:04:38.580> that's<00:04:38.699> fine<00:04:38.940> if<00:04:39.090> you

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
basis and as I say that's fine if you

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.520 
basis and as I say that's fine if you
mean<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.419> that<00:04:39.539> but<00:04:39.720> why<00:04:39.840> not<00:04:39.900> for<00:04:40.229> something

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
mean to that but why not for something

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.110 
mean to that but why not for something
that's<00:04:40.680> going<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.889> sort<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.550> not<00:04:41.729> challenge

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
that's going to sort of not challenge

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.059 
that's going to sort of not challenge
you<00:04:42.240> think<00:04:42.660> in<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.960> search<00:04:43.199> because<00:04:43.470> it's<00:04:43.949> not

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
you think in a search because it's not

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.339 
you think in a search because it's not

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.080 
some of the spirit back into it and the
adventure<00:04:52.319> and<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:53.280> know<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.520> reason<00:04:53.819> why<00:04:53.940> we

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
adventure and you know the reason why we

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.659 
adventure and you know the reason why we
like<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.419> sit<00:04:54.569> under<00:04:54.690> trees<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.319> just<00:04:55.520> be<00:04:56.520> out

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
like to sit under trees and just be out

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.210 
like to sit under trees and just be out
there<00:04:56.699> you<00:04:57.180> know<00:04:57.300> it's<00:04:57.479> not<00:04:57.630> really<00:04:57.870> about

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
there you know it's not really about

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.559 
there you know it's not really about
holding<00:04:59.220> fish<00:04:59.460> or<00:04:59.729> look<00:04:59.940> at<00:05:00.060> this<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.360> know<00:05:00.449> as

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
holding fish or look at this you know as

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:01.790 
holding fish or look at this you know as
element<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:00.960> that<00:05:01.080> because<00:05:01.259> we<00:05:01.349> all<00:05:01.440> like<00:05:01.620> that

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
element of that because we all like that

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.279 
element of that because we all like that
but<00:05:02.060> it's<00:05:03.060> more<00:05:03.300> about<00:05:03.479> sort<00:05:03.810> of<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:04.199> know

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
but it's more about sort of you know

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:05.719 
but it's more about sort of you know
it's<00:05:04.380> a<00:05:04.409> lot<00:05:04.500> of<00:05:04.530> incidental<00:05:04.919> photography<00:05:05.639> in

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
it's a lot of incidental photography in

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.700 
it's a lot of incidental photography in
there<00:05:05.940> like<00:05:06.120> kettles<00:05:06.479> boiling<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:07.199> you<00:05:07.560> know

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
there like kettles boiling and you know

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.339 
there like kettles boiling and you know
rods<00:05:08.039> against<00:05:08.550> iron<00:05:08.759> work<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.349> people

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
rods against iron work and people

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:11.689 
rods against iron work and people
fishing<00:05:10.530> next<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.860> motorways<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.340> things

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
fishing next to motorways and things

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:12.710 
fishing next to motorways and things
like<00:05:11.819> that<00:05:11.880> and<00:05:12.150> it's<00:05:12.270> more<00:05:12.419> about<00:05:12.569> the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
like that and it's more about the

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.330 
like that and it's more about the
stories<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:13.440> heart<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:13.949> and<00:05:14.099> the<00:05:14.159> soul

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
stories and the heart of it and the soul

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.249 
stories and the heart of it and the soul
of<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.669> and<00:05:15.360> I<00:05:15.449> think<00:05:15.509> that's<00:05:15.750> that's

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
of it and I think that's that's

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.830 
of it and I think that's that's
something<00:05:16.530> that's<00:05:16.860> gone<00:05:17.210> it's<00:05:18.210> just<00:05:18.389> that<00:05:18.539> you

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
something that's gone it's just that you

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.860 
something that's gone it's just that you
know<00:05:18.990> it's<00:05:19.169> it's<00:05:19.319> become<00:05:19.770> X<00:05:20.580> Factor<00:05:21.060> and<00:05:21.330> not<00:05:21.630> a

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
know it's it's become X Factor and not a

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.290 
know it's it's become X Factor and not a
variety<00:05:22.229> of<00:05:22.470> core<00:05:22.830> or<00:05:23.039> all<00:05:23.669> different<00:05:23.849> ways<00:05:24.150> of

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
variety of core or all different ways of

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.029 
variety of core or all different ways of
thinking<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:24.720> doing<00:05:24.870> it<00:05:25.139> and<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.710> think<00:05:25.740> that's

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
thinking and doing it and I think that's

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.419 
thinking and doing it and I think that's
for<00:05:26.220> me<00:05:26.310> that's<00:05:26.460> what<00:05:26.699> subsurface<00:05:27.090> is
