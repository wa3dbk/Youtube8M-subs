00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.200
 tell about an interesting purchase 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.099
 this flash drive jetflash 300 80g 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.509
 what is it actually interesting with 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.710
 one side in this flash drive there is 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.170
 trained connector usb 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 on the other side of the connector this year. but for 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.609
 connecting directly to a smartphone what 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.640
 very comfortable and you need to have with you 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.840
 constantly on then cable 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.960
 whip as usual we take and take 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:37.010
 smartphone usually connect to it then 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.200
 cable we connect the usual USB stick 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.719
 we get such an interesting one 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.010
 here's the constructor to connect the usual 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.989
 a flash drive that legs this here 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.300
 it turns out you can turn on Abel 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.039
 so here the flash drive is much more convenient and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.719
 nicer prettier now we try it 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:06.600
 unpack and measure speed 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.240
 check it in pieces not tested and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.060
 Record in Provence on some sort 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.700
 film with 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.250
 then throw this movie on 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.850
 smartphone also try directly 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.189
 video on your smartphone right from this flash drive 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.159
 Here is a comfortable pleasant course of the game 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.060
 the connector is all pretty little 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.009
 even now compare the size and here it is 10 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.450
 ruble coin is a very convenient flash drive 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.560
 it turns out even generally convenient ear 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.250
 there will be her here on the keys 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.700
 dress on nowhere not lost the usual 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.630
 usb and micro usb 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.409
 sell and even try right now 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.409
 paste it 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.560
 so that's all and everything but we have a flash drive 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.899
 please everything works a lot of space not 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.509
 occupies 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.870
 well then let's move on to 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.230
 computer and try on her something 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.080
 throw for 1 measure the speed know her 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:27.519
 connected by the way the flash drive was bought on 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:31.180
 site e2 she 4 worth 1 thousand 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:35.709
 eight hundred rubles is March 13 so what 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.239
 let's connect and let's see what it 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.910
 What is the technical part? 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.750
 these places on quite a bit 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:52.180
 very little that's Well 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:55.019
 go measuring speed well what 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.090
 let's go to testing 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.820
 we will test with black 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.620
 magic drive and test and then I 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.380
 reboot windu and we just 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.609
 classic total commander we jump 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.570
 curved filmets and then his 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:12.510
 read here we start the notepad disk 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.859
 speed test 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.859
 so we have this flash drive selected 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:29.819
 but flash drive transcend and start reading 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.819
 it turns out 13 12 megabytes 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.640
 u read speak read reading 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.640
 own 29 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.800
 Yes, it turns out a record about ten reading 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.800
 about 30 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.510
 up to 10 is obtained for writing and 30 reading 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.150
 roughly now what am I then 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.640
 I will reboot and Windows and we will try 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.639
 throw some movie on this 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.400
 flash drive 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:26.710
 Well, let's check on the speed 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.180
 I have already prepared fernet usually 9 reef on 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:41.070
 16 gigabytes and let's throw you on 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:42.510
 flash drive than getting to write 8 9 9 and 6 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.750
 megabyte 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.610
 10 give as it was originally 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.610
 then it turns out to write 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.450
 so we will not waste time 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.169
 Well, here we are copying the end 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.440
 speed even getting at 10 megabytes a 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:15.509
 11 waves 1 speed 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:22.320
 i think so i'm all bedlam ult oh well 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:33.389
 now let's try to copy 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:41.400
 back we copy back up to how 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:50.550
 talked 30 megabytes 30 megabytes and 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:54.509
 reading is also well so 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:59.699
 it turns out 28 from 28 to 30 megabytes per 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:02.729
 reading well and now in this flash drive now 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.580
 We insert here the smartphone and try 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:09.360
 I'll run it right from the flash drive. 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:15.199
 copy Well, let's try 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.199
 now run it all did 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:32.919
 mishin inclined I want total commander 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:35.280
 got used here we get yes it's flash 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.280
 . 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:55.710
 Everything works fine try now 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:01.920
 copy it this daddy video 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:14.410
 copy in principle even copy 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.840
 It is necessary because on the road here. do not interfere 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:22.230
 will i think so it can be straight if 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:26.820
 watch movies without copying and do not expect 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:29.590
 that with this pattern, I think finished 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:34.450
 subscribe to my channel rate 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:35.440
 if you like and offer some 

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:37.750
 shoot me a video 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.670
 may need some kind of computer 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:45.820
 help any help in technology 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:49.300
 told the body what and how to do well 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.830
 Of course of course in the form of but on this 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.840
 we will continue to channel in the same 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.830
 tempo maybe even in my plans 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.950
 make a video blog 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:01.990
 just shoot 

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.860
 be as they say a mere mortal 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.000
