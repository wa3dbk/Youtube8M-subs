let's<00:00:23.130> start<00:00:23.430> by<00:00:23.520> finding<00:00:23.789> F<00:00:24.240> sharp<00:00:26.060> F<00:00:27.060> sharp

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
let's start by finding F sharp F sharp

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.359 
let's start by finding F sharp F sharp
can<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.369> found<00:00:29.670> by<00:00:30.060> raising<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.869> regular<00:00:31.439> F<00:00:31.650> by<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
can be found by raising a regular F by a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.210 
can be found by raising a regular F by a
half-step<00:00:33.059> which<00:00:33.989> makes<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.410> become<00:00:34.559> F<00:00:34.920> sharp

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
half-step which makes it become F sharp

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.210 
half-step which makes it become F sharp
if<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:36.150> don't<00:00:36.330> know<00:00:36.449> where<00:00:36.600> F<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:38.040> can

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
if you don't know where F is you can

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.189 
if you don't know where F is you can
find<00:00:38.580> it<00:00:38.729> by<00:00:38.879> using<00:00:39.120> them<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.540> musical<00:00:40.049> alphabet

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
find it by using them a musical alphabet

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.969 
find it by using them a musical alphabet

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 
and counting up from C C is our typical

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.340 
and counting up from C C is our typical
starting<00:00:44.670> point<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.239> found<00:00:45.540> to<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> left

starting point and is found to the left
of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.190> grouping<00:00:47.549> of<00:00:47.670> two<00:00:47.909> Black<00:00:48.180> Keys<00:00:48.470> c<00:00:49.470> d<00:00:50.129> e

f<00:00:51.530> there's<00:00:52.530> F<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.430> make<00:00:53.580> it<00:00:53.699> sharp<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.239> raise<00:00:54.449> it

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
f there's F to make it sharp we raise it

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.939 
f there's F to make it sharp we raise it
by<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> half<00:00:55.080> step<00:00:55.110> F<00:00:55.820> sharp<00:00:57.619> now<00:00:58.619> an<00:00:58.769> F<00:00:58.920> sharp

by a half step F sharp now an F sharp
major<00:00:59.400> we<00:00:59.790> have<00:01:00.089> lots<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.110> lots<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.559> sharps<00:01:01.920> so

the chord is going to be sharp which

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.420 
the chord is going to be sharp which
means<00:01:09.690> it'll<00:01:09.870> be<00:01:09.960> raised<00:01:10.290> from<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> original
