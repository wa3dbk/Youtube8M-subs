just<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> motherboard<00:00:27.810> you'll<00:00:27.990> want<00:00:28.140> to

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
just like the motherboard you'll want to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.509 
just like the motherboard you'll want to
be<00:00:28.320> careful<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.039> hands<00:00:29.189> up<00:00:29.340> by<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
be careful with it and hands up by the

be careful with it and hands up by the
shroud<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.060> PCI<00:00:30.420> bracket<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.199> set<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
shroud and PCI bracket so set it on the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.990 
shroud and PCI bracket so set it on the
box<00:00:31.890> before<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.550> installed<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.940> the

box before we get it installed in the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.030 
box before we get it installed in the
case<00:00:33.210> take<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> closer<00:00:34.350> look<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.829> you'll<00:00:34.980> see

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
case take a closer look and you'll see

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.799 
case take a closer look and you'll see
the<00:00:35.219> two<00:00:35.399> fans<00:00:35.640> mounted<00:00:35.850> onto<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> heatsink

the two fans mounted onto the heatsink

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.880 
the two fans mounted onto the heatsink
but<00:00:37.050> beyond<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.710> pretty

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
but beyond that it's a pretty

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.770 
but beyond that it's a pretty
straightforward<00:00:38.160> card<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:39.329> remove<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
straightforward card just remove the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.299 
straightforward card just remove the
plastic<00:00:40.110> protectors<00:00:40.620> over<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> PCI

and<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.379> already<00:00:43.710> come<00:00:44.460> over<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> case

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and it's already come over to the case

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.549 
and it's already come over to the case
and<00:00:45.329> remove<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.750> thumb<00:00:45.930> screw<00:00:46.170> holding<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559

covers<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.039> place<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.640> pop<00:00:47.850> them<00:00:48.000> out

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
covers in place and then pop them out

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.650 
covers in place and then pop them out
the<00:00:48.210> back

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the back

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420

then<00:00:49.050> remove<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> screw<00:00:49.500> above<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.190> pull

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
then remove the screw above it and pull

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.650 
then remove the screw above it and pull
out<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.579> bracket<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.390> room<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
out the bracket so we have room to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.689 
out the bracket so we have room to
install<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> graphics<00:00:52.170> card<00:00:52.590> bring<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> GPU
