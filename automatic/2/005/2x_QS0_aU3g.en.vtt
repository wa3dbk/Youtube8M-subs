00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.050 
one but you know we're all very excited
and<00:03:18.570> no<00:03:18.750> number<00:03:19.019> 51<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:20.040> know<00:03:20.220> she's<00:03:20.549> gone

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
and no number 51 you know she's gone

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.220 
and no number 51 you know she's gone
maybe<00:03:21.359> it's<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.540> good<00:03:21.660> thing<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:21.959> don't<00:03:22.049> know

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
maybe it's a good thing I don't know

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.509 
maybe it's a good thing I don't know
we'll<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:22.590> sort<00:03:22.859> of<00:03:22.950> see<00:03:23.070> what<00:03:23.190> happens<00:03:23.459> but

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
we'll just sort of see what happens but

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.520 
we'll just sort of see what happens but
yeah<00:03:23.959> everything<00:03:24.959> happened<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.290> light

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
yeah everything happened so light

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.380 
yeah everything happened so light
and<00:03:26.620> decisions<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.310> know<00:03:27.520> we've<00:03:27.970> made<00:03:28.180> and

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
and decisions you know we've made and

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.490 
and decisions you know we've made and
obviously<00:03:28.600> that<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.900> number<00:03:29.110> goes<00:03:29.230> with<00:03:29.410> the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
obviously that the number goes with the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.040 
obviously that the number goes with the
franchise<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.760> it's<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.480> pretty<00:03:31.630> iconic

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
franchise and and it's a pretty iconic

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.530 
franchise and and it's a pretty iconic
number<00:03:32.319> to<00:03:33.040> be<00:03:33.130> racing<00:03:33.459> under<00:03:33.670> but<00:03:33.819> you<00:03:34.420> know

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
number to be racing under but you know

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.850 
number to be racing under but you know
decisions<00:03:34.930> had<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.200> be<00:03:35.260> made<00:03:35.350> pretty<00:03:35.650> quick

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
decisions had to be made pretty quick

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.370 
decisions had to be made pretty quick
and<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.970> think<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:37.630> probably<00:03:38.200> wasn't

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
and and I think it probably wasn't

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.840 
and and I think it probably wasn't
really<00:03:38.590> too<00:03:38.709> much<00:03:38.740> ministry<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.280> get<00:03:39.430> get<00:03:39.760> the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
really too much ministry to get get the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.120 
really too much ministry to get get the
number<00:03:40.120> back<00:03:40.270> and<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.810> think<00:03:41.319> Paul's<00:03:41.680> using<00:03:42.040> it

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
number back and I think Paul's using it

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.760 
number back and I think Paul's using it
but<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:43.270> think<00:03:43.690> just<00:03:44.020> timewise<00:03:44.230> we<00:03:44.620> just

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
but I think just timewise we just

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.900 
but I think just timewise we just
weren't<00:03:44.890> able<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.160> one<00:03:45.520> of<00:03:45.580> those<00:03:45.700> things<00:03:45.790> that

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
weren't able to one of those things that

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.390 
weren't able to one of those things that
couldn't<00:03:46.180> be<00:03:46.239> done
