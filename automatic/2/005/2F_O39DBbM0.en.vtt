3 and for the most part I would agree

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.209 
3 and for the most part I would agree
with<00:00:35.850> maybe<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> exception<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:37.260> operation

relationship with operation Metro
sometimes<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.059> awesome<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.660> other

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
sometimes it's just awesome and other

which<00:01:10.020> shouldn't<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.350> too<00:01:10.409> hard<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.979> should

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
which shouldn't be too hard that should

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.010 
which shouldn't be too hard that should
be<00:01:11.280> fairly<00:01:11.760> straightforward<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> actual

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
be fairly straightforward but the actual

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.499 
be fairly straightforward but the actual
challenging<00:01:13.680> part<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.700> five<00:01:15.000> kills<00:01:15.299> in

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
challenging part is to get five kills in

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.149 
challenging part is to get five kills in
a<00:01:15.600> round<00:01:15.840> from<00:01:16.020> either<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> operation

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
a round from either the operation

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.640 
a round from either the operation
firestorm<00:01:17.430> tower<00:01:18.000> or<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.869> Caspian<00:01:19.470> Border

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
firestorm tower or the Caspian Border

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.770 
firestorm tower or the Caspian Border
tower<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> did<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.240> operation

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
tower now I did this on operation

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.330 
tower now I did this on operation
firestorm<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> can't<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:22.920> say<00:01:23.130> how

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
firestorm so I can't really say how

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
firestorm so I can't really say how
difficult<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:24.090> easy<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.930> do<00:01:25.290> on

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
difficult or easy it was to do on

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200 
difficult or easy it was to do on
caspian<00:01:26.070> border<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.670> did<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
caspian border as I did it on a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.420 
caspian border as I did it on a
firestorm<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.290> essentially<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
firestorm so essentially there is a

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.090 
firestorm so essentially there is a
large<00:01:29.820> tower<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.479> operation<00:01:31.409> firestorm<00:01:31.680> if

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
large tower on operation firestorm if

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.920 
large tower on operation firestorm if
you<00:01:32.220> don't<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.479> look<00:01:33.720> up

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
you don't know what it is just look up

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.990 
you don't know what it is just look up
and<00:01:34.140> go<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.590> tallest<00:01:35.009> tower<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.820> can

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and go to the tallest tower that you can

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.819 
and go to the tallest tower that you can
see<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.509> basically<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.140> tower<00:01:37.320> has<00:01:37.439> three

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
see but basically the tower has three

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.800 
see but basically the tower has three
tiers<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.700> need<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.060> standing<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.600> any

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
tiers and you need to be standing on any

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
tiers and you need to be standing on any
one<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.079> those<00:01:40.380> three<00:01:40.710> tiers<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.340> need<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
one of those three tiers and you need to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.969 
one of those three tiers and you need to
get<00:01:41.759> five<00:01:42.030> kills<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.600> round<00:01:42.810> from<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
get five kills in a round from one of

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.469 
get five kills in a round from one of
those<00:01:44.130> levels<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:45.119> need<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.360> use<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
those levels and you don't need to use a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.569 
those levels and you don't need to use a
sniper<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:46.680> any<00:01:46.890> method<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.310> choose

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
sniper you can use any method you choose

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.520 
sniper you can use any method you choose
so<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.909> found<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.270> sniper<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.840> kind<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
so I found the sniper to be kind of the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.050 
so I found the sniper to be kind of the
easiest<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:50.490> need<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> in

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
easiest and you don't need to do it in

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.940 
easiest and you don't need to do it in
one<00:01:51.240> life<00:01:51.479> or<00:01:51.689> anything<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.470> one<00:01:52.710> round

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
one life or anything just in one round

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.710 
one life or anything just in one round
so<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.610> into<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.880> game<00:01:54.090> without<00:01:54.299> our<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
so if you go into a game without our a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600 
so if you go into a game without our a
thousand<00:01:55.200> tickets<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.950> should<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.399> able<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
thousand tickets you should be able to

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.060 
thousand tickets you should be able to
manage<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.450> relative<00:01:57.899> ease<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
manage it with relative ease so it was a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
manage it with relative ease so it was a
little<00:01:59.340> frustrating<00:01:59.610> getting<00:02:00.600> sniped<00:02:00.840> from

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
little frustrating getting sniped from

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.870 
little frustrating getting sniped from
there<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.860> are<00:02:02.009> pretty<00:02:02.310> much<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.670> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
there because you are pretty much just a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.789 
there because you are pretty much just a
beacon<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> ladders<00:02:04.350> you're

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
beacon and going up the ladders you're

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.620 
beacon and going up the ladders you're
just<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.219> huge<00:02:05.549> target<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.240> guy<00:02:06.450> right

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
just a huge target like that guy right

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.210 
just a huge target like that guy right
there<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.990> happened<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> me<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.860> many<00:02:08.099> times

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
there that happened to me so many times

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.850 
there that happened to me so many times
but<00:02:08.729> after<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> while<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.479> did<00:02:10.050> finally<00:02:10.530> get<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
but after a while I did finally get the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.890

GOL<00:02:11.039> magnum<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.670> will<00:02:11.819> say<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.660> worth

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
GOL magnum and I will say it is so worth

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
are the aspects with the GOL magnum

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.570 
are the aspects with the GOL magnum
sniper<00:02:18.990> rifle<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:19.950> stands<00:02:20.220> out<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
sniper rifle that really stands out to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.760 
sniper rifle that really stands out to
me<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.180> performance<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.020> close<00:02:22.320> quarters

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
me is this performance in close quarters

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.680 
me is this performance in close quarters
I<00:02:22.920> am<00:02:23.010> definitely<00:02:23.250> one<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.790> prefers<00:02:24.210> to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
I am definitely one that prefers to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.270 
I am definitely one that prefers to
snipe<00:02:24.960> up<00:02:25.170> close<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.740> don't<00:02:25.980> really<00:02:26.190> like

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
snipe up close I don't really like

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.640 
snipe up close I don't really like
anything<00:02:26.790> above<00:02:27.060> 200<00:02:27.630> meters<00:02:27.930> as<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.230> find<00:02:28.530> that

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
anything above 200 meters as I find that

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.500 
anything above 200 meters as I find that
the<00:02:28.800> gameplay<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.430> gets<00:02:29.610> really<00:02:30.210> dry<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
the gameplay just gets really dry and

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.930 
the gameplay just gets really dry and
dull<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.920> downright<00:02:32.100> boring<00:02:32.640> because

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
dull and just downright boring because

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.580 
dull and just downright boring because
you're<00:02:33.240> just<00:02:33.330> camping<00:02:33.780> there<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.170> trying<00:02:34.440> to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
you're just camping there and trying to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.260 
you're just camping there and trying to
kill<00:02:34.770> people<00:02:34.920> from<00:02:35.370> like<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.610> million<00:02:36.060> miles

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
kill people from like a million miles

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.450 
kill people from like a million miles
away<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.620> exciting<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.310> me<00:02:38.430> I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
away and it's just not exciting to me I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.220 
away and it's just not exciting to me I
really<00:02:38.820> like<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.180> up<00:02:39.330> close<00:02:39.360> running

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
really like to be up close running

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.210 
really like to be up close running
around<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.590> guess<00:02:40.650> more<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.040> an<00:02:41.100> aggressive

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
around I guess more of an aggressive

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.670 
around I guess more of an aggressive
recon<00:02:41.790> style<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.510> love<00:02:42.840> killing<00:02:43.110> people<00:02:43.470> just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
recon style I love killing people just

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.650 
recon style I love killing people just
point-blank<00:02:44.040> range<00:02:44.370> quick<00:02:44.760> scopes<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:45.300> you

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
point-blank range quick scopes if you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.150 
point-blank range quick scopes if you
want<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.900> call<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.200> no<00:02:46.590> scopes<00:02:46.920> when

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
want to call it that no scopes when

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.950 
want to call it that no scopes when
you're<00:02:47.280> lucky<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:48.270> find<00:02:48.450> that's<00:02:48.600> really

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
you're lucky I just find that's really

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.620 
you're lucky I just find that's really
how<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.230> enjoy<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:50.010> play<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.670> Recon<00:02:51.060> class<00:02:51.360> when

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
how I enjoy to play the Recon class when

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.660 
how I enjoy to play the Recon class when
I<00:02:51.660> am<00:02:51.810> using<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.170> bolt-action<00:02:52.620> sniper<00:02:52.890> rifle

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
I am using a bolt-action sniper rifle

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.430 
I am using a bolt-action sniper rifle
and<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.880> GOL<00:02:54.210> magnum<00:02:54.240> really<00:02:54.900> fits<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.410> bill

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and the GOL magnum really fits that bill

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.860 
and the GOL magnum really fits that bill
quite<00:02:56.100> well<00:02:56.370> mostly<00:02:56.850> due<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.150> its<00:02:57.660> rate<00:02:57.840> of

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
quite well mostly due to its rate of

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.660 
quite well mostly due to its rate of
fire<00:02:58.230> as<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.530> comes<00:02:58.740> in<00:02:58.920> at<00:02:59.040> sixty<00:02:59.520> three

fire as it comes in at sixty three

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.340 
fire as it comes in at sixty three
rounds<00:03:00.000> per<00:03:00.120> minute<00:03:00.240> which<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.900> one<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
rounds per minute which is one of the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.020 
rounds per minute which is one of the
highest<00:03:01.620> rates<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.190> fire<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:02.850> get

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
highest rates of fire that you can get

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.060 
highest rates of fire that you can get
on<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.270> bolt-action<00:03:03.990> sniper<00:03:04.230> rifle<00:03:04.920> let's

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
on a bolt-action sniper rifle let's

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.850 
on a bolt-action sniper rifle let's
compare<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.640> say<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.060> srr<00:03:06.630> 61<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.350> very

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
compare that to say the srr 61 a very

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.680 
compare that to say the srr 61 a very
popular<00:03:08.100> bolt<00:03:08.520> action<00:03:08.880> sniper<00:03:09.000> rifle<00:03:09.540> which

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
popular bolt action sniper rifle which

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.680 
popular bolt action sniper rifle which
only<00:03:09.900> fires<00:03:10.200> at<00:03:10.470> 40<00:03:11.160> rounds<00:03:11.370> per<00:03:11.790> minute<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.360> as

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
only fires at 40 rounds per minute so as

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.360 
only fires at 40 rounds per minute so as
you<00:03:12.960> can<00:03:13.110> tell<00:03:13.170> that's<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.710> significant

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
you can tell that's a significant

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.670 
you can tell that's a significant
upgrade<00:03:14.490> so<00:03:15.180> firing<00:03:15.600> very<00:03:15.840> quickly<00:03:16.140> up<00:03:16.410> close

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
upgrade so firing very quickly up close

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.530 
upgrade so firing very quickly up close
is<00:03:16.890> very<00:03:17.160> important<00:03:17.820> now<00:03:18.060> one<00:03:18.300> of<00:03:18.330> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
is very important now one of the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.960 
is very important now one of the
downsides<00:03:18.840> about<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.860> GOL<00:03:20.040> magnum<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.520> you

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
downsides about the GOL magnum is you

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.360 
downsides about the GOL magnum is you
only<00:03:21.150> have<00:03:21.480> six<00:03:21.870> bullets<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.800> chamber<00:03:23.010> at

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
only have six bullets in the chamber at

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.910 
only have six bullets in the chamber at
a<00:03:23.430> time<00:03:24.000> which<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.480> little<00:03:24.990> annoying<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.890> I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
a time which is a little annoying but I

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.980 
a time which is a little annoying but I
mean<00:03:26.160> usually<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.760> don't<00:03:27.060> need<00:03:27.210> to<00:03:27.330> fire<00:03:27.540> six

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
mean usually I don't need to fire six

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.080 
mean usually I don't need to fire six
shots<00:03:28.080> in<00:03:28.500> quick<00:03:28.650> succession<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.730> as<00:03:29.880> long<00:03:30.030> as

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
shots in quick succession so as long as

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.670 
shots in quick succession so as long as
you're<00:03:30.240> paying<00:03:30.510> attention<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.200> reloading

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
you're paying attention and reloading

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.050 
you're paying attention and reloading
when<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:31.890> need<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.610> shouldn't<00:03:32.940> really

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
when you need to you shouldn't really

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.940 
when you need to you shouldn't really
find<00:03:33.360> yourself<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.930> situation<00:03:34.170> where<00:03:34.860> you

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
find yourself in a situation where you

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.680 
find yourself in a situation where you
run<00:03:35.130> out<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.310> bullets<00:03:35.490> no<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.210> is<00:03:36.240> certainly

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
run out of bullets no that is certainly

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.690 
run out of bullets no that is certainly
not<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.080> say<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.650> GOL<00:03:37.860> magnum<00:03:37.890> cannot<00:03:38.580> be

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
not to say that the GOL magnum cannot be

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.180 
not to say that the GOL magnum cannot be
used<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.120> longer<00:03:39.540> range<00:03:39.750> situations<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.860> wasn't

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
used in longer range situations I wasn't

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.950 
used in longer range situations I wasn't
having<00:03:41.310> any<00:03:41.550> problem<00:03:42.120> killing<00:03:42.330> people<00:03:42.720> at

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
having any problem killing people at

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.230 
having any problem killing people at
around<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.830> don't<00:03:43.980> know<00:03:44.070> 200<00:03:44.340> meters<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.910> didn't

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
around I don't know 200 meters I didn't

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.520 
around I don't know 200 meters I didn't
really<00:03:45.360> go<00:03:45.510> too<00:03:45.570> much<00:03:45.870> further<00:03:46.110> than<00:03:46.290> that

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
really go too much further than that

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.380 
really go too much further than that
partially<00:03:47.040> because<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.340> can't<00:03:47.670> hit<00:03:47.850> people<00:03:47.880> I

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
partially because I can't hit people I

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.420 
partially because I can't hit people I
have<00:03:48.810> ranged<00:03:49.230> further<00:03:49.470> than<00:03:49.710> that<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.100> also

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
have ranged further than that and also

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.980 
have ranged further than that and also
just<00:03:50.580> partially<00:03:51.060> because<00:03:51.210> I<00:03:51.390> don't<00:03:51.570> even<00:03:51.660> try

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
just partially because I don't even try

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.230 
just partially because I don't even try
most<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.530> time<00:03:52.770> but<00:03:52.980> overall<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.940> works

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
most of the time but overall it works

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.600 
most of the time but overall it works
very<00:03:54.570> well<00:03:54.660> same<00:03:55.140> damage<00:03:55.380> model<00:03:55.800> as<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:55.950> srr

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
very well same damage model as the srr

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.150 
very well same damage model as the srr
61<00:03:57.120> works<00:03:57.810> very<00:03:58.080> well<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.470> bullet<00:03:58.650> drop<00:03:58.950> is<00:03:59.130> a

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
61 works very well the bullet drop is a

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.430 
61 works very well the bullet drop is a
little<00:03:59.550> more<00:03:59.730> than<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.090> srr<00:04:00.600> 6<00:04:00.900> 1<00:04:01.110> i'm<00:04:01.230> just

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
little more than the srr 6 1 i'm just

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.050 
little more than the srr 6 1 i'm just
using<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:01.980> compare<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.520> because<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.820> lot

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
using that to compare to because a lot

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.000 
using that to compare to because a lot
of<00:04:03.090> people<00:04:03.330> use<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:03.960> know<00:04:04.410> how<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.740> plays

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
of people use it and know how it plays

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.890 
of people use it and know how it plays
but<00:04:05.280> overall<00:04:05.580> nothing<00:04:06.390> really<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.750> worry

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
but overall nothing really to worry

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.780 
but overall nothing really to worry
about<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.380> as<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> long-range<00:04:08.130> bolt<00:04:08.460> action

sniper rifle the GOL magnum still works
quite<00:04:11.100> well<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.700> only<00:04:11.880> downside<00:04:12.120> again<00:04:12.660> being

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
quite well the only downside again being

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.320 
quite well the only downside again being
that<00:04:13.290> magazine<00:04:13.680> size<00:04:14.040> of<00:04:14.310> only<00:04:14.459> six<00:04:14.820> rounds

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
that magazine size of only six rounds

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.910 
that magazine size of only six rounds
but<00:04:15.600> overall<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.049> was<00:04:16.260> having<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.560> lot<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:16.799> fun

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
but overall I was having a lot of fun

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.370 
but overall I was having a lot of fun
with<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:17.730> GOL<00:04:17.940> magnum<00:04:17.970> sniper<00:04:18.480> rifle<00:04:19.080> one<00:04:19.290> of

with the GOL magnum sniper rifle one of

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.720 
with the GOL magnum sniper rifle one of
the<00:04:19.440> things<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.830> was<00:04:20.010> trying<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.310> do<00:04:20.489> was

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
the things that I was trying to do was

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.060 
the things that I was trying to do was
go<00:04:21.030> for<00:04:21.359> some<00:04:21.570> really<00:04:21.930> cool<00:04:22.140> no<00:04:22.470> scope<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:23.010> I

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
go for some really cool no scope so I

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.860 
go for some really cool no scope so I
put<00:04:23.280> on<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.490> laser<00:04:23.700> sight<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.510> was<00:04:24.630> trying

put on the laser sight and I was trying

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.510 
put on the laser sight and I was trying
to<00:04:24.930> get<00:04:25.020> some<00:04:25.229> no<00:04:25.380> scopes<00:04:25.710> which<00:04:25.979> do<00:04:26.250> have<00:04:26.490> a

to get some no scopes which do have a
lot

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
lot

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.670 
lot
of<00:04:26.940> luck<00:04:27.240> involved<00:04:27.870> with<00:04:28.170> them<00:04:28.350> but<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.530> was

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
of luck involved with them but I was

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.260 
of luck involved with them but I was
talking<00:04:29.010> to<00:04:29.040> glassy<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.550> he<00:04:29.820> was<00:04:29.940> saying<00:04:30.210> that

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
talking to glassy and he was saying that

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.210 
talking to glassy and he was saying that
if<00:04:30.540> you<00:04:30.810> just<00:04:30.990> stop<00:04:31.260> moving<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:31.710> just<00:04:31.800> stand

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
if you just stop moving and just stand

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.310 
if you just stop moving and just stand
still<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.790> works<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.450> lot<00:04:33.720> better<00:04:33.780> as<00:04:34.140> your

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
still it works a lot better as your

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.020 
still it works a lot better as your
spread<00:04:34.620> will<00:04:34.770> be<00:04:34.890> a<00:04:34.920> little<00:04:35.340> bit<00:04:35.580> tighter<00:04:35.820> and

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
spread will be a little bit tighter and

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.850 
spread will be a little bit tighter and
one<00:04:36.180> of<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.330> things<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:36.660> did<00:04:36.720> if<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:37.170> could<00:04:37.410> was

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
one of the things I did if I could was

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.560 
one of the things I did if I could was
out<00:04:38.010> crouched<00:04:38.340> down<00:04:38.370> because<00:04:39.000> your<00:04:39.150> spread<00:04:39.420> is

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
out crouched down because your spread is

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.570 
out crouched down because your spread is
a<00:04:39.600> little<00:04:39.960> bit<00:04:40.080> tighter<00:04:40.260> if<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.950> are<00:04:41.160> crouched

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
a little bit tighter if you are crouched

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.910 
a little bit tighter if you are crouched
and<00:04:41.850> again<00:04:42.240> either<00:04:42.720> way<00:04:43.110> there's<00:04:43.350> still<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.590> lot

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
and again either way there's still a lot

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.830 
and again either way there's still a lot
of<00:04:43.950> luck<00:04:44.340> involved<00:04:44.760> with<00:04:45.150> any<00:04:45.360> kind<00:04:45.540> of<00:04:45.660> no

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
of luck involved with any kind of no

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.540 
of luck involved with any kind of no
scoping<00:04:46.260> in<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.470> game<00:04:46.650> but<00:04:47.160> they<00:04:47.310> do<00:04:47.370> look

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
scoping in the game but they do look

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.280 
scoping in the game but they do look
pretty<00:04:48.000> cool<00:04:48.300> when<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:48.630> pull<00:04:48.840> them<00:04:48.990> off<00:04:49.140> and

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
pretty cool when you pull them off and

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.020 
pretty cool when you pull them off and
they<00:04:49.410> are<00:04:49.500> really<00:04:49.650> satisfying<00:04:50.370> when<00:04:50.820> they<00:04:50.970> do

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
they are really satisfying when they do

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.240 
they are really satisfying when they do
work<00:04:51.420> so<00:04:51.840> is<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.110> worth<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.620> go<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:52.920> the

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
work so is it worth it to go to the

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.830 
work so is it worth it to go to the
bother<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.700> unlocking<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.660> GOL<00:04:54.810> magnum
