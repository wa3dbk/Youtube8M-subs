though<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> dollar<00:01:52.290> store<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.799> only<00:01:53.040> had

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
though the dollar store I think only had

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.490 
though the dollar store I think only had
four<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.520> them<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:54.990> no

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
four of them and I think actually no

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.469 
four of them and I think actually no
they<00:01:55.680> look<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.310> they<00:01:56.579> had<00:01:56.820> most<00:01:57.180> of

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
they look at it I think they had most of

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.170 
they look at it I think they had most of
these<00:01:57.600> ones<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:58.259> which<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.979> guess<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> zoo

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
these ones here which I guess is the zoo

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.270 
these ones here which I guess is the zoo
Xia<00:02:00.420> collection<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.829> probably<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
Xia collection which are probably just

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950 
Xia collection which are probably just
see<00:02:02.369> regular<00:02:02.790> Zoobles<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.479> then<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:03.750> just

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
see regular Zoobles and then they just

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.980 
see regular Zoobles and then they just
colored<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.619> slightly

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
colored them slightly

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.469 
colored them slightly
there's<00:02:06.990> panaderia<00:02:07.439> there<00:02:08.030> but<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.239> see

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
little tree stump there I take the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.600 
little tree stump there I take the
zoobel<00:03:37.269> out<00:03:37.390> just<00:03:38.110> put<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.350> right<00:03:38.380> there<00:03:38.709> close

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
zoobel out just put it right there close

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.800 
zoobel out just put it right there close
up<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.880> stump<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:41.560> put<00:03:41.830> it<00:03:41.920> there<00:03:42.690> what<00:03:43.690> you

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
up the stump and put it there what you

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.150 
up the stump and put it there what you
have<00:03:44.019> is<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:44.709> self-contained<00:03:45.580> little<00:03:46.300> ball<00:03:46.630> I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
have is a self-contained little ball I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.100 
have is a self-contained little ball I
guess<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.850> equivalent<00:03:49.269> of<00:03:49.690> these<00:03:49.840> would

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
guess the the equivalent of these would

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.180 
guess the the equivalent of these would
be<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.590> back<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.280> Bakugan<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:52.739> think<00:03:53.739> Bakugan

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
be the back of Bakugan I think Bakugan

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.350 
be the back of Bakugan I think Bakugan
are<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.400> ones<00:03:54.550> that<00:03:54.700> have<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.880> balls<00:03:55.090> that

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
are the ones that have the balls that

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.970 
are the ones that have the balls that
that<00:03:55.570> open<00:03:55.930> up<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:56.440> do<00:03:56.590> different<00:03:56.950> things

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
that open up and do different things

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.580 
that open up and do different things
this<00:03:57.700> would<00:03:58.090> be<00:03:58.150> just<00:03:58.300> a<00:03:58.510> girl<00:03:58.840> version<00:03:59.230> of

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
this would be just a girl version of

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.380 
this would be just a girl version of
this<00:03:59.800> you<00:04:00.459> can<00:04:00.550> see<00:04:00.670> that<00:04:00.820> there's<00:04:01.060> a<00:04:01.120> little

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.210 
way to actually get these zoobel open I
guess<00:05:37.140> your<00:05:37.380> obviously<00:05:37.710> your<00:05:37.830> best<00:05:38.010> bet<00:05:38.190> is

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220

keep<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.880> stand<00:05:39.570> and<00:05:39.870> then<00:05:40.140> you<00:05:40.169> will<00:05:40.380> always

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
keep the stand and then you will always

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.640 
keep the stand and then you will always
have<00:05:40.890> an<00:05:40.980> opportunity<00:05:42.140> don't<00:05:43.140> have<00:05:43.500> your

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650
