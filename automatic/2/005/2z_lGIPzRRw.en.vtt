00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.230
 mythical hands ok well so that we do not 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.720

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.900
 first person we see good this 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.209

 that I see myself visible allow this guy 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.230
 He does not see me at all because more than anything 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.080
 because as it is called, I continue in bathrooms 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.750
 Even if you do not believe it, let's put 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.090
 little things here I want to put this for 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.560
 here to see if one realizes but with 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.630
 this here to see to see 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.489
 quiet quiet men like that already 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.650
 I was understanding up to see what 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.230
 happens what goes on here says that wave that 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.050
 one that is going through here people 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.910
 let's try to put this here 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.140
 is here to see if you do not realize 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.140
 come on let's go a little 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.950
 very tired the sport the only thing that 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.690
 I want it to appear is that this was 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.850
 died for my code because if they do not go 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.810
 to realize that yes but I do not think that 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.810
 nothing appeared 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.480
 not only does he say he fell out of the world like that 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.950
 I think it's going to be pretty good 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.260
 enough and we're going to put this here 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.970
 it is so that this here all go to 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.020
 die this way let's put this 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.670
 here 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.480
 ask in huanta fo what is happening 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.700

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.720
 every time he walks with this, not what 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.220
 with this we're going to wait until we're going to 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.500
 look for the other victim because this guy 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.990
 as I wanted to already forgot what is 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.360

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:17.160
 here and let's put this here ok to 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.510
 see if you do not smell it and there it is 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.920

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.630
 to say what's up with this thing that's 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.580
 going through here to get out of wave 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.920
 first of all not first and after that 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.720
