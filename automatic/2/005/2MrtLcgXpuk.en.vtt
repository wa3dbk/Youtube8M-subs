have<00:03:36.459> not<00:03:36.669> bad<00:03:36.879> potential<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.690> really

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
have not bad potential and really

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.780 
have not bad potential and really
turning<00:03:38.590> if<00:03:38.829> you<00:03:39.010> play<00:03:39.220> them<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.489> lot<00:03:39.519> that's

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
turning if you play them a lot that's

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.180 
turning if you play them a lot that's
really<00:03:40.180> one<00:03:40.329> thing<00:03:40.569> I<00:03:40.840> plays<00:03:41.530> with<00:03:41.769> not<00:03:41.980> bad

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
really one thing I plays with not bad

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.220 
really one thing I plays with not bad
potential<00:03:42.760> like<00:03:42.940> maybe<00:03:43.329> in<00:03:43.510> between<00:03:43.599> 80<00:03:44.079> and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
potential like maybe in between 80 and

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.979 
potential like maybe in between 80 and
82<00:03:44.680> or<00:03:45.160> maybe<00:03:45.519> 83<00:03:45.879> 84<00:03:46.449> you<00:03:46.599> don't<00:03:46.780> think

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
82 or maybe 83 84 you don't think

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.449 
82 or maybe 83 84 you don't think
they're<00:03:47.109> going<00:03:47.199> to<00:03:47.260> be<00:03:47.349> too<00:03:47.560> good<00:03:47.769> but<00:03:48.190> if<00:03:48.340> you

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
they're going to be too good but if you

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.979 
they're going to be too good but if you
play<00:03:48.699> them<00:03:48.940> more<00:03:49.180> than<00:03:49.359> average<00:03:49.660> like<00:03:49.870> I

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
play them more than average like I

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.740 
play them more than average like I
mentioned<00:03:50.230> they<00:03:50.889> become<00:03:51.250> maybe<00:03:51.699> a<00:03:52.000> potential

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
mentioned they become maybe a potential

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.140 
mentioned they become maybe a potential
into<00:03:52.959> 86<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.769> plus<00:03:54.099> just<00:03:54.430> depending<00:03:54.910> on<00:03:54.910> their

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
into 86 and plus just depending on their

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.360 
into 86 and plus just depending on their
performances<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:55.959> I've<00:03:56.319> noticed<00:03:56.799> especially

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
performances and I've noticed especially

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.970 
performances and I've noticed especially
for<00:03:58.060> my<00:03:58.180> career's<00:03:58.599> if<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.319> players<00:03:59.530> are<00:03:59.769> good

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
for my career's if the players are good

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.069 
for my career's if the players are good
good<00:04:00.370> form<00:04:00.609> getting<00:04:00.970> good<00:04:01.150> ratings<00:04:01.359> they

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
good form getting good ratings they

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.960 
good form getting good ratings they
really<00:04:02.440> improve<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.919> lot<00:04:03.069> it<00:04:03.519> doesn't<00:04:03.940> even

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
really improve a lot it doesn't even

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.729 
really improve a lot it doesn't even
matter<00:04:04.239> what<00:04:04.480> age<00:04:04.629> they<00:04:04.870> are<00:04:04.900> if<00:04:05.199> they're<00:04:05.560> even

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
matter what age they are if they're even

over<00:04:06.099> thirty<00:04:06.340> or<00:04:06.519> thirty<00:04:06.909> not<00:04:07.209> if<00:04:07.359> when<00:04:07.659> they

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
over thirty or thirty not if when they

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.680 
over thirty or thirty not if when they
get<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.079> really<00:04:08.260> /<00:04:08.590> 31<00:04:08.949> 32<00:04:09.940> then<00:04:10.299> they<00:04:10.449> start

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
get to really / 31 32 then they start

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.020 
get to really / 31 32 then they start
decreasing<00:04:10.989> but<00:04:11.650> even<00:04:11.949> older<00:04:12.220> players<00:04:12.459> are<00:04:12.639> 28

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
decreasing but even older players are 28

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.770 
decreasing but even older players are 28
29<00:04:13.389> if<00:04:13.870> they<00:04:14.739> play<00:04:14.949> well<00:04:15.220> if<00:04:15.549> they've<00:04:16.090> even

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
29 if they play well if they've even

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.270 
29 if they play well if they've even
reach<00:04:16.959> their<00:04:17.229> potential<00:04:17.530> if<00:04:17.859> they're<00:04:18.039> playing

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
reach their potential if they're playing

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.300 
reach their potential if they're playing
well<00:04:18.430> they<00:04:19.060> can<00:04:19.239> still<00:04:19.449> increase<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.310> some

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
well they can still increase so some

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.700 
well they can still increase so some
people<00:04:21.609> don't<00:04:21.820> know<00:04:21.940> that<00:04:22.080> extent<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.289> how

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
people don't know that extent of how

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.620 
people don't know that extent of how
potential<00:04:24.400> works<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.849> that's<00:04:25.000> what<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.270> sort

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
potential works and that's what I sort

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.300 
potential works and that's what I sort
of<00:04:25.750> want<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.380> show<00:04:26.530> in<00:04:26.650> this<00:04:26.770> series

liverpool<00:07:11.170> is<00:07:11.290> like<00:07:11.440> a<00:07:11.470> mid-table<00:07:11.890> team<00:07:12.280> now

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
liverpool is like a mid-table team now

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.990 
liverpool is like a mid-table team now
so<00:07:13.140> but<00:07:14.140> like<00:07:14.290> I<00:07:14.320> said<00:07:14.470> my<00:07:14.890> really<00:07:15.460> main<00:07:15.640> reason

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
so but like I said my really main reason

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.610 
so but like I said my really main reason
for<00:07:16.030> this<00:07:16.240> series<00:07:16.510> to<00:07:16.780> show<00:07:16.990> you<00:07:17.050> how<00:07:17.260> you<00:07:17.320> can

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
for this series to show you how you can

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.550 
for this series to show you how you can
improve<00:07:17.920> players<00:07:18.310> to<00:07:18.820> basically<00:07:19.720> reach<00:07:20.080> above

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
improve players to basically reach above

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.440 
improve players to basically reach above
their<00:07:20.800> potential<00:07:21.370> originally<00:07:22.090> I<00:07:22.120> was<00:07:22.360> going

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.450 
their potential originally I was going

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.540 
their potential originally I was going
to<00:07:22.630> start<00:07:22.870> with<00:07:22.990> a<00:07:23.050> lower<00:07:23.350> league<00:07:23.590> team<00:07:23.920> but<00:07:24.400> it

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
to start with a lower league team but it

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.490 
to start with a lower league team but it
will<00:07:24.760> be<00:07:24.910> harder<00:07:25.300> i<00:07:25.330> just<00:07:25.660> realized<00:07:26.110> before<00:07:26.290> i

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:26.500 
will be harder i just realized before i

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.410 
will be harder i just realized before i
started<00:07:27.010> it<00:07:27.190> they're<00:07:27.880> not<00:07:28.000> going<00:07:28.180> to<00:07:28.300> have

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.420 
started it they're not going to have

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.810 
started it they're not going to have
enough<00:07:28.450> money<00:07:28.930> to<00:07:29.200> buy<00:07:29.350> the<00:07:29.410> Scout<00:07:29.890> so<00:07:30.190> how<00:07:30.370> am

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:30.820 
enough money to buy the Scout so how am

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.670 
enough money to buy the Scout so how am
I<00:07:30.910> going<00:07:31.060> to<00:07:31.150> get<00:07:31.240> a<00:07:31.300> scouted<00:07:31.750> players<00:07:32.020> when

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
I going to get a scouted players when

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.500 
I going to get a scouted players when
they<00:07:32.710> don't<00:07:32.980> have<00:07:33.100> so<00:07:33.280> much<00:07:33.430> money<00:07:33.670> but<00:07:34.450> I

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.510 
they don't have so much money but I

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.090 
they don't have so much money but I
could<00:07:34.930> potentially<00:07:35.590> start<00:07:35.860> it<00:07:35.980> with<00:07:36.070> a

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.100 
could potentially start it with a

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.860 
could potentially start it with a
championship<00:07:36.850> team<00:07:36.880> that<00:07:37.390> could<00:07:37.570> be<00:07:37.660> good

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
championship team that could be good

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.750 
championship team that could be good
because<00:07:38.350> obviously<00:07:38.650> they<00:07:39.100> are<00:07:39.280> lower<00:07:39.520> they're

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:39.760 
because obviously they are lower they're

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.250 
because obviously they are lower they're
not<00:07:39.880> like<00:07:40.030> Liverpool<00:07:40.540> and<00:07:40.900> when<00:07:41.050> you<00:07:41.140> be<00:07:41.230> a

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:41.260 
not like Liverpool and when you be a

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.690 
not like Liverpool and when you be a
Liverpool<00:07:41.470> their<00:07:41.830> players<00:07:42.100> like<00:07:42.250> sour<00:07:42.520> is

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:42.700 
Liverpool their players like sour is

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.190 
Liverpool their players like sour is
Gerard<00:07:43.090> and<00:07:43.270> when<00:07:43.360> i<00:07:43.390> sell<00:07:43.720> them<00:07:43.870> i'm<00:07:44.020> going<00:07:44.140> to
