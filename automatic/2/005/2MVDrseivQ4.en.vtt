00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello good today javi placebo here you 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.119
 I leave my social networks as always 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.160
 if you want to contact me or you have 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.020
 some doubt in some video and well then 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.490
 is a somewhat special video is not going to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.680
 be no volume or anything like that 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.619
 it's just going to be a tweet that 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.750
 calls to use 2 recently has left no 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.750
 I know if you know him from ios and what was the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.570
 normal car but he could say with 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.369
 total security that can be let's go for 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.530
 me personally one of the three tweets 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.910
 better than there is in Libya the truth is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.559
 which is a pass because the first 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.940
 apart from saving you other tweets that 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.219
 they do the same function what are you going to have 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.229
 everything integrated here because second one is going to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.699
 preserve the home button and the best of 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:46.499
 everything is going to have an interface 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.379
 great look when I open the 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.539
 control center and multitasking in 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.159
 actually merge and well then let's go 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.079
 to explain it step by step so that 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.819
 you know how it is the first thing 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.219
 you have to do is obviously go into 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.109
 libya and once it's simple let's 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.159
 to tab face to look and you have to 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.350
 look for this to 127 this tweet is worth of 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.479
 payment in the weak repository 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.170
 ok it seems three dollars and something but 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.090
 I assure you they will be worth 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.770
 to turn it off because now you're going to see everything 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.900
 what you can do as I said nothing 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.340
 more the appearance because she beautiful the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.590
 true because here you have all your 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.210
 multitasking you have up all I had 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.830
 the day under all the options for 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.420
 camera etcetera etcetera is to say that it 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.369
 will merge the control center with 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.350
 the multitasking all this is configurable 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.240
 from the menu adjust and as I said 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.039
 let's go step by step While we will 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.530
 start from the beginning and first thing 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.450
 that we are going to see is well multicenter 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.520
 activating this box we will have 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.070
 so the merging of the two things is to say 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.830
 If we deactivate it , it will 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.350
 simply leave the control center and 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.819
 well only there you have it well another of the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.670
 options that this tweet has 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.770
 llama quit sicher is the truth very good 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.450
 because if we turn from the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.039
 left fix the manzanita what 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.869
 So we can see all the 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.729
 applications that we have open and 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.530
 we go through anyone to be able 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.600
 open it that we hope all this 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.250
 is from the left there you have the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.470
 next option called hot with him 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.729
 it's the same but the other way around I explain myself in 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.650
 time to the left we're going to give 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.720
 right and it's going to make us the effect of 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.750
 take us directly to the es 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.610
 cousin, I'm not going to let him go 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.900
 they explained the video but good we 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.480
 we would do so and we would already be 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.950
 directly on the spin board 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.410
 this, sincerely, will save us 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.660
 tap the home button as good 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.340
 well we all know that on the iphone the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.050
 truth is that the home button is the heel 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.090
 of Achilles are always spoiled 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.650
 well with this tweet honestly 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.720
 you will not have to touch the home button 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.550
 not good at all once we've seen 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.709
 these three options we have another menu 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.360
 more of advanced options let's go to 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.400
 for her the first option that we go 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.140
 to find is called minimal display in 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.640
 which if we activate it we are going to remove 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.560
 when we do the effect of uploading 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.230
 multitasking the control center we are going to 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.030
 remove as I said then the air place and 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.070
 the player thing that to me then 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.570
 honestly, it does not bother me. 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.880
 got up with what's off we have 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.709
 up and limelight and down here then 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.040
 we have all the player well then if 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.510
 I have it activated let's give it then 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.130
 Look are no longer both then 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.320
 you can reconfigure it like you 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.630
 want if you want it to turn off when 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.180
 the music is not playing when the 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.220
 full detect it or when the book is 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.200
 it will be removed sincerely 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.970
 I always like it and I'm going to 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.750
 deactivate because I want to always be 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.460
 see like this 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.470
 option as you are seeing is called open 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.930
 to the app in which if you have it 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.180
 activated just when you upload to the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.800
 Multitasking will put at the center 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.570
 last app that you have used 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.490
 honestly I do not care because 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.860
 turning to the left right I'm going to 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.090
 to be able to find the one I want with 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.100
 which then I'm going to leave 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.020
 deactivated the next option that 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.730
 you're seeing is called with launcher in 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.709
 which will take away your see 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.450
 you have in multitasking when the 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.220
 player on the move let's give it almost 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.410
 we learn better once we give 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.060
 He is not saying that when he does not 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.890
 is ringing I want it to be always 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.510
 you can also put it never to be 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.070
 when it is not ringing that is the case 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.290
 now you see now they are not already I had them the 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.850
 below as well I sincerely 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.860
 I want to put on display you also have 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.590
 the other option of auto dinÃ­s is to say 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.930
 that here below you can configure it 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.670
 at three seconds disappear that is to say 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.930
 if I now upload the multitasking that 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.459
 you are seeing that we are going to spend three 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.440
 seconds and you'll see how the three below 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.730
 will disappear you have seen between the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.010
 second you can configure it as 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.770
 I want to personally I want to put it 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.630
 always display is to say that it appears and 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.130
 the other option puts when it's sounding 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.660
 the player has 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.660
 and the options is to say in a 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.370
 appear to appear or configure it 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.560
 this through time the truth is 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.450
 that is very good credit that can 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.220
 be the very best that is in you of 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.990
 right now if we continue with the agenda 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.090
 option you are seeing a limit quit 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.160
 switcher is the option that explains from 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.170
 the left you remember so that 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.150
 do not leave more than six some things I do not know 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.590
 why this option the truth but good 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.180
 I have it activated to get me out 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.170
 all in such a way that if I lift 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.340
 from the left 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.010
 where all applications are going to come out 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.750
 open if you have that disconnected 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.970
 you're only going to get out with the last six 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.430
 the next option called imbert 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.170
 hot with him is the option that I told you about 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.970
 right you remember that sliding the 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.010
 finger from the right side and we're going to 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.530
 get to the sprint board well then if 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.120
 we invested that option not the 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.800
 is going to give the left look now 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.330
 I'm doing it myself 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.520
 left I do not know if you are watching the 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.200
 apple but good what he is doing 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.680
 the same left this option I do not see it 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.880
 very productive since by doing this the 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.740
 on the left does not change to the 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.210
 right I do not know if I explain is to say the 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.250
 option on the right would you be the 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.470
 multitasking and you will not get 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.990
 bass applications with which I 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.060
 finally the last option that is very 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.430
 well thought out is if you want this 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.890
 tuit is not available do not be 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.020
 enabled let's say in some application 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.610
 this the ideal is to put it then in some 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.320
 application of games because if you're 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.790
 playing and inadvertently you can do 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.590
 here you will get up the center of 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.750
 control with which then it is not pleasant 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.760
 Well, you just have to build 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.650
 any application that you want 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.660
 these list I tell you game unit for 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.700
 that this does not appear to you the truth is that 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.130
 it's an authentic past and this yes that 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.600
 deserves an exclusive video just for him and 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.370
 Well, this has been the one I hope 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.140
 that I have clearly explained the 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.350
 truth is that I 'm telling you it 's new 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.180
 tweet I highly recommend it and 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.860
 well I say goodbye not before telling you 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.750
 that you like the video if it has 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.400
 been useful and good that you subscribe to 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.290
 channel if you have not seen it yet I remember you 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.210

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.919
 link in which you have all the 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.230
 tweets say already available as not with 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.840
 May is 7 and well I hope that you 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.070
 like some one passes a good day remember 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.070
