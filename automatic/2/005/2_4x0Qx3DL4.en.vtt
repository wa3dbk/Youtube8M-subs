00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello everyone this is a new video 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.089
 about a new series where I'll be 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.680
 talking about the main reasons why 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.139
 which most of them find it hard to leave 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 the lower leagues the reason why I do 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.769
 is in a series because a lot 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 people ask me jokingly but 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.820
 also very seriously what can you do or 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.550
 what are you doing wrong to get out of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 just those leagues I can not give them 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.890
 an exact or punctual answer about 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 what are you doing wrong because 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.939
 good since serious is simply 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.700
 impossible but if I can help in the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.260
 way that I think it is 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.200
 they just do our videos 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.719
 explanatory we get the topics more 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.329
 punctual if I can not touch each topic 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.800
 specific to each player or each 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.980
 strategy because everything varies depending 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.250
 of each player just so if 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.739
 I will talk about the specific topics 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.020
 and almost literally vital that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.380
 they need to improve to be able to climb 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.270
 league 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.329
 in my opinion a very important detail 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.820
 and very 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.000
 and left aside is the subject of the vision 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.470
 there is still a lot that thought of 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.600
 that the keepers should buy them 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.189
 only the support is still very many 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.770
 people who do not know what should improve the 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.479
 trinquets or trinkets there's still a lot 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.810
 people who do not improve them to the ratchet 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.659
 developer there are many people who do not buy 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.720
 wards of vision yes then good 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.789
 that's why I'll do this video in the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.860
 that I will talk about the differences in the 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:33.460
 use of vision between bronze and 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.200
 Challenger the wards are a very part 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.600
 important of the game as they provide 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.729
 vision for that reason it is not surprising to see 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.850
 that in the highest leagues there is more 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.340
 play exposed the games in fact 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.459
 diamond have up to three times more 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.770
 wards of vision that in bronze as they see 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.959
 in graph 1 as you go up 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.390
 league will also increase the 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.920
 amount of wards that are used I think 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.920
 that we can all agree on 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.990
 that is not something casual likewise 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.209
 you can notice that the statistics of 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.700
 the trinquets in yellow and the warsame 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.160
 visible in green are instead a little 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.890
 more complex 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.440
 we noticed that in the highest leagues it 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.300
 they use more invisible wards and on the other 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.360
 the use of the guard also decreases 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.000
 trinquets this shows then that 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.580
 the more we climb the league the more we play 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.220
 visible and will be used instead 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.740
 will use less viewing trinquets this is 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.810
 surely because the leagues more 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.540
 high changes the vision trinquet 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.460
 by the tell-tale ratchet in fact yes 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.320
 super we put both graphics looks 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.510
 clearly the trend of which I speak 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.640
 the more we climb in the leagues more 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.920
 wards there will be less vision trinquets 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.720
 while it is not uncommon to believe that 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.360
 players in the highest leagues put 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.550
 more wards due to the desire to control 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.830
 the vision of the map there is another factor in the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.020
 I play the trinquets and the wards 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.530
 invisible last much less how much more 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.350
 let's go up in the leagues this is because 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.570
 the more wards more wards are used 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.670
 vision and revealing trinquets will be used 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.560
 also to give a statistic only the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.990
 3.7 percent of invisible guards 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.370
 in bronze are destroyed before 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.830
 expire naturally 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.950
 in time duration which 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.230
 would mean two things that are used 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.080
 less invisible and trinquets of 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.360
 emission and less are used 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.849
 vision wards and revealing trinquets 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.430
 in comparison in the league of teachers 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.860
 15% of the wards are destroyed and 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.230
 vision trinquets which means 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.269
 that besides they are more used also 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.400
 that generates more wards purchases 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.769
 because they just last less when being 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.930
 destroyed to end with the 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.120
 graphics we see that the control of the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.099
 vision is much more competitive in the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.230
 higher leagues the guards are 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.109
 destroyed more often and the use of 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.910
 playing television is much higher these 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.560
 things are finally what we should 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.690
 analyze and take into account when 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.730
 play and want to improve as players 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.190
 we should always be asking ourselves 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.319
 I'm saving enough really 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.790
 I give it a strategic use I keep it 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.950
 I just put them anywhere 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.260
 on any bus and if what I am 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.940
 doing is safe also because this 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.160
 it does not mean that we go to the base 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.900
 enemy power a guard you have to start at 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.000
 use a more critical and thought 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.220
 realize what the risks are 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.830
 are the advantages of going to save a 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.200
 place in specific the guard not only 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.850
 It serves to save us from gangs but to 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.010
 receive vital information from the enemy 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.090
 where are we what can we do while 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.740
 they are there 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.480
 what skills or spells they used 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.370
 during the time I had vision and 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.050
 other questions can occur to us and 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.270
 If we will have vision, we can 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.040
 answer them with ease there are many 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.380
 more things that include in the games 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.750
 ranked apart logically from being 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.820
 good or not mechanically the only thing 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.620
 I wanted to tell you is to take into account 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.710
 what I was saying in the video 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.510
 if the issue of risks the issue of 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.790
 strategy that we can do based on 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.190
 the vision that we have the information that 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.169
 gives us insight and importance 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.540
 of vision even in fights in 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.490
 team is very important that we 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.110
 let's start to realize that thanks to the 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.180
 vision is that they really win 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.770
 games 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.020
 if you served them then please 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.580
 share like and comment and if still 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.800
 they did not hesitate to subscribe 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.660
 I will continue uploading more material like this 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.270
 and they will be helping me a lot doing 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.160
 these things as always thank you very much 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.880
 for being on the other side and having a 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.880
 very good day
