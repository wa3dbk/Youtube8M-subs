00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
effective you should have to obviously

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.990 
effective you should have to obviously
improvise<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:26.340> sort<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.789> can't

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
improvise and you sort of you can't

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.580 
improvise and you sort of you can't
really<00:00:27.180> run<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.480> generic<00:00:27.990> screen<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.410> give

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
really run the generic screen they give

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.960 
really run the generic screen they give
you<00:00:28.710> because<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.340> takes<00:00:29.580> too<00:00:29.760> long<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
you because it just takes too long to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.049 
you because it just takes too long to
develop<00:00:30.269> especially<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.439> year's<00:00:31.619> game

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
develop especially in this year's game

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.350

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
against the blitz which is technically

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.770 
against the blitz which is technically
when<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.500> run<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.030> throw<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.629> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
when you run it you see I throw it and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.819 
when you run it you see I throw it and

there cook enough report it and then
right<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.479> at<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> plane<00:01:13.250> try<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> make<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
right here at the plane try to make it a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
right here at the plane try to make it a
lot<00:01:14.760> more<00:01:14.909> effective<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
lot more effective it's up there a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.929 
lot more effective it's up there a
little<00:01:16.530> quicker<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.040> his<00:01:17.159> blockers<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.759> out

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
little quicker but his blockers on out

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
little quicker but his blockers on out
there<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.360> mean<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.750> still<00:01:18.930> get<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.259> four<00:01:19.590> yards

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
there I mean I still get like four yards

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.910 
there I mean I still get like four yards
but<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:22.759> here<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> don't<00:01:24.920> worry

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
but that's it here I'm on I don't worry

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.550 
but that's it here I'm on I don't worry
blocks<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.790> goes<00:01:27.000> out<00:01:27.180> yeah<00:01:27.570> cuz<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
blocks and then goes out yeah cuz you

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.020 
blocks and then goes out yeah cuz you
know<00:01:28.680> maybe<00:01:28.860> it'll<00:01:29.100> slow<00:01:29.310> them<00:01:29.369> down<00:01:29.430> okay

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
know maybe it'll slow them down okay

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.640 
know maybe it'll slow them down okay
Bullards<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.229> gypsum<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
Bullards like gypsum and

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.620 
Bullards like gypsum and
get<00:01:33.070> out<00:01:33.190> there<00:01:33.400> quick<00:01:33.640> enough<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:37.240> what

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
get out there quick enough and then what

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.000 
get out there quick enough and then what
you<00:01:37.750> actually<00:01:37.930> do<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.440> you<00:01:38.650> want<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:38.860> pick<00:01:38.980> a
