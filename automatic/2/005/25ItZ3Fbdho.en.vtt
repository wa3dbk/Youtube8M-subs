if you guys like this definitely make
sure<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.160> leave<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> let's<00:00:43.020> get

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
sure to leave a like so let's get

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.130 
sure to leave a like so let's get
started<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:44.309> coming<00:00:45.270> into<00:00:45.329> number<00:00:45.719> three<00:00:46.110> I

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
started so coming into number three I

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.779 
started so coming into number three I
think<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:47.129> worst<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:48.469> think<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.739> goes<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
think the worst I think this goes to

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.779 
think the worst I think this goes to
redstone<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.570> redstone<00:00:51.960> or<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:53.399> reason<00:00:53.610> for

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
redstone a redstone or the reason for

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090 
redstone a redstone or the reason for
that<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.420> although<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.199> do<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.890> making

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that is I although I do like making

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.400 
that is I although I do like making
redstone<00:00:56.610> contraptions<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:58.170> about<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
redstone contraptions I think about it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
redstone contraptions I think about it
in<00:00:58.500> survival<00:00:58.940> it's<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.180> helpful

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
in survival it's not really helpful

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.440 
in survival it's not really helpful
because<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.980> spawns<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.059> lot<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.189> also<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:06.119> like

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
because it spawns a lot and also it like

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.690 
because it spawns a lot and also it like
you<00:01:07.290> you're<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.770> survival<00:01:08.460> you're<00:01:08.610> not

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you you're not in survival you're not

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.070 
you you're not in survival you're not
going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.909> make<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.030> crazy<00:01:09.479> redstone

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
going to make a crazy redstone

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
going to make a crazy redstone
contraption<00:01:10.799> you're<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> make<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
contraption you're not going to make a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.999 
contraption you're not going to make a
giant<00:01:11.880> thing<00:01:12.270> um<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.350> kind<00:01:16.799> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
giant thing um so it really is kind of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.690 
giant thing um so it really is kind of
useless<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:19.229> might<00:01:19.409> make<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> piston<00:01:19.920> door<00:01:20.310> or

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
useless you might make a piston door or

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.520 
useless you might make a piston door or
like<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.150> know<00:01:21.240> something<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.900> basic<00:01:22.140> but

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
like you know something really basic but

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
like you know something really basic but
you<00:01:22.590> won't<00:01:22.770> make<00:01:22.890> some<00:01:23.159> crazy<00:01:23.520> crazy<00:01:24.119> thing

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
you won't make some crazy crazy thing

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.679 
you won't make some crazy crazy thing
and<00:01:24.600> survival<00:01:25.080> um<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.939> that's<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> think

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and survival um so that's what I think

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.620 
and survival um so that's what I think
for<00:01:27.869> number<00:01:28.080> three<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.799> goes<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.280> redstone

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
for number three it goes to redstone

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
for number three it goes to redstone
number<00:01:30.630> two<00:01:30.900> has<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.979> go<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.079> gold<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.590> gold

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
number two has to go it to gold now gold

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.609 
number two has to go it to gold now gold
is<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.210> kind<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.540> hard<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> find<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.439> say

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
is it's kind of hard to find I would say

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.990 
is it's kind of hard to find I would say
it's<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> second<00:01:38.549> hardest<00:01:38.670> thing<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it's like the second hardest thing to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's like the second hardest thing to
find<00:01:39.119> besides<00:01:39.750> diamonds<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.950> diamonds

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
find besides diamonds because diamonds

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.819 
find besides diamonds because diamonds
you<00:01:41.670> know<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.259> guys<00:01:43.530> know

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
you know is it is like you guys know

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.160 
you know is it is like you guys know
it's<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> hardest<00:01:44.430> thing<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.640> find<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.750> once

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
it's the hardest thing to find and once

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.460 
it's the hardest thing to find and once
you<00:01:46.290> find<00:01:46.500> gold<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:46.979> um<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.259> you

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
you find gold as well um it really you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.139 
you find gold as well um it really you
cannot<00:01:49.799> make<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.220> can't<00:01:50.430> use<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.880> make<00:01:50.970> any

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
cannot make you can't use it to make any

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.730 
cannot make you can't use it to make any
tools<00:01:51.479> because<00:01:51.869> our<00:01:52.020> selves<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> will<00:01:52.470> break

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
tools because our selves it will break

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.999 
tools because our selves it will break
instantly<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.869> only<00:01:55.110> best<00:01:55.380> thing<00:01:55.619> really<00:01:55.770> can

instantly the only best thing really can

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.459 
instantly the only best thing really can
make<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.399> golden<00:01:56.700> apples<00:01:57.259> that's<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.380> like

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
make is golden apples that's not like

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.719 
make is golden apples that's not like
the<00:01:58.560> only<00:01:58.680> thing<00:01:58.829> though<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.399> one
