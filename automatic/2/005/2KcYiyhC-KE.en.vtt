00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.160
 the Florentine touches the net after a few 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.449
 minutes of play 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.660

 directly de tones with a lob 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.520

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.310
 gattuso 

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:27.229
 the novara coach not in gattuso 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.060
 however, we all know the world 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.450
 try even the inverted a 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.909
 surprising of tones puts his hand to the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.459
 novara goalkeeper for a sean is there 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.830
 space to even kick from 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.300
 distance 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.650
 an incredible parade of de tones 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.950
 tenth day of the championship as said 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:52.510
 that he had connected 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.960
 now they are second in the eye ranking 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.280
 my mother laughs at the left 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.800
 two zero masterpiece of areas from the limit 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.480
 of the area a blow on which the tones 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.710
 he can do absolutely nothing 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.179
 possati precisely pink castle touch 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.850
 wrong, however, he understands everything ciannamea 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.450
 tip the ball door for freedom you can 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.420
 kicking freedom speaks about the left 2 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.420
 a 1 novara liberty gets back and reopens 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.230
 the game 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.370
 tip vicari jumps the ball on the right 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.890
 mamma mia takes care of the corner ditches 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.490
 bernardeschi eye out remains if the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.190
 video vein de ski left on the fly 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:46.840
 my mom what a corner kick 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:50.890
 from the Florentine nazzani bench 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:56.800
 ditches from distance but puts out 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.510
 of everton bulls hours 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.360
 now for the Germans inside worse than 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.709
 head tries to crush he had maybe 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.510
 conclude with a pink steward foot a 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.260
 kick from the distance then weak throw 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.180
 ball heads high over the crossbar 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.910
 long ball for the racing region and it 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.940
 chest stop and civic upon him 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.209
 tip comes no partner gets bigger 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.239
 hours then he goes to kick the crossbar and the 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:32.459
 ball comes out a beautiful conclusion 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:35.890
 that of mixed areas three points made yes 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.170
 especially first important time not 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.950
 unfortunately we have created the error 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.319
 we did they punished us 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.079
 they were only good at continuing to 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.720
 definitely play his time we were 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.910
 a little more tired we had spent so much 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.470
 we have created so much in the first half 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.930
 maybe you had to close immediately not 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.790
 we succeeded but it was important 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.730
 restart and with a positive performance 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.389
 and above all an important result but 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.329
 that of today 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.889
 as you have also seen novara has come 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.109
 here with the third goalkeeper first 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.880
 libertazzi team to 92 per side there 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.410
 he made goals 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.109
 in short, they are also important exams 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.109
 these guys don't give 45 years old 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.599
 of difference is definitely one thing 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.940
 important for our growth and for 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.160
 continue to rock this that is 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.070
 becoming a dream of arriving at 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.590
 finals maybe through the first few 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.180
 two positions now made in the 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.889
 next two races there will be just the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.360
 challenge against turin and follows us e 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.270
 third in the standings 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.650
 if we think of recovering why 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.020
 we only often have so much today 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.820
 boys at the end were very tired 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.520
 Saturday we have siena than another 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.500
 derby for us so you have to try to 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.479
 also there to make a big game 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.360
 attention trying to get there for it 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.669
 less with this detachment then we say 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.560
 at the play-off with the turin and maybe 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.180
 play it at home in the best way 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.669
 this guy in the last few weeks 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.880
 seems really matured works with 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.710
 dedication with commitment runs far more 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.200
 dynamic than in the past what 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.020
 changed but changed and he certainly did 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.300
 worked so hard with great 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.760
 determination 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.500
 he wanted to prove it was not what we say 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.540
 last season the boy is 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.780
 growing from a point of view 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.270
 you saw is a form of ray 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.040
 important that we had never seen is 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.990
 like a prize this boy and he is 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.150
 working very carefully and can 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.610
 prove everything beautiful about mona had been 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.650
 said of him the pre-game to date 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.450
 there was an interview with that of 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.210
 sandro mencucci what did you say? 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.600
 in particular we were talking about the game 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:48.070
 we would have encountered difficulties 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.070
 nothing thanks
