00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.080
 old man from glass mountain 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:13.610
 one glorious kingdom was unlucky 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.440
 caught him kings of petty tyrant 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.470
 once he built a smooth glass 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.039
 mountain 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:27.119
 tried it and then who says 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:34.160
 at the very top of the glass crust will run out 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.160
 and will not fall, and he will be the husband of Princess 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.760
 the kingdom lived a man who 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.450
 correct and he loved the queen and asked 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.440
 by the king 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.680
 can he get the hand of his daughter that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.210
 Chuvash king if he can escape 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.559
 on outlandish uphill and not plop 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:01.230
 then who objected marry a princess 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.250
 said she wants him on that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.489
 mount run up 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.670
 to support his vision friend fall 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.659

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.439
 liked 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.470
 and so they ran together and when they 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.390
 were already in the middle of the mountain queen 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.900
 slipped and fell agar glass 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.450
 it opened up under it and she went there 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.890
 failed 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.979
 the poor fellow could not even show where 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.520
 it failed because the mountain again 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.320
 immediately closed and smoothed out 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.409
 and he began to lament 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.409
 on grieve yes and the king that is sadness 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.170

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.899
 break in the hope that he somehow 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.990
 manage to pull a daughter out from under her 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.110
 but there is no source where it is under the mountain 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.920
 meanwhile failed princess 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.729
 fell deep underground and hit the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.729
 big cave 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.800
 here I met an old man with a big gray 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.340
 beard 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.720
 This one didnâ€™t say that if she wanted him 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.730
 be a servant and do all that 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.209
 will order 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:31.420
 then leave to live at home and if not 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:35.170
 He wants that then her death to do 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:39.160
 nothing became a princess to perform all that 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:44.319
 didn't order as the them took out in the morning 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:48.190
 his ladder out of pocket pocketing her to 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.819
 the steep slope of the cliff and climbed 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.239
 she always left his ladder 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.390
 took with him at this time the princess 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.170
 was supposed to cook him food and lay 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.299
 bed and all other non-royal 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.790
 work to do when the old man 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:11.819
 came back home every time brought 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:15.489
 with a bunch of gold and silver 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.780
 wished her princess many years fare with 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.290
 big gray beard 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.250
 already quite decrepit and began to call her 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.840
 mistress 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:30.760
 Morse's mouth and allowed her to call herself 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.510
 old ring wound and then once 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.030

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:48.370
 and a small window at the top opened 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:52.690
 so that the light passes through it when 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:56.739
