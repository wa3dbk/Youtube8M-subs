00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.710
 Hello everyone, cattle today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:11.070
 I'll tell you more precisely I'll show windows 10 in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.759
 general pros and cons tell him so well 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.800
 we start with the first start-up is about to himself 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.800
 start as you see yes I switched from 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:29.000
 licensed windows 7 don't know if it's bad 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:33.899
 it or not in general everything works fine 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.219
 so let's start the app in general it's like 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.600
 In the standard way I want to tell you 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.780
 about standard windows here by the way 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.629
 is this here by the way there is a plus 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 the fact that here everything is just the same there 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.039
 point there everything is in general possible 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:03.170
 here look to see in general how everything 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:08.490
 old windows it seems so to caretakers and 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.820
 you can still delete how to look here 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.180
 remember here all sorts of things were like 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.630
 control there almost never remember 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.110
 well, I can't use windows anymore 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.979
 7 this is the way minus the fact that it is impossible 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:31.979
 again i take and remove eat windows 10 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:35.310
 don't return my old windows 7 well 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 just so that all this here is left 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:45.899
 so here so ok let's see I 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 for example, delete, click delete mail.ru 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.630
 for example, nothing is necessary to go into 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.939
 folder 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:04.539
 so this is not the table so this thing 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:12.940
 Okay, let's get it on, so why am I 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:15.970
 running the program starts so why 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:23.099
 then you can not give interesting but you see 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:26.830
 click delete so yes i know what and how 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:30.519
 did you do it let me ex i press 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.840
 on fraps and remove skip or and here 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:38.680
 it starts up by the way this is this 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:45.610
 control panel control panel on 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:48.700
 so it starts as you see 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.140
 you can say you do not need files here 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.200
 More precisely programs like on windows 7 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.819
 more everything is okay let's go 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.420
 now move on to its plus so 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.389
 user-friendly interface in general as you see 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.389
 some kind of translation you by the way 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:12.970
 you see power is written for some reason 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:17.440
 this computer used to be my translation 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.980
 computer now this computer takes 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.799
 she has a lot of space yes it is Windows 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:30.720
 I used to be 26 gigabytes free 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:34.650
 memory + 6 gig that's ok let's 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:39.880
 now you can go to minus a 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:46.209
 so in general you will not have antivirus 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:49.090
 work is a minus here by the way I still 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.910
 telling minus what can't 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.100
 go with 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.320
 seen here on windows 7 don't wrap 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.780
 more precisely his 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.180
 That something like this but the rest of the program I 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.190
 I think this is the only negative 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.610
 it seems that the antivirus does not work 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.740
 then no not the only minus 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.970
 long download by the way I do not know how u 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:16.840
 all but loading me a long time like me 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:22.360
 turn on the computer so he turned on 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.490
 general and black screen then about appears 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.300
 welcome forms this every other day 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:33.550
 somewhere 3 minutes this is a minus so 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:40.330
 Well, in general, all the programs work with 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:42.250
 windows 7 by the way who has a printer 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.300
 for example, I do not advise to switch to 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.700
 windows 10 since it won't work 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.280
 driver 1 oh what driver 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.240
 but scan as it would be possible even 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:05:00.400
 here is the hist to the socket here 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:06.970
 pull it down so I went close here 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:11.050
 by the way my scanner is so well and kind 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.900
 all and minus is not my work 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.660
 Antivirus okay Well thanks for all 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.500
 view and all while put huskies and 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.500
 subscribe to the channel 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.779
 but
