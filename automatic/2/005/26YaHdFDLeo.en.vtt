00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
single player that most races now have

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.100 
single player that most races now have
now<00:01:23.130> there's<00:01:23.340> three<00:01:23.399> game<00:01:24.030> types<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.750> tired

trial<00:01:25.470> race<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.369> zones<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.149> these<00:01:27.329> can<00:01:27.509> be

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
trial race and zones and these can be

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.929 
trial race and zones and these can be
done<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:28.020> any<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> eight<00:01:28.679> tracks<00:01:29.189> now

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
done on any of the eight tracks now

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.690 
done on any of the eight tracks now
8tracks<00:01:30.780> don't<00:01:31.020> sound<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.490> can

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
8tracks don't sound a lot but you can

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
8tracks don't sound a lot but you can
reverse<00:01:33.060> them<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:34.049> makes<00:01:34.319> a<00:01:34.590> big

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
reverse them if that makes a big

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.179 
reverse them if that makes a big
difference<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.240> my<00:01:36.539> eyes<00:01:36.569> it<00:01:36.960> doesn't<00:01:37.439> so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
difference but in my eyes it doesn't so

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
difference but in my eyes it doesn't so
the<00:01:38.579> only<00:01:38.759> game<00:01:39.090> type<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.539> I<00:01:39.569> can<00:01:39.780> talk<00:01:40.020> about

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the only game type that I can talk about

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.160 
the only game type that I can talk about
really<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.860> zone<00:01:41.250> seeing<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.179> town<00:01:42.630> trial<00:01:43.020> is

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the track in a time limit that it gives

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.309 
the track in a time limit that it gives
you<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:48.679> race<00:01:49.679> is<00:01:49.979> pretty<00:01:50.220> self-explanatory

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
you and race is pretty self-explanatory

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.589 
you and race is pretty self-explanatory
over<00:01:52.319> players<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.640> zones<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.179> mostly

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
over players so zones is mostly

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
interesting to talk about you go around

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.339 
interesting to talk about you go around
the<00:01:56.909> track<00:01:57.179> and<00:01:57.420> each<00:01:57.599> time<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.080> get<00:01:58.319> around

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
the track and each time you get around

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.100 
the track and each time you get around
the<00:01:58.679> track<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.399> increase<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.119> speed<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the track you increase in speed and you

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.169 
the track you increase in speed and you
keep<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.619> through<00:02:02.009> different<00:02:02.549> zones<00:02:02.819> and

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
each zone will give you a different

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.830 
each zone will give you a different
color<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.340> track<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.849> give<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.810> a

different speed to the track and most of

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.140 
different speed to the track and most of
the<00:02:10.079> time<00:02:10.289> actually<00:02:10.860> no<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.579> time<00:02:11.790> it's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the time actually no all the time it's

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.600 
the time actually no all the time it's
faster<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.380> don't<00:02:13.560> even<00:02:13.650> have<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.890> hold<00:02:14.250> down

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
faster you don't even have to hold down

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.090 
faster you don't even have to hold down
the<00:02:14.880> accelerator<00:02:15.209> boss<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.110> does<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.680> for

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the accelerator boss of it does it for

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.520 
the accelerator boss of it does it for
you<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.930> round<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> track

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
you you just have to get round the track

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.340 
you you just have to get round the track
without<00:02:20.040> dying<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.239> by<00:02:21.359> dying<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.140> mean

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
without dying and by dying I mean

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.890 
without dying and by dying I mean
crushing<00:02:22.859> your<00:02:23.010> ship<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.700> trust<00:02:24.329> me<00:02:24.420> by<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
crushing your ship and trust me by the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.650 
crushing your ship and trust me by the
time<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.350> get<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.560> about<00:02:25.890> zone<00:02:26.250> 30<00:02:26.670> you'll<00:02:27.480> be

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
time you get to about zone 30 you'll be

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.310 
time you get to about zone 30 you'll be
panicking

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.140 

so<00:02:32.320> this<00:02:32.530> wipeout<00:02:32.890> game<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.400> basically<00:02:33.760> a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
so this wipeout game is basically a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.010 
so this wipeout game is basically a
mixture<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.620> two<00:02:35.650> PSP<00:02:36.400> games<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.030> dodge

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
mixture of the two PSP games and dodge

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.290 
mixture of the two PSP games and dodge
these<00:02:38.500> shows<00:02:38.860> from<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.370> ships<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.150> can

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
these shows from the ships that you can

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.840 
these shows from the ships that you can
choose<00:02:40.510> from<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.500> tracks<00:02:41.890> no<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.640> isn't

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
choose from and the tracks no it isn't

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.550 
choose from and the tracks no it isn't
really<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.060> bad<00:02:43.300> thing<00:02:43.630> unless<00:02:43.990> if<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.320> played

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
really a bad thing unless if you played

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.430 
really a bad thing unless if you played
those<00:02:44.830> two<00:02:45.040> games<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.550> death<00:02:45.910> but<00:02:46.570> even<00:02:46.870> that

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
those two games to death but even that

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.430 
those two games to death but even that
the<00:02:47.950> tiny<00:02:48.550> price<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.090> it's<00:02:49.240> asking<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:50.020> gives

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
play a very important part in the races

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.400 
play a very important part in the races
for<00:03:54.520> example<00:03:55.030> you've<00:03:55.420> got<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.660> final<00:03:56.110> stretch

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
for example you've got the final stretch

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.130 
for example you've got the final stretch
and<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:57.010> boost<00:03:57.340> past<00:03:57.730> your<00:03:57.970> opponent<00:03:58.570> a<00:03:58.690> fly

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
and you boost past your opponent a fly

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.870 
and you boost past your opponent a fly
over<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.620> top<00:03:59.860> of<00:04:00.010> them<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.520> makes<00:04:00.760> you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
over the top of them and that makes you

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.060 
over the top of them and that makes you
win<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.150> race<00:04:01.350> rockets<00:04:02.350> for<00:04:02.560> example

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
win the race rockets for example

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.250 
win the race rockets for example
shooting<00:04:03.790> at<00:04:03.880> someone<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:04.690> slows<00:04:05.020> them

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
shooting at someone and it slows them

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.810 
shooting at someone and it slows them
right<00:04:05.530> down<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.130> point<00:04:06.370> where<00:04:06.550> you<00:04:06.700> can

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
right down to the point where you can

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.880 
right down to the point where you can
just<00:04:06.850> easily<00:04:07.270> own<00:04:07.570> take<00:04:07.900> them<00:04:08.170> they<00:04:08.650> might

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
just easily own take them they might

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.320 
just easily own take them they might
think<00:04:09.070> that's<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.340> bit<00:04:09.520> unfair<00:04:09.670> but<00:04:10.210> it

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
think that's a bit unfair but it

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.350 
think that's a bit unfair but it
actually<00:04:10.480> is<00:04:10.870> is<00:04:11.260> very<00:04:11.880> strategically<00:04:12.880> door

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
actually is is very strategically door

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.570 
actually is is very strategically door
and<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:13.930> just<00:04:14.260> like<00:04:14.500> any<00:04:14.710> other<00:04:14.980> wipeout

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580
