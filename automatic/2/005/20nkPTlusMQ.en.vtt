sort of here and the red was on the side
and<00:01:02.539> when<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> installed<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.290> earlier<00:01:05.100> they

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and when I installed it earlier they

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
and when I installed it earlier they
would<00:01:06.210> work<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.409> brake<00:01:07.650> light<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.430> you

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.530 
this and I think this flickers because
you<00:02:23.730> know<00:02:23.819> these<00:02:23.940> are<00:02:24.000> supposed<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.359> turn
