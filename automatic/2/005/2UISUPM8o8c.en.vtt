00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:36.269
 ok and now I stand here with the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:38.860
 I now know that I can 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.370
 So let's look at the following 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.649
 experimental setup now has the camera 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.690
 and shows the camera and the transmitter and 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.629
 I have the receiver with the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.339
 antenna 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.420
 we'll do that now you're leaving 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.089
 in the basement 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.949
 I go to my staircase once 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.229
 stairwell and we'll take a look here 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.809
 the video on 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:06.640
 Exactly shows the Valkyrie box in there 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.720
 the corner exactly what is on it 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.570
 you can read that 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:16.350
 wait for me because it's out of focus 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:21.159
 Look there is now but hold 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.259
 synonymous look cool, there is soon rx350 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.390
 and on the right is then 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:30.939
 still how many units are in there look 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.350
 look from the right to the right of the 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:38.200
 carton must go about it exactly 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.030
 Of course you do not have exactly four pieces 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.150
 get here by five instead 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:51.000
 is enough for a week ok then go 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.000
 It was exactly go out into the stairwell 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:05.490
 well now is light tackle 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:05.490
 Beneath it goes back signal 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.970
 yes you see that means of course 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.870
 unrealistic that but we had it now 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.610
 made in good resolution test because 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.050
 the dissolution test has shown namely 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.050
 Everything was very sharp on the box 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.050
 Of course that does not matter how you do that 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.180
 antenna is wanting to stand it is yes now 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.130
 that yes , but it was finally through 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.900
 three walls 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:49.910
 yes, that's not bad 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:52.440
 is of course complete mischief with 2 sp2 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.300
 that means you are standing in the room now 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.560
 stand the room now go there 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.820
 back to the room somewhere then me 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.410
 have to focus here 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:09.030
 oh god that's the other lab jakub 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:19.110
 but that's still good 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:28.700
 nevertheless times somewhere exactly could you want 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:28.700
 cook the logo that's really good 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.270
 There are no disturbances here 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.969
 yes, there are no problems 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.219
 we have seen so far though 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:47.909
 if you really get away almost completely 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:49.739
 then there was no disturbance but 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.230
 the picture was suddenly gone the same way 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.180
 as we said before and now 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.769
 the picture is not quite fluid but me 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.459
 believe so nearer you come the smoother 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:12.019
 it will not be easy to know where walls are 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:12.019
 now but dark now five is yes 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.049
 moves at the camera will he 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.669
 now it is getting a bit 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:24.080
 slower so I think so bad 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:30.270
 your signal gets slower 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:35.039
 here the image repetition rate make times 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.419
 a finger into the picture and sat 1 she is 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.139
 now we had almost half 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.139
 second delay 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.789
 yes that was pretty so that was 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.330
 about half a second until 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.330
 second 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.340
 even so now it was better now 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.340
 better 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:11.559
 How do you know how the antennas mine 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.559
 receivers always you have peppered 

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:19.519
 yes, but that's razor sharp 

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:21.439
 really really good and here in the iphone 

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:23.209
 is that still shown as dark and 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.860
 the transmitter is really bright iphone 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:31.269
 the exposure just stupid there 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:38.029
 somehow good then they will cost you 

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:44.089
 back here colleague so the man with 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:48.909
 sander can film it up with it 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:53.059
 here so close you can see me 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:57.559
 how we test where we stand here and 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:06:01.489
 film with an iphone filming with the iphone 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:03.259
 iphone then you have to always look at me 

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:16.989
 Now I'm happy right now 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:19.519
 so 321 know a bit 32 13 2 13 21 

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:22.929
 but you also see on the iphone now 

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:25.399
 So it's the axis and just done 

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:26.989
 that's hard to test if you do 

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:29.589
 not knows it, we will make 

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:29.589
 the end
