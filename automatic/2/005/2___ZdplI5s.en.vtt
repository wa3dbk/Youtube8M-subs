00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.129
 well and I'm happy to be another Tuesday 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.080
 healthy with you today 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.050
 I make the recipe for a green smoothie 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.699
 delicious and super easy to prepare but 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.529
 this is not the most important part of 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.300
 video but I also bring you a 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.850
 guide for you to elaborate your 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.470
 own green smoothies to your liking and it's 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.300
 that many of you have asked me to 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.369
 of green esmorís recipes and 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.169
 green games but what do I give them 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.030
 the recipe for a green smoothie is super 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.940
 sweet maybe you want to 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.890
 something more tropical and it has been so with 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.020
 this list you are going to be able to make your 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.270
 own creations depending on the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.070
 ingredients that strikes their fancy and 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.760
 if you want to see how to prepare them 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.809
 stay watching this video and the most 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.960
 important of a green smoothie 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.230
 evidently are the green leaves let's go 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.350
 to occupy 2 cups of green leaves and here 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.450
 I have chosen a list of green leaves that 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.149
 I consider very important and 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.009
 recommended because they are very very 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.320
 nutritious and if you are going to choose 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.360
 any green leaf that is not in this 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.610
 list I recommend that they go by 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.190
 those leaves that are green 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.860
 very dark the darker its color 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.010
 its nutritional value will be much higher 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.140
 and this time I bring them spinach 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.420
 which are the ones that I will use for this 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.229
 it is moore and kale Chinese cabbage 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.380
 lettuce romacello chard and tooth of 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.380
 Lion 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.210
 and we will also occupy a liquid base of 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.010
 this liquid base we will occupy two cups or 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.500
 half a liter and I will recommend you 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.540
 four bases and the choice will depend on 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.570
 that gives consistency you want me to take your 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.850
 esmorís you can choose vegetable milks and 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.850
 I'm going to recommend coconut milk or 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.890
 almond milk or you can use water 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.800
 I recommend you use water from 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.790
 coconut or natural water in this case 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.790
 I will use natural water 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.369
 and finally we will take 3 cups of 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.560
 ripe fruit and it is important that 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.390
 consume your ripe fruit because when 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.550
 your fruit is ripe means that 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.740
 all of its nutrients have been activated by 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.230
 complete your fruit you can put it in 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.630
 been natural or you can freeze your 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.790
 fruits and if you freeze your fruit it's not very 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.430
 and will have a consistency like frape 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.550
 and it tastes super rich and it's refreshing in 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.069
 this case I will use banana so 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:36.590
 the fruits that I recommend are banana 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:40.489
 mango fruits red orange peach pear 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.269
 apple and mostly green apple pineapple 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.269
 and grapes 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.610
 and as an extra, then to potentiate even more 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.040
 You are very green and I am going to give you 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.650
 below a list of things that 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.940
 you can add to your is very green but 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.370
 I recommend that if you are going to use 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.130
 some of them do not exceed one 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.620
 teaspoon in this case I'm going to 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.580
 use chia seeds so what 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.010
 I recommend you are chia seeds 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:17.090
 almond butter seeds 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.090
 cinnamon flax hemp and cocoa 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.569
 since we have chosen our 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.849
 ingredients is time for action well 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.340
 that what we will do is put our 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.069
 green leaves in the blender and add 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.780
 our liquid base liquefy we have very 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.780
 well these two ingredients 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.190
 since it is perfectly liquefied 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.799
 we will add our fruit either in 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.640
 been natural or frozen and we will return 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.640
 to liquefy 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.290
 ready to little is not super simple if you go 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.510
 to add an extra element like me the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.030
 Chia seeds you can do it at 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.580
 moment you add your fruit or 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.860
 finalize since you serve you is to die and if 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.200
 for many adults it is difficult to consume 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.560
 green eyes simply because of the color 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.390
 to give our children is very much 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.700
 more difficult so I came up with a 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.560
 afterthought and is why not 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.230
 Put our moore and green in molds 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.510
 of pallets freeze it and give it as a 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.190
 dessert to children the sour doh 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.860
 guaranteed but with the appearance of 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.750
 palette is super easy to consume it or 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.160
 because not also for us as a 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.830
 I hope you enjoyed the snack 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.290
 very much this recipe and send me 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.290

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.240
 do not 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.070
 I hope you liked it very much 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.020
 this video the truth I find very useful 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.180
 this ingredients guide you can choose 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.340
 If you want something sweet you can choose if 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.920
 you want something acid you can play with the 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.260
 ingredients that you have at home so 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.330
 if he makes his combinations I would love 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.820
 to send me a photo and tell me what 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.980
 combinations did so can you give me 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.570
 more ideas for me on my part is everything 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.920
 remember that we have an appointment on 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.740
 Friday on this channel 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.480
