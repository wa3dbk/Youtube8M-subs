dealing<00:02:52.720> with<00:02:52.750> sleep<00:02:53.140> deprivation<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:54.310> not

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
dealing with sleep deprivation and not

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.420 
dealing with sleep deprivation and not
having<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.690> best<00:02:55.720> sleep<00:02:56.319> schedule<00:02:56.799> for

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
having the best sleep schedule for

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.580 
having the best sleep schedule for
almost<00:02:57.879> ten<00:02:58.239> years<00:02:58.269> now<00:02:58.659> I'd<00:02:58.989> say<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.200> started

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
almost ten years now I'd say I started

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.860 
almost ten years now I'd say I started
having<00:02:59.739> problems<00:02:59.980> when<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.459> was<00:03:00.549> like<00:03:00.640> 13<00:03:00.970> which

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
having problems when I was like 13 which

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.089 
having problems when I was like 13 which
is<00:03:01.989> really<00:03:02.200> when<00:03:02.349> my<00:03:02.440> video<00:03:02.709> game<00:03:02.950> addiction

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
is really when my video game addiction

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.759 
is really when my video game addiction
came<00:03:03.609> in<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:03.970> I'd<00:03:04.060> say<00:03:04.299> it's<00:03:04.450> probably<00:03:04.720> part<00:03:05.650> of

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
came in so I'd say it's probably part of

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.399 
came in so I'd say it's probably part of
that<00:03:05.950> I'd<00:03:06.340> guarantee<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:07.299> a<00:03:07.420> big<00:03:07.870> part<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:08.260> my

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
that I'd guarantee that a big part of my

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.050 
that I'd guarantee that a big part of my
sleep<00:03:08.650> deprivation<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.459> not<00:03:09.609> getting<00:03:09.879> enough

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
sleep deprivation and not getting enough

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.539 
sleep deprivation and not getting enough
sleep<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.540> all<00:03:10.569> that<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:10.989> due<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.680> screens<00:03:12.159> I

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
sleep and all that is due to screens I

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.849 
sleep and all that is due to screens I
think<00:03:13.150> screens<00:03:13.629> are<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.140> blame<00:03:14.319> for<00:03:14.379> a<00:03:14.650> lot<00:03:14.709> of

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
think screens are to blame for a lot of

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.580
