00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
bad news and the good news is that the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.380 
bad news and the good news is that the
door<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.570> back<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.340> last<00:00:20.340> haunted<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> film<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
door is back on last haunted the film a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.950 
door is back on last haunted the film a
little<00:00:21.539> while<00:00:21.810> ago<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.769> door<00:00:23.039> was<00:00:23.250> broken<00:00:23.960> off

little while ago the door was broken off

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.939 
little while ago the door was broken off
so<00:00:25.130> I<00:00:26.130> thought<00:00:26.220> today<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:28.590> good<00:00:28.740> news

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
so I thought today that the good news

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.520 
so I thought today that the good news
was<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.189> found<00:00:29.550> or<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.060> put<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.330> back<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:32.030> and

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
was we found or we put it back on and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
was we found or we put it back on and
the<00:00:34.530> bad<00:00:34.710> news<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.820> broken

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the bad news is that is broken

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.630 
the bad news is that is broken
definitely<00:00:38.360> it's<00:00:39.360> faulty<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:44.340> crank

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
definitely it's faulty because the crank

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.920 
definitely it's faulty because the crank
handle<00:00:44.850> will<00:00:45.180> never<00:00:45.450> ever<00:00:45.690> move<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.200> drum<00:00:47.930> as
