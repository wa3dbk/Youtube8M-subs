just makes it so freakin easy because
these<00:02:15.180> are<00:02:15.360> locked<00:02:15.599> tight<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.959> on<00:02:18.890> there's

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
these are locked tight it on there's

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.570 
these are locked tight it on there's
that<00:02:20.160> nut<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:24.860> don't<00:02:25.860> think<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.129> can<00:02:26.280> get<00:02:26.370> this

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
that nut I don't think I can get this

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.470 
that nut I don't think I can get this
one<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:28.500> know<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.650> can't<00:02:29.610> get<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.970> quite<00:02:30.420> yet

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
one you know I can't get that quite yet

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.229 
one you know I can't get that quite yet
I<00:02:31.190> think<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.400> might<00:02:32.760> come<00:02:32.970> out<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> different

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
I think that might come out a different

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.699 
I think that might come out a different
way<00:02:33.750> again<00:02:34.709> forgive<00:02:35.069> me<00:02:36.230> one<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.319> this<00:02:37.410> was<00:02:37.590> on

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
way again forgive me one of this was on

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.559 
way again forgive me one of this was on
when<00:02:38.160> all<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.849> fly<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.090> have<00:02:39.360> not

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
when all this is on the fly I have not

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.180 
when all this is on the fly I have not
looked<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> book<00:02:40.170> or<00:02:40.349> anything<00:02:40.379> to<00:02:40.830> actually

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
looked at a book or anything to actually

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.850 
looked at a book or anything to actually
figure<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.489> out<00:02:42.319> probably<00:02:43.319> shut<00:02:43.470> up<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.769> I

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
figure this out probably shut up and I

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.740 
figure this out probably shut up and I
have<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.220> book<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.550> just<00:02:44.580> haven't<00:02:45.000> used<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.360> so

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.170 

hmm<00:02:51.750> I've<00:02:52.560> got<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.950> get<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.250> off<00:02:53.519> because<00:02:53.879> all

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
hmm I've got to get this off because all

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.839 
hmm I've got to get this off because all
this<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.480> held<00:02:54.690> together<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:55.260> one<00:02:56.069> piece<00:02:56.430> but

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
this is held together as one piece but

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.869 
this is held together as one piece but
what<00:02:57.750> my<00:02:57.989> question<00:02:58.409> is<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.519> close<00:02:59.760> to

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
what my question is this is so close to

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.690 
what my question is this is so close to
that<00:03:00.000> gear<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:01.040> guess<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.129> can<00:03:02.250> get<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.430> off<00:03:02.519> with

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
