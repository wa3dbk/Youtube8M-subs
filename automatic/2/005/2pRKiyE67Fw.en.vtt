recently in some high powered blenders
the<00:00:21.119> first<00:00:21.449> reason<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.109> including<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.560> pattern

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the first reason for including a pattern

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
the first reason for including a pattern
is<00:00:23.039> helping<00:00:23.369> mix<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.880> leafy<00:00:24.269> greens<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.840> whole

smoothie<00:00:27.080> green<00:00:28.080> smoothies<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.650> become

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
smoothie green smoothies have become

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.769 
smoothie green smoothies have become
increasingly<00:00:29.550> popular<00:00:29.640> over<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.359> last<00:00:30.390> few

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
increasingly popular over the last few

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.540 
increasingly popular over the last few
years<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> need<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> very<00:00:32.040> powerful

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
years and you need a very powerful

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.910 
years and you need a very powerful
blender<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.210> make<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.570> properly<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.649> no

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
blender to make one properly but no

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.799 
blender to make one properly but no
matter<00:00:35.190> how<00:00:35.489> powerful<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.120> bender<00:00:36.420> might<00:00:36.600> be

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809

lots<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.739> leaves<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.219> chunky<00:00:38.670> fruits<00:00:39.000> make<00:00:39.239> it

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
lots of leaves and chunky fruits make it

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.060 
lots of leaves and chunky fruits make it
hard<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.840> grab<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.200> ingredients<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.860> pull

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
hard to grab the ingredients and pull

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.190 
hard to grab the ingredients and pull
them<00:00:41.219> into<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> blades<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> fair<00:00:42.899> bit<00:00:43.170> of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
them into the blades with a fair bit of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.600 
them into the blades with a fair bit of
elbow<00:00:43.530> grease<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:44.100> paddle<00:00:44.700> makes<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> possible

elbow grease a paddle makes it possible
the<00:00:47.610> second<00:00:48.000> reason<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:49.110> frozen<00:00:49.469> desserts

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the second reason is for frozen desserts

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.069 
the second reason is for frozen desserts
you<00:00:50.430> need<00:00:50.610> two<00:00:50.730> super<00:00:51.210> powered<00:00:51.570> blender<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you need two super powered blender to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.020 
you need two super powered blender to
take<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> whole<00:00:52.739> bowl<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.160> frozen<00:00:53.399> fruit<00:00:53.699> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
take on a whole bowl of frozen fruit and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
take on a whole bowl of frozen fruit and
just<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.719> green<00:00:54.989> smoothies<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.890> frozen

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
just like green smoothies the frozen

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.740 
just like green smoothies the frozen
fruit<00:00:56.579> pieces<00:00:56.789> tend<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> clump<00:00:57.539> together

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
fruit pieces tend to clump together

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
fruit pieces tend to clump together
often<00:00:58.559> need<00:00:58.770> help<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.160> combine<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> building

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
often need help to combine the building

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
often need help to combine the building
and<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:01.530> third<00:01:01.800> reason<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.370> paddle<00:01:02.699> is

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and the third reason for the paddle is

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.750 
and the third reason for the paddle is
that<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.329> helps<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.140> igloo<00:01:04.549> igloos<00:01:05.549> are

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that it helps with the igloo igloos are

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640 
that it helps with the igloo igloos are
caused<00:01:05.970> by<00:01:06.180> air<00:01:06.330> pockets<00:01:06.750> forming<00:01:07.170> above<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
caused by air pockets forming above the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.920 
caused by air pockets forming above the
blades<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.670> blades<00:01:08.909> end<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.299> spinning<00:01:09.750> in

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
blades so the blades end up spinning in

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.510 
blades so the blades end up spinning in
thin<00:01:10.200> air<00:01:10.380> while<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> mass<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> unblended

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
thin air while a mass of unblended

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.240 
thin air while a mass of unblended
ingredients<00:01:12.330> are<00:01:12.450> stuck<00:01:12.659> above<00:01:13.189> igloo<00:01:14.189> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
ingredients are stuck above igloo is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.740 
ingredients are stuck above igloo is
tend<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.610> form<00:01:14.909> most<00:01:15.119> often<00:01:15.479> when<00:01:15.630> you're

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
tend to form most often when you're

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.480 
tend to form most often when you're
blending<00:01:16.020> milk<00:01:16.470> with<00:01:16.680> ice<00:01:16.860> which

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
blending milk with ice which

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.399 
blending milk with ice which
unfortunately<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.570> two<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> core

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
unfortunately are two of the core

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.969 
unfortunately are two of the core
ingredients<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:20.040> most<00:01:20.340> smoothies<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.680> power

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
ingredients of most smoothies so power

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.420 
ingredients of most smoothies so power
comes<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.460> handy<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.390> those<00:01:24.509> tasks

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
comes in handy for all of those tasks

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.730 
comes in handy for all of those tasks
but<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.299> bit<00:01:27.479> ironic<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.170> blenders<00:01:28.590> were

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
but it's a bit ironic that blenders were

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
but it's a bit ironic that blenders were
designed<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> help<00:01:29.430> reduce<00:01:29.700> manual<00:01:30.299> labor<00:01:30.479> yet

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
designed to help reduce manual labor yet

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.260 
designed to help reduce manual labor yet
the<00:01:31.380> paddle<00:01:31.799> brings<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.490> manual<00:01:32.820> labor<00:01:32.880> back

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the paddle brings that manual labor back

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.270 
the paddle brings that manual labor back
to<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> process<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.619> problems<00:01:35.009> just

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
to the process but it's problems just

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.620 
to the process but it's problems just
like<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> designers<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
like this that the designers and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.569 
like this that the designers and
engineers<00:01:36.780> at<00:01:37.200> Breville<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.799> love<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.369> try

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
engineers at Breville just love to try

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.880 
engineers at Breville just love to try
and<00:01:38.700> tackle<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.810> thought<00:01:40.110> what<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.590> there's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
and tackle so we thought what if there's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.920 
and tackle so we thought what if there's
a<00:01:40.950> way<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.490> able<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.790> bend<00:01:42.150> virtually<00:01:42.720> any

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
a way to be able to bend virtually any

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.469 
a way to be able to bend virtually any
combination<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.829> ingredients<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.210> so

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
combination of ingredients but to do so

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.990 
combination of ingredients but to do so
with<00:01:45.930> less<00:01:46.110> intervention<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> solution

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
with less intervention so the solution

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.980 
with less intervention so the solution
with<00:01:48.780> pro<00:01:49.079> kinetics<00:01:50.060> most<00:01:51.060> domestic<00:01:51.600> vendors

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
with pro kinetics most domestic vendors

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.109 
with pro kinetics most domestic vendors
tend<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> small<00:01:52.890> raised<00:01:53.340> blade<00:01:53.729> tree
