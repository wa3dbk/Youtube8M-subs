00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
this is what it looks like it didn't

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.690

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.580 
don't know why because all of their
pallets<00:02:48.280> usually<00:02:48.730> have<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> film<00:02:49.330> but<00:02:50.080> they<00:02:50.320> are

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
pallets usually have a film but they are

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.780 
pallets usually have a film but they are
intact<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.850> they<00:02:52.510> are<00:02:52.750> very<00:02:53.050> very<00:02:53.320> beautiful

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790

little concerned about is the second one
which<00:06:59.820> is<00:06:59.850> stark<00:07:00.750> I<00:07:01.080> didn't<00:07:01.860> notice<00:07:02.810> anything

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
can just use a clean brush and it will

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.510 
can just use a clean brush and it will
be<00:07:15.540> the<00:07:15.720> exact<00:07:16.050> same<00:07:16.290> thing<00:07:16.560> so<00:07:16.770> I<00:07:17.190> don't<00:07:17.220> know
