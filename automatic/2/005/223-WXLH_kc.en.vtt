00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
it before you sew it so i would and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.349 
it before you sew it so i would and

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
heat setting you can always heat set it

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.639 
heat setting you can always heat set it
with<00:02:02.819> an<00:02:02.999> iron<00:02:03.179> but<00:02:03.599> since<00:02:04.200> we're<00:02:04.380> probably

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
with an iron but since we're probably

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.339 
with an iron but since we're probably
not<00:02:04.979> going<00:02:05.279> to<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.520> washing<00:02:06.209> it<00:02:06.389> i<00:02:06.630> don't<00:02:06.990> think

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
not going to be washing it i don't think

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.469 
not going to be washing it i don't think
it's<00:02:07.499> a<00:02:07.619> problem<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.789> want<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.149> turn<00:02:09.300> it

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.110 
use my fabric tack cartridge with it so
what<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.430> would<00:03:13.580> do<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:15.220> take<00:03:16.220> your<00:03:16.760> glue

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
what you would do is take your glue

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.990 
what you would do is take your glue
glider<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.780> if<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.860> are<00:03:19.040> not<00:03:19.190> familiar<00:03:19.490> with

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
glider and if you are not familiar with

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.110 
glider and if you are not familiar with
these<00:03:20.300> this<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:20.990> how<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:21.530> comes<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.370> sold

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
these this is how it comes it is sold

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.320 
these this is how it comes it is sold
with<00:03:26.050> 11<00:03:27.220> cartridge<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.459> it's<00:03:28.730> usually<00:03:28.940> like

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
with 11 cartridge and it's usually like

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.160

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
now what's good about these is you

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.270 
now what's good about these is you
literally<00:03:35.959> just<00:03:36.470> snap<00:03:36.920> them<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.640> out<00:03:37.790> and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
literally just snap them in and out and

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.360

my little fabric bond on the lace and
you<00:03:47.660> can<00:03:47.840> kind<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.350> see<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.740> there<00:03:49.040> looks<00:03:49.490> like

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
you can kind of see it there looks like

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.690 
you can kind of see it there looks like
your<00:03:50.150> regular<00:03:50.360> adhesives<00:03:51.200> put<00:03:51.920> it<00:03:52.040> on<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.550> my

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
saying what they are fabric bond this

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.300 
saying what they are fabric bond this
one<00:04:32.150> says<00:04:32.419> permit
