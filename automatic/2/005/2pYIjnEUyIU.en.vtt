00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
it yourselves because you might have

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.130 
it yourselves because you might have
been<00:00:31.890> curious<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.610> know<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.480> was<00:00:33.660> actually

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
been curious to know if it was actually

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.700 
been curious to know if it was actually
in<00:00:34.320> GTA<00:00:35.160> online<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.020> footage<00:00:37.440> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
in GTA online and with this footage it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
in GTA online and with this footage it
actually<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.640> only<00:00:39.149> reason<00:00:39.570> why<00:00:39.719> I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
actually is the only reason why I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.560 
actually is the only reason why I
believe<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.739> GTA<00:00:41.129> online<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.270> maybe

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
believe it's in GTA online is that maybe

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.410 
believe it's in GTA online is that maybe
there's<00:00:42.930> more<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> UFO<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.370> don't<00:00:45.270> know

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
there's more to the UFO I don't know

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.630 
there's more to the UFO I don't know
what<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> could<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.860> all<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
what it could be and for all we know it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.100 
what it could be and for all we know it
could<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.180> be<00:00:48.300> nothing<00:00:48.840> more<00:00:49.050> than

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
could just be nothing more than

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.439 
could just be nothing more than
something<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.160> look<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.489> nothing<00:00:51.239> more

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
something to look at nothing more

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.500 
something to look at nothing more
nothing<00:00:52.079> less<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:53.520> also<00:00:53.670> confirm<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
nothing less I can also confirm that the

with<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.460> underwater<00:01:26.850> UFO<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.630> guess<00:01:28.080> it's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
with this underwater UFO I guess it's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.810 
with this underwater UFO I guess it's
still<00:01:28.470> pretty<00:01:28.619> cool<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> discover<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.670> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
still pretty cool to discover that it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.050 
still pretty cool to discover that it
that<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.689> GTA<00:01:31.079> online<00:01:31.369> also<00:01:32.369> another

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that it is in GTA online also another

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.530 
that it is in GTA online also another
thing<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.750> suggest<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.180> if<00:01:36.180> more

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
thing that I can suggest is that if more

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630 
thing that I can suggest is that if more
than<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.750> person<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> submarine<00:01:38.369> in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
than one person can have a submarine in

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.359 
than one person can have a submarine in
the<00:01:38.790> same<00:01:39.000> server<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.750> GTA<00:01:40.530> online<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.009> haven't

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the same server in GTA online I haven't

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.980 
the same server in GTA online I haven't
tried<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.119> I'm<00:01:42.240> not<00:01:42.450> exactly<00:01:42.570> sure

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
tried this out so I'm not exactly sure

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.080 
tried this out so I'm not exactly sure
but<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.850> than<00:01:44.909> one

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
but if you can have more than one

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.109 
but if you can have more than one
submarine<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> same<00:01:46.409> server<00:01:46.820> maybe<00:01:47.820> try

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
submarine in the same server maybe try

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.399 
submarine in the same server maybe try
and<00:01:48.240> get<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> lot<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> people<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.259> get<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and get a lot of people to get a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.800 
and get a lot of people to get a
submarine<00:01:49.950> each<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.549> go<00:01:50.820> down<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.329> UFO

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
submarine each and go down to the UFO

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
submarine each and go down to the UFO
all<00:01:52.049> at<00:01:52.229> once<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.619> see<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:53.220> anything

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
all at once and see if anything

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.149 
all at once and see if anything
different<00:01:54.119> happens<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:55.009> might<00:01:56.009> be

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
different happens I might be

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.459 
different happens I might be
overthinking<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:57.000> through<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.140> doesn't

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
overthinking this through but it doesn't

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.560 
overthinking this through but it doesn't
sound<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> bad<00:01:59.100> idea<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
sound like a bad idea if it actually it

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.539 
sound like a bad idea if it actually it
if<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.140> actually<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.649> possible<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.369> have

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
if it actually is possible to have

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.319 
if it actually is possible to have
multiple<00:02:02.579> summer<00:02:03.450> eens<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:04.229> every<00:02:04.560> person

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
multiple summer eens for every person

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.609 
multiple summer eens for every person
also<00:02:06.329> if<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.630> didn't<00:02:07.140> know<00:02:07.259> where<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.560> was

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
also if you didn't know where this was

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.460 
also if you didn't know where this was
located<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.819> map<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.170> it's

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
located on the map then here it is it's

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.619 
located on the map then here it is it's
right<00:02:11.250> at<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> very<00:02:11.550> top<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> map<00:02:12.330> which

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
right at the very top of the map which

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.640 
right at the very top of the map which
means<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.200> should

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
means it should

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.460 
means it should
be<00:02:13.860> hard<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.760> find<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.870> guess<00:02:16.049> that's<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.409> for

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
be hard to find so I guess that's it for

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.380 
be hard to find so I guess that's it for
