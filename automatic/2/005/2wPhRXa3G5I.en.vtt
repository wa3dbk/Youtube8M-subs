okay<00:00:03.270> what<00:00:03.419> we're<00:00:03.540> showing<00:00:03.689> here<00:00:03.840> is<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.080> part

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
okay what we're showing here is a part

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.320 
okay what we're showing here is a part
being<00:00:04.680> cut<00:00:04.890> we<00:00:05.100> just<00:00:05.310> did<00:00:05.490> our<00:00:05.520> first<00:00:06.000> rapid

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
being cut we just did our first rapid

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.530 
being cut we just did our first rapid
traverse<00:00:06.899> move<00:00:07.760> yeah<00:00:08.760> we're<00:00:09.150> piercing<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
traverse move yeah we're piercing the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.560 
traverse move yeah we're piercing the
material<00:00:09.960> here<00:00:10.730> raising<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.759> water<00:00:11.940> level<00:00:12.120> up

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
material here raising the water level up

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.379 
material here raising the water level up
there<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> little<00:00:12.990> bit<00:00:13.200> too<00:00:13.910> to<00:00:14.910> avoid<00:00:15.089> some<00:00:15.330> of

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
there a little bit too to avoid some of

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.870 
there a little bit too to avoid some of
the<00:00:15.509> splash<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.260> keep<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> noise<00:00:17.130> down<00:00:22.880> let's

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the splash and keep the noise down let's

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.429 
the splash and keep the noise down let's
close<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> nozzle<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.350> little

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
close up of the nozzle there the little

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.170 
close up of the nozzle there the little
foam<00:00:25.740> piece<00:00:26.010> around<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> keep<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
foam piece around it just to keep the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.350 
foam piece around it just to keep the
splashdown<00:00:31.430> we're<00:00:32.430> cutting<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.300> is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
splashdown we're cutting I think this is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.530 
splashdown we're cutting I think this is
half<00:00:33.630> inch<00:00:33.930> aluminum

there is another little shot of the

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.190 
there is another little shot of the
abrasives<00:02:03.090> coming<00:02:03.420> into<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.810> abrasive

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
abrasives coming into the abrasive

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.440 
abrasives coming into the abrasive
hopper<00:02:04.410> it's<00:02:04.740> pumped<00:02:05.400> in<00:02:05.490> there<00:02:05.520> using<00:02:06.330> a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
hopper it's pumped in there using a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.180 
hopper it's pumped in there using a
high-pressure<00:02:06.810> air<00:02:09.679> piercing<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.770> material

high-pressure air piercing the material

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.230 
high-pressure air piercing the material
again<00:02:15.740> there's<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.220> bump<00:02:17.459> crank<00:02:17.820> go<00:02:17.940> ahead

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
again there's the bump crank go ahead

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:28.280 
again there's the bump crank go ahead
it's<00:02:18.360> crankshaft<00:02:18.900> style<00:02:19.290> pump<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:27.290> little

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
it's crankshaft style pump a little

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.680 
it's crankshaft style pump a little
close<00:02:28.500> up<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> nozzle<00:02:29.130> there<00:02:29.550> okay<00:02:30.450> here's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
close up of the nozzle there okay here's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.330 
close up of the nozzle there okay here's
the<00:02:30.870> braces<00:02:31.320> coming<00:02:31.620> out<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.920> abrasive

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the braces coming out of the abrasive

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.970 
the braces coming out of the abrasive
hopper<00:02:32.790> being<00:02:33.060> pumped<00:02:33.620> through<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.709> little

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
hopper being pumped through a little

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.949 
hopper being pumped through a little
clear<00:02:35.190> plastic<00:02:35.400> tube<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.239> anywhere<00:02:39.780> from

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
clear plastic tube is this anywhere from

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.050 
clear plastic tube is this anywhere from
about<00:02:40.140> half<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.800> pound<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.250> pound<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.700> minute<00:02:41.970> of

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
about half a pound to pound a minute of

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.699 
about half a pound to pound a minute of
abrasive<00:02:42.630> here's<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.959> little<00:02:43.200> gate<00:02:43.440> that's

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
abrasive here's a little gate that's

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.949 
abrasive here's a little gate that's
being<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.220> little<00:02:44.820> cylinder<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.390> pushes<00:02:45.810> the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
being a little cylinder it pushes the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.890 
being a little cylinder it pushes the
gate<00:02:46.140> open<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.770> let<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.160> abrasive<00:02:47.610> fall<00:02:48.510> into

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
gate open to let the abrasive fall into

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.650 
gate open to let the abrasive fall into
the<00:02:49.020> tube<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.220> sucks<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:50.970> abrasive<00:02:51.420> into

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
the tube that sucks the abrasive into

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:03.640 
the tube that sucks the abrasive into
the<00:02:51.750> nozzle<00:03:01.850> all<00:03:02.850> right<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.090> see

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
the nozzle all right you can see

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.240 
the nozzle all right you can see
itself<00:03:03.980> off<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.900> that's<00:03:06.769> pretty<00:03:06.980> much<00:03:07.099> it

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
itself off and that's pretty much it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.759 
itself off and that's pretty much it
lowering<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:08.030> water<00:03:08.239> here<00:03:08.599> to<00:03:09.140> expose<00:03:09.739> the

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
lowering the water here to expose the

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.600 
lowering the water here to expose the
part<00:03:10.269> you<00:03:11.269> see<00:03:11.689> some<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.049> abrasive<00:03:12.610> around

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
part you see some of the abrasive around

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.880 
part you see some of the abrasive around
the<00:03:13.730> table<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.269> as<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.319> can<00:03:15.470> see<00:03:15.500> this<00:03:15.709> is

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
the table and as you can see this is

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.860 
the table and as you can see this is
taken<00:03:16.220> at<00:03:16.340> trade<00:03:16.640> show<00:03:16.849> so<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.329> ends<00:03:17.629> this
