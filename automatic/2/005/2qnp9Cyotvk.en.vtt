00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
just doesn't look amazing to me I

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.190 
just doesn't look amazing to me I
thought<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.910> galaxy<00:04:05.299> s2<00:04:05.389> looked<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.959> little

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
thought the galaxy s2 looked a little

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.670 
thought the galaxy s2 looked a little
better<00:04:06.620> on<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:07.370> structure<00:04:07.790> side<00:04:08.000> of<00:04:08.120> things

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
better on the structure side of things

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.890 
better on the structure side of things
but<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.739> being<00:04:10.129> said<00:04:10.540> I'm<00:04:11.540> not<00:04:11.599> going<00:04:11.840> to

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
but that being said I'm not going to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.339 
but that being said I'm not going to
complain<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:13.280> spec-wise<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.449> looks<00:04:14.629> fantastic

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
complain it spec-wise it looks fantastic

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.569 
complain it spec-wise it looks fantastic
and<00:04:15.769> that's<00:04:15.949> really<00:04:16.190> what<00:04:16.370> matters<00:04:17.109> but<00:04:18.109> yeah

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
and that's really what matters but yeah

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.230 
and that's really what matters but yeah
I<00:04:19.579> think<00:04:20.530> I'm<00:04:21.530> kind<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.829> hoping<00:04:22.190> actually<00:04:23.060> that

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
I think I'm kind of hoping actually that

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.950 
I think I'm kind of hoping actually that
the<00:04:23.360> US<00:04:23.630> version<00:04:23.870> gets<00:04:24.140> a<00:04:24.289> little<00:04:24.469> bit<00:04:24.830> of<00:04:24.979> a<00:04:25.280> a

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
the US version gets a little bit of a a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.600 
the US version gets a little bit of a a
revamped<00:04:26.960> structure

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
revamped structure

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.610 
revamped structure

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
on the physical side of things on the

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.170 
on the physical side of things on the
hardware<00:04:30.039> because<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.550> just<00:04:30.849> looks<00:04:31.090> too

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180
