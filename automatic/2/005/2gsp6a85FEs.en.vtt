the sound hole and it has a volume wheel
in<00:07:05.130> a<00:07:05.250> tone<00:07:05.490> wheel<00:07:05.730> that's<00:07:05.940> like<00:07:06.120> a<00:07:06.150> the<00:07:06.870> tone

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 
in a tone wheel that's like a the tone

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.260 
in a tone wheel that's like a the tone
works<00:07:07.290> in<00:07:07.470> this<00:07:07.560> instance<00:07:07.980> where<00:07:08.850> a<00:07:08.880> sweepable

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
works in this instance where a sweepable

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.910 
works in this instance where a sweepable
mid<00:07:09.570> basically<00:07:10.080> if<00:07:10.140> you<00:07:10.200> roll<00:07:10.380> it<00:07:10.470> to<00:07:10.560> one<00:07:10.680> side

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:10.920 
mid basically if you roll it to one side

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.010 
mid basically if you roll it to one side
it's<00:07:11.100> flat<00:07:11.340> roll<00:07:12.030> at<00:07:12.150> the<00:07:12.180> other<00:07:12.360> side<00:07:12.630> it<00:07:12.810> kind

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
it's flat roll at the other side it kind

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.810 
it's flat roll at the other side it kind
of<00:07:13.110> scoops<00:07:13.320> the<00:07:13.530> mid-range<00:07:13.860> you<00:07:14.370> can<00:07:14.520> do<00:07:14.610> like

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
of scoops the mid-range you can do like

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.610 
of scoops the mid-range you can do like
a<00:07:14.850> you<00:07:15.180> know<00:07:15.270> a<00:07:15.360> lower<00:07:15.570> mid<00:07:15.840> but<00:07:16.020> like<00:07:16.170> a<00:07:16.200> punchy

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
a you know a lower mid but like a punchy

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.800 
a you know a lower mid but like a punchy
high<00:07:16.800> and<00:07:17.040> they<00:07:17.130> squeal<00:07:17.550> oh<00:07:17.700> and<00:07:18.240> then<00:07:18.570> there's

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
high and they squeal oh and then there's

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.690 
high and they squeal oh and then there's
a<00:07:18.870> bass<00:07:19.350> boost<00:07:19.590> switch<00:07:19.890> on<00:07:20.100> this<00:07:20.250> model<00:07:20.460> as

well it can install this pickup in the
smaller<00:07:23.370> body<00:07:23.640> guitars<00:07:24.090> that<00:07:24.750> might<00:07:24.960> need<00:07:25.110> a

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.140 
smaller body guitars that might need a

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.560 
smaller body guitars that might need a
little<00:07:25.500> oomph<00:07:25.620> in<00:07:25.830> the<00:07:25.920> bass<00:07:26.070> Department<00:07:26.640> we

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
also then mount a Velcro battery bag and

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.610 
also then mount a Velcro battery bag and
you<00:07:31.050> need<00:07:31.170> nine<00:07:31.410> bowls<00:07:31.740> to<00:07:31.980> power<00:07:32.160> the<00:07:32.370> preamp

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
you need nine bowls to power the preamp

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.980 
you need nine bowls to power the preamp
for<00:07:34.130> this<00:07:34.280> particular<00:07:34.520> system<00:07:34.940> so<00:07:35.630> that's
