I mean guess I think of music as as a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.510 
I mean guess I think of music as as a
therapist<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:22.830> great<00:00:23.010> thing<00:00:23.160> about<00:00:23.189> is

you don't have to necessarily pay this
for<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.710> therapy<00:00:26.070> hourly<00:00:26.790> too<00:00:27.060> much<00:00:27.270> you
