00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.009 
brake bolt you want to grease it up I've
just<00:00:08.970> painted<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.360> black<00:00:11.750> you<00:00:12.750> know<00:00:12.840> that's

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
just painted this black you know that's

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.700 
just painted this black you know that's
obviously<00:00:13.730> not<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> requirement<00:00:15.470> and<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.590> will

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
obviously not a requirement and it will

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.529 
obviously not a requirement and it will
probably<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.310> did<00:00:17.430> put<00:00:17.699> some<00:00:17.850> clearcoat<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.390> it

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
probably I did put some clearcoat on it

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.810 
probably I did put some clearcoat on it
but<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.779> will<00:00:18.900> probably<00:00:19.140> end<00:00:19.590> up<00:00:20.340> shifting<00:00:20.609> I

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
but it will probably end up shifting I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.840 
but it will probably end up shifting I
would<00:00:20.910> imagine<00:00:21.350> maybe<00:00:22.350> not<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.519> does<00:00:23.670> I'll

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
would imagine maybe not if it does I'll

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.009 
would imagine maybe not if it does I'll
just<00:00:24.080> sand<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.170> down<00:00:26.210> no<00:00:27.210> big<00:00:27.420> deal<00:00:29.720> next<00:00:30.720> thing

crank that down and then now we'll move
on<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.330> next<00:01:32.450> step<00:01:34.330> okay<00:01:35.330> once<00:01:35.570> that's

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
on to the next step okay once that's

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.810 
on to the next step okay once that's

where you need it to be go ahead and
take<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:38.920> cotter<00:01:39.920> pin<00:01:40.220> there<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.759> clip<00:01:41.240> that

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
I'm just going to use a cotter pin go

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.180 
I'm just going to use a cotter pin go
ahead<00:01:46.789> and<00:01:46.880> put<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.030> through<00:01:47.479> there<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.979> get

clip on just yet and I would recommend
you<00:04:22.669> do<00:04:22.790> the<00:04:22.880> same<00:04:22.940> because<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.389> want<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.600> go

ahead<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:25.150> get<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.270> adjusted<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.440> where<00:04:27.530> you

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
ahead and get that adjusted to where you

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.350 
ahead and get that adjusted to where you
you<00:04:28.190> like<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.370> feel<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:29.060> then<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.870> last<00:04:30.020> step

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
you like the feel and then the last step

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.670 
you like the feel and then the last step
and<00:04:32.360> we're<00:04:32.630> also<00:04:32.750> not<00:04:33.050> gonna<00:04:33.200> do<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:33.470> safety

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
and we're also not gonna do the safety

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.610 
and we're also not gonna do the safety
wire<00:04:33.950> just<00:04:34.280> yet<00:04:34.630> I'll<00:04:35.630> make<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.870> separate<00:04:36.320> video

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
wire just yet I'll make a separate video

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.210 
wire just yet I'll make a separate video
on<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:36.830> because<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:39.410> can<00:04:39.560> buy<00:04:39.710> those<00:04:39.890> safety

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
on that because you can buy those safety

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.090 
on that because you can buy those safety
wires<00:04:40.400> anywhere<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.810> last<00:04:42.020> step<00:04:42.290> would<00:04:42.680> be<00:04:42.740> to

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
wires anywhere the last step would be to

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.480 
wires anywhere the last step would be to
actually<00:04:43.370> put<00:04:43.730> on<00:04:43.820> your<00:04:43.850> cleat<00:04:45.160> it's<00:04:46.160> just<00:04:46.370> two

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
actually put on your cleat it's just two

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.200 
actually put on your cleat it's just two
pound<00:04:46.880> one<00:04:46.970> head<00:04:47.120> bolts<00:04:48.760> go<00:04:49.760> ahead<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.090> put

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
pound one head bolts go ahead and put

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.240 
pound one head bolts go ahead and put
that<00:04:50.240> on<00:04:50.419> where<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:51.380> think<00:04:51.620> it<00:04:51.740> needs<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.010> be

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
that on where you think it needs to be

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.360 
that on where you think it needs to be
and<00:04:52.870> then<00:04:53.870> sit<00:04:54.380> on<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.500> bike<00:04:54.680> step<00:04:55.190> on<00:04:55.310> the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
and then sit on the bike step on the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.159 
and then sit on the bike step on the
bike<00:04:55.520> whatever<00:04:55.729> and<00:04:56.510> make<00:04:56.630> sure<00:04:56.780> that's<00:04:56.900> right

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
bike whatever and make sure that's right

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.100 
bike whatever and make sure that's right
the<00:04:57.500> right<00:04:57.650> position<00:04:58.810> preferably<00:04:59.810> with<00:04:59.930> your

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
the right position preferably with your

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.800 
the right position preferably with your
boots<00:05:00.290> on<00:05:00.580> shoes<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:01.910> boots<00:05:02.030> are<00:05:02.300> totally

boots on shoes and boots are totally

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.770 
boots on shoes and boots are totally
different<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:03.770> then<00:05:04.220> that's<00:05:05.060> basically<00:05:05.210> it

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
different and then that's basically it

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.920 
different and then that's basically it
for<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.470> brake<00:05:06.880> lever<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.960> cleat<00:05:09.200> so<00:05:10.930> see

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
for the brake lever and the cleat so see

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.820 
for the brake lever and the cleat so see
it's<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:14.210> looks<00:05:14.240> pretty<00:05:14.600> good<00:05:14.780> get<00:05:15.440> some<00:05:15.590> gold

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
it's it looks pretty good get some gold

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.870 
it's it looks pretty good get some gold
a<00:05:16.540> little<00:05:17.540> bit<00:05:17.810> of<00:05:17.870> gold<00:05:17.990> here<00:05:18.229> in<00:05:18.260> there<00:05:18.880> and

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
a little bit of gold here in there and

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.840 
a little bit of gold here in there and
it<00:05:19.970> matches<00:05:20.180> okay<00:05:20.510> so<00:05:21.460> anyway<00:05:22.460> that's<00:05:22.580> pretty

video<00:05:25.130> for<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.700> gear<00:05:26.150> shift<00:05:26.419> lever<00:05:26.479> it'll<00:05:27.410> be

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
video for the gear shift lever it'll be

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.500 
video for the gear shift lever it'll be
a<00:05:27.530> short<00:05:27.770> one<00:05:27.950> so<00:05:28.250> anyway<00:05:29.120> thanks<00:05:29.450> for
