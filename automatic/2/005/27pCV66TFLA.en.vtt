00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.930
 in order to create your 3d 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.690
 dragon you will need 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.690
 paper sheet and printer 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.600
 cook it and start doing it 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.519
 me 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.199
 download the template you can on the website 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.199
 handwork point ru service will be let down 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.500
 we begin to oblige the dragon 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.960
 what would you imagine that we 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080
 now we are going to make a video 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.590
 full screen you see now 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.949
 image 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.909
 This is a dragon that should turn out 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.060
 us in the end 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.250
 what we have to write out 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.910
 who wants to start right now 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.520
 cut and look like rizaeva yachts 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.770
 put on deck 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.050
 if you would cut yourself a dragon you can safely 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.290
 squander for 58 minutes 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.600
 and those who watch 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.000
 so i cut 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.090
 we know the creators 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.410
 this dragon 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.590
 all rent is 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.050
 I am self-taught which push 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.380
 coalition approach 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.270
 wherein knowledge is passed on to one 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.400
 one or yanis to another 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.410
 own mistakes 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.140
 art we experienced became interested in 12 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.730
 years old 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.550
 12 year old skeptic at school 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.760
 basketball competitions noticed 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 that the losing team denis his 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.110
 tried to lose 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.820
 and for this he concluded that what 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.760
 team 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.160
 we did not lose 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.290
 she will blame the south anyway 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.310
 and after that dillinger became 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.010
 question everything around him 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.600
 one of the reasons why i am so interested 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.840
 three-dimensional optical 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.700
 illusions 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.890
 that's what i don't believe paranormal 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.580
 phenomena of brightness 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.590
 after my death i'm looking forever i think 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.030
 that this life is the only one 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.920
 we have 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.040
 I hope that after my death, my 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.719
 records 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.819
 and all that remains after me do 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:43.569
 human attitude much 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.689
 the best of this quote said Andrews Terek 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.220
 so we are almost done 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.910
 in Ryazan dragon 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.910
 and soon the dragon will be ready ksk leykin 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 let's take a closer look what we did 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.040
 so toe bai 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.040
 bottom part 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.859
 paper document 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.859
 see how it is done in the picture 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.029
 Olya we will sing along sing extremely 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.029
 parts 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.509
 so that's what we do 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.909
 now where is the black box 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.759
 as a result, bye inward 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.889
 this segment 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.889
 there is a dotted line 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.919
 it should work 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.159
 now let's see how we need to glue 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.729
 as you can see there should be some 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.359
 to file 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.359
 square stand 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.079
 and who works dragon 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:54.119
 so now wears glue 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:56.459
 in the picture arrows indicate the places where 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.459
 need to carry glue 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.749
 so whether it is applied 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:15.749
 kopeck management 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.580
 dragon bottom 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.199
 left glue face 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.429
 so first we will apply the same as this 

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:23.429
 everything should look 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.699
 so that u make then reception 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.699
 now have any more obedient 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.960
 but critics 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.860
 and glue 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.330
 you can be a little bit 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.449
 umk it inside 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.620
 because we will have funds thousand will 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.770
 or not 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.770
 the dragon looks at us 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:40.039
 so our finish is almost ready 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.710
 if there is little glue then you can add 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.180
 a little more u 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.850
 so here we end up being great 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.710
 a gift for the new year from the day of birth 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.080
 and indeed on any other holiday of the way 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.180
 dragon is the symbol of 2012 but it is relevant and 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.180
 in 2013 in 2014 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.629
 mostly got 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:01.860
 leads specifically for the site a handicap point 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.039
 rub 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.649
 all the best you can shave 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:07.889
 and do not forget to subscribe from you 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:09.869
