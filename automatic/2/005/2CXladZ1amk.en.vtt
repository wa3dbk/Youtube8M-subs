real quick i have most of its like it's

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.519 
real quick i have most of its like it's
kind<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.689> half<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.020> half<00:00:22.050> some<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.439> its

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
kind of like half and half some of its

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.279 
kind of like half and half some of its
on<00:00:22.590> high<00:00:22.769> some<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.070> its<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.310> low<00:00:23.990> but<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.170> can

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
on high some of its on low but you can

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.040 
on high some of its on low but you can
see<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.680> most<00:00:25.859> part<00:00:26.099> its<00:00:26.599> sound<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:27.810> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
see for the most part its sound like I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.050 
see for the most part its sound like I
guess<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.320> could<00:00:28.439> say<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.490> average<00:00:29.849> like

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
guess you could say it be average like

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.440 
guess you could say it be average like

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.639 
destination what she's saying for the
most<00:01:59.240> part<00:02:00.670> but<00:02:01.670> uh<00:02:01.990> yeah<00:02:02.990> that's<00:02:03.229> just<00:02:03.560> a

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
most part but uh yeah that's just a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.219 
most part but uh yeah that's just a
little<00:02:03.799> benchmark<00:02:04.280> just<00:02:04.459> to<00:02:04.520> show<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.729> guys

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
little benchmark just to show you guys

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.149 
little benchmark just to show you guys
what<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.319> can<00:02:06.440> do<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.590> don't<00:02:06.799> know<00:02:06.860> if<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.069> was

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
what it can do I don't know if that was

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.419 
what it can do I don't know if that was
graphics<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.670> tents<00:02:07.880> over<00:02:08.000> what<00:02:09.310> that's<00:02:10.310> just

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
graphics and tents over what that's just

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.470 
graphics and tents over what that's just
kind<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.700> what<00:02:10.789> it<00:02:10.940> can<00:02:11.060> do<00:02:11.180> while<00:02:11.330> it's

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
kind of what it can do while it's

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.479 
kind of what it can do while it's
recording<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:12.470> if<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.680> runs<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.010> lot<00:02:13.100> better<00:02:13.160> when

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
recording so if I runs a lot better when

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.520 
recording so if I runs a lot better when
it's<00:02:13.640> not<00:02:13.760> recording<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.870> know<00:02:15.049> the<00:02:15.380> whole

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
it's not recording you know the whole

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.120 
it's not recording you know the whole
thing<00:02:15.769> though<00:02:16.510> via<00:02:17.530> I'm<00:02:18.530> gonna<00:02:18.739> put<00:02:18.860> out<00:02:18.980> more

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
thing though via I'm gonna put out more

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.110 
thing though via I'm gonna put out more
benchmark<00:02:19.640> videos<00:02:20.410> soon<00:02:21.730> probably<00:02:22.730> like<00:02:22.940> two

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
benchmark videos soon probably like two
