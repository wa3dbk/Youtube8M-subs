00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
pretty neat specifically what this does

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.740 
pretty neat specifically what this does
is<00:00:49.649> create<00:00:50.010> an<00:00:50.100> icon<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.520> calendar<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.210> with

it you can select a range of dates and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.630 
it you can select a range of dates and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
it will repeat a event for each day and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580
