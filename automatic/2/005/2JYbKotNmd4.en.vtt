00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
body style was really coming toward the

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.270 
body style was really coming toward the
end<00:01:03.910> of<00:01:04.059> its<00:01:04.239> line<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:05.350> style<00:01:05.619> changed<00:01:06.100> again

end of its line the style changed again
for<00:01:06.490> 1982<00:01:07.119> so<00:01:07.509> there<00:01:08.020> was<00:01:08.110> only<00:01:08.259> a<00:01:08.320> few<00:01:08.470> years

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
for 1982 so there was only a few years

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.880 
for 1982 so there was only a few years
left<00:01:09.070> by<00:01:09.880> 1979<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.350> what<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.500> think<00:01:11.770> is

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
left by 1979 and what I think is

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.800 
left by 1979 and what I think is
interesting<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.550> how<00:01:12.789> different<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.570> cars

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
interesting is how different the cars

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.680 
interesting is how different the cars
look<00:01:14.140> at<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.920> late<00:01:15.100> 70s<00:01:15.729> as<00:01:15.970> opposed<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.570> the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.559 
definitely a front-runner it was only an
eight-point<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:05.280> one<00:04:05.489> compression<00:04:05.910> ratio

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
eight-point one to one compression ratio

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.800 
eight-point one to one compression ratio

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.410 
engine with the Pontiac 6x cylinder
heads<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:10.889> is<00:04:11.040> what<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:12.150> know<00:04:12.239> right

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
heads so this is what a you know right

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.550 
heads so this is what a you know right

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
like it's interesting to see how these

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.409 
like it's interesting to see how these
things<00:04:19.049> evolved<00:04:19.650> over<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:19.950> years<00:04:20.220> this<00:04:21.120> is

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
things evolved over the years this is

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.620 
things evolved over the years this is

the color of the block because these

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.900 
the color of the block because these

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
and all kinds of garbage so a lot of

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.839 
and all kinds of garbage so a lot of
people<00:04:37.200> rip<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.710> stuff<00:04:37.950> off<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:38.669> could

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
people rip that stuff off and you could

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.120 
people rip that stuff off and you could
put<00:04:39.060> earlier<00:04:39.720> pontiac<00:04:40.349> cylinder<00:04:40.740> heads<00:04:40.919> on<00:04:41.099> it

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
put earlier pontiac cylinder heads on it

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.339 
put earlier pontiac cylinder heads on it
to<00:04:41.400> raise<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.789> compression<00:04:42.240> ratio<00:04:42.390> and<00:04:42.870> make

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
to raise the compression ratio and make

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.260 
to raise the compression ratio and make
a<00:04:43.380> bunch<00:04:43.650> more<00:04:43.830> power<00:04:44.070> other<00:04:44.820> things<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.210> think

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
a bunch more power other things I think

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.189 
a bunch more power other things I think
are<00:04:45.479> kind<00:04:45.599> of<00:04:45.720> interesting

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
are kind of interesting

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.379 
are kind of interesting
there's<00:04:46.560> some<00:04:46.830> efforts<00:04:47.370> here<00:04:47.639> from<00:04:47.879> GM<00:04:48.210> to

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
there's some efforts here from GM to

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.140 
there's some efforts here from GM to
save<00:04:48.629> money<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.499> fender<00:04:49.919> supports<00:04:50.400> in<00:04:50.610> order

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
save money the fender supports in order

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.659 
save money the fender supports in order
to<00:04:51.240> fit<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.509> same<00:04:51.779> one<00:04:52.050> left<00:04:52.319> and<00:04:52.499> right<00:04:52.680> its

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
to fit the same one left and right its

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.610 
to fit the same one left and right its
flipped<00:04:54.029> so<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.569> it<00:04:54.689> angles<00:04:54.900> differently<00:04:55.499> on

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
flipped so that it angles differently on

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.860 
flipped so that it angles differently on
one<00:04:55.800> side<00:04:56.039> than<00:04:56.249> the<00:04:56.279> other<00:04:56.400> so<00:04:57.300> we<00:04:57.509> started<00:04:57.810> to

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
one side than the other so we started to

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.559 
one side than the other so we started to
see<00:04:57.990> some<00:04:58.020> cost-cutting<00:04:58.680> because<00:04:59.129> by<00:04:59.279> 79<00:04:59.819> the

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
see some cost-cutting because by 79 the

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.260 
see some cost-cutting because by 79 the
design<00:05:01.020> process<00:05:01.289> for<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.860> 82<00:05:02.370> Trans<00:05:02.580> Am<00:05:02.969> I'm

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
design process for the 82 Trans Am I'm

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.209 
design process for the 82 Trans Am I'm
sure<00:05:03.539> was<00:05:03.749> well<00:05:03.930> underway<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:04.979> they<00:05:05.099> were<00:05:05.189> just

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
sure was well underway so they were just

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.969 
sure was well underway so they were just
trying<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.669> get<00:05:06.029> these<00:05:06.180> down<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.479> road<00:05:06.979> the

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
trying to get these down the road the

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.219 
trying to get these down the road the
rear<00:05:08.189> gear<00:05:08.490> with<00:05:08.639> the<00:05:08.669> four-speed<00:05:09.180> was<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.389> 323

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229
