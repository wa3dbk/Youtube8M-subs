00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.390
 windows 7 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.220
 they did not mark windows windows 8 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.450
 but it works so you 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.270
 download me I will not do it 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.950
 because I already have them once 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.570

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.570

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.060
 from there you go on administration of the 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.060
 driver 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.170

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:30.830
