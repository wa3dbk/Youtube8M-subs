00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
hi Dave I think I hear the leak he can

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.650 
hi Dave I think I hear the leak he can
see<00:00:15.020> get<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> good<00:00:16.609> decent<00:00:17.609> view<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.180> there<00:00:18.390> but

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
see get a good decent view on there but

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.019 
see get a good decent view on there but
I<00:00:18.690> am<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:22.020> was<00:00:22.830> called<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> transmission

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
I am the was called the transmission

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.880 
I am the was called the transmission
cooler<00:00:24.660> oil<00:00:25.619> cooler<00:00:26.070> thermostat<00:00:26.930> had<00:00:27.930> was

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
cooler oil cooler thermostat had was

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.350 
cooler oil cooler thermostat had was
cracked<00:00:29.689> so<00:00:30.689> none<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.439> hoses<00:00:32.960> are<00:00:33.960> leaking

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
cracked so none of the hoses are leaking

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.780 
cracked so none of the hoses are leaking
it's<00:00:36.360> actually<00:00:37.040> show<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.100> right<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.370> what

it's actually show you right here what

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:59.799 
it's actually show you right here what
happened<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.870> part<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.160> here

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
happened it was this part right up here

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.150 
happened it was this part right up here
there's<00:01:00.809> supposed<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> plastic<00:01:01.620> piece

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
there's supposed to be a plastic piece

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.759 
there's supposed to be a plastic piece
that<00:01:02.550> holds<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.449> locking<00:01:04.019> ring<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.500> that's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
that holds this locking ring in that's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.100 
that holds this locking ring in that's
up<00:01:05.960> at<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.260> top<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> other<00:01:09.450> side<00:01:09.570> it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
up at the top and on the other side it

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.640 
up at the top and on the other side it
had<00:01:10.320> broken<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:12.330> was<00:01:12.600> wasn't<00:01:13.140> there's<00:01:13.530> an

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
had broken so it was wasn't there's an

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.190 
had broken so it was wasn't there's an
o-ring<00:01:13.830> within<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:15.360> coupling<00:01:15.930> here

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
o-ring within this like coupling here

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.340 
o-ring within this like coupling here
that<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> hose<00:01:17.270> connects<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> top<00:01:21.350> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that the hose connects on the top and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.760 
that the hose connects on the top and
you<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.280> see<00:01:23.670> how<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.320> that's<00:01:25.320> where<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.650> was

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
you can see how it's that's where it was

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.609 
you can see how it's that's where it was
leaking<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:33.110> ran<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.140> car<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
leaking and I just ran the car up the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.850 
leaking and I just ran the car up the
temperature<00:01:35.960> ran<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.170> up<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.439> down<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
temperature ran it up and down the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.880 
temperature ran it up and down the
street<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:39.140> before<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.560> would<00:01:40.680> do

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
street and before what it would do

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.179 
street and before what it would do
typically<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:42.030> after<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.720> stop<00:01:43.140> or<00:01:43.560> Park<00:01:43.950> it

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
typically just after you stop or Park it

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:54.980 
typically just after you stop or Park it
it<00:01:44.670> would<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:44.970> leak<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:52.070> I<00:01:53.070> was<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.479> just

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
it would just leak and I was just I just

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
it would just leak and I was just I just
wanted<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.530> make<00:01:55.680> sure<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.009> none<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
wanted to make sure that none of the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.929 
wanted to make sure that none of the
hoses<00:01:56.700> had<00:01:57.450> any<00:01:57.719> seal<00:01:58.020> problems<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.950> looks

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
hoses had any seal problems and looks

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.700 
hoses had any seal problems and looks
like<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.360> isn't<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:01.049> was<00:02:01.200> actually<00:02:01.530> just

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
like there isn't it was actually just

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.700 
like there isn't it was actually just
that<00:02:01.860> thermostat<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.670> failed<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.649> know

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that thermostat that failed you know

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.429 
that thermostat that failed you know
plastic<00:02:05.310> plastic<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.390> heat<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.930> know<00:02:07.049> not

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
plastic plastic and heat you know not

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.620 
plastic plastic and heat you know not
good<00:02:08.509> not<00:02:09.509> good<00:02:09.569> partners

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
good not good partners

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
good not good partners
that's<00:02:12.630> probably<00:02:12.840> what<00:02:13.110> happened<00:02:13.230> with<00:02:13.560> your

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that's probably what happened with your

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.420 
that's probably what happened with your
expansion<00:02:14.130> Tang<00:02:14.520> which<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:15.060> showed<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.540> before

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
expansion Tang which I showed you before

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.280 
expansion Tang which I showed you before
where<00:02:17.430> he<00:02:17.460> had<00:02:17.670> cracked<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.510> thing<00:02:19.140> was

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
where he had cracked on that thing was

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.350 
where he had cracked on that thing was
on<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.590> corner<00:02:20.240> over<00:02:21.240> here<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:23.250> uh<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:24.150> car

on this corner over here so uh the car

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.780 
on this corner over here so uh the car
is<00:02:24.480> good<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.810> pick<00:02:24.960> up<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.470> got<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.190> other<00:02:26.340> parts
