00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.260
 electric mill or chisel 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.740
 prepare a place on the door for hinges at 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.740
 this from 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.070
 there must be a distance of 200 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.140
 herbs and similarly below 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.000
 further preparation is carried out in 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.280
 box using circular saw 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.770
 or hacksaw and miter box 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.390
 we cut off the side parts at an angle of 45 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.800
 degrees 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.330
 then side vertical detail 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.190
 which will be located by 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.290
 we put loops to lateral 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.990
 surface of the door and mark up the place where 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.910
 there will be loops on the jamb 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.070
 required to leave a gap on top of the door from 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.950
 two to four millimeters and below from 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.290
 10 to 15 millimeters gap size 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.050
 depends on the operating conditions of the door and 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.120
 the material of which it is made 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.760
 using an electric cutter and chisel 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.579
 on the side of the box we make a groove under 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.010
 hinges hinge put in made 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.079
 under them indentations and drill using 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.449
 drill in the door leaf and on the side 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.290
 surface trim make recess 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.140
 for screws 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.110
 this eliminates the cracking of wood from 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.640
 which made the door elements 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.550
 the diameter of the recesses must be smaller 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.100
 the diameter of the screws used then 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.100
 hinges attach to the door leaf 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 self-tapping screws 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.650
 flip the door and on 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.200
 opposite side end on level 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.790
 from 90 to 120 millimeters with a drill 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.270
 and large diameter drills 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.830
 make a recess for installing the latch 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.020
 inserting it into the groove made 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.230
 pencil outline the shape of the future groove 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.300
 intended for fastening the latch 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.980
 then using the cutter do the deepening 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.940
 in which the face will be placed 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.940
 gate valve 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.180
 after that the valve body is inserted 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.250
 into the recess made this way 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.409
 that her face plate does not stand for 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.870
 door leaf plane body 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.330
 gate valves pull out of the door leaf 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.650
 then on the outside and inside 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.290
 the surface of the door leaf do 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:16.060
 markup under the latch handle after that 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.060
 holes for pens are drilled 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.970
 the latch is inserted into the made for it 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.590
 grooves 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.960
 recesses are made with a drill 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.530
 opposite the mounting holes on the front 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.660
 latch strips 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.700
 then screw the screws into the hole 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.090
 that secure the latch in the door 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.610
 the canvas 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.260
 after that using self-tapping screws we mount 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.099
 latch knobs and fasten 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.099
 decorative covers 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.440
 for this ends of the upper transverse part 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.629
 boxes using circular 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.740
 saws or hacksaws and stumps are trimmed under 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.810
 45 degree angle 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.400
 its base facing the door 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.440
 the canvas must be greater than the width 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.440
 46 millimeter canvas 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.110
 whole parts of a transverse element 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.640
 strapping with the help of a drill is done through 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.420
 holes for connecting elements 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.420
 the boxes 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.310
 then shorten the length of the side 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.530
 box items according to 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.269
 the height of the door leaf is impossible 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.689
 forget the need for compliance 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.040
 gaps further on a flat surface 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.200
 lay out the elements of the future door 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.180
 n-shaped boxes 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.010
 through pre- made holes all 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.730
 elements of the box are interconnected 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.730
 self-tapping screws 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.160
 then in the assembled design in the slots 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.140
 where the hinges will be attached do two 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.880
 through holes for fixing the box 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.470
 to the wall 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.080
 put the box vertically in the opening 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.210
 fasten it through the top hole with 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.450
 using a large screw or dowel to 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.450
 the wall 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.850
 using the level we are trying to 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.040
 the box is upright 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.930
 then fasten the bottom of the box 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.930
 similar and top 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.769
 after attaching to ru 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.199
 wall from the hinge between the box 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.600
 and the wall should remain a gap in which 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.430
 wooden wedges are placed after this 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.900
 screwing the screw into the wall for 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.900
 ensure hard coupling 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.319
 the door is hung using 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:36.150
 screws at the same time hinges close 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.020
 heads of screws which box 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.020
 attached to the wall 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.380
 then check the correctness 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.820
 she should n't hang the door 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.940
 spontaneously open and 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.940
 close 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.560
 then fix the top of the box 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.560
 with a wooden wedge 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.509
 we install locking on 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.280
 and for this we close the door and on the box 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.650
 opposite the bolt make a mark 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.960
 a pencil 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.460
 then drill the drill at this place 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.139
 holes the size of which should 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.139
 fit the bolt size 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.789
 then close the door and check to 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.949
 the second strapping element took 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.780
 vertical position for this 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.270
 visually check the size of the gap 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.080
 between the box and the canvas gap should 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.000
 be the same throughout 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.210
 then between the box and the wall opposite 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.039
 deadbolt insert wooden wedge then in 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.199
 recess made for lock bolt 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.020
 we attach a rigid fastener with a screw 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.270
 the whole structure then into the recess 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.430
 made for bolt lock with a self tapping screw 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.199
 attach the box to the wall while 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.090
 screw must go through the wedge 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.729
 providing a rigid mount throughout 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.199
 designs are finally fastened 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.360
 canvas with a box check 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.710
 the verticality of the whole structure then with 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.590
 using extra wedges 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.780
 fasten the construction to the wall of the hole 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.710
 closing bolt for bolt 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.710
 with screws 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.710
 space left empty 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.960
 between the strapping and the wall fill 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.610
 Foam for this paint 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.220
 scotch cover the front surfaces 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.200
 the box and door leaf then 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.430
 moistened with water spray from those 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.350
 surfaces that will 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.330
 interact with the foam in the gap between 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.920
 box and door leaf can 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.340
 insert gaskets to avoid 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.420
 deformation of the door under the influence of foam 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.870
 need to use industrial 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.610
 foam 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.460
 applied with special 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.889
 gun such foam is denser and and 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.919
 magnification factor is small 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:46.650
 apply foam let it harden then 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:49.379
 cut off the excess foam remove the paint 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:53.210
 scotch we remove the pads that were in 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:53.210
 the gap between the box and the canvas 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.300
 the platbands interconnect under 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.020
 45 degrees for this we use 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.020
 circular saw 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.020
 the size of the platbands is determined by the place 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.180
 the surface of the box which will be 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.270
 cover the casing covered with silicone 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.270
 gel 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.580
 trimmed trim enclose boxes 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.650
 and fasten to it with studs 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.650
 or nails with reduced caps 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:44.420
 received from the deepening 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.420
 nails covered with mastic in the color of the door
