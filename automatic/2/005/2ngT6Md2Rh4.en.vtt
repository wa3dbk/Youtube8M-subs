when you get into the spot and you
control<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.270> spot<00:03:10.660> then<00:03:11.230> it's<00:03:11.440> almost<00:03:11.650> like

only going to be in no static position

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.370 
only going to be in no static position
so<00:03:56.800> I<00:03:56.830> haven't<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.820> know<00:03:57.880> heard<00:03:58.750> any<00:03:58.960> videos

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
so I haven't you know heard any videos

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.900 
so I haven't you know heard any videos
yet<00:03:59.410> or<00:03:59.800> seen<00:04:00.040> any<00:04:00.220> videos<00:04:00.610> where<00:04:00.880> people

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.570 
yet or seen any videos where people
talked<00:04:01.840> about<00:04:02.110> where<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.560> weather<00:04:03.310> had

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
talked about where the weather had

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.970 
talked about where the weather had
changed<00:04:04.060> over<00:04:04.300> time<00:04:04.480> on<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.870> multiplayer<00:04:05.680> map

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
changed over time on the multiplayer map

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.100 
changed over time on the multiplayer map
and<00:04:06.160> I'm<00:04:06.250> sure<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.460> developers<00:04:07.390> are<00:04:07.570> deciding

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
and I'm sure the developers are deciding

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.170 
and I'm sure the developers are deciding
what's<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.530> best<00:04:08.740> course<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.430> action<00:04:09.580> where

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
what's the best course of action where

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.600 
what's the best course of action where
to<00:04:10.450> actually<00:04:10.780> have<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.860> weather<00:04:12.040> change<00:04:12.430> but

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.010 
to actually have the weather change but
you<00:04:12.700> can<00:04:12.820> see<00:04:12.940> here<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.240> snow<00:04:13.450> is<00:04:13.600> coming<00:04:13.780> in

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.050 
you can see here the snow is coming in
in<00:04:14.140> this<00:04:14.290> specific<00:04:14.770> location<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.490> if<00:04:15.940> you

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
this game on the showroom floor we have

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.170 
this game on the showroom floor we have
the<00:05:01.560> poison<00:05:01.979> dart<00:05:02.160> what<00:05:02.310> is<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.520> was<00:05:02.729> what<00:05:03.060> is

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
the poison dart what is that was what is

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.810 
the poison dart what is that was what is
essentially<00:05:03.660> Jessica<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.310> hitting<00:05:05.310> gun<00:05:05.460> but<00:05:05.699> it

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
essentially Jessica a hitting gun but it

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.180 
essentially Jessica a hitting gun but it
takes<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.240> lot<00:05:06.479> longer<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.870> focus<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.860> it

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
takes a lot longer to focus that and it

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.770 
takes a lot longer to focus that and it
takes<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.490> lot<00:05:08.669> longer<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:09.060> actually<00:05:09.449> shoot<00:05:09.630> it

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
takes a lot longer to actually shoot it

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.600 
takes a lot longer to actually shoot it
and<00:05:09.870> affect<00:05:10.139> the<00:05:10.260> person<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:10.800> there<00:05:11.460> is<00:05:11.580> a

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
and affect the person so there is a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.790 
and affect the person so there is a
poison<00:05:12.030> dart<00:05:12.060> which<00:05:12.510> essentially<00:05:13.320> gives<00:05:13.650> you

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
poison dart which essentially gives you

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.200 
poison dart which essentially gives you
stealing<00:05:14.220> all<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.430> hidden<00:05:14.610> points<00:05:14.970> for<00:05:15.120> that

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
stealing all the hidden points for that

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.510 
stealing all the hidden points for that
do<00:05:15.810> you<00:05:15.870> have<00:05:16.080> glimmer<00:05:16.560> which<00:05:16.830> is<00:05:17.010> right<00:05:17.370> now

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
do you have glimmer which is right now

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.830 
do you have glimmer which is right now
being<00:05:17.820> showcased<00:05:18.000> on<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.389> screen<00:05:18.630> on<00:05:18.750> the

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
being showcased on the screen on the

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.420 
being showcased on the screen on the
right<00:05:18.870> essentially<00:05:19.680> I<00:05:19.770> believe<00:05:20.130> that<00:05:20.250> makes

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
right essentially I believe that makes

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.520 
right essentially I believe that makes
you<00:05:20.550> invisible<00:05:20.910> to<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.360> other<00:05:21.479> team<00:05:21.780> Oh<00:05:21.990> or

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
you invisible to the other team Oh or

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.810 
you invisible to the other team Oh or
you<00:05:22.740> know<00:05:22.860> I<00:05:22.889> don't<00:05:23.190> know<00:05:23.370> how<00:05:23.490> it's<00:05:23.639> going<00:05:23.760> to

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
you know I don't know how it's going to

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.100 
you know I don't know how it's going to
look<00:05:23.910> from<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.270> other<00:05:24.419> side<00:05:24.630> i'm<00:05:24.870> assuming

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
look from the other side i'm assuming

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.540 
look from the other side i'm assuming
it's<00:05:25.380> just<00:05:25.620> going<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.770> be<00:05:25.830> like<00:05:25.979> this<00:05:26.190> story<00:05:26.460> a

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
it's just going to be like this story a

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.060 
it's just going to be like this story a
distorted<00:05:27.240> space<00:05:27.539> that<00:05:28.320> you<00:05:28.440> just<00:05:28.620> see<00:05:28.830> and<00:05:29.010> if

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
distorted space that you just see and if

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.350 
distorted space that you just see and if
you<00:05:29.160> run<00:05:29.400> into<00:05:29.430> somebody<00:05:29.820> you're<00:05:30.060> going<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.240> be

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
you run into somebody you're going to be

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.210 
you run into somebody you're going to be
able<00:05:30.389> to<00:05:30.690> kill<00:05:30.870> or<00:05:31.050> stun<00:05:31.289> them<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:32.070> as

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
able to kill or stun them and that as

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.159 
able to kill or stun them and that as
position<00:05:32.760> another<00:05:33.360> thing<00:05:33.539> is<00:05:33.660> disruption

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
position another thing is disruption

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.350 
position another thing is disruption
which<00:05:34.440> is<00:05:34.620> essentially<00:05:35.099> causes<00:05:35.760> havoc<00:05:36.000> on<00:05:36.240> the

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
which is essentially causes havoc on the

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.240 
which is essentially causes havoc on the
other<00:05:36.479> person's<00:05:37.169> screen<00:05:37.500> disrupts<00:05:38.010> their<00:05:38.099> HUD

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
other person's screen disrupts their HUD

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.370 
other person's screen disrupts their HUD
system<00:05:38.639> disruptors<00:05:39.240> screen<00:05:39.570> you<00:05:40.020> know<00:05:40.139> maybe

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
system disruptors screen you know maybe

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.230 
system disruptors screen you know maybe
make<00:05:40.979> some<00:05:41.160> go<00:05:41.280> blind<00:05:41.639> you<00:05:41.820> can't<00:05:42.090> see

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
make some go blind you can't see

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.969 
make some go blind you can't see
everything<00:05:42.360> kind<00:05:42.780> of<00:05:42.840> like<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.139> Firecracker

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
everything kind of like the Firecracker

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.730 
everything kind of like the Firecracker
effect<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.639> the<00:05:45.630> last<00:05:45.870> one<00:05:46.080> is<00:05:46.200> shield<00:05:46.500> I

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
effect and the last one is shield I

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.440 
effect and the last one is shield I
don't<00:05:46.919> have<00:05:47.039> this<00:05:47.190> confirmed<00:05:47.610> I<00:05:47.760> just<00:05:47.970> saw<00:05:48.180> a

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
don't have this confirmed I just saw a

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.300 
don't have this confirmed I just saw a
mention<00:05:49.110> of<00:05:49.200> it<00:05:49.289> on<00:05:49.380> a<00:05:49.440> sink<00:05:49.740> on<00:05:49.919> a<00:05:50.130> certain

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
mention of it on a sink on a certain

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.980 
mention of it on a sink on a certain
gaming<00:05:50.789> site<00:05:51.000> or<00:05:51.150> forum<00:05:51.479> site<00:05:51.780> and

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
gaming site or forum site and

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.750 
gaming site or forum site and
essentially<00:05:52.710> what<00:05:52.860> it<00:05:52.889> is<00:05:53.070> it<00:05:53.220> allows<00:05:53.490> you<00:05:53.639> to

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
essentially what it is it allows you to

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.300 
essentially what it is it allows you to
block<00:05:53.910> kills<00:05:54.750> or<00:05:55.050> assassinations<00:05:55.949> or<00:05:56.099> you

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
block kills or assassinations or you

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.100 
block kills or assassinations or you
know<00:05:56.400> maybe<00:05:56.430> it<00:05:57.150> allows<00:05:57.449> you<00:05:57.599> to<00:05:57.690> block<00:05:57.810> some

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
know maybe it allows you to block some

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.140 
know maybe it allows you to block some
shots<00:05:58.410> like<00:05:58.650> a<00:05:58.710> hidden<00:05:59.039> gonna<00:05:59.220> kill<00:05:59.460> or<00:05:59.699> poison

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
shots like a hidden gonna kill or poison

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.260 
shots like a hidden gonna kill or poison
dart<00:06:00.330> kill<00:06:00.539> or<00:06:00.690> anything<00:06:00.960> like<00:06:00.990> that<00:06:02.270> alright

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
dart kill or anything like that alright

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.129 
dart kill or anything like that alright
so<00:06:03.360> the<00:06:03.479> next<00:06:03.599> thing<00:06:03.690> we're<00:06:03.870> going<00:06:03.960> to<00:06:04.020> be

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
so the next thing we're going to be

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.570 
so the next thing we're going to be
talking<00:06:04.289> about<00:06:04.440> is<00:06:04.710> a<00:06:04.740> new<00:06:04.949> park<00:06:05.280> called

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
talking about is a new park called

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.310 
talking about is a new park called
unstoppable<00:06:06.360> essentially<00:06:06.840> it<00:06:06.960> works<00:06:07.139> like

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
unstoppable essentially it works like

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.650 
unstoppable essentially it works like
Auto<00:06:07.590> bash<00:06:07.860> in<00:06:08.130> the<00:06:08.760> Brotherhood<00:06:09.449> and<00:06:09.599> the

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
Auto bash in the Brotherhood and the

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.120 
Auto bash in the Brotherhood and the
revelations<00:06:10.169> games<00:06:10.440> were<00:06:10.620> essentially<00:06:11.010> you

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
revelations games were essentially you

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.400 
revelations games were essentially you
were<00:06:11.220> able<00:06:11.400> to<00:06:11.699> run<00:06:12.360> through<00:06:12.599> the<00:06:12.720> crowds<00:06:12.960> very

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
were able to run through the crowds very

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.110 
were able to run through the crowds very
very<00:06:13.620> quickly<00:06:13.889> that<00:06:14.280> you<00:06:14.400> did<00:06:14.639> not<00:06:14.669> slow<00:06:15.060> you

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
very quickly that you did not slow you

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.600 
very quickly that you did not slow you
down<00:06:15.330> for<00:06:15.660> at<00:06:15.750> least<00:06:15.840> a<00:06:16.050> few<00:06:16.289> first<00:06:17.190> couple<00:06:17.520> of

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
down for at least a few first couple of

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.460 
down for at least a few first couple of
people<00:06:17.910> but<00:06:18.030> then<00:06:18.180> you<00:06:18.389> eventually<00:06:18.870> slow<00:06:19.260> down

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
people but then you eventually slow down

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.529 
people but then you eventually slow down
and<00:06:19.710> another<00:06:19.949> addition<00:06:20.460> to<00:06:20.610> that<00:06:20.789> unstoppable

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
and another addition to that unstoppable

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.390 
and another addition to that unstoppable
perk<00:06:21.810> is<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.410> fact<00:06:22.590> that<00:06:22.680> you<00:06:22.830> can<00:06:23.070> get

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
perk is the fact that you can get

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.370 
perk is the fact that you can get
through<00:06:23.610> one<00:06:23.849> chase<00:06:24.180> breaker<00:06:24.449> and<00:06:24.720> that's

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
through one chase breaker and that's

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.140 
through one chase breaker and that's
what<00:06:25.530> I've<00:06:25.650> read<00:06:25.800> on<00:06:25.949> the<00:06:26.070> multiplayer<00:06:26.699> forums

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
what I've read on the multiplayer forums

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.300 
what I've read on the multiplayer forums
and<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:27.419> websites<00:06:27.810> that<00:06:27.990> what<00:06:28.860> only<00:06:29.130> one

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
and the websites that what only one

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.189 
and the websites that what only one
chase<00:06:29.639> breaker<00:06:29.910> will<00:06:30.240> open<00:06:30.570> up<00:06:30.660> for<00:06:30.900> you<00:06:31.020> or

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
chase breaker will open up for you or

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.719 
chase breaker will open up for you or
lift<00:06:31.560> will<00:06:31.710> come<00:06:31.860> down<00:06:32.039> for<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.400> or<00:06:32.550> anything

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
lift will come down for you or anything

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:33.550 
lift will come down for you or anything
like<00:06:32.820> that

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
like that

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.870 
like that
and<00:06:33.680> afterwards<00:06:34.190> you<00:06:34.310> don't<00:06:34.580> have<00:06:34.730> that

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
and afterwards you don't have that

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.730 
and afterwards you don't have that
ability<00:06:35.150> anymore<00:06:35.480> and<00:06:35.930> you're<00:06:36.320> just<00:06:36.530> left

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
ability anymore and you're just left

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.409 
ability anymore and you're just left
with<00:06:36.860> the<00:06:37.040> auto<00:06:37.310> bash<00:06:37.550> so<00:06:37.790> it<00:06:37.910> sounds<00:06:38.180> kind<00:06:38.360> of

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
with the auto bash so it sounds kind of

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.470 
with the auto bash so it sounds kind of
interesting<00:06:38.570> you<00:06:38.960> know<00:06:38.990> it's<00:06:39.200> cool<00:06:39.350> to<00:06:39.410> have<00:06:39.650> a

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
interesting you know it's cool to have a

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.840 
interesting you know it's cool to have a
unstoppable<00:06:41.480> perk<00:06:41.690> or<00:06:41.810> whatever<00:06:42.110> it<00:06:42.290> is<00:06:42.410> and

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
unstoppable perk or whatever it is and

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.010 
unstoppable perk or whatever it is and
we'll<00:06:43.850> see<00:06:44.000> how<00:06:44.150> it<00:06:44.180> plays<00:06:44.330> out<00:06:44.600> in<00:06:44.750> the<00:06:44.780> game

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
we'll see how it plays out in the game

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.300 
we'll see how it plays out in the game
so<00:06:45.290> that's<00:06:45.590> pretty<00:06:45.919> much<00:06:45.980> all<00:06:46.190> the

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
so that's pretty much all the

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.530 
so that's pretty much all the
information<00:06:46.790> that<00:06:46.820> I've<00:06:47.030> been<00:06:47.150> able<00:06:47.300> to

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
information that I've been able to

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.690 
information that I've been able to
gather<00:06:47.690> I<00:06:48.050> didn't<00:06:48.590> focus<00:06:48.740> on<00:06:48.980> any<00:06:49.160> other<00:06:49.340> stuff

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
gather I didn't focus on any other stuff

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.430 
gather I didn't focus on any other stuff
like<00:06:49.880> reverse<00:06:50.389> detection<00:06:50.870> meters<00:06:51.169> or

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
like reverse detection meters or

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.379 
like reverse detection meters or
anything<00:06:52.220> like<00:06:52.250> that<00:06:52.370> I<00:06:52.550> know<00:06:52.700> that<00:06:52.820> it<00:06:53.120> is<00:06:53.240> in

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389 
anything like that I know that it is in

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:55.090 
anything like that I know that it is in
the<00:06:53.480> game<00:06:53.720> but<00:06:54.110> there<00:06:54.290> isn't<00:06:54.560> any<00:06:54.650> concrete

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
the game but there isn't any concrete

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.770 
the game but there isn't any concrete
evidence<00:06:55.220> or<00:06:55.850> information<00:06:55.880> about<00:06:56.510> it

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
evidence or information about it

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.629 
evidence or information about it
specifically<00:06:57.320> so<00:06:57.620> until<00:06:58.010> we<00:06:58.160> actually<00:06:58.250> see

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 
specifically so until we actually see

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:00.280 
specifically so until we actually see
some<00:06:58.820> gameplay<00:06:59.210> and<00:06:59.419> so<00:06:59.750> we<00:06:59.870> actually<00:06:59.990> play

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.290 
some gameplay and so we actually play

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.620 
some gameplay and so we actually play
