Lighting Factory is and that is maybe
also<00:00:32.580> the<00:00:32.790> reason<00:00:33.510> why<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.810> got<00:00:34.620> interested<00:00:34.980> in

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
also the reason why I got interested in

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.670 
also the reason why I got interested in
buses<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.330> the<00:00:36.420> first<00:00:36.690> place<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> little<00:00:37.559> boy

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
buses in the first place as a little boy

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.070 
buses in the first place as a little boy
I<00:00:37.950> think<00:00:38.610> something<00:00:39.239> happens<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.720> a<00:00:39.750> little

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
I think something happens to a little

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.549 
I think something happens to a little
boy<00:00:40.460> about<00:00:41.460> 6<00:00:42.300> 5<00:00:42.629> 6<00:00:42.930> years<00:00:43.110> old

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
boy about 6 5 6 years old

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.189 
boy about 6 5 6 years old
either<00:00:43.770> they<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.160> interested<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.910> trains<00:00:45.900> or

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
either they get interested in trains or

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.390 
either they get interested in trains or
fast<00:00:46.860> cars<00:00:47.220> or<00:00:47.550> airplanes<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.720> I<00:00:49.280> think<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
fast cars or airplanes and I think it

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.180 
fast cars or airplanes and I think it
depends<00:00:50.909> on<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.600> situation<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.860> you're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
depends on the situation that you're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.030 
depends on the situation that you're
brought<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:53.909> in<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.720> what<00:00:55.320> gets<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:55.800> real

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
brought up in is what gets your real

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.479 
brought up in is what gets your real
interest<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.790> for<00:00:57.420> me<00:00:57.540> that<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:58.489> buses

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
interest and for me that was buses

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.850 
interest and for me that was buses
because<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.239> ain't<00:01:01.110> open<00:01:01.409> is<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> very

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
because I ain't open is a very

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the Philips company are brought from

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.610

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
home to the factory and back by buses a

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.210 
home to the factory and back by buses a
lot<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.070> especially<00:01:14.790> old<00:01:15.330> buses<00:01:15.659> back<00:01:15.960> then

lot of especially old buses back then

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.050 
lot of especially old buses back then
and<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.700> think<00:01:18.680> what<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:19.890> interests<00:01:20.460> me<00:01:20.670> and

and I think what really interests me and
I<00:01:21.840> must<00:01:22.079> correct<00:01:22.590> being<00:01:23.579> interested<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.240> buses

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
I must correct being interested in buses

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.529 
I must correct being interested in buses
in<00:01:24.780> general<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.590> interested<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.539> buses

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
in general I'm not interested in buses

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.289 
in general I'm not interested in buses
of<00:01:27.750> tourism<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.490> me<00:01:29.640> they're<00:01:29.909> too

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
of tourism because to me they're too

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.510 
of tourism because to me they're too
modern<00:01:30.899> too<00:01:31.110> slick<00:01:31.500> too<00:01:31.829> easy<00:01:32.610> too<00:01:34.250> easy<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
modern too slick too easy too easy to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.660 
modern too slick too easy too easy to
manage<00:01:35.729> also<00:01:36.259> what<00:01:37.259> I'm<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.280> really

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
manage also what I'm what I'm really

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
manage also what I'm what I'm really
interested<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.359> and<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:39.930> attracts<00:01:40.350> me<00:01:40.590> in

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
interested in and what attracts me in

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.620 
interested in and what attracts me in
buses<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.490> there<00:01:41.939> are<00:01:42.030> real<00:01:42.329> hard

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
buses is that there are real hard

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.190 
buses is that there are real hard
workers<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:44.270> there<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.359> industrial

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
workers and there are industrial

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.380 
workers and there are industrial
machines<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:49.549> can<00:01:50.549> imagine<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:51.359> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
machines so I can imagine the the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.050 
machines so I can imagine the the
heritage<00:01:52.289> of<00:01:53.030> very<00:01:54.030> industrial<00:01:54.630> cities<00:01:56.060> with

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
heritage of very industrial cities with

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.050 
heritage of very industrial cities with
all<00:01:57.659> these<00:01:57.899> old<00:01:58.530> factories<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.460> all<00:01:59.909> these

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
all these old factories and all these

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.529 
all these old factories and all these
people<00:02:00.509> going<00:02:00.960> there<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.590> doing<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.999> very<00:02:03.179> hard

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
people going there and doing a very hard

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.510 
people going there and doing a very hard
job

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
job

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.300 
job
and<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.510> me<00:02:06.630> part<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> transportation

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
and for me part of the transportation

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.780 
and for me part of the transportation
there<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:11.060> also<00:02:12.060> very<00:02:12.330> important<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.670> for<00:02:14.670> me

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
there is also very important and for me

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.710 
there is also very important and for me
that's<00:02:15.120> why<00:02:15.360> buses<00:02:15.840> who<00:02:17.000> look<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.540> like

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that's why buses who look there and like

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.290 
that's why buses who look there and like
they're<00:02:18.930> real<00:02:19.200> hard<00:02:19.440> workers<00:02:19.950> who<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.580> heavy

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
they're real hard workers who have heavy

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.030 
they're real hard workers who have heavy
motors<00:02:22.230> who<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:22.980> heavy<00:02:23.910> smell<00:02:24.980> have<00:02:25.980> a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
motors who have heavy smell have a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.620 
motors who have heavy smell have a
certain<00:02:26.520> kind<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.060> design<00:02:28.340> are<00:02:29.340> very

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
certain kind of design are very

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.350 
certain kind of design are very
attractive<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:32.220> started<00:02:32.850> taking<00:02:33.030> pictures

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
attractive so I started taking pictures

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.100 
attractive so I started taking pictures
of<00:02:33.510> buses<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.080> Eindhoven<00:02:34.739> first<00:02:35.510> later<00:02:36.510> in<00:02:36.780> the

a little bit more modern I found these

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.490 
a little bit more modern I found these
perfect<00:02:55.350> old<00:02:56.310> industrial<00:02:56.760> buses<00:02:57.360> again<00:02:57.660> here
