so you got to worry about

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
so you got to worry about
this<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.920> Donuts<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:11.970> middle<00:01:12.240> school

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
parking lot right so we got about a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.480 
parking lot right so we got about a
fifty<00:01:15.509> eight<00:01:15.630> hundred<00:01:15.659> pound<00:01:16.229> bow<00:01:16.979> yeah<00:01:17.310> we

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
with us from epic boats absolutely glad

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.249 
with us from epic boats absolutely glad
to<00:01:37.830> be<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.100> epic<00:01:38.399> time<00:01:38.670> four<00:01:39.509> years<00:01:39.750> ago<00:01:39.990> we

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
to be here epic time four years ago we

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.810 
to be here epic time four years ago we
got<00:01:40.440> started<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.159> electric<00:01:41.640> boat

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
got started on this electric boat

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.700 
got started on this electric boat
project<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.140> wakeboard<00:01:43.530> boat

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
project what we do with wakeboard boat

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.169 
project what we do with wakeboard boat
is<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.009> load<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.369> down<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:44.819> heavy<00:01:45.000> with

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
is we load it down really heavy with

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.059 
is we load it down really heavy with
ballast<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:46.289> we<00:01:46.409> try<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:46.800> up<00:01:46.890> on

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
ballast and then we try to get up on

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.850 
ballast and then we try to get up on
plane<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.670> fast<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:48.330> wakeboard<00:01:49.229> boat<00:01:49.649> is

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
plane really fast a wakeboard boat is

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.980 
plane really fast a wakeboard boat is
very<00:01:50.100> inefficient<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.539> typical<00:01:51.810> day

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
very inefficient like on a typical day

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.540 
very inefficient like on a typical day
you're<00:01:52.229> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> burn<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.830> 40<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.280> 50

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
you're going to burn like 40 to 50

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.550 
you're going to burn like 40 to 50
gallons<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.970> gas<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.539> electric<00:01:54.569> motor<00:01:55.140> idea

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
gallons of gas the electric motor idea

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.139 
gallons of gas the electric motor idea
is<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> great<00:01:55.950> idea<00:01:56.069> because<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.000> take

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
is a great idea because we can take

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.880 
is a great idea because we can take
advantage<00:01:57.300> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> electric<00:01:58.080> torque<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.770> get

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
advantage of the electric torque and get

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.710 
advantage of the electric torque and get
out<00:01:59.069> of<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> hole<00:01:59.460> faster<00:01:59.970> we<00:02:00.240> don't<00:02:00.390> burn<00:02:00.539> any

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
out of the hole faster we don't burn any

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.719 
out of the hole faster we don't burn any
gas<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.590> costs<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.069> less<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.340> lot<00:02:02.520> better

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
gas so it costs a lot less a lot better

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.109 
gas so it costs a lot less a lot better
for<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> American

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
for the American

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.849 
for the American

we're here with Jeff Weatherall a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.240 
we're here with Jeff Weatherall a

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
two-time world champion wakeboarder you

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.680 
two-time world champion wakeboarder you
find<00:02:10.459> yourself<00:02:10.789> Restless<00:02:11.330> because<00:02:11.480> you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
find yourself Restless because you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.900

stuff<00:02:49.640> across<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.060> ocean<00:02:50.360> that's<00:02:50.599> true

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
stuff across the ocean that's true

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.420 
stuff across the ocean that's true
that's<00:02:51.019> tres<00:02:51.319> a<00:02:51.349> great<00:02:51.620> point<00:02:51.829> actually<00:02:52.010> yeah

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
that's tres a great point actually yeah

that's tres a great point actually yeah
this<00:02:52.940> boat<00:02:53.390> looks<00:02:53.660> pretty<00:02:53.900> normal<00:02:54.319> so<00:02:54.680> you

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
this boat looks pretty normal so you

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.000 
this boat looks pretty normal so you
flip<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.190> thing<00:02:55.250> up<00:02:55.640> oh<00:02:55.849> that's<00:02:56.180> pretty<00:02:56.329> cool

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
flip this thing up oh that's pretty cool

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.990 
flip this thing up oh that's pretty cool
so<00:02:58.010> normally<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.459> have<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.640> big<00:02:58.849> old
