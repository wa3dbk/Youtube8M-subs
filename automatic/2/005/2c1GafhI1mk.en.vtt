more information but it says and I quote
it's<00:00:37.360> massively<00:00:38.019> better<00:00:38.379> than<00:00:38.680> pink<00:00:38.980> one<00:00:39.519> why

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
it's massively better than pink one why

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.549 
it's massively better than pink one why
well<00:00:41.109> Bink<00:00:41.859> 2.4<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.059> she<00:00:43.239> ships<00:00:43.570> with<00:00:43.929> GPU

decoding<00:00:45.519> which<00:00:45.940> means<00:00:46.149> that<00:00:46.449> it<00:00:46.570> can<00:00:46.690> use

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
decoding which means that it can use

they're<00:01:10.600> saying<00:01:10.630> because<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.530> multi-core

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040

on a sim d so that means that you're

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.510 
on a sim d so that means that you're
able<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.820> play<00:01:27.940> 4k<00:01:28.480> video<00:01:28.870> frames<00:01:29.350> which<00:01:29.770> just

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
on the PC right so for we know they're

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.810 
on the PC right so for we know they're
using<00:01:58.240> an<00:01:58.360> i7<00:01:58.950> SuperDuper<00:01:59.950> powerful<00:02:00.430> system

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
or it could be something a little bit

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.290 
or it could be something a little bit
more<00:02:03.420> softer<00:02:04.420> now<00:02:05.350> interestingly<00:02:06.220> enough<00:02:06.970> and

more softer now interestingly enough and

confusion<00:02:27.720> going<00:02:27.870> around<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.530> Internet's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
confusion going around the Internet's

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.520 
confusion going around the Internet's
right<00:02:29.370> now<00:02:29.750> because<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.930> couple<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.349> websites

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
right now because a couple of websites

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.539 
right now because a couple of websites
are<00:02:32.190> pointing<00:02:32.849> out<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.420> they<00:02:33.810> actually<00:02:33.840> mean

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
are pointing out that they actually mean

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.990 
are pointing out that they actually mean
2.3<00:02:36.260> m/s<00:02:37.260> for<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.769> Xbox<00:02:38.220> one

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
2.3 m/s for the Xbox one

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.190 
2.3 m/s for the Xbox one
whereas<00:02:39.660> 1.4<00:02:40.530> m/s<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:41.810> for<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.290> ps4<00:02:43.890> which

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
whereas 1.4 m/s is for the ps4 which

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.630 
whereas 1.4 m/s is for the ps4 which
according<00:02:46.200> which<00:02:46.620> sounds<00:02:47.010> kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.370> right

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
according which sounds kind of right

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.069 
according which sounds kind of right
because<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.329> way<00:02:48.450> they're<00:02:48.659> using<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
because of the way they're using the

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.860 
because of the way they're using the
brackets<00:02:49.709> right<00:02:50.280> but<00:02:51.150> if<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.510> look<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
brackets right but if you look on the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.530 
brackets right but if you look on the
right-hand<00:02:52.110> side<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:53.519> actually<00:02:53.549> points<00:02:54.420> out

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
right-hand side it actually points out

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.190 
right-hand side it actually points out
it<00:02:54.840> says<00:02:55.049> decode<00:02:55.859> 4k<00:02:56.489> video<00:02:56.940> frames<00:02:57.359> in<00:02:57.629> 2.3

out that the ps4 version is one is 2.3

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
but the PC is 1.4 but as far as I can

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.430 
but the PC is 1.4 but as far as I can
tell<00:03:11.730> they're<00:03:12.180> not<00:03:12.420> giving<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.840> reading<00:03:13.079> for

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
tell they're not giving a reading for

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.539 
tell they're not giving a reading for
the<00:03:13.530> Xbox<00:03:13.950> one<00:03:14.040> now<00:03:14.609> I'm<00:03:15.150> gonna<00:03:15.450> contact<00:03:15.750> the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
the Xbox one now I'm gonna contact the

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.710 
the Xbox one now I'm gonna contact the
creators<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:17.579> this<00:03:17.819> application<00:03:18.569> and

fortunately I can only get one of their

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.170 
fortunately I can only get one of their
email<00:03:23.160> addresses<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.790> don't<00:03:24.000> necessarily

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
email addresses and I don't necessarily

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.030 
email addresses and I don't necessarily
know<00:03:24.750> how<00:03:24.900> great<00:03:25.139> it's<00:03:25.349> gonna<00:03:25.470> be<00:03:25.560> but<00:03:25.950> I've

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
know how great it's gonna be but I've

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.190 
know how great it's gonna be but I've
contacted<00:03:26.340> them<00:03:26.609> anyway<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.120> can't<00:03:27.870> comment

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
contacted them anyway I can't comment

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.170 
contacted them anyway I can't comment
actually<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:28.950> can't<00:03:29.250> guarantee<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.970> we're

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
actually I can't guarantee that we're

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.580 
actually I can't guarantee that we're
gonna<00:03:30.269> be<00:03:30.450> getting<00:03:30.599> a<00:03:30.750> response<00:03:31.019> from<00:03:31.410> them

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
gonna be getting a response from them

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.009 
gonna be getting a response from them
but<00:03:31.739> hopefully<00:03:31.919> they<00:03:32.400> do<00:03:32.459> reach<00:03:32.790> out<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.209> give

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
but hopefully they do reach out and give

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.240 
but hopefully they do reach out and give
us<00:03:34.109> a<00:03:34.200> little<00:03:34.349> bit<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.590> information<00:03:34.799> about<00:03:35.099> the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
us a little bit of information about the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.550 
us a little bit of information about the
Xbox<00:03:35.669> one<00:03:35.940> but<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.540> does<00:03:36.780> tell<00:03:37.019> us<00:03:37.139> of<00:03:37.290> course

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
Xbox one but it does tell us of course

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.250 
Xbox one but it does tell us of course
is<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.930> CPU<00:03:40.230> performance<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.639> ps4

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
is that the CPU performance of the ps4

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.110 
is that the CPU performance of the ps4
Xbox<00:03:43.260> one<00:03:43.470> are<00:03:43.739> going<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.370> be<00:03:44.459> roughly<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
Xbox one are going to be roughly the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.420 
Xbox one are going to be roughly the
same

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.699 

in<00:03:47.760> theory<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.569> mean<00:03:48.599> they've<00:03:48.989> not<00:03:49.169> really<00:03:49.470> gone

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
in theory I mean they've not really gone

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.470 
in theory I mean they've not really gone
super<00:03:50.099> into<00:03:50.280> specifics<00:03:50.880> here<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.120> don't<00:03:51.359> know

super into specifics here I don't know
if<00:03:51.540> that's<00:03:51.720> because<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:52.079> NBA's<00:03:52.530> or<00:03:52.859> just

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
if that's because of NBA's or just

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.890 
if that's because of NBA's or just
because<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:53.430> mostly<00:03:53.819> marketing<00:03:54.030> spiel<00:03:54.690> on

line<00:04:18.720> with<00:04:19.199> one<00:04:19.380> another<00:04:19.410> which<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.310> kind<00:04:20.970> of

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
line with one another which is kind of

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.760 
line with one another which is kind of
what<00:04:21.209> we<00:04:21.299> understood<00:04:21.750> anyway<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.410> mean<00:04:22.590> there

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
what we understood anyway I mean there

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.140 
what we understood anyway I mean there
was<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:22.949> whole<00:04:23.130> texture<00:04:23.490> generation

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
was that whole texture generation

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.000 
was that whole texture generation
benchmark<00:04:24.660> which<00:04:24.840> does<00:04:25.110> show<00:04:25.409> that<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.710> ps4

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
benchmark which does show that the ps4

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.969 
benchmark which does show that the ps4
CPU<00:04:26.789> is<00:04:26.940> slightly<00:04:27.690> ahead<00:04:28.050> in<00:04:28.440> text

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
CPU is slightly ahead in text

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.290 
CPU is slightly ahead in text
regeneration<00:04:29.729> but<00:04:30.090> what

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
regeneration but what

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.149 
regeneration but what
again<00:04:30.569> the<00:04:30.690> problem<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.080> there<00:04:31.620> was<00:04:31.650> quite<00:04:32.129> a

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
again the problem is there was quite a

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.490 
again the problem is there was quite a
few<00:04:32.400> questions<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.659> were<00:04:33.840> bought<00:04:34.020> into<00:04:34.289> this

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
few questions that were bought into this

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.939 
few questions that were bought into this
you<00:04:34.710> know<00:04:34.770> how<00:04:35.039> much<00:04:35.370> other<00:04:36.319> system<00:04:37.319> resources

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
you know how much other system resources

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.219 
you know how much other system resources
were<00:04:38.129> being<00:04:38.159> utilized<00:04:38.669> so<00:04:39.360> is<00:04:39.539> it<00:04:39.659> was<00:04:39.810> was<00:04:40.110> it

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
were being utilized so is it was was it

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.990 
were being utilized so is it was was it
a<00:04:40.289> case<00:04:40.530> of<00:04:40.770> because<00:04:41.190> you<00:04:41.580> know<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.819> pay<00:04:41.940> is

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
a case of because you know the pay is

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.890 
a case of because you know the pay is
false<00:04:42.270> memory<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:42.960> for<00:04:43.319> example<00:04:43.710> Xbox<00:04:44.099> ones

GTS rambles are really being utilized -
how<00:04:47.849> much<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.270> GPU<00:04:48.840> is<00:04:48.990> being<00:04:49.259> used<00:04:49.590> how

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
how much of the GPU is being used how

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.270 
how much of the GPU is being used how
many<00:04:50.220> cores<00:04:50.639> were<00:04:50.909> being<00:04:51.150> used<00:04:51.389> as<00:04:51.629> well

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
many cores were being used as well

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.529 
many cores were being used as well
because<00:04:53.280> that<00:04:53.400> wasn't<00:04:53.580> really<00:04:53.789> specific

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
because that wasn't really specific

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.809 
because that wasn't really specific
questions<00:04:54.659> that<00:04:55.020> were<00:04:55.199> reply<00:04:56.159> -<00:04:56.220> which<00:04:56.580> makes

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
questions that were reply - which makes

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.390 
questions that were reply - which makes
it<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.060> bit<00:04:57.090> tricky<00:04:57.509> but<00:04:58.259> we<00:04:58.379> can<00:04:58.680> tell<00:04:59.009> however

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
it a bit tricky but we can tell however

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.619 
it a bit tricky but we can tell however
is<00:04:59.639> that<00:05:00.360> 1.4<00:05:01.229> m/s<00:05:01.470> on<00:05:02.009> at<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.490> PC<00:05:03.030> as<00:05:03.270> far<00:05:03.509> as

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
is that 1.4 m/s on at the PC as far as

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:08.149 
is that 1.4 m/s on at the PC as far as
I'm<00:05:03.750> reading<00:05:03.960> here<00:05:04.500> and<00:05:04.669> 2.3<00:05:05.669> on<00:05:05.909> the<00:05:06.659> ps4<00:05:07.289> GPU

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
I'm reading here and 2.3 on the ps4 GPU

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.369 
I'm reading here and 2.3 on the ps4 GPU
so<00:05:08.340> obviously<00:05:08.699> the<00:05:08.819> PC<00:05:09.270> GPU<00:05:09.750> is<00:05:09.840> considerably

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379 
so obviously the PC GPU is considerably

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.010 
so obviously the PC GPU is considerably
faster<00:05:10.849> but<00:05:11.849> what<00:05:12.000> I'd<00:05:12.090> like<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.449> know<00:05:12.569> is<00:05:12.719> what

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
faster but what I'd like to know is what

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.790 
faster but what I'd like to know is what
PC<00:05:13.710> GPU<00:05:14.370> were<00:05:14.550> they<00:05:14.669> utilizing<00:05:15.539> as<00:05:16.259> an<00:05:16.440> example

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
PC GPU were they utilizing as an example

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.399 
PC GPU were they utilizing as an example
