 trying cooking you will understand how it 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.250
 so let's start by saying that we will 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.819

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.520
 Components 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:05.780
 gin 60 milliliter shaker 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.780
 protected the puzzle 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.830
 so then we need cream 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.340
 and 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.340
 smooth 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.550
 30 milliliters we need light 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.690
 the strength 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:26.540
 such then 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.390
 37 liters according to the exact century sahna 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.490
 syrup on my hiring as more to 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.220
 to be exact 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.610
 40 milliliters of sugar syrup at ease 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.780
 proportions one to one type simple 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.270
 the syrup then of course Tokyo 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.930
 flavoring pedal said incompatible 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.270
 Components 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.270
 citrus juices and cream 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.290
 but we need such a sleeps way 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.010
 preparations 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.349
 the neck is very long yes to us well 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.290
 bind these components and one of 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.310
 binding components 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.579
 helper will of course be protein 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.579
 eggs 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.980
 yes everything is there 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.980
 shelf life 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.930
 tremendous taste 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.400
 and add our secret ingredients this 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.510
 analogue 2 wall of water just need 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.510
 splash into a shaker and 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.640
 centers 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.220
 oranges slightly flavored 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.340
 until 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:52.950
 and add just a couple more gas 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:56.750
 tours after we once again interfere and for 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.990
 the group is not straightforward 6 and we will beat it up 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.400
 We want to merge that water with a shaker 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.130
 knocks we need to be very 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.460
 for a long time it is divided by 11 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.410
 minutes 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.590
 so 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.590
 we will begin to act 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:24.110
 so that the pens are not cold it will be possible 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:26.949
 wind up to a row and to 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.949
 well knocks 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.690
 our drink is almost ready 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.130
 the texture should be very 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.040
 he should air straight 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:43.950
 straight almost nose drunk 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:48.970
 So we need some 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:54.700
 sell as you need a highball glass 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:05:00.670
 when it came to cool remind one 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:04.510
 a third crushed ice and then pour our 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:09.510
 air drink which in its 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.510
 appearance reminds us of kefir 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:16.569
 and so a little bit like to mention this 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:19.210
 nuance to make it even more airy 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:25.480
 add a little soda pour 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:30.160
 just to the end and of course of course 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.280
 a little bit glossed over your drink here 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.310
 such here is small. 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.310
 lemon rind 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.069
 cocktail ramos from
