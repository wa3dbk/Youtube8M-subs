the camera on this here is the camera

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.049 
the camera on this here is the camera
lens<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> microphone<00:00:37.820> over<00:00:38.820> here

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
lens this is the microphone over here

will<00:00:43.350> work<00:00:43.649> without<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> memory<00:00:44.579> chip<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:45.059> put

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
will work without a memory chip to put

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
will work without a memory chip to put
the<00:00:46.309> images<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.910> you'd<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:49.250> four

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the images on so you'd get a little four

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.760 
the images on so you'd get a little four
gigabyte<00:00:51.239> memory<00:00:51.809> chip<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.680> be

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
gigabyte memory chip and you have to be

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
gigabyte memory chip and you have to be
careful<00:00:56.129> when<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.370> put<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> sort<00:00:57.300> of

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
careful when you put this in it sort of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.540 
careful when you put this in it sort of
goes<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.840> an<00:00:58.020> angle<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:59.190> entirely

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
goes in on an angle it's entirely

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.450 
goes in on an angle it's entirely
possible<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> put<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.129> out<00:01:02.129> of

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
possible for you to put this in out of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
possible for you to put this in out of
place<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.660> goes<00:01:03.930> into<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
place so that it just goes into the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.580 
place so that it just goes into the
cavity<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.430> camera<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.420> want<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.780> make

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
cavity of the camera so you want to make

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.530 
cavity of the camera so you want to make
sure<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.010> goes<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.520> an<00:01:08.670> angle<00:01:08.880> sort<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
sure that it goes in on an angle sort of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.960 
sure that it goes in on an angle sort of
thing<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.049> you'll<00:01:10.860> notice<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.939> has

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
thing and you you'll notice that it has

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.020 
thing and you you'll notice that it has
a<00:01:12.200> spring<00:01:13.760> resistance<00:01:14.760> when<00:01:15.740> it's<00:01:17.030> correctly

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
a spring resistance when it's correctly

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.380 
a spring resistance when it's correctly
positioned<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.290> camp<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.040> chip<00:01:20.909> will<00:01:21.119> push

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
positioned the camp the chip will push

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.010 
positioned the camp the chip will push
back<00:01:21.630> that's<00:01:22.049> how<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.950> out<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:24.020> you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
back that's how you get it out so you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
back that's how you get it out so you
just<00:01:25.259> push<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:26.009> until<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:28.490> locks<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
just push that in until it locks you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.620 
just push that in until it locks you
have<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> sort<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.570> go<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.710> bit<00:01:31.970> this<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
have to sort of go in a bit this is the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.600 
have to sort of go in a bit this is the
USB<00:01:34.880> connector<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:38.070> used<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:39.350> power<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
USB connector that you used to power the

USB connector that you used to power the
rechargeable<00:01:41.610> battery<00:01:41.990> inside<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.350> that's

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
rechargeable battery inside so that's

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.940 
rechargeable battery inside so that's
many<00:01:43.829> ust<00:01:44.280> plug<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.299> into<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.689> USB<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.710> your

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
many ust plug that into your USB on your
