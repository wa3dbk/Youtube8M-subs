00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.730
 martin would spend years taking pictures 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.269
 same thing but how 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.790
 first focus of the water drop of his fleet 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.400
 captured the mysterious world frozen 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:21.350
 in time such familiar same 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.519
 mysterious martin fought simple successes 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.970
 freeze the space 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.689
 all you need is martin from a pack of water from 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 three lantern 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.730
 small by the way yes yes coming over 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.710
 I did not see such equipment 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.329
 great we can see this whole 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.160
 process 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.770
 let's guys them and see again about 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.340
 apple creates a crater that forms 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.289
 crown or tiara 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.620
 aerator behaves like stretching 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.750
 spring water surface tension 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.940
 pulls it back and up 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.920
 it turns out a splash of jeff and martin poured 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.350
 on the platform a year deep several 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.869
 millimeters 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.110
 I think the crater and the surge will be less 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.670
 due to a thin layer of water it turns out not 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.950
 such a large column as in a large 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.960
 pool profession just saw dinner 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 form which he creates 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.890
 reverse impulse 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.300
 right 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 now let's look at two drops 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.390
 simultaneously energy released when 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.240
 a drop hits the water 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.010
 creates a stronger surge in this i 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.780
 I believe that the impact energy tends 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.480
 outward but surface tension 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.670
 saves it and as if transmits to 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.870
 this bezel 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.210
 holding in place until formed 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.650
 wave on a finger and change your favorite 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:56.670
 It is worth saying that because of this it turns out 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:59.640
 these crowns and if you add light, see 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.160
 what color the background top hsien 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.900
 red any light or any flat 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.560
 surface parallel to the water will 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.149
 seem 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.700
 and did not understand and the front of the waves will be 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.770
 seem red to be like jeff found 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.040
 soul mate and don't drop a drop of water 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.040
 let it fly 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.469
 look red appears cool 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.469
 date is thought up 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.410
 that's awesome beauty look like 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.840
 like a flower and a red disk 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.910
 clearly you and the truth 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.040
 achieved a sense of depth such in the first 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:57.250
 time I was fine for sure this time 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:00.570
 got him a drop of water and it 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.330
 somehow explodes right in the center of the lips 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.550
 smashbox shine and game and counteraction 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.260
 not really a great demonstration 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.660
 Newton's laws correctly recognized 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.700
 if there were no surface tension 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.650
 drops you just went through 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.300
 You can write about this nickname 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.080
 as it can be pretty accurately at 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.880
 each his own holy grail and martin 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.700
 choreographer of dancing files 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.170
 except I want to do something on that 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.470
 Seven years only looked and 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.210
 this is a clash of a fishing line with another how would I 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.540
 never seen this on video 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.990
 that is why I came here damn I hope 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.850
 we will not disappoint him stupid it will be 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:45.280
 rather unusually we need to take off 10 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:47.740
 drops per second and make sure it is 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.260
 such a difficult task 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.600
 these two geniuses will have to install 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.920
 high speed camera arrange 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.370
 a lot of water drops and now big farm 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:04.380
 yes and first the drops that hit 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.730
 water then splash rises up a 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.110
 then another drop hits your splash 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.510
 during the experiment I want to get 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.200
 clear flow of drops at intervals 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.390
 about one tenth of a second we take 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.790
 but only the first day yes it seems here 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.700
 a lot of work and everything seems to be going 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.740
 ok let's cheer our guys 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.610
 here is a lot of unnecessary same neatly 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.750
 raised them up too fast flowing okay 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:38.800
 are you ready come on 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:47.460
 so i grew stern and crown 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.460
 slowly splits now pipe will be 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.620
 got hurt no man ever 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.840
 couldn't do without water and we all 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.630
 time we touch down 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.850
 rain and millions to bezengi 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:11.730
 hit the ground each one do 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:18.540
 And so no one gives this phenomenon 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:18.540
 no value it's amazing 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.270
 we all go 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.680
 we thought it would be boring vision 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.930
 it turned out not or 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:44.750
 this art is science and this 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.750
 of awesome
