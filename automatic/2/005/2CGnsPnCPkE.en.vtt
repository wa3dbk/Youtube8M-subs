00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.060
 there you are all so bad we are going to do 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.220
 two small hairstyles 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.300
 hi girls how are you welcome to 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.120
 my channel and today 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.420
 today we have very special limited 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.310
 again the mini blogger cardigan her 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.829
 is going to be my model to be able to make them 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.599
 some princesses hairstyles again 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.609
 we have joined with Johnson's baby for 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.949
 to be able to bring you some ideas of 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.220
 hairstyles using their products and 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.020
 we already have months using these products 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.019
 bbk really liked what 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.120
 I feel that she likes to have some 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.309
 specific products that are for her 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.989
 every morning before she gets 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.089
 go to school I always give 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.699
 some hairstyles and I think of the other 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.440
 on the side of the screen there are moms that 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.149
 they battle every morning by engineering 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.460
 so we combed our hair 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.289
 daughters I have to do five hairstyles 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.030
 per week she tells me today I want to 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.199
 this princess today I want from this other 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.899
 princess and I have to be fine 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.019
 ingenuously blake ok I do this hairstyle 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.360
 and I will have the two ideas of hairstyles 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.540
 I hope you like them to be 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.490
 to your liking 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.530
 They are using the line johnson's 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.510
 amy what I like about this line is 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.390
 which is specifically for the hair 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.910
 of babies are three steps these three 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.800
 steps help strengthen hair and 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.960
 already when we are combing it does not 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.910
 do so many knots then to me in what 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.520
 personal I like because the hair of 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.440
 rebecca is more silky than ever and 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.390
 well now let's do these hairstyles 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.670
 and I hope you like it I will start 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.710
 detangle spray using no more t 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.870
 tangles children's hair is more 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.150
 fragile than the hair of adults and 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.430
 It tends to rupture more easily 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.060
 that's good to protect them and do it more 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.850
 strong and avoid those knots to start 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.300
 I'm going to make a tail in the part of 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.580
 up with this league and then the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.190
 part of in between with my finger I'm going to 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.380
 open a hole and I'm going to put the 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.689
 lock of hair 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.869
 it's the same procedure I will be 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.289
 repeating all over the head and I think that 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.840
 If you want more, you can use more 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.940
 and so it's going to look nicer I'm going to 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.050
 use 4 because that's what the 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.050
 little head of cardigan 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.189
 They are super practical and easy hairstyles 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.700
 what can you do in a matter of 5 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:25.129
 minutes and you put a little detail and ready 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.200
 so it is now for this second 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.750
 hairstyle I will comb all the hair 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.049
 for one side because we're going to make a 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.090
 braid completely from one side tomÃ¡s 3 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.080
 millions of hair and we're going to make a 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.510
 3 the French 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.200
 you will be feeding hair of 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.200
 both sides 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.810
 the difference is going to be that we're going to 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.959
 be taking hair from the other 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.690
 end of the head to this other 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.660
 end so that the braid is in a 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.030
 only place looks very nice to me 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.160
 like it a lot and also if you have your 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.000
 Chinese girl hair sure it's going to 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.000
 see beautiful too 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.080
 the same procedure of feeding 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.080
 hair follows 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.540
 and now in this part of here below I'm going 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.640
 to make a braid that is known as 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.070
 Fish tail that splits the hair 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.130
 in two if they take small locks of 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.190
 hair and they are joining one of the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.780
 two strands is super practical and good 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.780
 this is how I do see 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.090
 again because subject to a limit 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.420
 a little detail so that they feel all 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.489
 some princesses and see how easy they are 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.360
 these hairstyles I hope you have been 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.459
