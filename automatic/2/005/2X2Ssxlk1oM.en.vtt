feeling and the smell it smells mostly

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.460 
feeling and the smell it smells mostly
like<00:01:08.640> DHA<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.450> did<00:01:09.630> put<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> hint<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
like DHA they did put a hint of

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.950 
like DHA they did put a hint of
fragrance<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.159> there<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.420> wasn't<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:12.780> bad

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
fragrance in there so it wasn't as bad

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.359 
fragrance in there so it wasn't as bad
smelling<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.590> some<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> ones<00:01:14.159> I've<00:01:14.340> tried

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
smelling as some of the ones I've tried

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
smelling as some of the ones I've tried
because<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.479> least<00:01:15.630> tried<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.110> cover<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.380> up

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
because I at least tried to cover it up

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
because I at least tried to cover it up
with<00:01:16.680> fragrance<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.310> definitely<00:01:17.970> smelled

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
with fragrance but it definitely smelled

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.999 
with fragrance but it definitely smelled
like<00:01:18.479> DHA<00:01:18.960> which<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.229> didn't<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.950> it

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
like DHA which I didn't like so it

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
like DHA which I didn't like so it
wasn't<00:01:20.280> my<00:01:20.400> favorite<00:01:20.580> selling<00:01:21.090> product<00:01:21.540> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
wasn't my favorite selling product I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050 
wasn't my favorite selling product I
could<00:01:22.439> also<00:01:22.590> still<00:01:23.009> smell<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> DHA<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
could also still smell the DHA when I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.149 
could also still smell the DHA when I
woke<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> next<00:01:24.659> morning<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> didn't

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
afterwards to the drying time was

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.109 
afterwards to the drying time was
unbelievable<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:47.159> long<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.759> I

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
unbelievable it was really long so I I

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.630 
unbelievable it was really long so I I
was<00:01:48.659> waiting<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.140> an<00:01:49.259> hour<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.430> dry

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
was waiting for an hour for it to dry

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.120 
was waiting for an hour for it to dry
and<00:01:50.670> still<00:01:51.149> wasn't<00:01:51.360> dried<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.470> after<00:01:52.920> an<00:01:52.979> hour

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and still wasn't dried so after an hour

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.499 
and still wasn't dried so after an hour
I<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.490> went<00:01:53.640> ahead<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.909> put<00:01:54.060> my<00:01:54.090> clothes<00:01:54.390> on

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
I just went ahead and put my clothes on

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.630 
I just went ahead and put my clothes on
because<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.930> was<00:01:55.049> sick<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.259> waiting<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.920> haven't

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
because I was sick of waiting I haven't

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.149 
because I was sick of waiting I haven't
ever<00:01:56.790> had<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.780> product<00:01:58.110> that's<00:01:58.380> taken<00:01:58.740> me<00:01:58.860> over

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
ever had a product that's taken me over

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.520 
ever had a product that's taken me over
an<00:01:59.250> hour<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.579> dry<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.509> ultimately<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.049> ended<00:02:01.140> up

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
an hour to dry so ultimately I ended up

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.889 
an hour to dry so ultimately I ended up
taking<00:02:01.799> about<00:02:02.159> two<00:02:02.490> hours<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:03.090> completely<00:02:03.509> dry

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
taking about two hours to completely dry

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
taking about two hours to completely dry
and<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.130> uncomfortable<00:02:05.340> while<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and I was really uncomfortable while it

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.969 
and I was really uncomfortable while it
was<00:02:06.420> drying<00:02:06.689> because<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.200> product<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.649> really

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
was drying because the product is really

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.270 
was drying because the product is really
sticky<00:02:08.459> that's<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.479> thing<00:02:09.690> um<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.379> some

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
sticky that's one thing um that some

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920 
sticky that's one thing um that some
gels<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> don't<00:02:12.180> like<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
gels have I don't like is

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.300 
gels have I don't like is
it's<00:02:13.019> just<00:02:13.260> sticky<00:02:13.709> when<00:02:13.859> you're<00:02:13.980> waiting<00:02:14.280> for

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
it's just sticky when you're waiting for

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.240 
it's just sticky when you're waiting for
it<00:02:14.579> to<00:02:14.609> dry<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:15.959> one<00:02:16.140> took<00:02:16.319> forever<00:02:17.010> to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it to dry so this one took forever to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.020 
it to dry so this one took forever to
dry<00:02:17.579> and<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.849> really<00:02:18.239> didn't<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:20.030> it's

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
dry and I really didn't like that it's

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.610 
dry and I really didn't like that it's
not<00:02:21.239> too<00:02:21.299> messy<00:02:21.900> while<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.170> wait<00:02:22.319> for<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
not too messy while you wait for it to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.319 
not too messy while you wait for it to
dry<00:02:22.799> but<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.400> can't<00:02:23.640> really<00:02:23.760> touch<00:02:24.000> anything

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
dry but you can't really touch anything

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.819 
dry but you can't really touch anything
because<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.780> really<00:02:25.019> sticky<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.409> product

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
because it's really sticky and product

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.280 
because it's really sticky and product
will<00:02:26.010> get<00:02:26.159> everywhere<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.049> color

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
will get everywhere so the color

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.259 
will get everywhere so the color
produced<00:02:28.739> on<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.040> one<00:02:29.250> was<00:02:29.370> super<00:02:29.730> light<00:02:29.939> too

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
produced on this one was super light too

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.209 
produced on this one was super light too
I<00:02:30.480> woke<00:02:30.930> up<00:02:31.079> the<00:02:31.170> next<00:02:31.230> morning<00:02:31.439> and<00:02:31.859> I<00:02:31.950> was

even<00:02:36.629> which<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.109> liked<00:02:37.349> but<00:02:37.859> it<00:02:37.889> was<00:02:38.069> just<00:02:38.280> so

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
even which I liked but it was just so

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.580 
even which I liked but it was just so
light<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.969> wasn't<00:02:39.329> really<00:02:39.420> worth<00:02:39.719> the<00:02:39.989> two

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
light that I wasn't really worth the two

you'll have to apply it two or three

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.740 
you'll have to apply it two or three
days<00:02:46.349> in<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.620> row<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.489> just<00:02:47.760> don't<00:02:48.540> like

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
waiting 2 hours for my tan to dry that's

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.649 
waiting 2 hours for my tan to dry that's
just<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.269> pain<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.720> butt<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.900> me<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.450> this

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
just the pain in the butt to me so this

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.869 
just the pain in the butt to me so this
one<00:02:54.840> faded<00:02:55.530> after<00:02:55.859> about<00:02:56.040> two<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> three<00:02:56.669> days

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
one faded after about two to three days

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.629 
one faded after about two to three days
and<00:02:57.269> after<00:02:57.659> and<00:02:58.169> when<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.829> started<00:02:59.129> fading<00:02:59.519> I

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
and after and when it started fading I

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.580 
and after and when it started fading I
started<00:02:59.969> to<00:03:00.060> get<00:03:00.150> really<00:03:00.209> scaly<00:03:01.049> looking<00:03:01.439> and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
started to get really scaly looking and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.929 
started to get really scaly looking and
kind<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.799> looked<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.099> reptile

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
kind of looked like a reptile

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.119 
kind of looked like a reptile
I<00:03:02.969> think<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:03.959> product<00:03:04.260> kind<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.709> dried<00:03:04.919> my

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
I think this product kind of dried my

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.030 
I think this product kind of dried my
skin<00:03:05.430> out<00:03:05.519> unfortunately<00:03:06.530> because<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.829> fade

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
skin out unfortunately because as I fade

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.339 
skin out unfortunately because as I fade
it<00:03:08.189> as<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.669> faded<00:03:08.969> it<00:03:09.090> just<00:03:09.269> got<00:03:09.419> super<00:03:09.840> scaly

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
it as it faded it just got super scaly

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.629 
it as it faded it just got super scaly
and<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.709> doesn't<00:03:11.069> happen<00:03:11.219> with<00:03:11.459> all

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
and that doesn't happen with all

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.909 
and that doesn't happen with all
products<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.810> i<00:03:12.840> think<00:03:13.019> i<00:03:13.290> think<00:03:13.319> it<00:03:13.590> dried<00:03:13.799> my

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
products so i think i think it dried my
