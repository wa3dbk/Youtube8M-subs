00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:04.052
 Wonderful lighting settings 

00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:07.058
 Model: Salsa 

00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:10.062
 Vertical Light Sandwich Effect Setup Tutorial 

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:12.049
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.058
 This video tutorial, you will learn how to set the light source 

00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:17.048
 The resulting human body looks very artistic. 

00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:21.068
 Let's first look at the usual lighting settings, which show the basic contours of the human body. 

00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:23.079
 Or show the outline of a shape. 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.090
 But this setup doesn't show much more detail. 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.000
 This tutorial will definitely help you. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.010
 If you want to take great art photos. 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.093
 Today we and the model Salsa 

00:00:31.093 --> 00:00:33.076
 Salsa is a good athlete. 

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:37.012
 Yes, it is a very good athlete. 

00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:41.031
 Oh. . . Oh. . . Oh. . . I am a little nervous now. Let's take a moment to meditate 

00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:44.016
 Meditation - my doctor said it is very good for health. 

00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:45.055
 Ok, it feels better. 

00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:49.028
 Ready, she will put some very artistic shapes on the ground. 

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:51.008
 Or jump or other styling. 

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:55.017
 We used the front of the reflective umbrella to enhance the brightness of the light. 

00:00:55.017 --> 00:00:57.042
 Using the front umbrella, 

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:59.046
 We can make more light 

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:01.053
 Illuminated on the ground. 

00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:04.051
 The other side is also the same light source setting. 

00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:06.027
 a reflective umbrella in front, one behind, 

00:01:06.027 --> 00:01:09.089
 This makes the light source settings look great. 

00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:12.000
 Ok, let's see the effect. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.053
 So how do you shoot this scene? 

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:15.061
 It's very simple, 

00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:19.006
 You only need to use a large white strip, a large white seamless background. 

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:20.088
 In front you have to use something that can reflect light, 

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:23.004
 Like the glass plate in front. 

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:25.047
 Let the model stand 

00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:27.090
 Stand on the back edge of the plate. 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.018
 Most of the light thus reflected falls in front. 

00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:34.087
 Then you complete an actual light sandwich, 

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:36.054
 a circular light source on the left and a circular light source on the right. 

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.074
 The model is in the middle. 

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:41.010
 Of course, you need to use the flash, 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.035
 Use 2 flashes on each side, 

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:46.071
 A flash shines over the model, 

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:49.078
 Another one looks into the background, 

00:01:49.078 --> 00:01:52.023
 Let a lot of light shine on the background. 

00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:56.072
 Then you can shoot. 

00:01:56.072 --> 00:02:01.071
 The camera settings are like this: 

00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:05.006
 I used f/11, you can use f/16 or other settings, 

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:06.089
 Because I want to make the background a bit fuzzy, 

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:08.073
 Because the background has some stains. 

00:02:08.073 --> 00:02:11.042
 This is also the reason 

00:02:11.042 --> 00:02:14.065
 Why the flash is overexposed 

00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:19.022
 I set these flashes to +3 

00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:21.046
 Usually, we all use +1 

00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:24.038
 Let the white background look very white 

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:25.041
 Not in the gray. 

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:27.090
 However, this background is dirty, 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.002
 Very dirty, 

00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:33.071
 So I set the flash to +3 so that it looks as good as possible. 

00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:36.041
 This way I don't have to remove the stain on the background in the image processing software. 

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:38.040
 Ok, this is the lighting setup today, 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.066
 Very simple and very easy to understand. 

00:02:42.018 --> 00:02:51.045
 We welcome your feedback, please leave your valuable comments below! 

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:55.021
 Now let's take advantage of a top secret technique. 

00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:58.002
 A common technique for shooting Hollywood movie images. 

00:02:58.002 --> 00:03:00.076
 You let your model jump to the right 

00:03:00.076 --> 00:03:03.096
 From the center of your light source 

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:06.018
 This is the secret. 

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:08.005
 Commonly used in Hollywood, um, in Photoshop 

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:12.063
 Edit menu &gt; Freeform &gt; Rotate 90° 

00:03:12.063 --> 00:03:13.095
 boom! 

00:03:13.095 --> 00:03:16.040
 Now she fell and landed in one place. 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.089
 You add a little tilt to the background, 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:20.026
 Now she is in the light. 

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:22.050
 Is this very amazing? 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.012
 This secret is only known to us, 

00:03:25.012 --> 00:03:27.067
 Don't tell this secret to anyone you know, 

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:29.053
 Let’s not tell other people about our experiments today, okay? 

00:03:29.053 --> 00:03:32.022
 Well, it looks very good, 

00:03:32.022 --> 00:03:35.091
 I think the most important thing to note is: 

00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:39.080
 A: When you set the lights to the opposite, 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.031
 When you let your model stand in the shadows, 

00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:43.076
 Background in the light, 

00:03:43.076 --> 00:03:45.093
 This also captures the viewer's attention. 

00:03:45.093 --> 00:03:47.037
 Another point is: 

00:03:47.037 --> 00:03:49.083
 If you want to capture the outline of the item, 

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:51.064
 You need to pay more attention to the shadows, 

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.010
 Not some details. 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.072
 Ok, I hope this helps you, 

00:03:55.072 --> 00:03:59.086
 You can use it well. See the next video tutorial. 

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:02.079
 I wish you a good work!
