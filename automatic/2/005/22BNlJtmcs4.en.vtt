 from welcome online store 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.540
 libre boat com i will show you today 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.440
 how keel boat is going to 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.060
 on the example of k n 330 d to start in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.550
 the kit includes the boat itself 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:26.609
 two bags aluminum seats 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.710
 paddle pump repair kit and very hard 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.830
 bottom with aluminum profiles and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.980
 stringers what we do first 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.680
 we decompose the boat and pump up the cylinders 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.500
 somewhere in the middle 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.070
 this we have done for what it is necessary for 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.920
 to flatten the food tape 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.940
 to make it easier for us to insert hard 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.940
 the floor will begin 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.690
 we start with a hard floor nose it consists 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.110
 of the four boards they are all numbered 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.110
 start with 1 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.240
 last and last but one we 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.380
 put the houses in order to postal on 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.380
 your place and 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.229
 and 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.230
 after the floor became a place we 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.550
 insert side stringers 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.550
 to increase floor rigidity 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.330
 little trick to stringer well 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.670
 became necessary 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.270
 that part of the container with which you will 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.650
 insert thong 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:36.110
 lift for this can be used 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.110
 2 stringer we put it under the balloon 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.200
 other side we can use by ourselves 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.200
 pump 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:26.159
 we are inserted on 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:27.900
 we start pumping samoilov after 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.019
 how the boat pumped up pumped 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.540
 the last turn the keel the keel is pumped up 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.049
 until it stops until the pump stops 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.049
 push through 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.830
 put on the back seat is necessary 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:08.520
 soul boat seat in this boat 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.520
 moving 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.130
 as you can see, nothing complicated after that 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.550
 after set the seat set 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.360
 tag 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.360
 finishing touch 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.000
