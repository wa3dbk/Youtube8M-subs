00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
in that now must always do this you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120 
in that now must always do this you
should<00:01:06.270> extract<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.799> should<00:01:07.860> make<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
should extract it as they should make it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.179 
should extract it as they should make it
much<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.580> stable<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.960> general<00:01:10.619> rule<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.890> if

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
much more stable the general rule is if

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.310 
much more stable the general rule is if
everything<00:01:11.670> else<00:01:11.850> that's<00:01:12.360> normal<00:01:13.170> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
everything else that's normal is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.060 
everything else that's normal is
extracted<00:01:14.220> then<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.460> should<00:01:14.610> extract<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:16.070> so

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
extracted then you should extract it so

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.090 
extracted then you should extract it so
we'll<00:01:17.460> open<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.439> here's<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> lucky

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
we'll open up that and here's the lucky

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.620 
we'll open up that and here's the lucky
little<00:01:20.250> thing<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> some<00:01:21.090> reason<00:01:21.330> windows

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
little thing that some reason windows

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.190 
little thing that some reason windows
does<00:01:22.280> it's<00:01:23.280> got<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> double<00:01:24.240> folders<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
does it's got a double folders so it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.359 
does it's got a double folders so it
looks<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.590> you've<00:01:25.770> done<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.280> you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
looks like you've done it but you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.160 
looks like you've done it but you
haven't<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.150> here<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.810> click<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
haven't really it's in here so click and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.670 
haven't really it's in here so click and
drag<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.500> two<00:01:28.650> saves<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.250> copy<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.030> paste

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
drag that up two saves or copy and paste

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.560 
drag that up two saves or copy and paste
and<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:31.799> hopefully<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.430> should<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:33.420> be

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and then hopefully that should really be

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.249 
and then hopefully that should really be
that<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.890> open<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.159> minecraft<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.810> play

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that so if we open up minecraft and play

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.950 
that so if we open up minecraft and play
and<00:01:37.890> seek<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.340> player<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.000> right<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and seek a player and right at the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.410 
and seek a player and right at the
bottom<00:01:40.229> got<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> image<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.549> multiplex<00:01:42.030> it's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
bottom got the image of multiplex it's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.270 
bottom got the image of multiplex it's
really<00:01:42.780> cool<00:01:43.049> eventually<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:43.890> by<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> way<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
really cool eventually but by the way I

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.270
