00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.710 
things loose all those black holes I can
go<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.490> we<00:02:39.060> start<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:40.140> pretty<00:02:40.380> cool<00:02:40.650> harmony

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
go in we start just pretty cool harmony

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.280 
go in we start just pretty cool harmony
Wow<00:02:42.720> far<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:44.070> then<00:02:44.550> after<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.210> you<00:02:46.110> have<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
Wow far so then after that you have a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.810 
Wow far so then after that you have a
number<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:47.270> lock<00:02:48.380> passo<00:02:49.460> pretty<00:02:50.460> cool

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.770 

training<00:02:54.620> level<00:02:55.620> 1<00:02:55.770> 25<00:02:56.160> number<00:02:56.610> 12<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.720> you

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
training level 1 25 number 12 so you

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.270 
training level 1 25 number 12 so you
have<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.050> move<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.260> blue<00:02:58.890> squares<00:03:00.920> like<00:03:01.920> that

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
have to move the blue squares like that

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:24.260 
have to move the blue squares like that
so<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.210> get<00:03:04.070> like<00:03:05.390> let<00:03:06.390> me<00:03:06.510> show<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.840> move

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:33.410 

I<00:03:24.330> must<00:03:25.110> start<00:03:25.410> wait<00:03:26.210> I'll<00:03:27.210> show<00:03:27.240> you<00:03:27.660> Ailee<00:03:32.420> so

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
I must start wait I'll show you Ailee so

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.660 
I must start wait I'll show you Ailee so
you<00:03:33.480> do<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:34.700> it's<00:03:35.700> kind<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.910> hard<00:03:37.310> I'm<00:03:38.310> gonna

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
you do that it's kind of hard I'm gonna

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.430 
you do that it's kind of hard I'm gonna
stop<00:03:39.470> as<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.710> can<00:03:40.830> see<00:03:41.010> i'm<00:03:41.100> not<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.460> good<00:03:41.730> so

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
stop as you can see i'm not that good so

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.620 
stop as you can see i'm not that good so
let's<00:03:43.440> keep<00:03:43.740> you<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.700> have<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.060> get<00:03:45.210> that<00:03:45.360> red

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
let's keep you just have to get that red

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.530 
let's keep you just have to get that red
so<00:03:46.590> go<00:03:46.830> square<00:03:47.190> in<00:03:47.400> here<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:49.640> after<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.940> we

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
so go square in here so after that we

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.960 
so go square in here so after that we
have<00:03:51.840> ball<00:03:52.530> fight<00:03:52.890> on<00:03:53.460> number<00:03:54.770> three<00:03:55.790> so<00:03:56.790> it's

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
have ball fight on number three so it's

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.590 
have ball fight on number three so it's
right<00:03:57.150> there<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.630> ball<00:03:57.780> fight<00:03:59.300> most<00:04:00.300> of<00:04:00.450> these

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
right there and ball fight most of these

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.050 
right there and ball fight most of these
my<00:04:01.200> best<00:04:01.470> applications<00:04:02.100> are<00:04:02.250> on<00:04:02.430> game<00:04:02.670> so

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
my best applications are on game so

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.180 
my best applications are on game so
they're<00:04:03.390> pretty<00:04:03.570> fun<00:04:03.810> but<00:04:03.990> to<00:04:04.500> get<00:04:04.650> your<00:04:05.040> the
