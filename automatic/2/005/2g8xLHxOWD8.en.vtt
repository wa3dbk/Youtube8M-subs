00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.720
 we are in the central in today 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.849
 bear city and how to easily recognize 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.520
 can be here next to me today 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.960
 theme bread jens stone house with me from 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.560
 the hinsbecker management hello 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.750
 Hello 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.920
 yes you can see such a few varieties 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.080
 here next to us are how many 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.790
 There are different varieties with you 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.470
 over 20 different types of bread we 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.070
 all to the best of our knowledge and certain 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.170
 make of the grain bread about what 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.699
 What else is there no bread spelled 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.710
 grape seeds then different 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.449
 mixed bread and therefore with a higher share of 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.460
 Rock or low share in rocking 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.830
 So there is something for every taste 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.030
 So every day another boat or that 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.530
 is also healthy every day another 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.000
 Just boot for the taste more 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.170
 for me to get used to one thing you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.180
 can not schnitzel every day 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.530
 eat or steak but you have to 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.570
 yes someday change a bit 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.089
 and there it is with the bread of hearty 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.159
 from sweet to white brody 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.320
 then they will be very mild 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.759
 Breads are all made here 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.670
 here all made after own 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.500
 show recipe with different sour 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.970
 and to the best of my knowledge and certain and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.580
 as I said with a nice source 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.050
 piece cattle as I have to the then 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060
 imagine what will be in bread here 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.990
 manufactured 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.880
 bread is made with the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.630
 simplest ingredients only wheat flour 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.550
 water rye flour and yeast of course 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.440
 salt is still there and our secret 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.990
 is we still have a cook piece to make 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.380
 What is cooking with the context 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.690
 I would have been normal with bread now 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.100
 but our piece of cook is us 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.659
 Take the rye flour and leave that 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.830
 over a longer period of time 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.210
 in-house recipe at certain grad 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.880
 to let's leave that for a certain 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.409
 buy space that it's the water, so to speak 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.090
 already binds and it still gives the whole 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.650
 a taste and substantial longer 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.350
 fresh attitude without adding 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.990
 chemicals so the baker, the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.340
 partially cooked at least the bread 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.110
 Sounds a bit like one 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.380
 own science what the bread baking 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.390
 Here you can and you can too 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.510
 So do not bake bread now 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.260
 but there is a degree course 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.409
 nutritional sciences and the baker 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.689
 There is a lady doing her master's thesis 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.880
 writes about bread among others and the 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.980
 I introduce them now 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.020
 Kathleen Reinhardt is the one who 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.480
 here their master thesis also writes with 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.890
 work baker master harald late you are 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.140
 Here's a bit of the guard now 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.060
 Kathleen, how do I have yours ? 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.100
 imagine work here to the whole 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.620
 day in the bakery and testes dough 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.900
 Do not you try it? 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.580
 quality of protec also a lot with the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.410
 Raw materials that's what it means 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.320
 samples from the raw materials 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.300
 get pulled in and then tester with 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.430
 made sure the quality of flour stops in 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.270
 Order is whether you stop to bake it 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.460
 suitable is 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.650
 and then it goes on over that 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.890
 bread itself is just outside 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.660
 considered it corresponds to the form 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.490
 the look what a customer have stopped 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.800
 it wants to be cut open it will 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.750
 try and halt watched whether the halt 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.120
 meets the customer's requirements 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.950
 how fine your samples here at the bakery 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.920
 so very good 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.650
 so it's a very nice bread which 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.280
 I test it here every day 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.310
 much love with trainer and the quality 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.590
 Also comes through the raw materials 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.430
 here from the region and so me 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.960
 I am very pleased 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.510
 So everything is at a very high level 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.980
 or very high level we can do that 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.720
 a protest as you otherwise always him 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.420
 doing here also make time does that yes 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.070
 clearly behind us is built one 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.200
 acidity analysis that is just like 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.420
 sour a bread is but it will 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.890
 mr later tell them something 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.280
 while I'm doing my test 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.470
 harald was just doing cath lena 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.570
 here we do now just such 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.360
 Dimensioning means that we measure the acidity 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.000
 in bread and sourdough with it 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.500
 Can we tell how is that 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.080
 taste of the bread fits the acid has 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.760
 the sourdough its optimal ripe order 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.980
 he after that a product also the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.560
 top quality brings that means you 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.830
 is now calling out of the bread pieces 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.799
 get out right here are ten grams of bread 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.950
 or sourdough will be taken out 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.450
 then afterwards with soda lye the whole 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.940
 will that 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.500
 a bad thing and so to speak 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.960
 about where we then afterwards that 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.360
 Whole measures how much acid in the 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.210
 product in it is why you have to 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.410
 if, for example, we make an acid 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.850
 manufacturer or sourdough produce the 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.930
 Too long stand for example have to 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.310
 many acetic acid in it 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.580
 but then it forms in the taste 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.370
 if you have the bread after one 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.840
 Sharp a sharp should go out like this 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.330
 Can you say it swallows and 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.700
 that is rather negative again 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.380
 therefore easy then the acid measurement to 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.480
 to act against it 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.340
 how long will a bread last now? 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.440
 fresh four to five days 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.110
 Now I read that if you can do that 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.430
 in the fridge packs that is longer 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.690
 fresh stays longer keeps that true 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.610
 no, no 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.140
 always in a lunch box to keep the 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.240
 Keep the whole and nice clean 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.520
 breadbox and then you have everything you need 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.140
 would like to have bread then what do I have 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.430
 Now for a bread here in her hand 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.590
 have now really good one 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.030
 Mixed bread so that's a mixed bread it 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.190
 But there are still many at hannah becker 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.200
 other varieties from the grain bread over sieges 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.390
 best you can just times in the 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.030
 Look out if you have something special 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.010
 find bread a very exciting and also 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.380
 interesting complex topic like us 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.600
 have learned there are protests kathleen 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.580
 write her master thesis about us 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.650
 press your thumb for that's it 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.210
 for this episode hannah becker tv i 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.220
 Hope you had fun now 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.640
 much more about bread and to the next 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.640
