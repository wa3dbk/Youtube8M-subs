flags if you notice there on the bottom
left<00:00:21.700> which<00:00:22.270> is<00:00:22.420> a<00:00:22.570> a<00:00:22.960> good<00:00:23.380> upgrade<00:00:23.560> from<00:00:23.860> the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
left which is a a good upgrade from the

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.160 
left which is a a good upgrade from the
retail<00:00:24.610> version<00:00:24.820> but<00:00:25.119> it's<00:00:25.270> slightly<00:00:25.600> smaller

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
retail version but it's slightly smaller

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.200 
retail version but it's slightly smaller
than<00:00:26.320> how<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.650> original<00:00:27.130> design<00:00:27.400> was<00:00:27.430> too

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
than how the original design was too

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.460 
than how the original design was too
familiar<00:00:28.390> with<00:00:28.600> battlefield<00:00:28.930> to<00:00:29.230> it<00:00:29.350> have

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
familiar with battlefield to it have

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.230 
familiar with battlefield to it have
eight<00:00:29.680> naps<00:00:29.980> and<00:00:30.220> I<00:00:30.609> think<00:00:30.789> the<00:00:30.880> launch<00:00:31.090> it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
eight naps and I think the launch it

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.170 
eight naps and I think the launch it
behind<00:00:31.510> this<00:00:31.630> was<00:00:31.779> dice<00:00:31.960> wanted<00:00:32.320> to<00:00:32.410> give<00:00:32.529> two

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
behind this was dice wanted to give two

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.689 
behind this was dice wanted to give two
sides<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.570> uncap<00:00:35.019> and<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.370> then<00:00:36.489> you<00:00:36.580> would

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
sides the uncap and and then you would

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.280 
sides the uncap and and then you would
go<00:00:36.850> in<00:00:36.970> and<00:00:37.120> start<00:00:37.420> capturing<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.960> flags<00:00:38.170> and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
go in and start capturing the flags and

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.240 
go in and start capturing the flags and
I<00:00:38.320> don't<00:00:38.500> know<00:00:38.590> if<00:00:38.680> that's<00:00:38.830> going<00:00:38.949> to<00:00:39.010> be<00:00:39.129> the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
I don't know if that's going to be the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.549 
I don't know if that's going to be the
exact<00:00:39.670> placement<00:00:39.970> of<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.570> young<00:00:40.690> caps<00:00:40.960> but

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
exact placement of the young caps but

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.920 
exact placement of the young caps but
that's<00:00:41.739> just<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.280> theory<00:00:43.059> so<00:00:43.180> we'll<00:00:43.540> see<00:00:43.750> that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
that's just a theory so we'll see that

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.630 
that's just a theory so we'll see that
you'll<00:00:44.110> notice<00:00:44.260> that<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.920> map<00:00:45.129> itself<00:00:45.339> is<00:00:45.610> a

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
you'll notice that the map itself is a

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.460 
you'll notice that the map itself is a
complete<00:00:46.030> redesign<00:00:46.330> of<00:00:46.659> battlefield<00:00:47.290> Tunes

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
complete redesign of battlefield Tunes

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.070 
complete redesign of battlefield Tunes

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
version as you notice some familiar look

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.660 
version as you notice some familiar look

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
here from the bridge crossing over to

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.799 
here from the bridge crossing over to
each<00:00:51.790> side<00:00:52.000> there's<00:00:52.449> gonna<00:00:52.540> be<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:52.690> lot<00:00:52.750> more
