00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.820
 [Music] 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.940
 99 and hello to one 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.980
 another video to destiny and indeed in 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.599
 the video is about an amazing 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.190
 Fund that I found as me 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.840
 the live stream yesterday again 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.970
 I've looked and I have here 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.410
 found something very special 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.840
 Here I show again the cash on delivery 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.910
 pay attention to the weapon over the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.480
 universal device so the exotic weapon 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.510
 the exotic shotgun sees the thing 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.309
 just like the rifle of the strangers 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.530
 only in legendary 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.940
 Let's get to the other stuff I have 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.800
 linked to this 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 Look at that thing looks like 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.460
 but the defense has the foreign batteries 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 element as it can see below has 24 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.350
 shots magazine looks really identical 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.660
 to the gun of the strangers 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.070
 My guess is really that there 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.199
 granted strangers the next 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.020
 evolutionary stage in this game 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.750
 because it is not for nothing 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.869
 just so this legendary picture in the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.299
 world and a non-exotic weapon the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.650
 an element has that are actually only 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.439
 raid weapons and since this weapon is not 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.560
 in a way, it looks like a weapon 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.610
 which actually comes from the star 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.530
 namely strongly on the accordingly 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.869
 granted to strangers an evolution weapon 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.939
 is the one and the king of the possessed ones 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.930
 two further stages unlocked 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.759
 will get because at the same time the picture 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.130
 you now again pays short as 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.799
 said about the universal device 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.619
 or twice over the red one 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.450
 Dead and then you see exactly what I am 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.250
 This is really the picture of me 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.439
 gun of foreign members in the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.200
 Background that is the thing 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:55.090
 legendary and legendary granted foreign 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.500
 that seems to me a lot 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.770
 to be interesting because it gets 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.920
 strangers was already so strong 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.319
 It was all over from the b16 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.420
 strong it was much stronger than all 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.280
 other weapons for level 16 man 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.130
 had more perks had so much 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.709
 malicious their weapons and even had 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.239
 ballistic though it's just a blue one 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.910
 weapon normally have 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.940
 Ballisticians only exotic weapons 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.099
 that means the thing could really be then 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.180
 the new weapon we are aiming for 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.040
 play or 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.560
 the weather is bad at the next corner 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.590
 chelsom will be in the game here you see 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.420
 again the three pictures of the guards 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.069
 once started with signs 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.980
 after that comes the legendary one 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.620
 are so I have no name 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.340
 the exotic part should be a name 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.780
 do not get time for explanations like that 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.329
 That should be called in German 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.310
 what do you mean your opinion in me 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.220
 the comments will really be 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.870
 an evolution swatch or not so in 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.130
 In the meantime I say goodbye to many 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.660
 Thanks for watching one 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.660
