the next questions about denture

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.040 
the next questions about denture
retention<00:02:37.400> now<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.120> get<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.360> denture<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.930> it's

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
retention now you get a denture and it's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.050 
retention now you get a denture and it's
placed<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.650> now<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.520> just<00:02:40.550> doesn't

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
placed and now it just it just doesn't

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.480 
placed and now it just it just doesn't
stay<00:02:41.210> at<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.390> place<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.380> can't<00:02:42.650> eat<00:02:42.800> well

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
stay at a place and you can't eat well

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.950 
stay at a place and you can't eat well
the<00:02:43.640> treatment<00:02:44.000> for<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.210> loose<00:02:44.390> denture<00:02:44.840> is

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
the treatment for a loose denture is

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.840 
the treatment for a loose denture is
dependent<00:02:45.530> as<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.830> can<00:02:45.950> probably<00:02:46.190> imagine<00:02:46.370> on

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
dependent as you can probably imagine on

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.360 
dependent as you can probably imagine on
the<00:02:46.970> cause<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:48.230> ventured<00:02:48.590> very<00:02:48.890> old<00:02:49.130> and

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the cause is the ventured very old and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.890 
the cause is the ventured very old and
therefore<00:02:49.790> maybe<00:02:50.000> your<00:02:50.330> gum<00:02:50.510> tissues<00:02:50.870> may

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
therefore maybe your gum tissues may

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.390 
therefore maybe your gum tissues may
have<00:02:51.170> changed<00:02:51.470> over<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.890> years<00:02:52.190> and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
have changed over the years and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.130 
have changed over the years and
therefore<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.270> results<00:02:53.660> in<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.810> loss<00:02:53.990> of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
therefore it results in a loss of

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.010 
therefore it results in a loss of
retention<00:02:54.440> now<00:02:55.340> it's<00:02:55.520> possible<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.090> really<00:02:56.270> a

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
retention now it's possible to really a

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.420 
retention now it's possible to really a
real<00:02:57.350> line<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.740> your<00:02:57.830> denture<00:02:58.190> may<00:02:58.370> be

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
real line of your denture may be

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.610 
real line of your denture may be
indicated<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:59.690> need<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.050> discuss<00:03:00.290> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
indicated you need to discuss the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.200 
indicated you need to discuss the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
treatment alternatives with your dentist

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.690 
treatment alternatives with your dentist
know<00:03:02.690> if<00:03:02.960> this<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.380> new<00:03:03.560> denture<00:03:04.070> then<00:03:04.520> the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
know if this is a new denture then the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.700 
know if this is a new denture then the
retention<00:03:05.030> may<00:03:05.480> just<00:03:05.900> not<00:03:06.050> be<00:03:06.110> adequate<00:03:06.530> for

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
retention may just not be adequate for

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.640 
retention may just not be adequate for
wide<00:03:07.160> variety<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:07.940> reasons<00:03:08.000> including

wide variety of reasons including

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.710 
wide variety of reasons including
limited<00:03:09.650> bone<00:03:09.860> support<00:03:10.340> now<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.210> would<00:03:11.570> suggest

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
limited bone support now I would suggest

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.720 
limited bone support now I would suggest
that<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.200> discussion<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.830> dental<00:03:13.100> implants<00:03:13.520> may

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
that a discussion of dental implants may

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.020 
that a discussion of dental implants may
be<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:14.060> your<00:03:14.210> future<00:03:14.920> for<00:03:15.920> now<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.130> can<00:03:16.580> go<00:03:16.730> to

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
be in your future for now you can go to

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.760 
be in your future for now you can go to
lose<00:03:17.270> one<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.810> denture<00:03:18.290> adhesive<00:03:18.320> that
