00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.620
 greetings we're starting one more 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.720
 today's edition in tek world 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.200
 you will see information about the bike x 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.040
 + 1 new from computex and others 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.870
 highlights 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.590
 so stay connected when it's time to stay 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.720
 updated a new vulnerability 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.050
 found in the encryption system the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.779
 psl may be more serious than hotmind 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.769
 a very serious fault identified 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.289
 time 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.450
 tatsuya hayashi a specialist in 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.850
 data security told the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.980
 guardian that this new bug allows 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.890
 hackers have direct access to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.020
 communications from other users and this 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.719
 much easier if someone wants to 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.809
 to spy on a person only the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.100
 curious is that this fault is part of a 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.949
 code in the system since 1998 or 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.739
 16 years without solving this 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.730
 breach so far no attack has been 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 registered 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.809
 but the tip of the experts in 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.920
 safety is to keep all equipment 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.200
 updated 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.110
 the successor to the bike x which should be called 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.790
 moto x plus one will have a screen with 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.520
 resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels and this 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.740
 has been confirmed in an unusual way 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.320
 punit soni who is vice-president of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.439
 motorola product posted an image 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.020
 registered on a smartphone with display 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.479
 that the resolution has the detail is that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.090
 no motorola products already available 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.400
 the market has this characteristic and was 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.860
 reason why they concluded that this then 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.659
 must be the resolution of the bike x plus one 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 this device must be 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.439
 officially in the third quarter of this year. 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.710
 year 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.869
 The subject is now computex because there in the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.180
 largest electronics fair in Asia was 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.360
 displayed a keyboard that holds the keys 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.030
 suspended in the air magnetically this 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.399
 novelty was presented by darfur 1 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.439
 the keyboard is called maglev and what 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.469
 happens is that the keys are repelled 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.840
 magnetically by the support of elements 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.550
 that hold the keys in place but not 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.709
 there are mechanical parts 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.940
 the manufacturer's expectation is that 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.220
 assemblers cut 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.980
 say this keyboard in notebooks so that 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.470
 the notebooks are even thinner 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.780
 It's a nice news that comes there. 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.660
 of computex but what did you find? 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.850
 liked to leave your opinion in the comments 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.160
 Another highlight of this computex comes from 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.960
 asus because the company presented a 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.540
 headset with a look of an owl 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.620
 devilish look evil even so thing of the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.720
 really 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.060
 jokes aside with the look of this 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.410
 line is aimed at the public gamer who 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.230
 it's called tics 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.680
 this model has on each side a 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.470
 60mm one neodymium magnet 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.780
 control box via usb still helps 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.850
 items like the noise cancellation 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.250
 microphone can be highlighted to 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.530
 use the accessory only as a headset 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.960
 and if network 7 should reach the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.640
 international stores from the month of 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.950
 but there is no information about the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.840
 launch here in Brazil two counties 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.990
 from england will use a car from 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.240
 race to chase who walks a lot 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.310
 hurry on the roads of the region 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.190
 the hurries that run through the 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.230
 data from avon and somerset will have to be 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.330
 watch with ariel atom 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.850
 this vehicle even looks like a car 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.070
 formula 1 and goes from 0 to 100 kilometers 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.130
 per hour in less than two seconds and 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.480
 half the car costs something around 115 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.040
 one thousand reais 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.830
 but it was not bought by the police 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.959
 it was borrowed to be used 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.120
 during the summer there in a campaign to 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.739
 raise awareness of heavy-duty drivers 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.840
 on the accelerator 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.600
 the expectation is that drivers 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.720
 Look at this car and think about two cars. 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.150
 500 times before starting to run a 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.239
 site g1 made a survey that points 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.580
 that Brazil has the ninth worst internet 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.500
 among the 32 countries that will compete 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.870
 world cup starting next week 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.060
 here in brazil this research used 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.160
 connection data provided by the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.120
 network infrastructure company 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.239
 Akamai 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.519
 Brazil recorded the speed of 2.7 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.310
 megabits per second between the selections 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.459
 this brand is better only than 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.120
 costa rica honduras and iran 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.200
 Ivory coast wins Algeria and Algeria 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.630
 Cameroon 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.020
 one of the reasons for this are the ones and made a 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.120
 single or 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.699
 internet protocol logs 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.550
 which are responsible for enabling the 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.650
 access to the large network by 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.449
 good who uses the internet there knows in Brazil 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.409
 It may even be champion of the Cup but 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.870
 Internet 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:43.210
 we give a thrashing of many countries 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.610
 and this is it was another edition of the 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.500
 today in the world tac link all links 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.930
 news that we show here are on 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.789
 description is just click and check people 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.680
 Back on Monday, everyone has a 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.680
