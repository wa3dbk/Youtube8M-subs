has a touchscreen on the back which we

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.019 
has a touchscreen on the back which we
can<00:00:28.329> use<00:00:28.569> not<00:00:29.019> only<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.800> navigate<00:00:30.699> through<00:00:30.939> our

autofocus even during our video burst we
really<00:00:53.410> like<00:00:53.649> that<00:00:53.859> feature<00:00:54.269> it<00:00:55.269> has<00:00:55.329> a<00:00:55.809> micro

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
really like that feature it has a micro

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.250 
really like that feature it has a micro
four-thirds<00:00:57.370> fitting<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.539> benefits<00:00:59.079> of<00:00:59.199> the

four-thirds fitting the benefits of the
micro<00:00:59.620> four-thirds<00:01:00.129> fitting<00:01:00.579> is<00:01:00.910> that<00:01:01.179> we<00:01:01.329> can

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
micro four-thirds fitting is that we can

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.250 
micro four-thirds fitting is that we can
have<00:01:02.760> interchangeable<00:01:03.760> lenses<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
have interchangeable lenses the

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.590 
have interchangeable lenses the
effective<00:01:06.130> focal<00:01:06.370> length<00:01:06.730> is<00:01:06.850> basically<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.390> 2

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
effective focal length is basically a 2

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.320 
effective focal length is basically a 2

millimeter<00:01:10.800> 1.7<00:01:11.800> pancake<00:01:12.430> lens<00:01:12.670> we<00:01:13.660> in<00:01:13.960> call

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
millimeter 1.7 pancake lens we in call

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
to a 40 millimeter 1.7 so in that case

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.200 
to a 40 millimeter 1.7 so in that case
it<00:01:17.500> would<00:01:17.590> be<00:01:17.620> really<00:01:18.250> nice<00:01:18.400> slightly<00:01:18.910> wide

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210

face recognition will prioritize to

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.059 
face recognition will prioritize to
focus<00:02:12.129> where<00:02:12.310> we<00:02:12.340> want<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:14.410> screen<00:02:14.799> as

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
focus where we want it to the screen as

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.970 
focus where we want it to the screen as
I<00:02:16.000> said<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.480> flips<00:02:16.810> out<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.290> if<00:02:17.410> we<00:02:17.560> want<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:17.920> to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
I said it flips out so if we want it to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.440 
I said it flips out so if we want it to
be<00:02:18.099> hidden<00:02:18.569> we<00:02:19.569> turn<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.099> like<00:02:21.099> this<00:02:21.239> if<00:02:22.239> we

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
be hidden we turn it like this if we

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.360 
be hidden we turn it like this if we
want<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.660> use<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.200> screen<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:23.950> composition

or menu we can turn it around that way
but<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.069> really<00:02:27.549> neat<00:02:27.819> little<00:02:28.000> feature<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.780> it

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
but the really neat little feature is it

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.440 
but the really neat little feature is it
has<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> sensor<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.790> when<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.060> put<00:02:31.360> the

to 42 millimeter zoom lens which which

to 42 millimeter zoom lens which which
is<00:03:22.359> a<00:03:22.389> really<00:03:22.810> nice<00:03:23.049> combination<00:03:23.500> which<00:03:24.280> is

is a really nice combination which is

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.080 
is a really nice combination which is
equivalent<00:03:24.819> to<00:03:25.389> a<00:03:25.599> 28<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.859> 80<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.430> 84
