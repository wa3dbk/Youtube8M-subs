00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
bottom text down here I just really want

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.580 
bottom text down here I just really want
to<00:03:15.320> concentrate<00:03:16.320> on<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.620> masthead<00:03:17.100> here<00:03:17.549> and

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
to concentrate on the masthead here and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.289 
to concentrate on the masthead here and
this<00:03:19.590> canvas<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.310> not<00:03:20.370> very<00:03:20.850> good<00:03:21.000> because<00:03:21.150> it

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
this canvas is not very good because it

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.780 
this canvas is not very good because it
doesn't<00:03:21.720> let<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.900> see<00:03:22.530> anything<00:03:23.160> outside<00:03:23.670> of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
doesn't let you see anything outside of

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.430 
doesn't let you see anything outside of
the<00:03:23.850> canvas<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:24.900> can't<00:03:25.230> get<00:03:25.350> your

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
the canvas so you can't get your

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.410 
the canvas so you can't get your
handlebars<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:29.549> looks<00:03:29.790> pretty<00:03:30.030> good<00:03:30.209> I

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
handlebars that looks pretty good I

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.120 
handlebars that looks pretty good I
don't<00:03:30.600> mind<00:03:30.750> having<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.079> little<00:03:31.200> white<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.769> both

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
don't mind having a little white on both

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.530 
don't mind having a little white on both
sides<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:34.610> for<00:03:35.610> today's<00:03:35.850> purposes<00:03:36.329> that's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
sides and for today's purposes that's

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.860 
sides and for today's purposes that's
fine<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.230> as<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.380> can<00:03:37.500> see<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:38.190> letterhead

we can go in and crop out that bottom
but<00:06:52.019> you<00:06:52.050> get<00:06:52.319> a<00:06:52.349> pretty<00:06:52.619> good<00:06:52.709> looking

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:53.159 
but you get a pretty good looking

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:55.879 
but you get a pretty good looking
estimate<00:06:53.639> really<00:06:53.999> fast<00:06:54.389> obviously<00:06:55.050> it's<00:06:55.739> for

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
estimate really fast obviously it's for

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.649 
estimate really fast obviously it's for
nobody<00:06:56.309> so<00:06:56.759> it<00:06:56.849> doesn't<00:06:57.089> have<00:06:57.269> information

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:57.659 
nobody so it doesn't have information

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:59.479 
nobody so it doesn't have information
here<00:06:58.050> you<00:06:58.739> can<00:06:58.889> actually<00:06:59.039> bring<00:06:59.339> this

00:06:59.479 --> 00:06:59.489 
here you can actually bring this

00:06:59.489 --> 00:07:01.939 
here you can actually bring this
information<00:06:59.759> down<00:07:00.360> a<00:07:00.419> little<00:07:00.689> bit<00:07:00.779> more<00:07:00.989> this

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949 
information down a little bit more this

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.299 
information down a little bit more this
is<00:07:02.159> a<00:07:02.309> really<00:07:02.939> nice<00:07:03.119> estimate<00:07:03.929> for<00:07:04.319> the<00:07:05.099> type

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:05.309 
is a really nice estimate for the type

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:06.559 
is a really nice estimate for the type
of<00:07:05.339> thing<00:07:05.639> you<00:07:05.819> know<00:07:05.939> for<00:07:06.119> the<00:07:06.269> you<00:07:06.389> know<00:07:06.539> a

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:06.569 
of thing you know for the you know a

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:09.469 
of thing you know for the you know a
longer<00:07:07.439> line<00:07:07.739> item<00:07:08.159> so<00:07:08.909> you<00:07:08.969> can<00:07:09.119> fit<00:07:09.299> more

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 
longer line item so you can fit more

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.589 
longer line item so you can fit more
