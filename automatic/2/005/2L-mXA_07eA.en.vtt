00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.240
 hello everyone today I 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.760
 will show you how to do this 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.119
 decoration of drapes again but a 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.419
 cloth is very simple a beginner level 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.759
 that I did on an old French that 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.919
 date more than five weeks ago than 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.119
 I could not bear anymore and as I had 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.099
 I do not want to completely redo 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.649
 nails I just made myself a 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.520
 little decor over by keeping when 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.149
 even some golden touches that go 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.950
 very well with the bordeaux the bordeaux 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.260
 draping go I'll let you look 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.380
 at the level of the frozen index so 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.860
 reproduce this same decoration mirrors 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.200
 so I take a flat brush there it's 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.410
 a number zero raphael however I 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.000
 no longer the reference is the range 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.000
 sepia that I bought in art store 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.570
 and I use personally I use 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.880
 for this decoration the gel by the Indian 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.619
 blueberries from real threat 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.729
 but obviously you can do that at 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.600
 varnish or even watercolor for a little 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.399
 more transparency 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.399
 so I start by drawing 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:32.780
 their shares 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.780
 will ask peace I the limits actually 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.229
 game jacques apply it very fine 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.280
 diapers hours because I'm eaten 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.110
 keep one years transparency effect 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.990
 to preserve the glitter that in 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.430
 below we look down under the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.650
 shoes your heart beating and then I 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:07.479
 teasing ladder sort of looking at you 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.060
 deeply buried moments of 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.580
 the future in sounds the violent funds 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.260
 the show that lifts the night fallen stone 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.390
 SÃ©mard 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.739
 before jean vilar more i show you 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.430
 always a little bit higher 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.959
 on that side of me there is fire in the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.120
 straw is at the water sun in hama 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.879
 rebellious city whose sun and then the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.409
 brusciously bewildered here is the field all 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.409
 simply these are triple to 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.410
 can not complicated 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.620
 and then the only possible outcome as well 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.140
 art 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.200
 give me hollande su 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.160
 i have the daily tokens catalyze 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.590
 one minute 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.170
 then without degreasing the gel I'm going 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.770
 use my acrylic paint my pb at 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.780
 white paint decoration 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:04.400
 I take my brush which is new 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:08.240
 announced baby wakes me up 1400m and back 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.670
 it 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.910
 very sharp and at the same time the basis 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.910
 is very wide 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.550
 great and here I will follow the benchmarks 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.350
 of my staircase to come and make their 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.350
 fears of two worlds fast 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.470
 as we have banked 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.470
 go down in this area 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.530
 here is the fool in the straw is then 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.530
 the one of my life 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.890
 and on the top edge I want to come 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:08.240
 draw our white line a little bit 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:09.980
 thicker I stole our fears 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.490
 I think 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.810
 and the fate 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.810
 like cocks in 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.109
 1 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.000
 then I just have to do the clown 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.000
 rapping by directing them towards however 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.500
 you can also make their butter 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.240
 justin 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.559
 at the end of classes 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.439
 I always got with the same a bucket 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:04.349
 and the painting is white I'm going to do 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.979
 kind of places a little bit small 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.979
 little as I want 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.229
 without thinking too much 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.560
 he 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:24.999
 he added 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.020
 a small cup 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:32.360
 at the end of the wolf 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.030
 Houas 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.040
 yeah 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.040
 makes a second 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.430
 a second one is there it's rather than a 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.430
 young who comes what he puts on 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.970
 it's a mini m 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.510
 as soon as my painting is wise me I 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:37.960
 come on put a finishing gel so there 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:39.790
 I use the gloss adnet luxury and then 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.800
 you on your side if you do that 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.520
 with varnish you add just one 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.520
 layer of top coat 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.050

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.150
 minutes have passed

 mongel is totally dry and I have 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.730

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.350
 mayrevieille break that had more than 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.850
 five weeks 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:16.460

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:17.410
 cuticles to moisturize well and that's 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.520
