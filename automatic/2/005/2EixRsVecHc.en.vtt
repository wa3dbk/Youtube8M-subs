honest with you here you go see how it

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.770 
honest with you here you go see how it
pours<00:05:39.509> out<00:05:39.720> get<00:05:40.289> closer<00:05:40.849> it's<00:05:41.849> basically<00:05:42.659> a

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
pours out get closer it's basically a

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.240 
pours out get closer it's basically a
liquid<00:05:43.169> okay<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:43.800> um<00:05:45.590> yeah<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:46.620> think<00:05:46.770> it's<00:05:47.039> for

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
liquid okay and um yeah I think it's for

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.350 
liquid okay and um yeah I think it's for
fine<00:05:47.699> to<00:05:48.000> medium<00:05:48.210> here<00:05:50.030> which<00:05:51.030> is<00:05:51.150> fine

fine to medium here which is fine

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.399 
fine to medium here which is fine

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
because my strands are on the finer side

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.680 
because my strands are on the finer side
but<00:05:55.409> my<00:05:55.440> hair<00:05:55.979> is<00:05:56.009> very<00:05:56.310> dense<00:05:56.759> like<00:05:57.330> I<00:05:57.479> have<00:05:57.659> a
