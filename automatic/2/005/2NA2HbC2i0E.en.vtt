00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:03.650
 well let's do a lighting test of 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.060
 from our lounge 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.350
 brands in a toledo 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.040
 in it we are installed in this vehicle a few kilos where 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.809
 35 watts 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.470
 of 6 thousand cases 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.470
 in short range and that courageous faror 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.029
 as you know mental and senegal 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.029
 let's understand the short 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 we see that the start is very fast not even five seconds 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.020
 our trainers we already know that they are watertight 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.110
 and provides world in this case 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.460
 35 35 watts that is how it is in which any vehicle takes origin 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.540
 let's try the anti-fog 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.990
 in this case we carry lamps of five thousand degrees Kelvin 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.740
 because it is a strike an open strike 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 ok does not wear lenses a normal pattern unemployment 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.049
 the coloration of the coast in seismic is equated with the magnifying glass 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.850
 with the case of 5000 case the javier toyo anti-fog arrest 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.150
 we were to approve the long 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.240
 We also carry a kit 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.440
 25 Watt 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.510
 ok - our marked a toledo 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.780
 d 5000 kelvin 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.270
 there is no doubt about quite powerful and that enough time 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.970
 and let's get an idea 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.600
 g jose going down 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 We have been receiving the signals that we have found in the background 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 in red triangular signs 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.320
 what are others doing 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.130
 which are 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.120
 create signs of we want to triangulate appetite 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.770
 they are from a zebra crossing 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.320
 maybe it gains 100 meters located we do not have there two square signs the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.010
 blue color alleges are pretty far 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.010
 need located 200 meters away 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.850
 we are the clarity of light 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.050
 and the cut in all the trees of the road 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.009
 from the 100 meters that is there trees are born in loincloths 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.429
 up to 50 meters that is the tang square here signs 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.839
 and at 10 meters 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.839
 asked for 10 meters the first signs of poles and kicks 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:32.949
 until the next test
