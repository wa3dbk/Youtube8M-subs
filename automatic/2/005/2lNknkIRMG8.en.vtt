which<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> pay<00:00:47.520> for<00:00:47.820> but

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
which I think you have to pay for but

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.100 
which I think you have to pay for but
four<00:00:49.140> points<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.800> walk<00:00:50.250> faster<00:00:51.110> climb

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
four points you can walk faster climb

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.459 
four points you can walk faster climb
and<00:00:52.350> crouch<00:00:52.590> walk<00:00:52.890> faster<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.170> you're<00:00:55.170> nearly

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
and crouch walk faster and you're nearly

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.830 
and crouch walk faster and you're nearly
impossible<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.579> hear<00:00:56.879> one<00:00:57.120> moving<00:00:57.539> which<00:00:57.690> is

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
impossible to hear one moving which is

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.040 
impossible to hear one moving which is
very<00:00:58.109> important<00:00:58.620> which<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.719> give<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
very important which if you can give it

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.630 
very important which if you can give it
a<00:01:01.109> crafter<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.190> then<00:01:02.430> put<00:01:02.730> covert<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
a crafter one and then put covert to

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.130 
a crafter one and then put covert to
your<00:01:05.640> pretty<00:01:05.909> much<00:01:06.060> invisible<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.750> listening

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
your pretty much invisible to listening

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.440 
your pretty much invisible to listening
mode<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.369> move<00:01:08.580> around<00:01:08.729> super<00:01:09.180> quick

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
mode and you can move around super quick

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.520 
mode and you can move around super quick
and<00:01:09.689> you'll<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.420> Shiv<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.439> you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
won't even have to worry about crafting

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.280 
won't even have to worry about crafting
shiz<00:01:15.119> which<00:01:15.390> pretty<00:01:15.630> much<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.020> class

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
