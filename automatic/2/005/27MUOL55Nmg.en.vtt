00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.650
 Here you have a short overview 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.080
 what you in the day all so yet 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.180
 expected all channels are in the end and in 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.680
 the infobox links and there is with me 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.939
 today just this juicy 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.010
 chocolate cake 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:35.260
 we need some salt for that 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.070
 nexans alternatively also powder or 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.130
 vanilla sugar 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.930
 we need bacau powdered sugar 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.520
 baking powder some light vinegar to 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.250
 example bright balsamic or 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.170
 white wine vinegar and dark chocolate 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 a tasteless oil so to 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.730
 for example rapeseed or sunflower oil 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.070
 occupy a baking mold main has one 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.500
 diameter of 20 centimeters at the bottom 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.870
 Put some oil into it with baking paper 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.590
 and paint them with the floor and 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.670
 one side 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.970
 then we sprinkle them with something 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.920
 Cocoa turns it over and knocks it too 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.170
 times to the sides then spreads 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.400
 all good 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.939
 we put the cocoa in a bowl 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.399
 this 240 liters of lukewarm water 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:22.390
 and then stir everything until the cocoa 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.890
 no lumps he forms into a big one 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.759
 We give the bowl to the sea 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.399
 the sugar the baking powder and one 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.469
 half teaspoon of salt and then stir 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.909
 everything thoroughly with each other and the 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.829
 whisk makes it all 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.069
 practically 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.270
 We then press in the middle of a trough 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:47.439
 pour the biggest cocoa into it 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.670
 as well as the oil and supplement with two 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.740
 teaspoons of vanilla essence then 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.929
 We stir everything thoroughly until for 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.510
 a homogeneous slightly viscous pike 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.850
 receive 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.270
 then we go vinegar to it and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.619
 stir everything again briefly 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.020
 with the dough we fill now the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.160
 prepare bakeware and give it 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.260
 then in the oven 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.310
 there we pack them at 190 degrees 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.250
 circulated air 170 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.650
 with me it was exactly 34 power to the end 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.970
 Just finish the chopsticks sample 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.860
 Let's have it baked for 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.319
 Cool for at least a quarter of an hour 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.360
 then release the cake with a knife 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.940
 side edge of the springform and leave the 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.630
 then freed from the springform 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.910
 cool completely 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.010
 in the meantime, we are shattering the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.200
 did bitter chocolate roughly melt the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.750
 then either over the water or in 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.810
 the microwave melted chocolate 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.819
 then we will extend a garage to 7 so 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.350
 a part of the powdered sugar over it 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.090
 You can also pour it in so pure 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.519
 runs then however danger that itself 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.170
 make clumps then stir everything 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.970
 Add a small amount of lukewarm water 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.830
 and do not be surprised if the 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.390
 chocolate in the meantime a little firmer 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.790
 that will be at the clock again 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.340
 then the rest of the blood sugar above it 7 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.500
 maybe again something from the water up 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.390
 he end up having a consistency like that 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.220
 in danger looks 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.200
 and then this chocolate mass pours 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.210
 on the center of the cake and spread 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.310
 She either becomes a palette knife 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.230
 or with a cake server or one 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.630
 quite normal big knife everything 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.630
 let it dry and this is done 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.550
 delicious chocolate cake the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.500
 the alternative, however, is that he still has it 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.660
 I decorated myself a little bit 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.950
 Physx everything decided and only to 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.720
 Do not be surprised at that 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.940
 top again a little bit of 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.350
 the garage given for the come if 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.240
 table good fit taste 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.680
 excellent in but also in 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.400
 Strawberries, I imagine that very much 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.410
 delicious before 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.360
 We could see the preparation 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.820
 really not complicated and the 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.130
 We see that in in voters 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.410
 beautiful juicy dough has emerged like 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.490
 the cake tastes excellent 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.740
