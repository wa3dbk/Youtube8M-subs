00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
visit where they put this on the outside

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.760 
visit where they put this on the outside
and<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.900> think<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.260> reason<00:02:21.380> why<00:02:21.560> you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
and can you think of a reason why you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.610 
and can you think of a reason why you
would<00:02:22.100> do<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:23.080> think<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.200> teachers<00:02:24.590> and

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
would do that think of teachers and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.400 
would do that think of teachers and
adults<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.820> students<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:26.900> they<00:02:26.930> can<00:02:27.080> like

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
adults and students so they can like

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.210 
adults and students so they can like
make<00:02:27.650> sure<00:02:27.920> everyone's<00:02:28.900> coming<00:02:29.900> out<00:02:30.220> exactly

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
make sure everyone's coming out exactly

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.360 
make sure everyone's coming out exactly
it's<00:02:31.459> easier<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.880> supervise<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:33.050> think

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
it's easier to supervise and I think

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.710 
it's easier to supervise and I think
everybody<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.820> know<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.120> adult<00:02:35.360> end<00:02:35.570> of

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
everybody that you know the adult end of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.600 
everybody that you know the adult end of
it<00:02:35.810> loves<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.500> idea<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.160> we're<00:02:37.310> kind<00:02:37.580> of

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
it loves the idea so we're kind of

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.340 
it loves the idea so we're kind of
curious<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.030> see<00:02:38.180> how<00:02:38.269> it<00:02:38.390> works<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.840> mean<00:02:39.260> the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
curious to see how it works I mean the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.290 
curious to see how it works I mean the
bathroom<00:02:39.739> obviously<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.340> still<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:41.060> know<00:02:41.120> the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
bathroom obviously is still you know the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.000 
bathroom obviously is still you know the
same<00:02:41.510> but<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.989> sinks<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.530> everything<00:02:42.860> we're

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
same but the sinks and everything we're

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.949 
same but the sinks and everything we're
all<00:02:43.130> outside<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.820> this<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.360> true<00:02:44.600> for<00:02:44.630> both

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
all outside and this is true for both

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:57.980 
all outside and this is true for both
schools

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.510 

so<00:02:58.990> now<00:02:59.140> we're<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.470> Louis<00:02:59.800> Hornsby<00:03:00.250> middle

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
so now we're in Louis Hornsby middle

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.330 
so now we're in Louis Hornsby middle
school<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.090> second<00:03:01.450> school<00:03:01.660> were<00:03:01.780> going<00:03:02.050> into

square feet this one's almost not quite

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.390 
square feet this one's almost not quite
but<00:03:10.420> almost<00:03:10.510> twice<00:03:10.990> that<00:03:11.020> size<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.590> 145

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
both schools the elementary school you

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.900 
both schools the elementary school you
add<00:03:51.330> that<00:03:51.360> gymatorium<00:03:52.220> this<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.430> full-size

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
you asked me about unique features when

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.710 
you asked me about unique features when
you<00:04:23.190> look<00:04:23.370> at<00:04:23.490> this<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.910> way<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.510> designed

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
you look at this the way it's designed

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.080 
you look at this the way it's designed
to<00:04:25.170> size<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.830> ceiling<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.280> give<00:04:26.520> it<00:04:26.639> some<00:04:26.790> open

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
to size the ceiling to give it some open

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.690 
to size the ceiling to give it some open
space<00:04:27.740> very<00:04:28.740> different<00:04:29.100> for<00:04:29.280> most<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.610> our

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
space very different for most of our

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.820 
space very different for most of our
other<00:04:29.880> cafeteria<00:04:30.600> in<00:04:30.780> comparison<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.620> some<00:04:31.800> of

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
other cafeteria in comparison to some of

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.500 
other cafeteria in comparison to some of
the<00:04:32.010> cafeterias<00:04:32.820> I've<00:04:33.000> seen<00:04:33.360> its<00:04:33.600> cavernous

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
the cafeterias I've seen its cavernous

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.060 
the cafeterias I've seen its cavernous
that's<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.600> good<00:04:36.720> description<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:37.500> would<00:04:37.919> agree

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
that's a good description I would agree

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.800 
that's a good description I would agree
with<00:04:38.160> that<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.760> i<00:04:39.150> think<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.600> lights

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
with that and i think that the lights

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.210 
with that and i think that the lights
coming<00:04:39.930> in<00:04:40.290> at<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.500> end<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.860> natural

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
coming in at the end the natural

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.460 
coming in at the end the natural
lighting<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.660> looks<00:04:42.930> on<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.110> other<00:04:43.260> space

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
lighting it to looks on the other space

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.940 
lighting it to looks on the other space
you're<00:04:43.590> big<00:04:43.770> on<00:04:43.950> natural<00:04:44.520> light<00:04:45.710> this<00:04:46.710> isn't

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
you're big on natural light this isn't

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.409 
you're big on natural light this isn't
the<00:04:47.010> most<00:04:47.130> attractive<00:04:47.460> place<00:04:47.880> in<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.180> school

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
the most attractive place in the school

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.700 
the most attractive place in the school
