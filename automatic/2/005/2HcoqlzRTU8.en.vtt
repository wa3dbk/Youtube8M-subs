00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
put the screwdriver into this bit which

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.190 
put the screwdriver into this bit which
will<00:02:33.030> allow<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.329> to<00:02:33.480> put<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> capping

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
station through its movements now to

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.699 
station through its movements now to
start<00:02:38.489> you're<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.849> want<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.090> put<00:02:39.709> about

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
one full syringe worth of solution in

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.390 
one full syringe worth of solution in
each<00:02:45.209> side<00:02:45.920> you're<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.099> want<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.280> just

we<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.040> use<00:02:53.190> our<00:02:53.340> screwdriver<00:02:54.379> to<00:02:55.549> just<00:02:56.549> go

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
we can use our screwdriver to just go

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.460 
we can use our screwdriver to just go
back<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:57.060> forth<00:02:57.329> until<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.810> see<00:02:57.989> both<00:02:58.170> sides

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
back and forth until you see both sides

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.259 
back and forth until you see both sides
drain<00:02:59.040> freely<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:02.250> once<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.639> starts<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.000> drain

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
you just put more solution in and just

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.259 
you just put more solution in and just
keep<00:03:06.510> draining<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:07.849> you<00:03:08.849> can<00:03:09.000> see<00:03:09.180> it

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269

the capping station and also through the
waste<00:03:13.650> tube<00:03:15.049> underneath<00:03:18.889> so<00:03:19.889> now<00:03:20.010> we've<00:03:20.160> got

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
waste tube underneath so now we've got

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.129 
waste tube underneath so now we've got
both<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.459> them<00:03:20.760> free<00:03:20.940> freely<00:03:21.540> draining<00:03:21.780> we're
