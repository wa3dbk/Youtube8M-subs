for<00:00:26.800> me<00:00:26.950> the<00:00:27.189> thrill<00:00:27.460> is<00:00:27.760> not<00:00:28.029> so<00:00:28.240> much<00:00:28.500> diving

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
for me the thrill is not so much diving

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.150 
for me the thrill is not so much diving
as<00:00:29.590> hard<00:00:29.770> as<00:00:29.890> I<00:00:29.980> can<00:00:30.039> at<00:00:30.430> features<00:00:30.790> it's<00:00:31.150> more

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
as hard as I can at features it's more

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.290 
as hard as I can at features it's more

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
possible legal mountain flying in the

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.009 
possible legal mountain flying in the
States<00:00:46.960> it's<00:00:47.830> a<00:00:47.890> novelty<00:00:48.220> but<00:00:48.540> there's<00:00:49.540> we're

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
States it's a novelty but there's we're

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.210 
States it's a novelty but there's we're
just<00:00:50.170> helping<00:00:50.440> us<00:00:50.530> spread<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.949> love<00:00:51.070> around

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220

me<00:00:51.400> form<00:00:51.730> or<00:00:51.940> at<00:00:52.000> least<00:00:52.180> happen<00:00:52.540> I'd<00:00:53.350> see<00:00:53.680> it<00:00:53.769> as

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
me form or at least happen I'd see it as

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.459 
me form or at least happen I'd see it as
like<00:00:53.949> a<00:00:54.129> bit<00:00:54.730> of<00:00:54.789> revolution<00:00:55.329> you<00:00:55.420> know

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
like a bit of revolution you know

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.209 
like a bit of revolution you know
everything<00:00:56.469> we'd<00:00:56.590> heard<00:00:56.710> about<00:00:56.770> this<00:00:57.010> cliff

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
everything we'd heard about this cliff

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.310 
everything we'd heard about this cliff
was<00:00:57.489> you<00:00:58.120> can't<00:00:58.360> jump<00:00:58.570> it<00:00:58.750> there's<00:00:58.960> nothing<00:00:59.050> up

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
was you can't jump it there's nothing up

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.080 
was you can't jump it there's nothing up
there<00:00:59.350> you<00:00:59.800> can<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.190> flights<00:01:00.399> too<00:01:00.579> long<00:01:00.789> it's

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
there you can the flights too long it's

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.090 
there you can the flights too long it's
not<00:01:01.239> gonna<00:01:01.360> work<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.840> I<00:01:02.620> think<00:01:02.739> until<00:01:02.949> you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
not gonna work and I think until you

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.049 
not gonna work and I think until you
just<00:01:03.280> kind<00:01:03.430> of<00:01:03.460> go<00:01:03.579> up<00:01:03.610> there<00:01:03.789> and<00:01:03.879> do<00:01:03.969> it

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
just kind of go up there and do it

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.630 
just kind of go up there and do it
yourself<00:01:04.680> yeah<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:05.740> never<00:01:05.920> really<00:01:06.190> know<00:01:06.310> it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
yourself yeah you never really know it

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.609 
yourself yeah you never really know it
still<00:01:06.910> could<00:01:07.119> either<00:01:07.330> go<00:01:07.600> or<00:01:07.780> not<00:01:07.990> go<00:01:08.050> it's<00:01:08.470> not

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
still could either go or not go it's not

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.810 
still could either go or not go it's not
and<00:01:08.770> we're<00:01:08.860> still<00:01:09.009> not<00:01:09.130> totally<00:01:09.490> shut<00:01:09.670> down

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
and we're still not totally shut down

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.600 
and we're still not totally shut down
till<00:01:10.720> we<00:01:10.750> actually<00:01:10.840> get<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.410> top<00:01:11.649> and<00:01:11.890> kind

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
till we actually get to the top and kind

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.040 
till we actually get to the top and kind
of<00:01:12.700> determine<00:01:13.119> how<00:01:13.240> much<00:01:13.360> altitude<00:01:13.810> we<00:01:13.960> have

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
of determine how much altitude we have

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.560 
of determine how much altitude we have
to<00:01:14.170> work<00:01:14.320> with<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.649> get<00:01:14.800> going<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:16.240> Energy's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
to work with to get going the Energy's

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.630 
to work with to get going the Energy's
high<00:01:16.690> if<00:01:16.869> we<00:01:16.990> do<00:01:17.110> find<00:01:17.289> find<00:01:17.649> a<00:01:17.710> spot<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:17.920> to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
high if we do find find a spot to to

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.609 
high if we do find find a spot to to
jump<00:01:18.820> off<00:01:19.000> there<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:19.899> trains<00:01:20.140> definitely

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
jump off there the the trains definitely

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.529 
jump off there the the trains definitely
flyable<00:01:20.830> below<00:01:21.220> it<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.520> we're<00:01:22.119> looking<00:01:22.149> at

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
flyable below it and we're looking at

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.560 
flyable below it and we're looking at
you<00:01:22.840> know<00:01:22.990> potentially<00:01:23.649> a<00:01:23.679> perfectly<00:01:24.100> legal

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you know potentially a perfectly legal

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.300 
you know potentially a perfectly legal
close<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.720> five<00:01:25.869> thousand<00:01:26.289> foot<00:01:26.410> jump<00:01:26.950> which

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
close to five thousand foot jump which

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.270 
close to five thousand foot jump which
would<00:01:28.119> be<00:01:28.240> amazing<00:01:28.689> for<00:01:29.049> the<00:01:29.170> states<00:01:29.380> it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
would be amazing for the states it

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.770 
would be amazing for the states it
almost<00:01:30.490> looks<00:01:30.700> like<00:01:30.759> you<00:01:31.360> know<00:01:31.420> not<00:01:31.570> could<00:01:31.750> be

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
almost looks like you know not could be

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.840 
almost looks like you know not could be
over<00:01:32.049> home<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.500> that<00:01:32.680> -<00:01:32.950> yeah<00:01:33.340> totally

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
over home to that - yeah totally

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.850 
over home to that - yeah totally
-<00:01:34.689> not<00:01:34.869> just<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.470> left<00:01:35.939> could<00:01:36.939> be<00:01:37.500> an<00:01:38.500> even

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
- not just to the left could be an even

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.410 
- not just to the left could be an even
smaller<00:01:39.040> part<00:01:39.400> of<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.549> ledge<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:40.240> could<00:01:40.360> be

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
smaller part of the ledge it could be

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.580 
smaller part of the ledge it could be
some<00:01:40.570> massive<00:01:40.720> ledge<00:01:41.020> we<00:01:41.140> can't<00:01:41.290> even<00:01:41.439> see

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
some massive ledge we can't even see

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.140 
some massive ledge we can't even see
here<00:01:41.890> I<00:01:42.100> mean<00:01:42.400> yeah<00:01:42.549> it's<00:01:42.759> hard<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:42.909> say<00:01:43.030> until

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
here I mean yeah it's hard to say until

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:52.570 
here I mean yeah it's hard to say until
we<00:01:43.210> walk<00:01:43.390> over<00:01:43.540> there

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.230 

one<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.730> things<00:01:53.880> we're<00:01:54.030> trying<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
one of the things we're trying to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.630 
one of the things we're trying to
remember<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.960> case<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> exit<00:01:56.340> doesn't

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
remember here in case the exit doesn't

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.820 
remember here in case the exit doesn't
go<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:57.840> you're<00:01:57.960> coating<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.260> all<00:01:58.410> accounts

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
go that you're coating to all accounts

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.690 
go that you're coating to all accounts
it<00:01:58.920> doesn't<00:01:59.250> except<00:02:00.240> for<00:02:00.360> ours<00:02:00.710> is<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.100> where

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
it doesn't except for ours is that where

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.580 
it doesn't except for ours is that where
this<00:02:02.880> an<00:02:03.090> insane<00:02:03.480> spot<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.230> sort<00:02:04.440> of<00:02:04.470> like

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
this an insane spot is sort of like

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.470 
this an insane spot is sort of like
alpine<00:02:05.190> lake<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.820> we<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.060> went<00:02:06.240> for<00:02:06.360> this

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
alpine lake and we just went for this

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.020 
alpine lake and we just went for this
really<00:02:06.810> cool<00:02:07.110> hike

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
really cool hike

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
it's the unknown right it's always the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.400 
it's the unknown right it's always the
unknown<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.819> fact<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.150> there's<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.110> slab

unknown and the fact that there's a slab
and<00:03:07.740> it's<00:03:07.830> gonna<00:03:07.950> be<00:03:08.100> visual<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:08.730> mean<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:08.940> think

and it's gonna be visual I mean I think
that<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.480> exit<00:03:10.080> seems<00:03:11.040> reasonable

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
that the exit seems reasonable

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.160 
that the exit seems reasonable
I<00:03:11.790> think

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.080 

I<00:03:14.200> think<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:14.860> client<00:03:15.130> seems<00:03:15.340> reasonable<00:03:15.850> it's

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
I think the client seems reasonable it's

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.570 
I think the client seems reasonable it's
all<00:03:16.240> it's<00:03:16.990> all<00:03:17.080> gonna<00:03:17.290> be<00:03:17.470> Anya<00:03:17.980> but<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.370> think

all it's all gonna be Anya but I think

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.570 
all it's all gonna be Anya but I think
it's<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:20.170> gonna<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.770> think<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.100> doable<00:03:21.370> I

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
it's it's gonna it I think it's doable I

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
think it's reasonable but I think it's

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.620
