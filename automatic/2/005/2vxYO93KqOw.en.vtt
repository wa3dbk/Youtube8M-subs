00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.330
 very probably have you ever 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.090
 asked what happens if something fell 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.730
 inside a good black hole the 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.880
 answer is very simple if you are alive 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.890
 will die and anything else will 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.640
 will disintegrate instantly 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.800
 point 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.890
 in the event that a human 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.500
 leave the earth travel light years to 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.930
 through the universe and reach the reach 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.130
 gravitational of a black hole 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.670
 will inevitably die 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.160
 ok it 's simple a black hole is a 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.380
 sure death but have you ever done 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.440
 asked how that would really be 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.500
 death the answer may not be so 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.650
 easy but neglect in this video we're going 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.080
 to find out 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.420
 but wait before answering 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.190
 original question let's analyze a 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.670
 little about black holes in 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.760
 general that is exactly how it was formed 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.760
 a black hole like it looks are questions 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.560
 complicated but luckily science 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.720
 have some good ideas for 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 answer them 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.550
 The main peculiarity of the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.980
 black holes is that they exert so much 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.130
 force of gravity that not even the 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.520
 light can come out of it that he does 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.670
 made invisible a black hole no 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.180
 reflects light so we can not see it from 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.550
 normal way but thanks some 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.500
 sophisticated space telescopes 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.050
 We can know your location 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.020
 the enormous force of gravity of a 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.930
 black hole is formed because this 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.490
 is formed when a star dies 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.210
 matter of which the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.910
 star 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.310
 it is compressed into a mass very very 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.299
 tense that the pse such severity 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.509
 death by spaghetti this strange 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.330
 term was coined in the 90s by 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.569
 British astrophysicist Sir Martin Rees 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.060
 to explain what would happen if a person 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.380
 what's inside a black hole 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.480
 in the 90s rees described how it would be 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.000
 exactly death within a 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.580
 black hole fundamentally the idea 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.980
 of network is that a person to be 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.560
 absorbed by a black hole it 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.569
 I would move this space 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.599
 due to the force of gravity that 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.239
 would act by stretching it in one direction and 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.760
 compressing it in another direction the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.099
 Spaghetti term aims to give 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.709
 account of what would happen to an object 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.019
 how the human body would stretch and 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.990
 would twist in such a way that death 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.690
 it would be insured 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.510
 Astrophysics has come a long way since 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.150
 the 90s and currently the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.100
 scientists have another concept about 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.470
 what would this death be like in a 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.230
 black hole now the scientists 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.710
 they believe that more than spaghetti 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.470
 a person inside a black hole 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.830
 would die by crushing when entering a 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.990
 black hole according to experts would fall 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.630
 on our back all the matter 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.690
 who came before us for the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.750
 called movement of dispersion challenge is 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.930
 say thousands of tons of bacteria 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.170
 absorbed by the hole for thousands 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.360
 and millions of years would exert so much 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.450
 pressure on us that quickly 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.730
 we disintegrate and masters we would be 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.620
 crushed so quickly that no 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.690
 we would have time to move like 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.270
 spaghetti depending on the strength of 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.230
 gravity in any case both 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.120
 possibilities are just theories in 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.430
 the moment nobody has made a good 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.580
 Field investigation to confirm 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.120
 any 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.760
 and what do you think you already knew some of 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.620
 these theories consider that it is possible 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.300
 that the earth is swallowed by a hole 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.420
 black 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.160

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.160
 Comment box of this video 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.610

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.950
 of your liking please give the button

 I like this video and share it with your 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.470
 friends that would be great 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.080
 give me a like on facebook follow me

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.190
 you are aware of my new videos 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.580
 and so that I can continue creating 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.350
 videos like this I upload video all the 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.230
 Wednesday and Friday 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.000
 I'm ju linera the funny guy and that 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.000
 you spend happy the rest of the day
