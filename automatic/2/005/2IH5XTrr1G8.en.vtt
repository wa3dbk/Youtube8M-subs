00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.330
 to the guys how are they and glasses to me 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.309
 Channel 7 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.860
 today I want to share a coach that is 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.260
 very simple and I want to show you with 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.540
 a girl with medium hair or a 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.279
 shorter bit also including 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.860
 can make a concise braid on the side 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.470
 although the classical one is not invested in 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.870
 it's blown on only one side and they 've been 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.330
 loaded with nothing is simply a 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.340
 French braid on the side with all the 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.110
 hair is that I will be my 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.300
 mannequin that as I have told you with the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.330
 little way is here is the shoulder and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.260
 some captain war and it is very 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.989
 pretty 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.780
 obviously if you have long hair is 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.309
 the same procedure nothing more than in 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.080
 Once you have the transit here 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.199
 only to be silent is here in front 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.159
 in something very pretty and I hope that it 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.159
 stay to see this serial 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.060
 with this every day well brushed we are going to 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.689
 make a division of the side 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.979
 and we are going to separate the rest of the hair 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.759
 we are going to separate the part of 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.810
 in front ok about 4 fingers 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:22.229
 Wide 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.229
 and we are going to start making the braid 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.490
 i 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.790
 happens to take a lock of hair and what 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.040
 you are going to divide into three parts and then 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.290
 every time it happens I never leave for the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.580
 you have to feed it with another 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.580
 male cited hair 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.810
 to 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.009
 and it is very simple to your left in 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.810
 half his right in the middle and in the 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.630
 second round is when you already start 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.390
 feed that we're going to do this until 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.969
 that you arrive approximately until your 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.299
 ear if you know a cock you can 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.789
 support the comb or there with your fingers you 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.929
 you are analyzing it so that you have what 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.929
 prettiest possible 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.330
 to 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.490
 ah 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.430
 ah 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.920
 now you are going to release the rest of the hair 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.400
 and will continue to take portions of 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.799
 hair the closest to the million you go 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.870
 to feed and while it continues to be 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.849
 loose hair on the other side you're going to 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.849
 to continue feeding 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.799
 ah 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.960
 Y 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.519
 the less you miss to get to 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.350
 finish tense the strands of 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.330
 hair should be thicker and thicker 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.040
 and almost at the end, you have them 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.100
 to go grabbing almost from the other 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.100
 shore 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.639
 also if you have very long hair 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.560
 in getting to the ear what you can do 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.509
 it's part of all your hair in three 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.699
 portions and finish in a braid 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.240
 simple three strands that will be much 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.240
 easier 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.640
 ah 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.860
 ah 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:27.400
 that is the final result so you will have 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.400
 if you have medium hair almost cut 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.630
 you can let it go or you can finish 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.630
 making you a little chin doing like a 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.630
 pretty and hold with baby pins and you 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.310
 you can put a little flower if you have the 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.790
 hair in layers and you subtract some 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.010
 layer your continuation of your braid and 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.280
 final these hair injuries that are 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.880
 jetas with loose paper and remains 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.880
 very well 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.389
 plus 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.389
 ah 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.680
 plus 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.680
 ah 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.919
 ah 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.680
 ah 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.580
 since it's an easy very simple not 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.500
 has more complication only than 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.210
 not sexist but I never leave because 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.610
 we know we do not have to start over 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.220
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.020
 they leave like and also their comments and 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.460
 I liked them I'll leave on Facebook 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.470
 this information if you have not added me 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.070
 little kisses 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.070
 we can try
