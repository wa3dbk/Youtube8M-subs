00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.710 

right<00:00:00.299> so<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.680> quarter-turn

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:02.720 
right so this is a quarter-turn

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.390 
right so this is a quarter-turn
cartridge<00:00:03.720> or<00:00:03.870> valve<00:00:04.140> come<00:00:05.040> out<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.310> a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
cartridge or valve come out of a

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.909 
cartridge or valve come out of a
standard<00:00:05.879> basin<00:00:06.420> tap<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:07.500> I<00:00:07.680> think<00:00:07.830> it's

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
standard basin tap and I think it's

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.520 
standard basin tap and I think it's
supposed<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.280> be<00:00:08.490> for<00:00:09.120> superior<00:00:09.599> than<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.870> old

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
supposed to be for superior than the old

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.640 
supposed to be for superior than the old
washer<00:00:11.040> tar<00:00:11.280> valves<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.080> that<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> UK

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
washer tar valves and that in the UK

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.650 
washer tar valves and that in the UK
they<00:00:13.889> suffer<00:00:14.250> from<00:00:14.450> limescale

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
they suffer from limescale

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.870 
they suffer from limescale
and<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.680> gets<00:00:16.980> between<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.369> two<00:00:17.609> ceramic

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and that gets between the two ceramic

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.450 
and that gets between the two ceramic
discs<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.109> pushes<00:00:19.470> them<00:00:19.590> apart<00:00:19.710> or<00:00:20.189> even

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
discs and pushes them apart or even

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700 
discs and pushes them apart or even
scores<00:00:20.910> surface<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.539> them<00:00:21.689> which<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.529> result

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
scores surface of them which can result

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.150 
scores surface of them which can result
in<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.279> tap<00:00:23.609> dripping<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.680> now<00:00:25.680> if<00:00:25.980> you're<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
in the tap dripping and now if you're a

handyman the best way to resolve a
dripping<00:00:32.399> tap<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.910> has<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> cork<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.600> involve

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
dripping tap that has a cork to involve

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.590 
dripping tap that has a cork to involve
is<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.620> replace<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.010> completely<00:00:35.730> now<00:00:36.270> that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
is to replace it completely now that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.869 
is to replace it completely now that
sounds<00:00:37.559> easier<00:00:37.860> than<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.250> because<00:00:38.700> these

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
sounds easier than it is because these

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.819 
sounds easier than it is because these
are<00:00:39.059> not<00:00:39.300> all<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> same<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.620> need<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
are not all the same and you need to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.279 
are not all the same and you need to
match<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.370> valves<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:45.050> difficulty<00:00:46.050> is

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
match the valves and the difficulty is

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.779 
match the valves and the difficulty is
that<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.860> there's<00:00:47.039> no<00:00:47.129> manufacturer's<00:00:47.760> name

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that if there's no manufacturer's name

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
that if there's no manufacturer's name
on<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.390> tap<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.840> matching<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> valve<00:00:49.829> can

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
on the tap then matching the valve can

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.529 
on the tap then matching the valve can
prove<00:00:50.399> difficult<00:00:52.309> this<00:00:53.420> technique<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.510> going

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
prove difficult this technique I'm going

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.689 
prove difficult this technique I'm going
to<00:00:54.660> show<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.870> now<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.800> sort<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> buy

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
to show you now is just a sort of buy

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.860 
to show you now is just a sort of buy
you<00:00:56.760> some<00:00:57.239> time

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you some time

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.860 
you some time
and<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> may<00:00:58.920> last<00:00:59.190> six<00:00:59.820> hours<00:01:00.000> may<00:01:00.449> not<00:01:00.600> six

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and it may last six hours may not six

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.959 
and it may last six hours may not six
days<00:01:01.050> may<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.320> six<00:01:01.710> months<00:01:02.039> may<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.460> six<00:01:02.730> years

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
days may not six months may or six years

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.740 
days may not six months may or six years
and<00:01:03.439> but<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.150> emitted<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> buy<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> some

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and but it's a emitted to buy you some

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.980 
and but it's a emitted to buy you some
time

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
time

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.960 
time
to<00:01:07.409> stop<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> drip<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> tap<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.729> give<00:01:08.909> you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
to stop the drip of the tap to give you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.700 
to stop the drip of the tap to give you
some<00:01:09.150> time<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.330> source<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.990> replacement

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
some time to source the replacement

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.399 
some time to source the replacement
valve<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> may<00:01:12.240> last<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.110> lifetime

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
valve and but it may last for a lifetime

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.210 
valve and but it may last for a lifetime
as<00:01:13.890> well<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> theory<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
as well and so the theory is is the the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.760 
as well and so the theory is is the the
limescale<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.659> gets<00:01:18.960> between<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> discs

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
limescale that gets between the discs

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.130 
limescale that gets between the discs
pushes<00:01:20.189> them<00:01:20.340> apart<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.990> resulting<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
pushes them apart and resulting in a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.170 
pushes them apart and resulting in a
drip<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.530> scores<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> surface<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.090> we

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
drip all scores the surface so what we

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.730 
drip all scores the surface so what we
want<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.600> clean<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:24.960> lab-scale

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
want to do is clean that lab-scale

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.480 
want to do is clean that lab-scale
out<00:01:25.920> at<00:01:26.600> re-grease<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.869> valve<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:29.220> then

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
out at re-grease the valve and then

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.030 
out at re-grease the valve and then
we're<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:32.119> assist<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.479> rubber

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
we're going to assist this rubber

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.859 
we're going to assist this rubber
stopper<00:01:35.040> that's<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> india<00:01:36.090> which<00:01:36.329> forms

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
stopper that's on the india which forms

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
stopper that's on the india which forms
two<00:01:37.049> purposes<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.950> both<00:01:38.670> forms<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.150> seal<00:01:39.450> and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
two purposes it both forms a seal and

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.679 
two purposes it both forms a seal and
see<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> tap<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> stop<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.700> water<00:01:42.150> passing

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
see to the tap to stop it water passing

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.200 
see to the tap to stop it water passing
around<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.320> valve<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.280> also<00:01:44.430> holds<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
around the valve but it also holds the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.050 
around the valve but it also holds the
two<00:01:45.509> ceramic<00:01:45.899> discs<00:01:46.259> together<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.250> push<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
two ceramic discs together and push the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.260 
two ceramic discs together and push the
pressure<00:01:48.420> against<00:01:49.049> them<00:01:49.700> allowing<00:01:50.700> them<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
pressure against them allowing them you

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.300 
pressure against them allowing them you
know<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:52.049> surfaces<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.560> adhere<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.280> each

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
know to the surfaces to adhere to each

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
know to the surfaces to adhere to each
other<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.689> what<00:01:54.869> we're<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
other and so what we're going to do is

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.959 
other and so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.860> clean<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> lime<00:01:56.430> scale<00:01:56.700> off

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
we're going to clean the lime scale off

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.010 
we're going to clean the lime scale off
this<00:01:57.420> valve<00:01:57.990> by<00:01:58.770> soaking<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.180> household

on to the end of the valve and what that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.230 
on to the end of the valve and what that
does<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:25.680> when<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.430> tighten<00:02:27.120> this

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
does is it just when you tighten this

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.200 
does is it just when you tighten this
valve<00:02:27.510> back<00:02:27.990> into<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.800> tap<00:02:29.220> with<00:02:30.000> this

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
additional washer step on the end it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.970 
additional washer step on the end it
performs<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:33.000> better<00:02:33.330> seal<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.960> adds<00:02:34.170> more

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
performs a better seal but it adds more

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.430 
performs a better seal but it adds more
pressure<00:02:35.040> onto<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.030> disc<00:02:36.300> forcing<00:02:37.200> this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
pressure onto the disc forcing this

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.990 
pressure onto the disc forcing this
around<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.740> close<00:02:38.160> together<00:02:38.640> tighter

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
around just close together tighter

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.650 
around just close together tighter
together<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.950> therefore<00:02:40.950> hopefully

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
together and therefore hopefully

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.410 
together and therefore hopefully
resolving<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.840> drip<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.310> I'm<00:02:45.030> going<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.300> go

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
resolving the drip so I'm going to go

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:55.540 
resolving the drip so I'm going to go
through<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> process<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.290> what<00:02:46.740> you<00:02:46.800> would<00:02:47.100> do

in<00:03:16.740> closing<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.220> could<00:03:17.370> see<00:03:17.550> it's<00:03:17.700> completely

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
in closing I could see it's completely

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.210 
in closing I could see it's completely
scale<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.650> first<00:03:19.890> thing<00:03:20.070> I'm<00:03:20.160> going

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
scale that so the first thing I'm going

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.420 
scale that so the first thing I'm going
to<00:03:20.340> do<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.730> I'm<00:03:21.450> going<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.840> soak<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:22.890> the

to do is I'm going to soak it in the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
and now what you normally do is leave it

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.470 
and now what you normally do is leave it

down<00:03:44.420> but<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.660> sake<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.140> video<00:03:46.350> I'm

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
down but the sake of this video I'm

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.940 
down but the sake of this video I'm
going<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.280> take<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.880> up<00:03:47.940> now<00:03:48.350> so<00:03:49.350> that's<00:03:49.770> now

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
going to take it up now so that's now

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.699 
going to take it up now so that's now
being<00:03:50.160> descale<00:03:50.640> I'm<00:03:51.150> gonna<00:03:51.480> rinse<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.870> off<00:03:51.989> in

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
being descale I'm gonna rinse it off in

00:03:52.709 --> 00:04:07.630 
being descale I'm gonna rinse it off in
my<00:03:53.160> hot<00:03:53.580> water<00:03:53.790> thoroughly<00:04:01.670> do<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> few<00:04:02.970> turns

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.670 

really<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:08.910> feels<00:04:09.209> easier<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.170> terminate

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
really that feels easier to terminate

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.830 
really that feels easier to terminate
did<00:04:13.880> I'm<00:04:14.880> going<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.120> give<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.360> good<00:04:15.510> dry<00:04:15.780> off

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
did I'm going to give it a good dry off

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.390 
did I'm going to give it a good dry off

but<00:04:21.400> now<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:21.910> next<00:04:22.420> thing<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.750> do<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:22.900> to

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
but now the next thing to do is to

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.460 
but now the next thing to do is to
redress<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:24.400> disk<00:04:25.330> because<00:04:25.720> what<00:04:26.110> happened

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
redress the disk because what happened

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.350 
redress the disk because what happened
when<00:04:26.680> our<00:04:26.710> D<00:04:26.950> scale<00:04:27.250> that<00:04:27.460> is<00:04:27.640> probably<00:04:28.270> you

when our D scale that is probably you
cleaned<00:04:28.660> off<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:29.080> lot<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.530> silicon

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
cleaned off a lot of the the silicon

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.070 
cleaned off a lot of the the silicon
grease<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:30.880> was<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.480> know<00:04:31.600> between<00:04:31.780> the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
grease that was you know between the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.630 
grease that was you know between the
discs<00:04:32.320> that<00:04:32.830> allows<00:04:33.040> them<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.280> slide<00:04:33.580> past

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640

discs that allows them to slide past
each<00:04:34.120> other<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:34.900> I'm<00:04:34.990> going<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.170> use<00:04:35.260> some<00:04:36.180> hard

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
each other so I'm going to use some hard

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.200 
each other so I'm going to use some hard
tension<00:04:37.740> silicon<00:04:38.740> grease<00:04:38.980> which<00:04:39.970> can<00:04:40.150> be

going to force some silicon grease back

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:15.600 
going to force some silicon grease back
into<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.410> valve<00:04:59.620> between<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.130> discs

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.409 

completely<00:05:16.389> saturating<00:05:17.199> the<00:05:17.379> internals<00:05:18.419> with

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
completely saturating the internals with

completely saturating the internals with
silicon<00:05:19.930> grease

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.110 

and<00:05:27.020> then<00:05:27.370> we're<00:05:28.370> going<00:05:28.460> to<00:05:28.520> open<00:05:28.639> and<00:05:28.939> close

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
and then we're going to open and close

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.119 
and then we're going to open and close
the<00:05:29.150> valve<00:05:29.509> a<00:05:29.749> few<00:05:30.229> times<00:05:30.469> to<00:05:30.740> make<00:05:30.889> sure<00:05:31.039> the

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
the valve a few times to make sure the

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.969 
the valve a few times to make sure the
silicon<00:05:31.490> grease<00:05:32.050> gets<00:05:33.050> forced<00:05:33.349> between<00:05:33.559> the

silicon grease gets forced between the
two<00:05:34.159> disks<00:05:36.759> and<00:05:37.759> pushing<00:05:38.270> some<00:05:38.419> more<00:05:38.569> in<00:05:39.909> so

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
two disks and pushing some more in so

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:41.950 
two disks and pushing some more in so
like<00:05:41.059> I<00:05:41.210> said<00:05:41.270> you<00:05:41.419> want<00:05:41.599> to<00:05:41.629> completely

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
like I said you want to completely

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.040 
like I said you want to completely
saturate<00:05:42.319> the<00:05:43.069> internals<00:05:43.550> to<00:05:44.539> make<00:05:44.689> sure<00:05:44.900> that

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
saturate the internals to make sure that

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.350 
saturate the internals to make sure that
the<00:05:45.529> grease<00:05:45.740> does<00:05:46.370> get<00:05:46.610> forced<00:05:46.969> between<00:05:47.270> the

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
the grease does get forced between the

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.159 
the grease does get forced between the
two<00:05:47.539> disks<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:50.240> that<00:05:50.479> feels<00:05:50.719> good

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
two disks and that feels good

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.209 
two disks and that feels good
easy<00:05:51.740> to<00:05:51.949> turn<00:05:52.159> okay<00:05:53.059> now<00:05:53.990> clean<00:05:54.979> off<00:05:55.099> any

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:55.219 
easy to turn okay now clean off any

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.850 
easy to turn okay now clean off any
grease<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:55.520> I've<00:05:55.759> dropped<00:05:55.939> on<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.710> top<00:05:57.710> of

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
grease that I've dropped on the top of

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:08.780 
grease that I've dropped on the top of
the<00:05:57.919> valve<00:05:58.129> in<00:05:58.819> this<00:05:59.210> rubber<00:05:59.749> washer

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.900 

the<00:06:09.570> next<00:06:09.810> day<00:06:09.930> is<00:06:10.290> to<00:06:10.500> apply<00:06:10.800> this<00:06:10.920> HOF<00:06:11.580> inch

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
the next day is to apply this HOF inch

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.240 
the next day is to apply this HOF inch
rubber<00:06:12.570> washer<00:06:12.840> to<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:13.560> end<00:06:13.800> of<00:06:13.950> the<00:06:14.040> valve

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
rubber washer to the end of the valve

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.660 
rubber washer to the end of the valve
I'm<00:06:14.880> going<00:06:15.060> to<00:06:15.120> use<00:06:15.240> some<00:06:15.510> superglue<00:06:16.670> the

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
I'm going to use some superglue the

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.820 
I'm going to use some superglue the
easiest<00:06:17.970> superglue<00:06:18.330> to<00:06:18.360> use<00:06:18.690> to<00:06:18.900> control<00:06:19.200> is

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
easiest superglue to use to control is

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.180 
easiest superglue to use to control is
one<00:06:20.040> that<00:06:20.160> comes<00:06:20.370> a<00:06:20.430> little<00:06:20.670> brush<00:06:20.910> on<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:21.270> end

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
one that comes a little brush on the end

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.350 
one that comes a little brush on the end
so<00:06:23.190> I'm<00:06:23.250> just<00:06:23.340> gonna<00:06:23.460> brush<00:06:23.730> some<00:06:23.790> superglue

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
so I'm just gonna brush some superglue

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.150 
so I'm just gonna brush some superglue
on<00:06:24.660> to<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:24.900> end<00:06:25.050> of<00:06:25.140> this<00:06:25.580> rubber<00:06:26.580> stopper

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
on to the end of this rubber stopper

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.410 
on to the end of this rubber stopper
then<00:06:29.160> if<00:06:29.310> it'd<00:06:29.400> be<00:06:29.490> a<00:06:29.520> lot<00:06:29.730> it's<00:06:29.940> just<00:06:30.000> enough

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
then if it'd be a lot it's just enough

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.710 
then if it'd be a lot it's just enough
to<00:06:30.570> hold<00:06:30.870> the<00:06:31.860> new<00:06:32.070> washer<00:06:32.430> in<00:06:32.610> place<00:06:32.690> as<00:06:33.690> you

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
to hold the new washer in place as you

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.190 
to hold the new washer in place as you
turn<00:06:34.080> it<00:06:34.230> as<00:06:34.490> you<00:06:35.490> push<00:06:35.970> it<00:06:36.120> back<00:06:36.330> into<00:06:36.540> the<00:06:36.750> tap

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.880 

carefully<00:06:41.240> stick<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:42.360> rubber<00:06:42.540> washer<00:06:42.890> onto

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
carefully stick the rubber washer onto

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:51.309 
carefully stick the rubber washer onto
the<00:06:44.190> end<00:06:44.370> line<00:06:44.790> it<00:06:44.940> up

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:54.980 

there<00:06:52.319> we<00:06:52.409> go<00:06:52.589> so<00:06:53.339> that's<00:06:54.210> all<00:06:54.419> you<00:06:54.629> need<00:06:54.779> to<00:06:54.870> do

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
there we go so that's all you need to do

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.129 
there we go so that's all you need to do
that's<00:06:55.289> the<00:06:55.499> repair<00:06:55.939> once<00:06:56.939> that's<00:06:57.210> dry<00:06:57.659> enough

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
that's the repair once that's dry enough

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.219 
that's the repair once that's dry enough
I<00:06:58.439> am<00:06:59.099> going<00:06:59.370> to<00:06:59.580> put<00:07:00.059> that<00:07:00.150> back<00:07:00.210> in<00:07:00.629> the<00:07:00.749> tap

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
I am going to put that back in the tap

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:04.100 
I am going to put that back in the tap
tighten<00:07:02.009> it<00:07:02.069> up<00:07:02.189> really<00:07:02.580> nice<00:07:02.819> and<00:07:03.089> tight<00:07:03.300> and

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
tighten it up really nice and tight and

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.390 
tighten it up really nice and tight and
you'll<00:07:04.289> feel<00:07:04.469> the<00:07:04.620> tap<00:07:04.830> might<00:07:05.009> be<00:07:05.189> a<00:07:05.219> little

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
you'll feel the tap might be a little

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.040 
you'll feel the tap might be a little
bit<00:07:05.520> stiffer<00:07:05.729> the<00:07:06.240> reason<00:07:06.539> the<00:07:06.659> tap<00:07:06.839> feels

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
bit stiffer the reason the tap feels

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.659 
bit stiffer the reason the tap feels
stiffer<00:07:07.289> is<00:07:07.800> because<00:07:08.069> you've<00:07:08.189> added<00:07:08.400> this

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:08.669 
stiffer is because you've added this

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:10.999 
stiffer is because you've added this
extra<00:07:08.870> thickness<00:07:09.870> of<00:07:10.229> rubber<00:07:10.469> and<00:07:10.680> the<00:07:10.800> end

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:11.009 
extra thickness of rubber and the end
