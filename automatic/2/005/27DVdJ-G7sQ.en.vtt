made with sc3 carbon so the SC 3 carbon

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.900 
made with sc3 carbon so the SC 3 carbon

the tied master and the Premier's which
is<00:01:40.290> sc2<00:01:40.800> so<00:01:41.010> SC<00:01:41.310> 3<00:01:41.550> is<00:01:41.640> higher<00:01:41.880> modulus<00:01:42.409> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
is sc2 so SC 3 is higher modulus and
