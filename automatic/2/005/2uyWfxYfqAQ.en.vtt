00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.830
Hey guys, it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.250
Today I am gonna be making something that
I got so many requests for after I made

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.760
my cheeseburger cake, and I’ve been watching
a lot of Bob’s Burgers lately, so

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.620
today I am gonna be making cheeseburger cupcakes!

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
The things you will need, will be: 1 Yellow
cake, or you can use your favorite

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.860
cake recipe, doesn’t have to be box cake,
lemon cake works really well, as long

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.070
as it looks like a cheeseburger bun color,
so something yellow.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.030
1/2 a cup of vegetable oil, 1 cup of water,
green food coloring dye, some

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.030
toothpicks, 3 eggs, and coconut flakes. You’ll
also need a cupcake baking pan, and

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:58.690
I’ve lined it with these little paper liners,
1 big mixing bowl, and I’ve pre-made

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.710
some brownies, just use whatever is your favorite
brownie recipe.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.540
Mmmmm!

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.360
Alright, let’s put it all together!

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.280
Hmmm-hmmm-hmmm!

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.540
1/2 a cup of this…

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.280
Then we’re gonna crack 3 eggs!

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.960
Bew!

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.400
Now you’re gonna mix for 3 minutes on a
medium speed.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.659
Once your batter is all mixed, we’re gonna
fill these little cupcake trays.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.939
And I like to put 3 scoops, to 2 scoops, depending
on how full they are, you just

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.420
want it 2/3 full, and now is a good
time to preheat your oven to 350.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.440
Rewp! 1, 2, yeah we’re gonna do 3 scoops.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.549
It’s OK to get messy, we’ve got cupcake
liners.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.450
You’re just gonna fill all these trays.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.820
Oh wow, this is really messy!

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.579
There’s probably a better way to do this,
some people put it in a little zip-lock

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.579
baggie and then… But… It doesn’t, it’s
OK, it’s OK to get messy.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.090
Boom! Nailed it! Cupcakes look perfect, we’re
gonna throw these in the oven

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.729
for about 20 minutes on the heat of 350.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.220
Now, while the cupcakes are baking we are
going to be making the lettuce out of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.850
coconut flakes. Da-dew!

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.790
They’re just regular coconut flakes, we’re
gonna pour them into a small bowl

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.510
like this, and then we’re just gonna take
a little bit of green food coloring dye

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.870
and put a few drops in. Boop, boop!

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.110
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.610
You can put as many as you want, however dark
green you want to make it.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.970
But I’m just gonna take a little fork, mix
it all together.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.159
Ta-da! Once you’ve dyed all your coconut
shavings green, we’re just gonna set

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.909
this aside, and what you’re gonna want to
do is get 2 plastic bags and fill them

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.319
with frosting, I put red frosting in this
bag, and yellow frosting in this bag.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.120
And you can use a basic zip-lock, anything.
And this is going to be our

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.879
cheese and ketchup!

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.290
Once your cupcakes are done baking, take them
out of the oven and make sure they’ve

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.439
had plenty of time to cool before you do this.
Otherwise they will fall apart.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.610
So what you’re gonna do is take a knife,
I’ve got a sharp knife, and you’re

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.370
gonna cut your cupcake in 1/2. So I’m gonna
turn it on its side so you can see.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.680
And I’m gonna cut right below, I call it
the muffin top, the yummiest part of the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.090
cupcake! Err-err-err-err! And you’re just
gonna cut all the way through.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.739
So this will be the top of our hamburger bun,
and this will be the bottom.

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.599
I’m just gonna take the bottom 1/2 of the
cupcake, put it over here, and just

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.010
kind of eyeball how big the meat patty is
gonna be. I’m just taking a little

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.610
butter knife, and I’m just gonna cut around
so I know about how big I want

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.640
my meat patty to be.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.960
That’s my kind of cheeseburger!

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.430
Oh my god I love brownies!

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.700
Now I shallassemble my cheeseburger. This
is technically my cheese, it may also

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.200
look like mustard, but this is a cheeseburger.
So, I’m gonna pretend this is cheese.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.500
You’re just gonna put a little bit. Errrrroooop!

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.340
Go all the way around, zig-zag, perfect!

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.859
Now you’re gonna take your meat patty, mmmm!
Your brownie meat patty, and I’m just

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.719
squishing it, like so, so it looks really
meaty. Oh yeah!

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.579
Now you’re gonna take your ketchup, you’re
gonna put a little layer here, all

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.049
the way around, oh, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.949
And now you’re gonna take your coconut flakes,
our lettuce and sprinkle a

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.240
little bit. Oh coconut and chocolate, they
go so good together!

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.550
Now you’re gonna put on the top of your
hamburger.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.430
Oh yum, look at that, meaty hamburger.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.170
Alright, for the final touches, what we’re gonna
do is take these little toothpicks,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.030
and put them all the way down, right in the
center to hold our little cupcake

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.960
together. Oh these are so cute! They’re
like bite-sized!

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.320
After I put these together, I thought, these
aren’t quite done!

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.400
I was thinking, what are they missing? Oh yeah the little sesame seeds, so I went through

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.480
all of my cupcake stuff and I found sprinkles!
So I went ahead and separated

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.070
some of the white sprinkles, doo-doo! Like
this, now we’re just gonna sprinkle

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.780
those on top of the little cheeseburgers.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.180
I can haz cheeseburgers!

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.080
Ta-da! Here are our cheeseburger cupcakes,
they’re so cute and I love that they’re

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.010
bite size! With the brownie in the middle!

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.480
Thanks you guys for suggesting it, if you
have any other ideas for any other

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.040
