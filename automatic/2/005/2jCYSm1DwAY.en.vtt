what<00:02:44.819> bulbs<00:02:45.239> use<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:47.160> top<00:02:48.200> see<00:02:49.670> top<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
what bulbs use the top see top and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.930 
what bulbs use the top see top and
bottom<00:02:51.389> our<00:02:51.690> double<00:02:52.230> filament<00:02:52.500> bulbs<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
bottom our double filament bulbs and the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.479 
bottom our double filament bulbs and the
two<00:02:54.150> middle<00:02:54.299> ones<00:02:54.420> are<00:02:54.720> single<00:02:55.019> filament<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.459> I

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
two middle ones are single filament so I

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.830 
two middle ones are single filament so I
would<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:56.940> transfer<00:02:57.660> them<00:02:58.700> right<00:02:59.810> to<00:03:00.810> each

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
would just transfer them right to each

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.860 
would just transfer them right to each
one<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.700> obviously<00:03:05.910> you'll<00:03:06.359> want<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.599> put<00:03:06.780> in

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
one and obviously you'll want to put in

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.470 
one and obviously you'll want to put in
new<00:03:07.019> bulbs<00:03:07.380> if<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.709> have<00:03:07.889> a<00:03:08.480> corrosion

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
new bulbs if you have a corrosion

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.020 
new bulbs if you have a corrosion
problem<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.980> dual<00:03:14.160> filament<00:03:14.639> bulbs<00:03:14.910> look

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
problem the dual filament bulbs look

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.830 
problem the dual filament bulbs look
like<00:03:15.239> they're<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:17.569> three<00:03:18.569> oh<00:03:18.630> five<00:03:18.810> seven<00:03:19.319> caves

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
like they're a three oh five seven caves

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.120 
like they're a three oh five seven caves
and<00:03:21.840> then<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.049> single<00:03:22.349> film<00:03:22.650> instead<00:03:23.069> of

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
and then a single film instead of

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.809 
and then a single film instead of
probably<00:03:23.340> 305<00:03:23.819> cores<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:26.040> single<00:03:26.400> filaments

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
probably 305 cores the single filaments

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:34.150 
probably 305 cores the single filaments
are<00:03:26.910> three<00:03:27.150> one<00:03:27.359> five<00:03:27.599> six<00:03:27.989> caves

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.120 

okay<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.220> put<00:03:35.489> your<00:03:35.610> bulbs<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.800> you<00:03:37.800> can<00:03:37.980> either

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
okay so put your bulbs in you can either

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.880 
okay so put your bulbs in you can either
pack<00:03:38.550> that<00:03:38.730> now<00:03:39.560> or<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.770> do<00:03:40.860> it

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
pack that now or you can do it

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.760 
pack that now or you can do it
afterwards<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.900> shape<00:03:43.110> of<00:03:43.140> your<00:03:43.290> tail

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
afterwards and the shape of your tail

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.150 
afterwards and the shape of your tail
light<00:03:45.260> makes<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.380> obvious<00:03:46.709> which<00:03:46.890> way<00:03:47.040> this

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
light makes it obvious which way this

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.640 
light makes it obvious which way this
goes<00:03:47.540> again<00:03:48.540> if<00:03:48.720> your<00:03:48.840> taillight<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.230> cracked

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
goes again if your taillight is cracked

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.320 
goes again if your taillight is cracked
or<00:03:49.860> broken<00:03:50.060> you'll<00:03:51.060> want<00:03:51.330> to<00:03:51.500> replace<00:03:52.500> that

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
or broken you'll want to replace that

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.259 
or broken you'll want to replace that
then<00:03:54.330> this<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:54.920> presses<00:03:55.920> right<00:03:56.069> in<00:03:59.269> and

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
then this just presses right in and

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.670 
then this just presses right in and
you'll<00:04:00.420> need<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.630> press<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.050> firmly<00:04:01.380> as<00:04:01.560> you

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
you'll need to press it firmly as you

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:24.760 
you'll need to press it firmly as you
want<00:04:01.890> make<00:04:02.010> sure<00:04:02.239> seals<00:04:03.890> put<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:04.950> right<00:04:05.040> down

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.400 

it<00:04:25.770> makes<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.160> custom<00:04:26.580> trying<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:28.020> sound<00:04:28.260> that

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
it makes a custom trying that sound that

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.440 
it makes a custom trying that sound that
locking<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:28.890> bottom<00:04:29.220> corner<00:04:29.250> one<00:04:29.640> first<00:04:29.940> it

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
locking this bottom corner one first it

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.110 
locking this bottom corner one first it
was<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.630> best<00:04:30.810> way<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:30.960> go<00:04:31.670> but<00:04:32.670> the<00:04:32.820> hardware

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
was the best way to go but the hardware

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.120 
was the best way to go but the hardware
is<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.330> lock<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:34.410> better<00:04:34.590> because<00:04:34.980> you<00:04:35.100> know

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
is the lock the better because you know

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.450 
is the lock the better because you know
it's<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:35.610> there<00:04:36.410> nice<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.470> firm<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:37.920> sealing

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
it's in there nice and firm and sealing

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:49.930 
it's in there nice and firm and sealing
well<00:04:39.440> okay<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:41.340> now<00:04:42.740> we<00:04:43.740> connect<00:04:44.070> our<00:04:44.990> harness

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:05:05.200 

and<00:04:51.770> we<00:04:52.770> put<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.160> harness

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.340
