without having to wait the 10 seconds so

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.859 
without having to wait the 10 seconds so
it's<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> very<00:02:02.159> fast<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.969> effective<00:02:03.420> method

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.569 
it's a very fast and effective method
and<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.590> keep<00:02:04.799> repeating<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.399> over

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and you just keep repeating this over

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
front which is my grasp of the dead

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.860 
front which is my grasp of the dead
pushing<00:02:18.129> them<00:02:18.250> all<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> top<00:02:19.209> left<00:02:19.540> corner

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
pushing them all to the top left corner

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.050 
pushing them all to the top left corner
and<00:02:20.260> then<00:02:20.769> once<00:02:21.010> they're<00:02:21.189> in<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.370> big<00:02:21.549> clump<00:02:21.879> I

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
and then once they're in a big clump I

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.670 
and then once they're in a big clump I
moved<00:02:22.299> to<00:02:22.359> the<00:02:22.510> other<00:02:22.540> side<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.379> this<00:02:23.469> gets

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
moved to the other side and this gets

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.520 
moved to the other side and this gets
them<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.129> nice<00:02:24.340> big<00:02:24.609> ball<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:26.049> that<00:02:26.140> once<00:02:26.349> the

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
them at once now obviously depending on

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.110 
them at once now obviously depending on
