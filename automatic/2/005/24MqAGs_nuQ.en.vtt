00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
grind group right there so if you really

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.450

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.330 
it's kind of entry-level kaiser frame i
would<00:00:58.140> probably<00:00:58.440> recommend<00:00:58.739> switching<00:00:59.070> this

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
would probably recommend switching this

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.709 
would probably recommend switching this
frame<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.730> i<00:00:59.940> mean<00:01:00.120> i<00:01:00.149> don't<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:00.449> ride

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
