00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.340 

so<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> think<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.570> one<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> huge

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
so I think the one of the huge

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.250 
so I think the one of the huge
advantages<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.100> past<00:00:17.310> few<00:00:17.490> decades

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
advantages in the past few decades

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.599 
advantages in the past few decades
biologists<00:00:19.260> have<00:00:19.320> collected<00:00:19.800> vast<00:00:20.100> amounts

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
biologists have collected vast amounts

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.630 
biologists have collected vast amounts
of data<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.619> mathematics<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.949> be<00:00:23.250> used<00:00:23.430> as<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
of data and mathematics can be used as a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.730 
of data and mathematics can be used as a
tool<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.000> extract<00:00:24.300> meaningful<00:00:25.050> patterns<00:00:25.590> from

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
tool to extract meaningful patterns from

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.189 
tool to extract meaningful patterns from
that<00:00:25.890> data<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.369> make<00:00:26.460> sense<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.939> data

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
that data to make sense of that data

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.359 
that data to make sense of that data
moreover<00:00:28.199> actually<00:00:28.619> mathematics<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.310> be

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
moreover actually mathematics can be

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.000 
moreover actually mathematics can be
used<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:30.439> sort<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.529> develop<00:00:32.719> logically

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
used to sort of develop logically

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.010 
used to sort of develop logically
hypotheses<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.210> biological<00:00:36.210> systems<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
hypotheses about biological systems and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.260 
hypotheses about biological systems and
they<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.290> tested<00:00:37.620> empirically<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.730> also

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
they can be tested empirically and also

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.760 
they can be tested empirically and also
you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:39.750> run<00:00:39.989> experiments<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
you can actually run experiments that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.479 
you can actually run experiments that
will<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.040> impossible<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:42.649> with<00:00:43.649> limited

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
will be impossible to do with limited

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.100 
will be impossible to do with limited
resources<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.420> even<00:00:45.570> from<00:00:45.719> ethical

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
resources or even from ethical

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.290 
resources or even from ethical
standpoint<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.730> mathematics

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
standpoint so I think mathematics

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.880 
standpoint so I think mathematics
provides<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.750> these<00:00:48.899> wonderful<00:00:49.230> tools<00:00:49.590> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
provides all these wonderful tools to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.799 
provides all these wonderful tools to
help<00:00:50.010> set<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> shed<00:00:51.090> insights<00:00:51.480> into<00:00:51.660> these

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
help set it shed insights into these

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.210 
help set it shed insights into these
biological<00:00:52.800> systems

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.060 

okay<00:00:59.880> so<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.390> mean<00:01:01.110> I<00:01:01.170> almost<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.740> my<00:01:01.860> work

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
okay so I mean I almost all my work

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.040 
okay so I mean I almost all my work
involves<00:01:02.400> an<00:01:02.910> integration<00:01:03.450> of<00:01:03.540> mathematics

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
involves an integration of mathematics

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.150 
involves an integration of mathematics
and<00:01:04.200> biology<00:01:04.230> so<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.770> do<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.950> lot<00:01:05.100> of

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
and biology so I do a lot of

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.320 
and biology so I do a lot of
applications<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:06.090> ecology<00:01:07.070> epidemiology<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
applications to ecology epidemiology and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.090 
applications to ecology epidemiology and
evolution<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:10.170> summer<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:10.740> instance

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
evolution so this summer for instance

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.440 
evolution so this summer for instance
I'm<00:01:11.220> working<00:01:11.550> on<00:01:11.610> several<00:01:11.850> projects

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
I'm working on several projects

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.010 
I'm working on several projects
simultaneously<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.950> understand<00:01:14.400> how

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
simultaneously to understand how

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.480 
simultaneously to understand how
variation<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.320> environmental<00:01:16.920> factors<00:01:17.310> like

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
variation and environmental factors like

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.330 
variation and environmental factors like
light<00:01:18.120> availability<00:01:19.010> in<00:01:20.010> a<00:01:20.100> water

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
light availability in a water

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.060 
light availability in a water
availability<00:01:20.910> and<00:01:21.360> how<00:01:21.750> organisms<00:01:22.260> respond

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
availability and how organisms respond

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490 
availability and how organisms respond
to<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.370> variation<00:01:24.140> influences<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> amount

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
to that variation influences the amount

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.950 
to that variation influences the amount
of<00:01:25.560> species<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.640> preserved<00:01:27.030> locally

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
of species that can be preserved locally

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
of species that can be preserved locally
as<00:01:28.110> well<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.380> regionally<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.580> we're

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
as well as regionally and then we're

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.130 
as well as regionally and then we're
hopefully<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.120> to<00:01:30.210> start<00:01:30.450> testing<00:01:30.840> some<00:01:31.020> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
hopefully going to start testing some of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.830 
hopefully going to start testing some of
those<00:01:31.520> sort<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.580> theory<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.390> some<00:01:33.600> actual

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
those sort of theory with some actual

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.960 
those sort of theory with some actual
meso<00:01:34.229> cop<00:01:34.500> or<00:01:34.770> microcosm<00:01:35.220> experiments

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.450 

so<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.080> list<00:01:42.260> of<00:01:42.380> course<00:01:42.620> could<00:01:43.040> be<00:01:43.160> endless

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
so the list of course could be endless

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.940 
so the list of course could be endless
because<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:44.360> think<00:01:44.530> mathematics<00:01:45.530> has<00:01:45.650> been

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
because I think mathematics has been

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.850 
because I think mathematics has been
very<00:01:46.670> instructive<00:01:47.590> gaining<00:01:48.590> new<00:01:48.680> biological

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
very instructive gaining new biological

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.420 
very instructive gaining new biological
insights<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:50.440> one<00:01:51.440> or<00:01:51.560> two<00:01:51.680> examples<00:01:51.860> would

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
insights but one or two examples would

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.150 
insights but one or two examples would
be<00:01:52.490> in<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.660> context<00:01:54.290> of<00:01:54.440> understanding<00:01:55.070> how

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
be in the context of understanding how

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.340 
be in the context of understanding how
species<00:01:55.430> coexist<00:01:56.180> we<00:01:56.780> actually<00:01:56.930> have<00:01:57.170> learned

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
species coexist we actually have learned

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.920 
species coexist we actually have learned
that<00:01:57.700> variation<00:01:58.700> in<00:01:58.820> time<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.360> environmental

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
that variation in time of environmental

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.960 
that variation in time of environmental
condition<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:00.560> was<00:02:00.650> like<00:02:00.800> like<00:02:01.490> I<00:02:01.580> said<00:02:01.760> light

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
condition and was like like I said light

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.180 
condition and was like like I said light
or<00:02:02.210> water<00:02:02.870> availability<00:02:03.410> in<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.830> end<00:02:04.100> of

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
or water availability in the end of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.160 
or water availability in the end of
themselves<00:02:04.370> can<00:02:04.910> allow<00:02:05.150> species<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.900> co-exist

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
themselves can allow species to co-exist

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.900 
themselves can allow species to co-exist
that<00:02:06.470> would<00:02:06.680> coexist<00:02:06.980> otherwise<00:02:07.550> and

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
that would coexist otherwise and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.419 
that would coexist otherwise and
similarly<00:02:08.810> variation<00:02:09.350> in<00:02:09.470> space<00:02:09.770> also<00:02:10.280> can

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
similarly variation in space also can

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.700 
similarly variation in space also can
play<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.640> role<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:10.940> what<00:02:11.810> species<00:02:12.050> can<00:02:12.410> co-exist

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
play a role in what species can co-exist

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.699 
play a role in what species can co-exist
and<00:02:13.130> spatially<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.510> these<00:02:14.630> are<00:02:14.810> variation

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
and spatially so these are variation

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.260 
and spatially so these are variation
play<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.250> really<00:02:16.459> important<00:02:17.000> role<00:02:17.120> in

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
play a really important role in

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.180 
play a really important role in
understanding<00:02:18.070> global<00:02:19.070> diversity

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.640 

well<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.220> think<00:02:26.580> mathematics<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.840> in

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
well I think mathematics is going to in

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.110 
well I think mathematics is going to in
general<00:02:29.040> contribute<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> world<00:02:29.880> by

general contribute to the world by

general contribute to the world by

providing us a sense of how to maybe
