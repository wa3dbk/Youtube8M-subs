neon green duct tape that was the same

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.199

would look beautiful in a neon green
style<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:08.989> then<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.319> could<00:02:09.439> even<00:02:09.560> take<00:02:09.799> the

except<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:17.330> could<00:02:17.510> tear<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.780> up<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.020> bit<00:02:18.440> it'll

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
except you could tear it up a bit it'll

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.230 
except you could tear it up a bit it'll
still<00:02:19.010> hold<00:02:19.250> its<00:02:19.400> own<00:02:19.490> pretty<00:02:19.820> well<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.090> got

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
still hold its own pretty well you got

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.550 
still hold its own pretty well you got
the<00:02:20.390> belt<00:02:20.750> loop<00:02:20.930> there<00:02:21.170> you've<00:02:21.290> got<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.410> pretty

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
the belt loop there you've got a pretty

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.920 
the belt loop there you've got a pretty
pretty<00:02:22.070> nice<00:02:22.280> sized<00:02:22.580> belt<00:02:22.910> loop<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.840> you

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
pretty nice sized belt loop so you

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.350 
pretty nice sized belt loop so you
probably<00:02:24.050> get<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.320> pretty<00:02:24.440> good<00:02:24.620> belt<00:02:24.830> on<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.160> it

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
probably get a pretty good belt on to it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.520 
probably get a pretty good belt on to it
but<00:02:26.360> then<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.600> if<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.990> wanted<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.290> go<00:02:27.380> all

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
but then you if you wanted to go all

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.230 
but then you if you wanted to go all
zombie<00:02:27.920> with<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.340> would<00:02:28.550> be<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.760> great

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
zombie with it this would be a great

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.950 
zombie with it this would be a great
knife<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.690> do<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.050> check<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.860> out
