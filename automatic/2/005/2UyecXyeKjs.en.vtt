00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.640
 me 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.730
 Lily could play an important role in the history of competition tires 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.390
 what 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.829
 The rice 1951 Pirelli is the alpha 159 to be the basis for the subsequent tire development 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.090
 Innovative tire 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:33.750
 I put on the people Trat 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:39.270
 The tires were adopted from the name of the carcass Oura - ji Albert 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:43.320
 Chin-to-alert technology was originally metal is used after the fiber 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.490
 This technology makes it possible to widen the tire width 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:53.580
 Made a course for the birth of middle breath tire 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:55.600
 It will also increase the force to try to suppress the therefore the road surface of the machine to the effects of aerodynamic increases 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:01.800
 Was 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.800
 The width of the tire has further expanded to over 40 cm 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:11.670
 Progress of 20 years represented the wide tires as it was dramatically expanded the ground area before 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:17.549
 It was a grooved block pattern 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:21.720
 It was 1971 that slick tires designed exclusively for racing appeared 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:26.080
 Compound is also improved and natural rubber of material is softer 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.870
 Switched to synthetic rubber with greater grip 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:37.040
 The burden on the Splus pair tires has also been greater than ever 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:42.050
 The 1971 Lotus 56 b was the most expensive machine at the time, wasn't it? 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.650
 The gas turbine engine behind the driver squeezes out 600 horsepower 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.180
 I used four-wheel drive oh 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.270
 Heavy vehicle weight and strong torque gave the tires various stress 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.270
 What 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.110
 FERERRARI tiff wears radial tires and title in 1979 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.869
 Won 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.080
 It was also necessary to support the grand effects technology used at this time 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.410
 Side skirt presses machine against the ground 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.410
 Because I put an additional load on the tires 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.990
 Radial tires 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.990
 I'm getting healthier, right? 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:28.790
 In the 1990s, Pirelli introduced a new dual compound 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.370
 This will give you the best performance in qualifying and the occurrence of degradation during the race 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:37.250
 We were able both to reduce 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:40.080
 The inner compound is solid for racing and the outer compound is high for qualifying 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:45.330
 We use properly in grip thing 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:51.640
 The traction problems and wheel spins seen in the preliminary round were made by the soft rubber on the front side 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:57.640
 Solved and made possible a wide range of turbo settings in qualifying and races 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:01.209
 Mist returns from 1989 to 1991 with p 7 tires 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.370
 The Benetton drink village Piquet led to victory 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.050
 Only the design of the tire contact surface which is not the world changing rapidly in the last 30 years 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.630
 I only changed 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:17.840
 Prince radial mother makes dragon r compound 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:22.820
 And the use of composite materials is an important technology that leads to modern tire Is Best 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:29.040
 A God as the go sophisticated Pirelli addition to the improvement of tire compounds 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:34.290
 Carcass and structure have also been reviewed to boost technology levels 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:39.469
 Ultimate grip and performance with different compounds on circuits around the world 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.469
 You can see in the top level races that take place
