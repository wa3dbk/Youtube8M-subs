his questions a good question comes from
Simon<00:00:13.259> Says<00:00:13.410> hey<00:00:14.130> there<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.549> just<00:00:14.639> can't

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
Simon Says hey there I just can't

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.000 
Simon Says hey there I just can't
understand<00:00:15.450> why<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.990> not<00:00:16.080> possible<00:00:16.230> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
understand why it is not possible to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.070 
understand why it is not possible to
apply<00:00:17.250> body<00:00:17.699> filler<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.240> edge<00:00:18.420> primer

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
apply body filler to edge primer

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.920 
apply body filler to edge primer
what<00:00:19.619> happens<00:00:20.010> when<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.480> it<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
what happens when you do it is just a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.290 
what happens when you do it is just a
question<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:23.130> or<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.119> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
question of that or is it just a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.359 
question of that or is it just a
question<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.660> bad<00:00:24.840> adhesion<00:00:25.320> or<00:00:25.529> does<00:00:26.220> it

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
question of bad adhesion or does it

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.040 
question of bad adhesion or does it
react<00:00:26.730> somehow<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> edge<00:00:27.630> primer

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
react somehow with the edge primer

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.740 
react somehow with the edge primer
because<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.010> me<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.400> sounds<00:00:29.820> even<00:00:30.060> worse<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
because to me it sounds even worse to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.440 
because to me it sounds even worse to
apply<00:00:30.990> body<00:00:31.320> filler<00:00:31.590> direct<00:00:32.040> metal<00:00:32.369> since<00:00:33.300> it

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
apply body filler direct metal since it

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.470 
apply body filler direct metal since it
is<00:00:33.570> porous<00:00:33.989> material<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.620> simply<00:00:35.480> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
is porous material and simply the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.450 
is porous material and simply the
moisture<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.110> air<00:00:37.200> could<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.129> trapped

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
moisture in the air could get trapped

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.240 
moisture in the air could get trapped
under<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.000> filler<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:39.510> well<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.230> my<00:00:40.829> mind<00:00:40.860> you

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
under the filler as well in my mind you

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.160 
under the filler as well in my mind you
need<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.550> apply<00:00:41.790> something<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:43.050> it

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
need to apply something that it

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.560 
need to apply something that it
chemically<00:00:43.620> merges<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> metal<00:00:44.879> like

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
chemically merges with the metal like

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.650 
chemically merges with the metal like
acid<00:00:46.050> helps<00:00:46.260> edge<00:00:46.469> primer<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.460> something<00:00:48.450> that

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
acid helps edge primer or something that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.350 
acid helps edge primer or something that
transports<00:00:49.590> any<00:00:49.860> moisture<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> surface

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
transports any moisture to the surface

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.260 
transports any moisture to the surface
or<00:00:51.570> otherwise<00:00:52.289> away<00:00:52.710> from<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> metal<00:00:53.270> good

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
or otherwise away from the metal good

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.510 
or otherwise away from the metal good
vids<00:00:54.539> by<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.530> not<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> critique<00:00:55.980> just

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
vids by the way it's not a critique just

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.610 
vids by the way it's not a critique just
wondering<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> good<00:00:58.320> question

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
wondering and that is a good question

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.760 
wondering and that is a good question
and<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.850> short<00:01:00.120> answer<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.680> know

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and the short answer to this is you know

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.250 
and the short answer to this is you know
if<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.100> want<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> apply<00:01:02.670> body<00:01:03.510> filler<00:01:03.809> over<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
if you want to apply body filler over a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.980 
if you want to apply body filler over a
primer<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:05.040> you're<00:01:05.460> mentioning<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.090> about

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
primer like you're mentioning here about

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.719 
primer like you're mentioning here about
the<00:01:07.140> only<00:01:07.350> primer<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.010> recommended<00:01:08.430> on

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the only primer that is recommended on

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 
the only primer that is recommended on
the<00:01:08.820> technical<00:01:09.210> data<00:01:09.390> sheets<00:01:09.659> by<00:01:09.840> most<00:01:10.080> most

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the technical data sheets by most most

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.910 
the technical data sheets by most most
of<00:01:10.710> primers<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.360> epoxy<00:01:12.960> primer<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.799> if

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
of primers is the is epoxy primer so if

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.620 
of primers is the is epoxy primer so if
you're<00:01:14.070> wanting<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.610> seal<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.119> metal<00:01:15.479> off

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
you're wanting to seal that metal off

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.230 
you're wanting to seal that metal off
and<00:01:15.900> then<00:01:16.409> apply<00:01:16.710> some<00:01:16.740> body<00:01:17.549> filler<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.150> know

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and then apply some body filler you know

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.609 
and then apply some body filler you know
that<00:01:18.390> probably<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> way<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.140> go

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that probably be the way to go

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.469 
that probably be the way to go
and<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:20.490> another<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.939> your<00:01:21.119> concerns

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and to another one of your concerns

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.600 
and to another one of your concerns
about<00:01:21.659> applying<00:01:22.200> body<00:01:22.530> filler<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> metal

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
about applying body filler to the metal

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.640 
about applying body filler to the metal
you<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.390> designed<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.409> most

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you know it's designed to do that most

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.859 
you know it's designed to do that most
the<00:01:25.860> premium<00:01:26.310> body<00:01:26.520> fillers<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.210> zinc<00:01:27.659> in

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the premium body fillers have zinc in

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.469 
the premium body fillers have zinc in
them<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.860> zinc<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:29.820> provides

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
them and that zinc is what provides

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
them and that zinc is what provides
corrosion<00:01:30.750> protection<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.770> has<00:01:32.009> zinc<00:01:32.400> in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
corrosion protection so it has zinc in

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.429 
corrosion protection so it has zinc in
the<00:01:32.790> body<00:01:32.970> filler<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.630> designed<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.259> go

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the body filler that is designed to go

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.550 
the body filler that is designed to go
directly<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.189> metal<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:36.450> why<00:01:36.960> can't<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.409> put

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
directly to metal now why can't you put

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
directly to metal now why can't you put
it<00:01:37.650> over<00:01:37.740> self-etch<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> tell<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it over self-etch you know to tell you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.230 
it over self-etch you know to tell you
that<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.960> know<00:01:40.079> I'm<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:42.119> know

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.300 
know don't know all that I just know
that<00:01:45.930> most<00:01:46.110> technical<00:01:46.619> data<00:01:46.799> sheets<00:01:47.070> don't

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that most technical data sheets don't

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.240 
that most technical data sheets don't
say<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:50.070> don't

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
say not to do that so but I really don't

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.950 
say not to do that so but I really don't
know<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.399> reasoning<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> me<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.329> my<00:01:51.540> mind<00:01:51.750> I'm

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
know the reasoning to me in my mind I'm

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.420 
know the reasoning to me in my mind I'm
just<00:01:51.990> thinking<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.470> acids<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.130> react

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
just thinking that acids going to react

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.370 
just thinking that acids going to react
with<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> body<00:01:53.939> filler<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.509> either<00:01:55.140> cause

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
with the body filler and either cause

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.899 
with the body filler and either cause
that<00:01:55.619> heejun<00:01:55.920> problem<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.490> mentioned

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
that heejun problem like you mentioned

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.300 
that heejun problem like you mentioned
or<00:01:57.119> cause<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> mapping<00:01:58.560> where<00:01:58.740> kind<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.070> lifts

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
or cause a mapping where kind of lifts

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.429 
or cause a mapping where kind of lifts
the<00:01:59.430> edges<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.000> you'll<00:02:00.540> build<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.930> see<00:02:01.020> what

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the edges and you'll build to see what

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469 
the edges and you'll build to see what
looks<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.680> scratches<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.210> know<00:02:03.299> after

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
looks like scratches that you know after

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.289 
looks like scratches that you know after
it's<00:02:03.659> been<00:02:03.780> painted<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.290> everything<00:02:04.710> but

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
it's been painted and everything but

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.260 
it's been painted and everything but
that's<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.630> that's<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.970> absolute<00:02:08.970> answer

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
that's a that's not a absolute answer

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.750 
that's a that's not a absolute answer
that's<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.629> my<00:02:09.810> opinion<00:02:10.220> but<00:02:11.220> me<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.640> know

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that's just my opinion but me you know

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400 
that's just my opinion but me you know
it<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:12.000> says<00:02:12.120> not<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.290> know<00:02:13.379> I

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
it just says not to do it so you know I

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.700 
it just says not to do it so you know I
try

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
drive you know you're going to get

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.720

arrested or go to jail or whatever and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.850 
arrested or go to jail or whatever and
we<00:02:21.600> both<00:02:21.750> know<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.020> every<00:02:22.350> time<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.620> drink

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
we both know that every time you drink

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.990 
we both know that every time you drink
and<00:02:22.980> drive<00:02:23.010> you're<00:02:23.310> not<00:02:23.430> going<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> go<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.760> jail

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and drive you're not going to go to jail

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.700 
and drive you're not going to go to jail
but<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.330> do<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.510> long<00:02:24.690> enough<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.620> know

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
but if you do it long enough you know

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.990 
but if you do it long enough you know
you're<00:02:25.860> probably<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.310> get<00:02:26.490> caught<00:02:26.730> I

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you're probably going to get caught I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.820 
you're probably going to get caught I
think<00:02:27.210> this<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.570> same<00:02:27.810> way<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.290> know<00:02:28.500> I

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
think this is the same way you know I

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.470 
think this is the same way you know I
think<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.490> good<00:02:29.610> idea<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.210> follow

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
think it's a good idea just to follow

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.180 
think it's a good idea just to follow
the<00:02:30.600> recommendations<00:02:31.410> because<00:02:31.530> they<00:02:31.740> do<00:02:31.800> have

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the recommendations because they do have

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.000 
the recommendations because they do have
you<00:02:32.220> know<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:33.050> paint<00:02:34.050> makers<00:02:34.440> are<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.920> know

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
you know the paint makers are you know

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.010 
you know the paint makers are you know
whoever<00:02:35.340> they<00:02:35.790> test<00:02:36.060> these<00:02:36.240> products<00:02:36.780> and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
whoever they test these products and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.200 
whoever they test these products and
they<00:02:38.010> know<00:02:38.190> how<00:02:38.340> they<00:02:38.490> work<00:02:38.700> best<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.120> how

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
they know how they work best and how

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
they don't you know I think it's best

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.840 
they don't you know I think it's best
