00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
I believe that's an old greenback hole

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:45.020 
I believe that's an old greenback hole
and<00:04:32.030> pop<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.060> back<00:04:33.480> on<00:04:43.760> and<00:04:44.760> when<00:04:44.940> you<00:04:44.970> put

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
and pop that back on and when you put

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.340 
and pop that back on and when you put
your<00:04:45.300> bolts<00:04:45.600> in<00:04:45.720> make<00:04:45.930> sure<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.139> pop<00:04:46.290> some

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
your bolts in make sure you pop some

00:04:46.350 --> 00:05:09.710 
your bolts in make sure you pop some
blue<00:04:46.740> loctite<00:04:46.980> on<00:05:08.120> we<00:05:09.120> can<00:05:09.300> torque<00:05:09.510> them<00:05:09.690> down

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
blue loctite on we can torque them down

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.480 
blue loctite on we can torque them down
and<00:05:10.350> then<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.650> next<00:05:10.889> thing<00:05:11.010> would<00:05:11.130> be<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.310> put

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
and then the next thing would be to put

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.950 
and then the next thing would be to put
the<00:05:11.610> fork<00:05:11.850> back<00:05:12.030> in<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.479> that's<00:05:12.600> pretty<00:05:12.840> much

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
the fork back in and that's pretty much

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.340 
the fork back in and that's pretty much
