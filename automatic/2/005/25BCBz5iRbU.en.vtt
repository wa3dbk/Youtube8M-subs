00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 what to expect from a game called 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.020
 installed in Martian verses 3 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.900
 as well as three have already had 12 or 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.130
 knowing face the game 1 stalin versus 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.219
 Martians 1 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.010
 it was there a strategy game that 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.330
 as well as a concrete one 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.769
 sent the military troops there with 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.840
 equipment practically 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.449
 World War II with tanks and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.720
 armaments shots more than the army of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.570
 stalin that dictator of the soviet union 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.370
 I tried to stop the aliens 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.920
 Martians in a humorous way 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.309
 selected from the game there very funny 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.129
 as if it were a search remix 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.270
 dictatorships and the game was not 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.610
 seriously but the gameplay style 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.969
 was free cute as a game of 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.620
 strategy now face this here stalin 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.949
 verses plus your 3 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.129
 It's like it 's cool, it's enough. 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.649
 the first showing the dictator being 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.180
 practically idolized thinking of how 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.000
 It will end an invasion. 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.270
 alien in his beloved Russia in his 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.090
 dear soviet union then himself 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.970
 I decided to be the hero and create a robot. 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.759
 colorful giant with union colors 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.600
 to end the Martians 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.570
 face 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.610
 the game is all funny the measure of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.920
 possible we have marsans do not end up with 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.829
 You and you are almost invincible. 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.229
 with giant robot walking on one side 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.360
 to the other as if it were a power 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.579
 rangers and tries to break all these 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.960
 alien forces and this is the game is 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.820
 with collective financing there in the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.140
 so kickstarter if you say that 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.630
 calm the whole game and can 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.000
 financing is well so Carlos asked 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.700
 125 thousand dollars and so far it has only been 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.520
 raised $ 1,900 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.680
 What a sad thing, then, if the people 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.020
 really like stalin versus 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.299
 marcellus 3 who knows he really does not 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.299
 saw the game is new generation
