this<00:01:27.780> laptop<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.189> razor<00:01:29.490> blade<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.689> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
this laptop like the razor blade it's I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.440 
this laptop like the razor blade it's I
would<00:01:32.009> definitely<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> razor<00:01:33.000> blade<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
would definitely get the razor blade the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.899 
would definitely get the razor blade the
razor<00:01:33.659> blade<00:01:33.990> Pro<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.619> probably<00:01:35.220> still<00:01:35.579> too

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
razor blade Pro is probably still too

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.670 
razor blade Pro is probably still too
big<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.390> me<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.350> your<00:01:37.500> only

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
big for me but if that was your only
