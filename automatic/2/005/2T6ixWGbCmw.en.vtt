designers start cutting the fabric and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.139 
designers start cutting the fabric and
then<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.559> course<00:00:40.829> come<00:00:41.129> sewing<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.790> which<00:00:41.940> all

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
then of course come sewing in which all

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.790 
then of course come sewing in which all
this<00:00:42.390> pattern<00:00:42.750> pieces<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.469> stitched

together the last step is fitting the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.380 
together the last step is fitting the
garment<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> model<00:00:47.370> which<00:00:47.550> ensures<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
garment to the model which ensures the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.139 
garment to the model which ensures the
designers<00:00:48.840> vision<00:00:49.289> translates<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.039> real<00:00:50.190> life

when<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> look<00:00:54.360> at<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.629> processes<00:00:55.350> more<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.800> all

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
when I look at my processes more of all

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.889 
when I look at my processes more of all
the<00:00:56.129> information<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.789> take<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.629> mostly

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the information I take in it's mostly

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.080 
the information I take in it's mostly
images<00:00:58.350> images<00:00:58.770> stimulate<00:00:59.219> creative<00:00:59.640> process

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
images images stimulate creative process

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.460 
images images stimulate creative process
tremendously

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.930 

what<00:01:05.470> I<00:01:05.500> like<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.680> do<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.190> begin<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.700> sketch

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
what I like to do is begin to sketch

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.960 
what I like to do is begin to sketch
focus<00:01:07.509> on<00:01:07.750> my<00:01:08.200> details<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:09.400> begin<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.729> swatch

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
focus on my details and begin to swatch

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.240 
focus on my details and begin to swatch
and<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.479> pick<00:01:10.720> out<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.140> fabrics<00:01:11.560> that<00:01:11.860> would<00:01:12.040> go

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
and I pick out the fabrics that would go

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.560 
and I pick out the fabrics that would go
with<00:01:12.820> each<00:01:13.150> look<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:15.030> wanted<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.150> kind<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.450> keep

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
with each look I wanted to kind of keep

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.120 
with each look I wanted to kind of keep
the<00:01:16.720> focus<00:01:16.930> on<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.229> knitting<00:01:17.680> in<00:01:17.950> my

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
the focus on the knitting in my

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.359 
the focus on the knitting in my
collection<00:01:18.729> I<00:01:18.970> took<00:01:19.360> chiffon<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.229> I<00:01:20.799> cut<00:01:21.040> into

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
collection I took chiffon and I cut into

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.649 
collection I took chiffon and I cut into
strips<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.880> just<00:01:21.970> knit<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.390> strip's

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
strips and just knit the strip's

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.289 
strips and just knit the strip's
together<00:01:23.049> to<00:01:23.440> create<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.890> jacket<00:01:24.700> on<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:24.940> shirt

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
together to create a jacket on a shirt

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.940 
together to create a jacket on a shirt
and<00:01:25.600> I<00:01:25.810> think<00:01:26.020> that's<00:01:26.200> pretty<00:01:26.380> cool<00:01:26.680> because

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
and I think that's pretty cool because

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.830 
and I think that's pretty cool because
you<00:01:27.610> know<00:01:27.729> it's<00:01:27.880> art<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:28.299> have<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.600> look

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
you know it's art and you have to look

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.289 
you know it's art and you have to look
at<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.250> Charles<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:30.430> I<00:01:30.520> actually<00:01:30.850> made<00:01:31.270> a

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
at it Charles and I actually made a

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.499 
at it Charles and I actually made a
couple<00:01:31.659> of<00:01:32.170> semesters<00:01:32.619> ago<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.700> we<00:01:33.909> balance

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
couple of semesters ago and we balance

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.080 
couple of semesters ago and we balance
each<00:01:34.630> other<00:01:34.929> out<00:01:35.080> so<00:01:35.340> well<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:36.940> was<00:01:37.060> just

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
each other out so well and it was just

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.200 
each other out so well and it was just
great<00:01:37.450> for<00:01:37.659> us<00:01:37.869> to<00:01:38.050> be<00:01:38.200> able<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.590> collaborate

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
great for us to be able to collaborate

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.580 
great for us to be able to collaborate

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.340 

that's<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.580> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.090> industrial<00:02:00.689> progressive

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that's out of the industrial progressive

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.690 
that's out of the industrial progressive
and<00:02:01.590> tailored<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:03.000> beam<00:02:03.180> inventory

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and tailored and just beam inventory

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.300 
and tailored and just beam inventory
it's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.420> passion<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.409> found<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.680> connection

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
it's a passion I just found a connection

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.219 
it's a passion I just found a connection
with<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.569> know<00:02:09.690> making<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:10.110> own

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
with it you know making your own

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.390 
with it you know making your own
material<00:02:10.709> from<00:02:10.830> scratch<00:02:13.190> personally<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.370> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
material from scratch personally is the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.850 
material from scratch personally is the
most<00:02:15.000> exciting<00:02:15.569> thing<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.930> believe<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.530> this

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
most exciting thing I believe is this

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.070 
most exciting thing I believe is this
show<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:17.610> coming<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.030> pass<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.959> is

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
show and it's coming to pass so this is
