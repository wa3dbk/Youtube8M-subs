pretty<00:00:32.369> bad<00:00:32.550> textures<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.480> Plasti<00:00:34.050> Dip<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.469> you

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
pretty bad textures on Plasti Dip so you

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.620 
pretty bad textures on Plasti Dip so you
can<00:00:34.860> spray<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> new<00:00:35.550> Plasti<00:00:35.969> Dip<00:00:36.000> over<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
can spray a new Plasti Dip over and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.110 
can spray a new Plasti Dip over and
hopefully<00:00:36.960> cover<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:37.649> pretty<00:00:37.920> decently<00:00:38.370> so

like to use a paper plate because it
gives<00:00:53.820> good<00:00:54.449> space<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:54.840> rolling<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:55.980> into

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
gives good space for rolling it out into

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.680 
gives good space for rolling it out into
the<00:00:56.399> roller<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> we're<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.329> gonna<00:01:00.449> pour

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the roller so we're just gonna pour

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.200 
the roller so we're just gonna pour
enough<00:01:01.020> piling<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.640> roll<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
enough piling on here that I can roll it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.810 
enough piling on here that I can roll it
into<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> high<00:01:03.780> density<00:01:04.019> brush<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:07.610> it<00:01:08.610> will

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
into the high density brush and it will

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.789 
into the high density brush and it will
kind<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.210> absorb<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> paper<00:01:10.110> plate<00:01:10.650> if

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
kind of absorb into the paper plate if

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:21.960 
kind of absorb into the paper plate if
you<00:01:10.890> don't<00:01:11.100> roll<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.490> into<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.210> brush<00:01:12.600> quickly

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.250 

and<00:01:22.970> you're<00:01:23.270> gonna<00:01:23.390> definitely<00:01:23.720> want<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.110> make

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
and you're gonna definitely want to make

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.770 
and you're gonna definitely want to make

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
sure that none of its gonna splash out

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.330 
sure that none of its gonna splash out
of<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:26.990> brush<00:01:27.260> because<00:01:27.500> if<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.040> have<00:01:28.159> too

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
of the brush because if you have too

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.649 
of the brush because if you have too
much<00:01:28.460> in<00:01:28.640> there<00:01:28.820> it's<00:01:28.970> gonna<00:01:29.090> run<00:01:29.360> down<00:01:29.540> the

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
much in there it's gonna run down the

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:30.940 
much in there it's gonna run down the
side<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:29.930> you're<00:01:30.050> gonna<00:01:30.110> get<00:01:30.350> more<00:01:30.590> stains

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
side and you're gonna get more stains

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
like from the gas so you're just gonna

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.900 
like from the gas so you're just gonna
go<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:36.410> with<00:01:36.560> your<00:01:36.710> roller<00:01:37.009> with<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.490> xylene

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
on it and you're gonna just roll over

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.960 
on it and you're gonna just roll over
the<00:01:42.410> Plasti<00:01:42.860> Dip<00:01:45.550> you're<00:01:46.550> gonna<00:01:46.670> want<00:01:46.909> to

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
the Plasti Dip you're gonna want to

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.960 
the Plasti Dip you're gonna want to
apply<00:01:47.300> a<00:01:47.659> little<00:01:47.869> bit<00:01:48.050> of<00:01:48.259> pressure<00:01:48.820> but<00:01:49.820> not

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
apply a little bit of pressure but not

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.760 
apply a little bit of pressure but not
too<00:01:50.240> much<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:52.340> can<00:01:52.520> see<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.740> is

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
too much and you can see that it is

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.010 
too much and you can see that it is
taking<00:01:55.250> some<00:01:55.460> of<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.640> plasti<00:01:56.060> dip<00:01:56.090> down<00:01:56.450> back

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.830 
to the primer that's underneath on this
car<00:02:00.940> just<00:02:01.940> because<00:02:02.330> these<00:02:02.690> tears<00:02:03.350> are<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:03.830> big

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.680 
but like I said before this car is
getting<00:02:08.179> read<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:09.100> here<00:02:10.100> fairly<00:02:10.519> soon<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.360> it's

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
getting read it here fairly soon so it's

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.040 
getting read it here fairly soon so it's
not<00:02:11.840> really<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.380> big<00:02:12.620> deal<00:02:13.510> but<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.570> figured<00:02:15.019> this

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
not really a big deal but I figured this

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.830 
not really a big deal but I figured this
would<00:02:15.320> be<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.470> good<00:02:15.709> opportunity<00:02:16.160> to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
would be a good opportunity to

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.590 
would be a good opportunity to
demonstrate<00:02:17.840> how<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.140> fix<00:02:18.970> big<00:02:19.970> tears<00:02:20.330> and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
demonstrate how I fix big tears and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:34.330 
demonstrate how I fix big tears and
textures

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.550 

so<00:02:34.910> I've<00:02:35.060> still<00:02:35.300> got<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.750> little<00:02:35.930> bit<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.380> the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
so I've still got a little bit of the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.360 
so I've still got a little bit of the
green<00:02:36.800> mixed<00:02:37.730> into<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.709> high-gloss<00:02:39.709> top<00:02:40.130> coat

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
green mixed into the high-gloss top coat

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.350 
green mixed into the high-gloss top coat
from<00:02:40.550> dip<00:02:40.760> your<00:02:40.880> home<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:43.239> hopefully<00:02:44.239> it'll

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
from dip your home and hopefully it'll

00:02:44.360 --> 00:03:16.630 
from dip your home and hopefully it'll
be<00:02:44.540> enough<00:02:44.569> get<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> couple<00:02:46.010> coats<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.550> there

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:27.650 

not<00:03:17.640> much<00:03:19.970> see<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.730> thinner<00:03:27.000> took<00:03:27.300> it<00:03:27.450> down

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
not much see the thinner took it down

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.900 
not much see the thinner took it down
back<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.410> what<00:03:28.709> was<00:03:28.890> underneath<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.459> thinner

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
back to what was underneath the thinner

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.390 
back to what was underneath the thinner
I<00:03:30.209> decided<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.290> put<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.440> couple<00:03:31.800> layers<00:03:32.220> of

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
I decided to put a couple layers of

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.320 
I decided to put a couple layers of
black<00:03:33.360> plastidip<00:03:34.019> down<00:03:34.290> as<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:35.250> base<00:03:35.610> since<00:03:36.090> the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
black plastidip down as a base since the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.199 
black plastidip down as a base since the
pearls<00:03:36.629> need<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> base<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:38.760> know<00:03:38.879> this<00:03:39.060> is

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
pearls need a base and you know this is

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:53.290 
pearls need a base and you know this is
just<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.510> quick<00:03:39.750> easy<00:03:39.989> way<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.650> do

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.660 

all<00:03:54.300> right<00:03:54.570> this<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.080> final<00:03:55.500> result<00:03:55.740> it's

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
all right this is the final result it's

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.420 
all right this is the final result it's
not<00:03:57.470> perfect<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.830> actually<00:03:59.010> see<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
not perfect and you can actually see a

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.150 
not perfect and you can actually see a
pretty<00:03:59.820> major<00:04:00.060> difference<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:01.130> where<00:04:02.130> I

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
pretty major difference in where I

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.430 
pretty major difference in where I
sprayed<00:04:02.580> with<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.970> cheap<00:04:03.210> HVLP<00:04:03.780> gun<00:04:03.960> and<00:04:04.350> when

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
sprayed with the cheap HVLP gun and when

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.560 
sprayed with the cheap HVLP gun and when
I<00:04:04.470> sprayed<00:04:04.890> with<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.340> DYC<00:04:05.730> dip<00:04:06.180> sprayer<00:04:06.560> but
