hey guys this is bryan over at OB DIA
and<00:00:15.990> i'm<00:00:16.109> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> show<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.529> today<00:00:16.800> how<00:00:16.920> to

and i'm going to show you today how to

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.550 
and i'm going to show you today how to
create<00:00:17.520> an<00:00:17.640> audio<00:00:17.850> effects<00:00:18.570> end<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:19.020> cakewalk

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
create an audio effects end in cakewalk

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.150 
create an audio effects end in cakewalk
sonar<00:00:20.070> producer<00:00:20.760> 8<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.260> real<00:00:22.560> easy<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.949> do

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
sonar producer 8 this is real easy to do

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.189 
sonar producer 8 this is real easy to do
in<00:00:23.340> sonar<00:00:23.820> sonar<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.300> very<00:00:24.510> powerful<00:00:24.990> when<00:00:25.109> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
in sonar sonar is very powerful when it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500 
in sonar sonar is very powerful when it
comes<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> routing<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> audio<00:00:27.180> effects

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
comes to the routing of audio effects

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.759 
comes to the routing of audio effects
buses<00:00:27.960> i<00:00:28.109> think<00:00:28.289> that's<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> things

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
buses i think that's one of the things

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
buses i think that's one of the things
that<00:00:28.980> makes<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.310> really<00:00:29.460> powerful<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.660> what

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that makes it really powerful so what

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.359 
that makes it really powerful so what
we're<00:00:30.900> going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.289> today<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.800> we're<00:00:32.279> going

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
we're going to do today is we're going

opens up i can add as many effects as
and<00:01:11.250> i<00:01:11.280> want<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.670> course<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.119> my<00:01:12.240> chain<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:12.750> i'm

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and i want of course to my chain but i'm

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.179 
and i want of course to my chain but i'm
going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> keep<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> chain<00:01:13.560> real<00:01:13.799> simple

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
going to keep the chain real simple

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.310 
going to keep the chain real simple
