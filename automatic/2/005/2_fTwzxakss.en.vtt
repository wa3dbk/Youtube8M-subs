we'll<00:04:01.620> see<00:04:01.799> in<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:01.950> minute<00:04:02.069> it<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:03.239> gave<00:04:03.450> an<00:04:03.569> idea

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
we'll see in a minute it it gave an idea

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.280 
we'll see in a minute it it gave an idea
to<00:04:03.989> another<00:04:04.230> company<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:05.450> build<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.629> machine<00:04:06.780> a

to another company to build a machine a

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
factory racer in a similar arrangement

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.380 
factory racer in a similar arrangement
what<00:04:11.040> I'm<00:04:11.129> standing<00:04:11.459> next<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.760> here<00:04:12.090> is

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
what I'm standing next to here is

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.350 
what I'm standing next to here is
Honda's<00:04:14.090> rs.750

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
Honda's rs.750

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.680 
Honda's rs.750
built<00:04:16.350> about<00:04:16.560> four<00:04:16.889> years<00:04:17.070> later<00:04:17.510> it's<00:04:18.510> an

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
built about four years later it's an

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.069 
built about four years later it's an
air-cooled<00:04:19.139> four<00:04:19.829> valve<00:04:20.130> overhead<00:04:20.880> cam<00:04:21.180> which

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
air-cooled four valve overhead cam which

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.430 
air-cooled four valve overhead cam which
the<00:04:22.229> other<00:04:22.320> one<00:04:22.500> was<00:04:22.889> a<00:04:23.120> cam<00:04:24.120> in<00:04:24.389> in<00:04:24.600> crankcase

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
the other one was a cam in in crankcase

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.010 
the other one was a cam in in crankcase
more<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.889> a<00:04:25.949> push<00:04:26.160> rod<00:04:26.400> type<00:04:26.789> motor<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:27.840> is

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
more of a push rod type motor so this is

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.500 
more of a push rod type motor so this is
the<00:04:28.110> most<00:04:28.260> sophisticated<00:04:28.820> dirt-track<00:04:29.820> engine

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
the most sophisticated dirt-track engine

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.820 
the most sophisticated dirt-track engine
probably<00:04:30.780> for<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.380> class<00:04:32.010> see<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.580> between

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
probably for the class see in between

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.450 
probably for the class see in between
kites<00:04:34.830> creation<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.820> this<00:04:36.270> RS<00:04:36.810> 750<00:04:37.460> was

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
kites creation and this RS 750 was

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.529 
kites creation and this RS 750 was
Honda's<00:04:38.940> NS<00:04:39.530> 750<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:41.220> machine<00:04:41.669> like<00:04:42.210> kites

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
Honda's NS 750 that machine like kites

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.219 
Honda's NS 750 that machine like kites
used<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.139> CX<00:04:43.440> 500<00:04:44.100> motor<00:04:44.310> punched<00:04:45.150> out<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.479> 750

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
used a CX 500 motor punched out to 750

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.670 
used a CX 500 motor punched out to 750
so<00:04:46.910> kite<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.150> American<00:04:49.050> Honda<00:04:49.260> we're

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
so kite and American Honda we're

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.190 
so kite and American Honda we're
thinking<00:04:49.979> along<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.550> same<00:04:50.580> lines<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.810> try<00:04:52.080> and

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
thinking along the same lines to try and

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.469 
thinking along the same lines to try and
bring<00:04:52.440> Han<00:04:52.650> to<00:04:52.860> some<00:04:53.010> championships<00:04:53.700> on<00:04:54.000> the
