 the program is installed from 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.880
 market 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.440

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.470
 Basically, we don't need system data. 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.230
 copy that we will reflash 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.990
 that we will have a system constantly 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.490
 change and here is what the user has 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.940
 have established 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.190
 from which users with a coupon very much 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.380

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.310
 most recently recommends us 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.750
 girls for example when you have system

 applications have something interesting 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.829
 which we would like to keep 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.749
 so make a backup 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.119
 chesno start button 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.089
 tick all that we need 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.189
 do something let's say we don't want 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.699
 she supplies what we will do here 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.609
 can be considered treasonable figure out 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.519
 you can invest in the Internet 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.929
 put a tick exclude running this 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:27.389
 that is, the sixth will not run 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.320
 sold included in baikal 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.500
 either just stop excel 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.720
 earing books suspend all that 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.209
 you do save these changes 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.129
 and then do the player 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.069
 reason for the fact that reading bypassed 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.370
 our vain this tick AM upper 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.980
 corner 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.419
 will be cleaned 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:46.919
 Here he passes quickly enough 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.229
 new we were nervous in a panic 3 3 minutes 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.949
 no more dependence of course 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.729
 on calories to recover 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.839
 Sissy options are also several 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.189
 stop absent ie 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.849
 do not restore what you already have 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.979
 installed 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:05.279
 and on your phone either restore everything 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.129
 that is, rewrite and not including that 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.959
 will install 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.869
 for example, we restore chirkova 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.699
 surrendered we do not have what you feel 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.659
 why not deliver 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.659
 the question of what is in the hospitals to your 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:21.399
 it is installed in ushaki 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:23.199
 natalya recovery 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.239
 went strip 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.310
 By the way as a result of the grain to buy seekers 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.260
 the policy downloaded the Canadians also 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.090
 slowly doing here everything was going with 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.499
 application to show on the example in plus so 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:36.509
 as a player for pentus 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.429
 estimated price is not so much 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.089
 what 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.679
 it all comes back 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:44.559
 set install all 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.629
 establishment held our input 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.059
 row 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.949
 it will be written that these people are not in a hurry 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.730
 until saved 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.349
 as we remember on this map in the folder we read 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.799
 Barkat happen what the opera set 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:58.559
 firmware 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:01.309
 they only installed this program and under 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.449
 hit the bill set one literally 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:04.509
 movements 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.009
 here and I think that I do not call all the same 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.989

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.389
 among the members but remove 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.439
 when however as noted what
