00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.300
 hello very good everyone here products 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.790
 we are in the series promised series of 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.619
 good mods now we will be in 1.4 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.840
 motorbike 2 and when another one comes out we're going to 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.730
 start with this again from scratch 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.730
 well then now I bring you in my 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.980
 excellent opinion that is to say it goes up as much as 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.230
 for servers clear that in some 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.390
 servers in the block but good 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.040
 then we are basically what it does 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.040
 it's been pressing the x key 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.680
 x there is like the one that shows the water 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.579
 iron all minerals the network are 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.040
 and wood and stone as it ignores all 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.960
 the normal pebble then this serves 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.320
 well as well as to mine or in 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.970
 servers if once you occupy the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.519
 servants of the eye of hunger and of having 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.010
 he was very cheating he was actually with 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.960
 fire on what good as you already know that 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.110
 she not only say but good basically 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.990
 is this there all these appear and squeezed 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.479
 what and nothing good then this would be the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.860
 true too much programming in easy 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.420
 to install I recommend you to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.500
 survival on servers both in 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.929
 servers as survival 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.759
 good survival then now let's go 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.259
 to start with the skewer of the real who 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.890
 the easiest thing that can be in the 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.890
 universe 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.650
 and then good first what they have 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.180
 what to do is enter this page that 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.580
 it looks with the description on the graph 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.710
 dot com and there it is but then what 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.420
 first thing we do is go down like here 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.720
 is the mode and we are going here wanted 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.160
 download x-ray mod for 1.4 point 2 1 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.430
 once you have downloaded I will close 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.200
 this is talking to lucas jose 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.850
 and on youtube it's called luca jose videos 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.250
 in health now the first thing then 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.930
 what you have to do is open go to abdalÃ¡ 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.100
 running new 20 min 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.970
 then he pointed minecraft bean and he 's here 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.860
 with almost nothing open with winrar then 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.920
 well once it is already open as 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.500
 I had it open once opened 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.300
 we delete one that is called meta ins well 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.370
 as I'm saying meta lyon and in 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.780
 uppercase we eliminate folders and the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.520
 selected in put of led or its 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.680
 first the button delete what we do 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.630
 is to open the folder sham the file 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.100
 enter that we do not download and the only thing 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.459
 just the only thing I have to do 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.050
 it's all all everything does not solve a whole and 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.820
 it would show me once already eliminated in 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.100
 the mental folder and when I do 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.080
 that in theory is going to work for us 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.200
 actually I would be with tape 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.270
 pity but I just tried like that I tried 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.710
 do it like that and it worked then once 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.660
 I already done that 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.040
 in the michael of the most normal without putting 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.440
 for their part if they are not going to update 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.670
 and they will go wrong then once 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.590
 you already bored the world 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.600
 initially craft for sure that and ready 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.220
 then this will be the video if tutor x 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.600
 favorite is good in this after being more 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.180
 because you saw me several 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.920
 times more more more more same not only in the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.110
 previous video that I had said yes 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.790
 we wanted in several videos I had 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.190
 said then here they have it next 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.690
 soon more episode hopefully 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.530
 that lasts a lot this series we're not going 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.640
 until next year 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.950
 goodbye 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.600
 with the thing is that I was going to have counting 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:22.569

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.569
