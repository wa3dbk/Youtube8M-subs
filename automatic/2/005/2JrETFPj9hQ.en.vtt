 this was according to the need of the 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.729
 the patch opening reaction is new 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.490
 I hope you enjoyed it a lot but I don't know if 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.200
 you saw how magical these were 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.940
 ideas if you ever started your clip if 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.890
 I when I saw it I am absolutely 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.600
 fascinated because it never happened to me 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.640
 that a German of a went one 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.479
 message with above its clip so it is 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.850
 It was really quite a thing 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.200
 tactics and prost must be honest 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.060
 I had a bit of difficulty 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.039
 in avoiding this video better 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.840
 in assigning the positions and their respective 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.520
 positions at each clip indeed 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.320
 roughly everyone was equivalent is not 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.910
 that there was one that towered over 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.530
 powerfully the others as maybe it was 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.300
 success in episode number one 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.250
 so maybe if you can let me know if 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.289
 you would have used my own 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.000
 order or if you would have exchanged 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.310
 some kind so I can 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.930
 more and more aware of the 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.340
 your tastes and always improve in 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.500
 next episode so it seems to me 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.240
 quite tactically then to take a 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.540
 moment a minute to wish you a 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.700
