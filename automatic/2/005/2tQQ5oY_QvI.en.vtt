00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.830
 Hello 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.440
 good morning to all welcome back to mine 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.620
 kitchen today I plan to prepare a 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.359
 flat a little bit particular 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.480
 the lobster always alive and let's have only one 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.789
 with lobster to make us mezzemaniche 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.970
 then we go half lobster sleeves 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.849
 to list the various things that are needed 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.890
 I always say that pepper and salt a 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.610
 your pleasure you can add 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 of chilli 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:42.540
 so we move from pepper to salt 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:47.160
 we have garlic and parsley 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.820
 onion and then we add a little something 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.559
 particular a teaspoon of curry 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.010
 this is very intriguing is not 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.420
 a little bit of cognac is required 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.340
 marjoram white wine and cherry tomatoes 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.880
 always little boats that are always a lot 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.159
 nice to cook I like a lot 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.700
 this way of doing then it is clear that if 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.180
 there is no marjoram there will not be 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.880
 problems 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.220
 the quantities of wine and con iarc e 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.799
 always subordinated as the rose is 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.810
 so other little details that man 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.119
 hand as we go forward 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.119
 I'll show you then I'll show you how 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.579
 gets ready as you select and waves 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.810
 of sea to make us the sauce 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.810
 so in this case we have to 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.229
 break it up here we are the systems for 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.780
 cut it are many so you have to 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.970
 do so I go in just where you have been 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.790
 bust saying that simplifies 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.890
 and then I can cut it or in this world 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.590
 but slightly time this is one 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.810
 dog that was very peaceful 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.660
 tail I remove because it serves no purpose whatsoever 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:05.550
 it gives no taste and the head is gray 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:07.500
 we pray to methane ok I do like 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:15.470
 the hand above but then maybe you 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:20.090
 put an excerpt something else 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.090
 it has always been very good for me 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.670
 and so we prepared the fund well 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.930
 cut etc. 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:35.330
 okay and we transfer it to this one 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:38.190
 ability to be able to then go and cook it 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.340
 let's put your oil right away, not much 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.760
 I don't admit 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.930
 then we immediately add the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.170
 school art the onion you can put in 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.170
 sit down 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.099
 very interesting to eat at the engine 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.959
 precisely so I always recommend myself 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:04.060
 garlic symbol and also believed to 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.620
 this was taken care of with these that these 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.760
 you would have ingredients now 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.860
 made the onion and from these they say 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.900
 cutting errors but not the whole proposal 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.370
 you hear nothing 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.080
 just hack onion brand just a little 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.880
 of color of the group he feels a little bit 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.920
 of ryanair who wanted to use in the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.790
 fish is parsley garlic la 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:29.200
 onion and even other heroes once 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.569
 Now I can move 30 seconds 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.480
 forty because it bends it very much 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:41.410
 time before you can cook roll it 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.549
 at this point let's put it 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.549
 to cook immediately 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.560
 it is called very strong because it must 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.010
 take a particular perfume on 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.290
 shell the plastics and take this 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.290
 nutty taste and this beautiful color 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.160
 in the meantime, however , I can add it 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.160
 a little precise 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.609
 also the price we put it also 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.609
 later because it was not always true 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.790
 a teaspoon of curry so we put ourselves 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.500
 one if you want we can put them 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:43.580
 minus wine we have one of 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.580
 perfect original we are here 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.050
 proposes it 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:03.350
 as you see to the cronies of a beautiful color 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:07.390
 a good figure at this point there 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.390
 we put with the caterpillar just coined 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:19.879
 slowly fire that he is not one 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:22.129
 flame put the brother-in-law we can 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.599
 work a little and add the wine 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.960
 White 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.960
 after which 20 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.160
 I will conjure up a little it will take at least one 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.520
 about minute 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.580
 I meanwhile put on 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.360
 of salt 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.360
 I'd put politicians before 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:58.430
 so see this samples did not go 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:00.469
 well then the scent is growing then 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.360
 we will make freezing for half 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:05.150
 sleeve and the nets we have a good one 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.279
 result but I recommend the sequences e 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:13.099
 browning is essential for the party 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:15.919
 Roman for all late and therefore food 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:20.169
 the pasta is ready, we founded it 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:25.460
 we transfer it before and it is already cooked 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:27.740
 in the pan in this case the 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.490
 chewing and a lot of software is not one 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.229
 something that must do pisa bike to affirm 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.550
 say first 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:43.330
 we check that the room what of 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:46.330
 precisely I call it the flame this 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.330
 this summer 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:00.139
 well I think it's perfect here we are 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:09.780
 here we are ready to replace 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:14.610
 let's put all the pasta in it and then there 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:17.190
 we put our lobsters very much 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.639
 beautiful very beautiful but also very much 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.639
 good 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:29.460
 we give him a decorated na we put ourselves 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.389
 which I still like a little bit of 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.100
 decoration a little parsley not 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:37.729
 never fails 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.729
 is the dish is ready
