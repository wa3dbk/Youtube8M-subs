00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.219 
spotlight as well so I went with the
matte<00:01:41.009> black<00:01:41.189> again<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.840> looked<00:01:43.110> at

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
matte black again I was I looked at

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.630 
matte black again I was I looked at
luring<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.009> preferred<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.460> one

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
luring but I think I preferred this one

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.370 
luring but I think I preferred this one
higher<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> didn't<00:01:45.869> know<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.110> or<00:01:46.200> anything

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
higher so I didn't know it or anything

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
higher so I didn't know it or anything
like<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.450> wheels<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:51.030> just

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
like that and for the wheels I was just

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.499 
like that and for the wheels I was just
going<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:52.430> again<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.579> gone<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
going for again I was gone for like a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.270 
going for again I was gone for like a
kind<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> ridiculous<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:56.040> know<00:01:56.070> just

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
kind of a ridiculous you know just

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.800 
kind of a ridiculous you know just
adding<00:01:56.640> everything<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.149> did<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> same<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.719> I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
adding everything so I did the same as I

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.880 
adding everything so I did the same as I
did<00:01:57.899> with<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.020> pan<00:01:58.290> trying<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.649> put<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
did with the pan trying to put the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.429 
did with the pan trying to put the
flares<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.460> put<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.659> black<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
flares on put it with the black and the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.590 
flares on put it with the black and the
custom<00:02:01.950> tires<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.490> white<00:02:02.759> ring<00:02:03.060> around<00:02:03.090> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
custom tires so the white ring around it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.709 
custom tires so the white ring around it
and<00:02:04.909> that<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.210> basically<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
and that was just basically the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.059 
and that was just basically the
reasoning<00:02:07.020> behind<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.039> just

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
reasoning behind that it's just it just

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.400 
reasoning behind that it's just it just
stands<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.819> lot<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.840> there<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.140> no

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
stands out a lot so there was just no

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.650 
stands out a lot so there was just no
real<00:02:10.619> thought<00:02:10.890> process<00:02:11.370> into<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.000> also<00:02:12.330> went

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
real thought process into it I also went

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.470 
real thought process into it I also went
with<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.930> pure<00:02:13.170> buy

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
with the pure buy

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.720 
with the pure buy
again<00:02:13.810> for<00:02:14.019> new<00:02:14.110> pure<00:02:14.409> black<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.280> windows

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
again for new pure black on the windows

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.960 
again for new pure black on the windows
so<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.780> respray<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.560> went<00:02:18.099> I<00:02:18.340> was<00:02:18.670> going<00:02:18.879> to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
so for the respray I went I was going to

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.070 
so for the respray I went I was going to
go<00:02:19.060> through<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.299> matte<00:02:19.480> section<00:02:19.900> because

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
go through the matte section because

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.300 
go through the matte section because
they've<00:02:20.200> got<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.440> matte<00:02:20.620> black<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.129> bars

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
they've got that matte black the bars

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.160 
they've got that matte black the bars
everything<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.599> was<00:02:22.780> just<00:02:22.900> going<00:02:23.080> around

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
everything and I was just going around

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.619 
everything and I was just going around
again<00:02:23.650> there's<00:02:24.099> no<00:02:24.340> real<00:02:24.700> thought<00:02:24.940> process<00:02:25.450> as

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
again there's no real thought process as

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.289 
again there's no real thought process as
soon<00:02:25.870> as<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.110> hit<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:26.470> ice<00:02:26.739> white<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.730> was<00:02:28.000> just

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
soon as I hit this ice white it was just

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.509 
soon as I hit this ice white it was just
you<00:02:28.629> know<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.930> was<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.500> was<00:02:29.620> done<00:02:29.799> I<00:02:30.099> was<00:02:30.250> done

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
but just matte black it just hit just

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.940 
but just matte black it just hit just
