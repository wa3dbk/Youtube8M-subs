00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.069 
like I said you can put it in anything
you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.250> imagine<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.789> had<00:00:56.969> karma<00:00:57.390> Gans<00:00:57.629> there

you can imagine we had karma Gans there

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.260 
you can imagine we had karma Gans there
and<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.770> Geo<00:00:58.949> Tracker<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.879> an<00:00:59.969> L<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and a Geo Tracker there with an L a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.910 
and a Geo Tracker there with an L a
whole<00:01:00.660> minutes<00:01:01.020> care<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.620> vans<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
whole minutes care for vans and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.009 
whole minutes care for vans and
everything<00:01:03.280> up<00:01:03.460> too<00:01:03.579> late<00:01:03.850> models<00:01:04.299> anything

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
everything up too late models anything

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.120 
everything up too late models anything
any<00:01:05.170> Wow

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
any Wow

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.910 
any Wow
so<00:01:06.729> you<00:01:07.240> know<00:01:07.330> now<00:01:07.689> I<00:01:07.720> guess<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.290> challenge<00:01:08.470> is

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
so you know now I guess the challenge is

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.630 
so you know now I guess the challenge is
to<00:01:09.159> make<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:10.000> LS<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:11.530> versatile<00:01:12.040> as<00:01:12.280> the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
to make the LS as versatile as the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.300 
to make the LS as versatile as the
original<00:01:13.479> small-block<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:14.920> guess<00:01:15.100> maybe

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
original small-block and I guess maybe

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.590 
original small-block and I guess maybe
that's<00:01:15.520> where<00:01:15.729> your<00:01:15.820> new<00:01:15.909> intake<00:01:16.180> manifold<00:01:16.540> is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
that's where your new intake manifold is

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.780 
that's where your new intake manifold is
coming<00:01:16.899> our<00:01:17.710> new<00:01:17.830> intake<00:01:18.159> manifolds<00:01:18.670> are

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
coming our new intake manifolds are

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.960 
coming our new intake manifolds are
serving<00:01:19.180> dual<00:01:19.360> purposes<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:20.590> know<00:01:20.759> some<00:01:21.759> guys

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
serving dual purposes you know some guys

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.670 
serving dual purposes you know some guys
like<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.210> street<00:01:22.479> robbery<00:01:22.840> they<00:01:23.080> don't<00:01:23.289> may<00:01:23.530> not

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
like a street robbery they don't may not

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.070 
like a street robbery they don't may not
like<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.009> look<00:01:24.190> of<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.460> low<00:01:24.610> intake<00:01:25.570> manifold

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
like the look of the low intake manifold

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.219 
like the look of the low intake manifold
that's<00:01:26.380> victims<00:01:27.130> on<00:01:27.580> an<00:01:27.880> LS<00:01:28.149> so<00:01:28.539> we've<00:01:29.080> got

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
that's victims on an LS so we've got

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.800 
that's victims on an LS so we've got
tonal<00:01:29.560> Rams<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:30.100> can<00:01:30.640> bring<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.360> look<00:01:31.630> of

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
tonal Rams that can bring the look of

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.029 
tonal Rams that can bring the look of
the<00:01:31.869> engine<00:01:32.170> up<00:01:32.320> when<00:01:32.500> you've<00:01:32.619> got<00:01:32.740> coil

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
the engine up when you've got coil

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.399 
the engine up when you've got coil
covers<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:33.729> you'll<00:01:33.909> see<00:01:34.149> they<00:01:34.330> can<00:01:34.539> hide<00:01:35.259> the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
covers that you'll see they can hide the

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.370 
covers that you'll see they can hide the
coil<00:01:35.679> so<00:01:36.039> it<00:01:36.100> looks<00:01:36.220> like<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.399> big<00:01:36.550> mark<00:01:36.789> Chevy

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
coil so it looks like a big mark Chevy

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.320 
coil so it looks like a big mark Chevy
then<00:01:38.380> that<00:01:38.560> tunnel<00:01:38.860> ram<00:01:39.009> I<00:01:39.190> mentioned<00:01:39.610> is<00:01:40.149> also

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
then that tunnel ram I mentioned is also

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.770 
then that tunnel ram I mentioned is also
perfect<00:01:41.049> for<00:01:41.080> drag<00:01:41.350> racing<00:01:41.619> -<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:43.360> what's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
perfect for drag racing - so what's

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.300 
perfect for drag racing - so what's
configuration<00:01:44.770> we're<00:01:44.890> looking<00:01:45.069> at<00:01:45.159> here<00:01:45.250> I

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310

and<00:01:50.080> then<00:01:50.649> this<00:01:50.979> is<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.220> high<00:01:52.030> rise<00:01:52.270> single

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
and then this is a high rise single

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.880 
and then this is a high rise single
plane<00:01:53.170> intake<00:01:53.200> manifold<00:01:54.130> with<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.850> EFI<00:01:55.270> top

ninety two millimeter or 1 by 102
millimeter<00:02:01.690> well<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.679> then<00:02:02.770> if<00:02:02.860> you'll

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
millimeter well and then if you'll

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.669 
millimeter well and then if you'll
notice<00:02:03.369> it<00:02:04.030> means<00:02:04.299> it<00:02:04.630> stopped<00:02:04.899> when<00:02:05.140> removed

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
notice it means it stopped when removed

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.770 
notice it means it stopped when removed
yes<00:02:06.069> modular<00:02:06.670> it's<00:02:06.939> modular<00:02:07.359> and<00:02:07.479> we<00:02:07.600> have

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
yes modular it's modular and we have

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.529 
yes modular it's modular and we have
tops<00:02:08.049> allow<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.679> put<00:02:08.859> two<00:02:09.070> two<00:02:09.670> 4150

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
tops allow you to put two two 4150

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.199 
tops allow you to put two two 4150
carburetors<00:02:11.320> for<00:02:11.530> 4150<00:02:12.010> EFI<00:02:12.489> throttle<00:02:12.880> bodies

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
- 4,500 Dominator tops we've got a blank

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.349 
- 4,500 Dominator tops we've got a blank
top<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.370> put<00:02:18.579> whatever<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.940> want<00:02:19.000> on

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
top so you can put whatever you want on

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.980 
top so you can put whatever you want on
and<00:02:19.600> whatever<00:02:19.720> your<00:02:19.959> imagination

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
and whatever your imagination

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.620 
and whatever your imagination
I<00:02:21.080> mean<00:02:21.560> for<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.330> right<00:02:23.330> I'm<00:02:23.480> and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
I mean for you on that right I'm and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.660 
I mean for you on that right I'm and
that's<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:24.020> smart<00:02:24.260> move<00:02:24.350> because<00:02:24.710> I'm

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
that's a smart move because I'm

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.060 
that's a smart move because I'm
imagining<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.270> base<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.900> same<00:02:26.930> base<00:02:27.890> is

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
imagining the base is the same base is

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.430 
imagining the base is the same base is
the<00:02:28.130> same<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:28.790> it's<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.210> lesser<00:02:29.780> manufacturing

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
the same so it's a lesser manufacturing

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.920 
the same so it's a lesser manufacturing
cost<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.310> means<00:02:31.610> hopefully<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.240> lesser

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
cost so that means hopefully a lesser

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.820 
cost so that means hopefully a lesser
retail<00:02:33.620> all<00:02:33.830> right<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.190> then<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:36.140> cylinder

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
retail all right and then what cylinder

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.880 
retail all right and then what cylinder
had<00:02:37.010> configuration<00:02:37.850> do<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.030> make<00:02:38.210> these<00:02:38.390> for

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
had configuration do you make these for

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.740 
had configuration do you make these for
this<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.220> single<00:02:40.550> plane<00:02:40.790> arrives<00:02:41.300> for<00:02:41.690> the

ls3 and they'll 92 okay and what about

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.300 
ls3 and they'll 92 okay and what about
the<00:02:45.530> LS<00:02:45.830> 1<00:02:46.070> &amp;<00:02:46.340> 6<00:02:46.580> we<00:02:47.240> have<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.720> dual<00:02:48.290> plane<00:02:48.530> or<00:02:49.160> go

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
the LS 1 &amp; 6 we have a dual plane or go

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.590 
the LS 1 &amp; 6 we have a dual plane or go

through by for intake manifold that
we're<00:02:50.840> showing<00:02:51.020> here<00:02:51.380> today<00:02:51.440> cool<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.250> it's

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
we're showing here today cool and it's

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.940 
we're showing here today cool and it's
still<00:02:53.270> playing<00:02:53.510> two<00:02:54.110> by<00:02:54.260> four<00:02:54.530> four

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
still playing two by four four

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.870 
still playing two by four four

carburetors or EFI 4150 throttle bodies

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.500 
carburetors or EFI 4150 throttle bodies
so<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.810> it's<00:03:00.020> more<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.380> streetcar<00:03:00.680> face

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
so it's a it's more of a streetcar face

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.380 
so it's a it's more of a streetcar face
1500<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.660> 7,000<00:03:03.380> rpm<00:03:03.860> where<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.880> single<00:03:05.180> plane

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
is good up to you know the public speak

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.390 
is good up to you know the public speak
power<00:03:07.640> band<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.090> 7/8

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
power band is 7/8

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.850 
power band is 7/8
optimum<00:03:11.329> power<00:03:11.480> band<00:03:11.750> for<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.500> of

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
optimum power band for that and of

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.920 
optimum power band for that and of
course<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.250> single<00:03:13.549> plane<00:03:13.760> once<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.360> put<00:03:14.599> EFI

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
course the single plane once you put EFI

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.449 
course the single plane once you put EFI
on<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.319> turns<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.739> down<00:03:15.769> for<00:03:16.129> our<00:03:16.189> street

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
on and that turns it down for our street

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.100 
on and that turns it down for our street
rod<00:03:16.610> like<00:03:16.849> I<00:03:17.000> said<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:17.329> earlier<00:03:17.659> we<00:03:17.840> want<00:03:18.019> to

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
rod like I said it earlier we want to

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.819 
rod like I said it earlier we want to
cool<00:03:18.319> though

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
cool though

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.679 
cool though
well<00:03:19.430> of<00:03:19.670> course<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.939> kind<00:03:20.239> of<00:03:20.269> gets<00:03:20.480> into

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 
well of course that kind of gets into

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.449 
well of course that kind of gets into
your<00:03:22.180> EFI<00:03:23.180> systems<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.890> know<00:03:24.980> will<00:03:25.250> help

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
your EFI systems that you know will help

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.949 
your EFI systems that you know will help
the<00:03:25.579> fuel<00:03:25.819> management<00:03:26.120> everything<00:03:26.390> else<00:03:26.750> so

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
the fuel management everything else so

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.440 
the fuel management everything else so
now<00:03:27.170> with<00:03:27.769> these<00:03:27.950> parts<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.849> can<00:03:29.030> truly<00:03:29.209> do

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
now with these parts you can truly do

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.000 
now with these parts you can truly do
the<00:03:29.540> top<00:03:29.720> half<00:03:29.750> without<00:03:30.200> anything<00:03:30.799> going

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
the top half without anything going

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.179 
the top half without anything going
right<00:03:31.609> right<00:03:31.939> yeah<00:03:32.239> we<00:03:32.450> even<00:03:32.569> have<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.870> hard<00:03:33.859> EFI

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
right right yeah we even have a hard EFI

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
putting LS gen 3 gen 4 motors and pretty

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.770 
putting LS gen 3 gen 4 motors and pretty
much<00:03:52.190> everything<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.420> know<00:03:53.480> there's<00:03:53.750> been

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
much everything and I know there's been

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.259 
much everything and I know there's been
some<00:03:53.930> hooker<00:03:54.680> part<00:03:54.920> number<00:03:55.250> plates<00:03:55.970> in<00:03:56.180> the

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
some hooker part number plates in the

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.569 
some hooker part number plates in the
past<00:03:56.540> but<00:03:57.139> it<00:03:57.260> looks<00:03:57.439> like<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.829> whole<00:03:58.250> new<00:03:58.370> line

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
past but it looks like a whole new line

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.420 
past but it looks like a whole new line
of<00:03:58.609> motor<00:03:59.599> mount<00:03:59.840> plates<00:04:00.109> to<00:04:00.409> do<00:04:00.829> a<00:04:00.859> swap<00:04:01.129> where

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
of motor mount plates to do a swap where

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.160 
of motor mount plates to do a swap where
we're<00:04:01.519> looking<00:04:01.700> at<00:04:01.790> when<00:04:02.480> we<00:04:02.599> expanded<00:04:03.139> that

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
we're looking at when we expanded that

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.589 
we're looking at when we expanded that
we<00:04:03.920> only<00:04:04.069> had<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.310> one<00:04:04.400> play<00:04:04.790> initially<00:04:05.420> that

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
we only had the one play initially that

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.879 
we only had the one play initially that
was<00:04:05.720> good<00:04:05.959> for<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.230> stock<00:04:06.409> transmission

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
was good for the stock transmission

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.149 
was good for the stock transmission
location<00:04:07.760> but<00:04:08.480> what<00:04:08.629> we<00:04:08.780> found<00:04:09.019> is<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.319> who

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
location but what we found is that who

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.349 
location but what we found is that who
knows<00:04:10.310> what<00:04:10.489> things<00:04:10.670> are<00:04:10.700> going<00:04:10.879> to<00:04:10.970> go<00:04:11.120> within
