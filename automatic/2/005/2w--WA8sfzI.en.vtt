00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:09.240
 it is dialogue directly again today with 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.530
 to land a supertor borderlands 2 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.340
 it works as usual you either need 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.210
 dementis or that is a free one 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.330
 just under and then install 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.820
 you have a black iphone in your system 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.680
 shows that is allowed 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.210
 download the first file and fit 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.210
 then they execute 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.879
 then you can man exposed for her 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:44.180
 then you realize to a computer and 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.960
 the fascinating dvd drive is there 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.960
 very simple 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.180
 that will be the installation of 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.180
 borderlands 2 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.910
 where he will install this and wants 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.710
 So there is in the installation 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.030
 but actually the language could then 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.970
 change later 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.160
 who the program to the language too 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.210
 change is also keeping in the moment 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.210
 tries from where he installs the game 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.220
 photo p 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.880
 continue 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.590
 See if we need that if the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.210
 directx brought then you can us 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.740
 of course not installed and 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.740
 now the installation starts 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.380
 Well the installation is done then 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.120
 we can pack it 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.370
 so download the second file 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.590
 So he could land and of course he is 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.690
 recorded and copied everything that goes with it 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.470
 here in the folder in which you 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.040
 Borderlands 2 installed and added it 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.570
 and copy and paste 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.570
 stressed newsletter 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.250
 now , the language changer could do that 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.880
 fill out and change your language 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.860
 thereafter occurs opener and spontaneous 2 and 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.370
 now completely problems are working 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.740
 it not 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.210
 So if I have so I equip 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.000
 with many other that heard it 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.700
 disco fox will win32 if you 're in werries 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.380
 go and just for talents from there 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.480
 most executes that thereafter 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.570
 still has problems when zb says 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.010
 that often wrong and a dll file 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.550
 missing in the download of a dll 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.020
 fixer with 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.590
 if it's wrong that I should go 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:16.310
 installed and installed a pdf 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.410
 files in the example says 85 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.300
 dll missing then give her in the search 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:32.320
 and then you invite yourself 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:32.320
 the whole thing is still changing 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:04:09.970
 the class was the installation of 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.739
 Play this one really played 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.030
 definitely have it missing and in the 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:22.340
 category you should have played 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:27.310
 playing now I could subject 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.310
 speak individually and a cold game 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.480
 if you guys did that then the green ones 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.450
 thumbs up 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.920
 and if you like it write 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.660
 unconditional account last comment there 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.970
 to tell me what was going on 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.010
 if their problems have also just as if 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.620
 the tight game or have a program 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.180
 I want you to suggest that 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.900
 that maybe next video 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.550
 could do 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.170
 then just send me a message 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.330
 or comment on this as well 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.740
 Subscribe to me in any case is from 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.670
 still very dutiful program 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.320
 tomorrow comes torchlight 2 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:10.870
 ok and now you can come down to me 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:13.200
 like players play with me 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.120
 computer is a little slow manoeuvrable 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.280
 that's why I just have to record 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.290
 but check the settings 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.690
 Borderlands 2 is doing pretty well 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.080
 recognizes directly what the computer can do 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:30.040
 he can not and then he does that 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:34.350
 automatically thanks again for 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.350
 watch and do until next 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:06:08.570
 that's stupid now nothing is coming 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:11.450
 nothing comes out of the language file 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.380
 sound was already out what's the name 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.380
 stupidly speaking peter
