00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
a long history with mirrorless and I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.809 
a long history with mirrorless and I
probably<00:02:17.110> didn't<00:02:17.349> even<00:02:17.409> realize<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.040> but<00:02:18.250> this

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
probably didn't even realize it but this

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.390 
probably didn't even realize it but this
little<00:02:19.120> rangefinder<00:02:19.930> camera<00:02:20.319> which<00:02:21.040> was<00:02:21.250> my

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
little rangefinder camera which was my

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.550 
little rangefinder camera which was my
mom's<00:02:21.670> camera<00:02:22.180> was<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.540> first<00:02:22.989> camera<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.530> I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
mom's camera was the first camera that I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.010 
mom's camera was the first camera that I
used<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.340> was<00:02:24.550> when<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.730> was<00:02:24.819> 12<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.510> I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
used and this was when I was 12 and I

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.430 
used and this was when I was 12 and I
used<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.590> work<00:02:26.770> on<00:02:27.069> a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
used it to work on a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.130 
used it to work on a
Boy<00:02:27.890> Scout<00:02:28.160> merit<00:02:28.340> badge<00:02:28.610> on<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.540> back<00:02:29.570> of<00:02:30.020> it

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
Boy Scout merit badge on the back of it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.490 
Boy Scout merit badge on the back of it
is<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.650> scale<00:02:31.280> for<00:02:31.970> exposure<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.960> I<00:02:33.020> used<00:02:33.350> to

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
is the scale for exposure that I used to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.430 
is the scale for exposure that I used to
calculate<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.130> exposure<00:02:34.700> with<00:02:35.600> try<00:02:35.960> X<00:02:36.140> film

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
calculate the exposure with try X film

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.620 
calculate the exposure with try X film
because<00:02:37.070> that's<00:02:37.310> there<00:02:37.730> was<00:02:37.820> no<00:02:38.000> meter<00:02:38.270> in<00:02:38.510> the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
because that's there was no meter in the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.780 
because that's there was no meter in the
camera<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.620> we've<00:02:39.830> come<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.100> long<00:02:40.190> way<00:02:40.730> since

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
camera so we've come a long way since

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.360 
camera so we've come a long way since
then<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.410> what<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.680> used<00:02:43.070> in<00:02:43.250> the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
then so this is that what I used in the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.370 
then so this is that what I used in the
70s<00:02:43.880> when<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.060> was<00:02:44.120> learning<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:45.080> I've<00:02:45.170> always

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
70s when I was learning so I've always

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.810 
70s when I was learning so I've always
been<00:02:45.500> kind<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.010> 35-millimeter

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
been kind of a 35-millimeter

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.450 
been kind of a 35-millimeter
photographer<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.350> shot<00:02:48.650> bigger<00:02:48.920> formats

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
photographer I have shot bigger formats

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.880 
photographer I have shot bigger formats
large<00:02:50.180> format<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> little<00:02:50.720> bit<00:02:51.200> medium<00:02:51.650> format

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
large format a little bit medium format

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.100 
large format a little bit medium format
quite<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> bit<00:02:52.610> but<00:02:52.820> I've<00:02:52.940> always<00:02:53.240> gravitated

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
quite a bit but I've always gravitated

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.800 
quite a bit but I've always gravitated
towards<00:02:54.560> 35<00:02:55.490> millimeter<00:02:56.000> size<00:02:56.270> cameras

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
towards 35 millimeter size cameras

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.990 
towards 35 millimeter size cameras
because<00:02:57.140> they<00:02:57.320> really<00:02:57.800> work<00:02:58.040> with<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.820> way<00:02:58.970> I

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
because they really work with the way I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.660 
because they really work with the way I
like<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.420> capture<00:02:59.840> life<00:03:00.080> as<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.620> happens<00:03:00.980> this

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
like to capture life as it happens this

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.260 
like to capture life as it happens this
is<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.970> Canon<00:03:02.600> Elan<00:03:03.200> 7<00:03:03.830> which<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.580> film<00:03:05.000> camera

Sony<00:03:20.600> photographers<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.850> really<00:03:22.850> knew<00:03:23.510> about

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
Sony photographers I really knew about

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.060 
Sony photographers I really knew about
mirrorless<00:03:24.290> but<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.560> didn't<00:03:24.830> really<00:03:24.950> like

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
mirrorless but I didn't really like

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.400 
mirrorless but I didn't really like
think<00:03:25.610> about<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:25.970> as<00:03:26.120> anything<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.960> look<00:03:27.140> about

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
think about it as anything to look about

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.830 
think about it as anything to look about
look<00:03:27.800> forward<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.340> or<00:03:28.490> even<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:29.270> concern

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
look forward to or even can concern

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.900 
look forward to or even can concern
myself<00:03:30.020> with<00:03:30.350> because<00:03:30.800> after<00:03:31.610> all<00:03:31.640> I've<00:03:31.880> been

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
myself with because after all I've been

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.030 
myself with because after all I've been
always<00:03:32.330> wanting<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.959> full-frame<00:03:33.470> 35

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
always wanting a full-frame 35

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.740 
always wanting a full-frame 35
millimeter<00:03:34.430> digital<00:03:35.150> sensor

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
millimeter digital sensor

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.140 
millimeter digital sensor
I<00:03:35.780> always<00:03:36.260> thought<00:03:36.530> bigger<00:03:36.830> was<00:03:37.160> better<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.700> I

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
I always thought bigger was better and I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.690 
I always thought bigger was better and I
always<00:03:38.390> thought<00:03:38.600> that<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:39.470> full-frame<00:03:40.280> sensor

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
always thought that a full-frame sensor

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.720 
always thought that a full-frame sensor
would<00:03:40.820> give<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.180> look<00:03:41.420> like<00:03:41.660> no<00:03:41.870> other

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
would give you a look like no other

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.280 
would give you a look like no other
well<00:03:43.730> that's<00:03:43.910> true<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.330> does<00:03:44.540> give<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.870> quite

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
well that's true it does give you quite

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.430 
well that's true it does give you quite
a<00:03:45.350> look<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.070> it's<00:03:46.760> also<00:03:46.940> if<00:03:47.840> you've<00:03:48.050> tried<00:03:48.290> to

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
a look and it's also if you've tried to

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.170 
a look and it's also if you've tried to

shoot video with the DSLR it can be
tricky<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:51.500> found<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:52.130> very<00:03:52.190> frustrating

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
tricky and I found it very frustrating

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
and it was I just think it turned out

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.960 
and it was I just think it turned out
beautifully<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.740> client<00:04:55.190> ordered<00:04:55.460> an<00:04:55.580> 11<00:04:55.850> by

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
17 of this but I would have no problem

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.240 
17 of this but I would have no problem
making<00:04:58.790> a<00:04:59.060> 16<00:04:59.450> by<00:04:59.600> 24<00:04:59.960> even<00:05:00.350> a<00:05:00.440> 20<00:05:00.710> by<00:05:00.800> 30<00:05:01.010> of

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
making a 16 by 24 even a 20 by 30 of

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.490 
making a 16 by 24 even a 20 by 30 of
that<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:01.580> that's<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:01.970> very<00:05:02.390> common<00:05:02.750> size<00:05:03.110> for

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
that and that's a very common size for

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.440 
that and that's a very common size for
me<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:04.100> I<00:05:04.370> see<00:05:04.580> that<00:05:04.790> if<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.060> can<00:05:05.240> make<00:05:05.420> that

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
me and I see that if I can make that

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.450 
me and I see that if I can make that
from<00:05:05.900> that<00:05:06.020> small<00:05:06.320> sensor<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:06.950> looks<00:05:07.160> at<00:05:07.310> that

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
from that small sensor and looks at that

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.210 
from that small sensor and looks at that
great<00:05:07.850> there's<00:05:08.570> no<00:05:08.840> problem<00:05:09.290> so<00:05:09.920> I've<00:05:10.010> also

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
great there's no problem so I've also

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.950 
great there's no problem so I've also

the<00:05:26.360> great<00:05:26.750> quality<00:05:27.230> of<00:05:27.320> stills<00:05:27.590> but<00:05:28.100> also<00:05:28.250> the

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
the great quality of stills but also the

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.790 
the great quality of stills but also the
incredible<00:05:28.780> quality<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:29.810> ease<00:05:30.230> of<00:05:30.260> using

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
incredible quality and ease of using

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.820 
incredible quality and ease of using
video<00:05:31.100> so<00:05:31.910> this<00:05:32.360> is<00:05:32.570> a<00:05:32.600> GH<00:05:32.960> 2<00:05:33.320> which<00:05:33.650> is

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
video so this is a GH 2 which is

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.580 
video so this is a GH 2 which is
Panasonic's<00:05:34.780> flagship<00:05:35.780> which<00:05:35.960> is<00:05:36.110> now<00:05:36.320> being

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
Panasonic's flagship which is now being

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.980 
Panasonic's flagship which is now being
replaced<00:05:36.920> by<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.280> GH<00:05:37.670> 3<00:05:37.700> which<00:05:38.120> I'm<00:05:38.300> expecting

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
replaced by the GH 3 which I'm expecting

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.110 
replaced by the GH 3 which I'm expecting
later<00:05:39.290> on<00:05:39.530> today<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:40.640> lens<00:05:40.820> that<00:05:40.970> I've

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
later on today and the lens that I've

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.110 
later on today and the lens that I've
got<00:05:41.270> on<00:05:41.480> this<00:05:41.660> camera<00:05:41.900> is<00:05:42.140> a<00:05:42.170> 35<00:05:42.710> to<00:05:42.950> 100<00:05:43.130> F<00:05:43.490> 2.8

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
got on this camera is a 35 to 100 F 2.8

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.270 
got on this camera is a 35 to 100 F 2.8
so<00:05:44.690> virtually<00:05:45.170> this<00:05:45.350> is<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.680> equivalent<00:05:46.160> of

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
so virtually this is the equivalent of

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.910 
so virtually this is the equivalent of
the<00:05:46.820> money<00:05:47.540> lens<00:05:47.870> for<00:05:48.140> a<00:05:48.170> lot<00:05:48.320> of<00:05:48.350> DSLR

because I think that could very well be

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.220 
because I think that could very well be
the<00:06:21.470> camera<00:06:22.310> that<00:06:22.610> allows<00:06:22.880> me<00:06:23.840> to<00:06:23.930> make<00:06:24.080> that
