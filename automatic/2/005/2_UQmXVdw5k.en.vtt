about is the almighty Bob we do them

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:14.479 
about is the almighty Bob we do them
tons<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.379> do<00:00:13.499> them<00:00:13.619> all<00:00:13.799> day<00:00:14.009> long<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.459> the

tons we do them all day long in the
salon<00:00:14.820> right<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.719> there's<00:00:16.650> some<00:00:16.920> really

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
salon right so there's some really

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.100 
salon right so there's some really
common<00:00:17.550> challenges<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.780> we<00:00:18.870> want<00:00:19.050> to

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
common challenges that we want to

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.220 
common challenges that we want to
address<00:00:19.380> today<00:00:19.670> one<00:00:20.670> challenge<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.930> lot<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
address today one challenge is a lot of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.200 
address today one challenge is a lot of
times<00:00:22.410> when<00:00:22.590> we're<00:00:22.740> layering<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.280> bob<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:24.090> end

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
times when we're layering a bob we end

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.970 
times when we're layering a bob we end
up<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.450> these<00:00:24.600> thin<00:00:24.990> spots<00:00:25.380> around<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> ears

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
up with these thin spots around the ears

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.610 
up with these thin spots around the ears
right<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:27.270> other<00:00:27.450> challenge<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.110> find<00:00:28.410> is

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
right the other challenge I find is

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.980 
right the other challenge I find is
sometimes<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.850> go<00:00:29.970> too<00:00:30.030> aggressive<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:30.840> our

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
sometimes we go too aggressive with our

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.229 
sometimes we go too aggressive with our
layering<00:00:31.560> what<00:00:32.160> ends<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.460> happening<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:33.089> is

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
layering what ends up happening then is

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.149 
layering what ends up happening then is
we<00:00:33.359> get<00:00:33.449> this<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:33.809> light<00:00:34.260> upper<00:00:34.679> surface

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:35.159 
we get this really light upper surface

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.639 
we get this really light upper surface
and<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.909> lot<00:00:36.269> of<00:00:36.420> bulk<00:00:36.659> sitting<00:00:37.170> down<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.559> at

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
and a lot of bulk sitting down here at

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.860 
and a lot of bulk sitting down here at
the<00:00:37.739> bottom<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.670> that's<00:00:39.179> really<00:00:39.420> what<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.659> want

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the bottom so that's really what I want

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.649 
the bottom so that's really what I want
to<00:00:39.899> address<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.409> you<00:00:40.440> today<00:00:41.449> let's<00:00:42.449> talk

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:42.659 
to address with you today let's talk

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.590 
to address with you today let's talk
about<00:00:42.809> how<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.620> approach<00:00:43.949> a<00:00:44.370> layer<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.120> these<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
about how we approach a layer on these a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.160 
about how we approach a layer on these a
lot<00:00:46.499> of<00:00:46.559> times<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.039> ends<00:00:47.249> up<00:00:47.309> happening<00:00:48.170> take

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
lot of times what ends up happening take

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.759 
lot of times what ends up happening take
that<00:00:49.350> vertical<00:00:49.769> section<00:00:51.319> we<00:00:52.319> elevate<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
that vertical section we elevate that

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.099 
that vertical section we elevate that
straight<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.399> from<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.819> head<00:00:53.999> we<00:00:54.539> start<00:00:54.870> here

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
straight out from the head we start here

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.290 
straight out from the head we start here
and<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.289> start<00:00:55.559> cutting<00:00:55.800> upwards<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.639> that's

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and we start cutting upwards and that's

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.809 
and we start cutting upwards and that's
okay<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.409> what<00:00:58.679> happens<00:00:59.069> a<00:00:59.190> lot<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.399> times<00:00:59.609> as

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
okay but what happens a lot of times as

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:01.579 
okay but what happens a lot of times as
we<00:00:59.940> start<00:01:00.269> with<00:01:00.420> too<00:01:00.600> short<00:01:00.929> of<00:01:01.019> a<00:01:01.109> guide<00:01:01.319> back

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
we start with too short of a guide back

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.770 
we start with too short of a guide back
here<00:01:01.889> in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> center<00:01:02.399> back<00:01:02.609> by<00:01:03.299> the<00:01:03.389> time<00:01:03.600> we

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
here in the center back by the time we

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.610 
here in the center back by the time we
get<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> ear<00:01:04.910> right<00:01:05.910> there<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:07.230> have<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.410> lot

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
get to the ear right there we have a lot

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.250 
get to the ear right there we have a lot
less<00:01:07.800> hair<00:01:07.980> don't<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.960> ends<00:01:10.110> up

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
less hair don't we so what ends up

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.900 
less hair don't we so what ends up
happening<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.890> initial<00:01:11.310> guides<00:01:11.490> way<00:01:11.850> too

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
happening is that initial guides way too

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.600 
happening is that initial guides way too
short<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.590> need<00:01:13.830> over<00:01:14.040> top<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
short for what we need over top of the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.220 
short for what we need over top of the
ear<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.880> that's<00:01:15.420> where<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.720> end<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.050> that

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
ear and that's where we end up with that

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.020 
ear and that's where we end up with that
lightness<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.010> thinness<00:01:17.310> over<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> ear

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
lightness and that thinness over the ear

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.500 
lightness and that thinness over the ear
so<00:01:18.660> here's<00:01:19.260> what<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.470> suggest

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
so here's what I suggest

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.330 
so here's what I suggest
look<00:01:21.510> at<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> top<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> ear<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.380> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
look at the top of the ear and you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.240 
look at the top of the ear and you
rotate<00:01:23.820> around<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.630> back<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> head

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
rotate around to the back of the head

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.970 
rotate around to the back of the head
wherever<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.280> point<00:01:26.910> is<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.230> start<00:01:28.740> your

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
wherever that point is if you start your

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.700 
wherever that point is if you start your
layering<00:01:29.250> from<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.090> point<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.750> move<00:01:31.380> upward

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
layering from that point and move upward

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.640 
layering from that point and move upward
from<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.610> point<00:01:32.880> you're<00:01:33.750> probably<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
from that point you're probably going to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.370 
from that point you're probably going to
be<00:01:34.830> ok<00:01:35.160> with<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.520> ear<00:01:35.760> if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.750> need<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.080> adjust

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
be ok with the ear if you need to adjust

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.260 
be ok with the ear if you need to adjust
a<00:01:37.500> little<00:01:37.620> bit<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.980> you<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.280> closer<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:39.150> can

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
a little bit as you get closer you can

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.170 
a little bit as you get closer you can
always<00:01:39.450> invert<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:40.080> finger<00:01:40.380> angle<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.030> what

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
always invert your finger angle so what

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510 
always invert your finger angle so what
that<00:01:42.300> looks<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:43.010> is<00:01:44.010> we're<00:01:44.190> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.370> come

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
that looks like is we're going to come

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.880 
that looks like is we're going to come
straight<00:01:44.790> out<00:01:44.880> from<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> head<00:01:45.770> we're<00:01:46.770> going

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
straight out from the head we're going

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.560 
straight out from the head we're going
to<00:01:46.950> come<00:01:47.130> from<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> point<00:01:47.760> use<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.300> as<00:01:48.450> our

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
to come from that point use that as our

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.820 
to come from that point use that as our
guide<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.350> we're<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.280> point<00:01:50.790> cut

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
guide and we're going to just point cut

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.320 
guide and we're going to just point cut
now<00:01:52.830> what<00:01:52.980> will<00:01:53.070> happen<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.550> if<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.790> continue

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
now what will happen is if I continue

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.610 
now what will happen is if I continue
this<00:01:54.360> line<00:01:54.720> straight<00:01:55.080> up<00:01:55.200> straight<00:01:55.530> up

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
this line straight up straight up

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.149 
this line straight up straight up
straight<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> flat<00:01:57.180> angle<00:01:57.659> here

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
straight up and have a flat angle here

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.620 
straight up and have a flat angle here
that<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.190> lot<00:01:59.400> of<00:01:59.430> times<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.970> leave<00:02:00.210> me<00:02:00.420> too

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that a lot of times can leave me too

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.170 
that a lot of times can leave me too
much<00:02:00.750> bulk<00:02:01.080> on<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.890> top<00:02:02.100> edge<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.670> they

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
much bulk on the on the top edge so they

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.899 
much bulk on the on the top edge so they
can<00:02:03.330> do<00:02:03.450> instead<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.070> start<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.490> shift

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
can do instead is I can start to shift

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.540 
can do instead is I can start to shift
as<00:02:06.120> I<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.630> top<00:02:06.900> edge<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.620> take<00:02:08.399> away

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
as I get to the top edge and take away

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.720 
as I get to the top edge and take away
that<00:02:08.910> upper<00:02:09.240> corner<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.830> tiny<00:02:11.250> little

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that upper corner now this tiny little

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.220 
that upper corner now this tiny little
quarter<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.360> an<00:02:12.450> inch<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.810> lives<00:02:13.020> at<00:02:13.110> that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
quarter of an inch that lives at that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
quarter of an inch that lives at that
upper<00:02:13.500> corner

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
upper corner

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.790 
upper corner
a<00:02:14.280> lot<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.580> times<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.240> difference<00:02:15.570> between

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
a lot of times is the difference between

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.970 
a lot of times is the difference between
perfect<00:02:16.800> Bob<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.310> bulky<00:02:18.060> top<00:02:18.360> edge<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.800> that's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
perfect Bob and bulky top edge so that's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.850 
perfect Bob and bulky top edge so that's
really<00:02:20.430> how<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.790> create<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> nice<00:02:22.260> layer<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
really how you create a nice layer to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.750 
really how you create a nice layer to
your<00:02:22.890> Bob<00:02:23.130> without<00:02:23.880> taking<00:02:24.270> too<00:02:24.510> much<00:02:24.720> away

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
your Bob without taking too much away

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.700 
your Bob without taking too much away
now<00:02:26.760> as<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.210> get<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.390> these<00:02:27.630> sides<00:02:27.960> I'm<00:02:28.530> just

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
now as we get to these sides I'm just

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.110 
now as we get to these sides I'm just
going<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:28.980> ahead<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.310> rotate<00:02:29.490> her<00:02:29.820> here

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
going to go ahead and rotate her here

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.470 
going to go ahead and rotate her here
more<00:02:30.780> towards<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.200> side<00:02:32.060> over<00:02:33.060> top<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.420> these

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
more towards the side over top of these

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.240 
more towards the side over top of these
ears<00:02:33.870> let's<00:02:34.320> say<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.560> did<00:02:34.830> go<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> little

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
ears let's say you did go a little

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.830 
ears let's say you did go a little
aggressive<00:02:35.790> with<00:02:35.910> your<00:02:36.030> initial<00:02:36.450> layering

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
aggressive with your initial layering

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.360 
aggressive with your initial layering
because<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.320> wanted<00:02:37.590> more<00:02:37.770> tuck<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.310> back

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
because you wanted more tuck in the back

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.410 
because you wanted more tuck in the back
your<00:02:41.370> guide<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.820> probably<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.300> be

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
your guide is probably going to be

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.870 
your guide is probably going to be
somewhere<00:02:42.750> kind<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.020> vertical<00:02:43.440> like<00:02:43.560> this

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
somewhere kind of vertical like this

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.150 
somewhere kind of vertical like this
what<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.120> do<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.410> can<00:02:46.530> still<00:02:46.890> come

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
what you can do is you can still come

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.460 
what you can do is you can still come
from<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.489> same<00:02:47.820> guide<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:48.959> start<00:02:49.320> to

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
from that same guide but then start to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.229 
from that same guide but then start to
invert<00:02:49.739> your<00:02:49.770> finger<00:02:50.250> angle<00:02:50.670> out<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.090> way

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
invert your finger angle out in a way

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.780 
invert your finger angle out in a way
what<00:02:51.870> happened<00:02:52.290> when<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.440> did<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.830> hair<00:02:53.550> fell

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
what happened when I did that hair fell

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.880 
what happened when I did that hair fell
out<00:02:54.000> right<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.420> that's<00:02:55.080> how<00:02:55.350> we<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.650> protect

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
out right and that's how we can protect

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.500 
out right and that's how we can protect
that<00:02:56.190> point<00:02:56.580> over<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.940> top<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.300> ear<00:02:57.480> and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
that point over the top of the ear and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.740 
that point over the top of the ear and
not<00:02:58.170> get<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.470> light<00:02:58.739> spot<00:02:59.160> very<00:02:59.910> very<00:03:00.270> simple

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
not get that light spot very very simple

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.410 
not get that light spot very very simple
transition<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.830> just<00:03:02.010> twist<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.880> drop<00:03:03.120> some

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
transition to just twist and drop some

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.040 
transition to just twist and drop some
of<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.630> hair<00:03:03.870> out<00:03:04.670> now<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:06.570> back<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.930> the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
of that hair out now going back to the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.500 
of that hair out now going back to the
other<00:03:07.200> challenge<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:08.130> lot<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.790> times<00:03:09.090> we<00:03:09.270> end<00:03:09.300> up

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
other challenge a lot of times we end up

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.140 
other challenge a lot of times we end up
with<00:03:09.660> way<00:03:10.080> too<00:03:10.110> much<00:03:10.560> layering<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.280> too<00:03:12.000> much

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
with way too much layering and too much

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.180 
with way too much layering and too much
bulk<00:03:12.420> sitting<00:03:12.810> at<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.989> bottom<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:13.830> how<00:03:13.980> do<00:03:14.040> we

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
bulk sitting at the bottom so how do we

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.240 
bulk sitting at the bottom so how do we
address<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:15.200> again<00:03:16.200> coming<00:03:16.500> back<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.890> that

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
address that again coming back to that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.720 
address that again coming back to that
initial<00:03:17.520> guide<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.239> chose<00:03:18.690> if<00:03:19.730> you're

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
initial guide that we chose if you're

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.330 
initial guide that we chose if you're
not<00:03:20.940> coming<00:03:21.330> down<00:03:21.480> too<00:03:21.959> low<00:03:22.410> you're<00:03:23.100> not<00:03:23.220> going

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
not coming down too low you're not going

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.150 
not coming down too low you're not going
to<00:03:23.400> get<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.640> shorten<00:03:24.000> your<00:03:24.060> layers<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:25.040> what<00:03:26.040> I

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
to get to shorten your layers and what I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.449 
to get to shorten your layers and what I
tend<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.700> do<00:03:26.880> more<00:03:27.269> in<00:03:27.630> my<00:03:28.049> shape<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:29.220> stay

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
tend to do more in my shape is to stay

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.789 
tend to do more in my shape is to stay
out<00:03:29.670> from<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.239> sides<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.380> back<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:31.769> the

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
out from the sides and the back of the

out from the sides and the back of the
head<00:03:32.040> rather<00:03:32.670> than<00:03:32.850> coming<00:03:33.120> up<00:03:33.360> onto<00:03:33.630> the

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
head rather than coming up onto the

head rather than coming up onto the
upper<00:03:33.989> surface<00:03:34.230> as<00:03:35.360> we<00:03:36.360> come<00:03:36.540> up<00:03:36.720> here<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.110> we

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
upper surface as we come up here and we

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.160 
upper surface as we come up here and we
take<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:37.590> corner<00:03:37.980> away<00:03:38.100> if<00:03:38.910> this<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.810> short

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
take this corner away if this is short

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
head it tends to bounce a lot and we get

head it tends to bounce a lot and we get
a<00:03:44.640> lot<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.000> fullness<00:03:45.540> right<00:03:45.780> there<00:03:45.930> on<00:03:46.019> that

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
a lot of fullness right there on that

a lot of fullness right there on that
upper<00:03:46.410> surface<00:03:46.860> what<00:03:47.700> that<00:03:47.850> does<00:03:48.120> though<00:03:48.420> is

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
upper surface what that does though is

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.289 
upper surface what that does though is
because<00:03:48.989> as<00:03:49.290> we<00:03:49.829> elevate<00:03:50.220> here<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:50.910> much<00:03:51.090> hair

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
because as we elevate here so much hair

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.390 
because as we elevate here so much hair
drops<00:03:51.600> out<00:03:51.810> in<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.200> bottom<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:53.070> end<00:03:53.190> up<00:03:53.280> with

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
drops out in the bottom we end up with

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.640 
drops out in the bottom we end up with
that<00:03:53.519> bulky<00:03:53.880> fatness<00:03:54.840> at<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.110> bottom<00:03:55.470> that

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
that bulky fatness at the bottom that

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.400 
that bulky fatness at the bottom that
nobody<00:03:56.370> likes<00:03:56.670> no<00:03:57.269> one<00:03:57.480> wants<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.810> fatness

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
is start out with those vertical

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.150 
is start out with those vertical
sections<00:04:05.930> find<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:07.110> balance<00:04:07.590> from<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:07.890> top

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
sections find that balance from the top
