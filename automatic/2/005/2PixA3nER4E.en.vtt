00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
always been interested in how people

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.790 
always been interested in how people
interact<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.360> technology<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> social

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
interact with technology and the social

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.709 
interact with technology and the social
aspects<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.489> interested<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.059> kind<00:00:42.660> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
aspects that I was interested in kind of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.479 
aspects that I was interested in kind of
coincided<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.350> these<00:00:43.620> visual<00:00:44.100> things<00:00:44.340> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
coincided with these visual things that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
coincided with these visual things that
I<00:00:44.579> was<00:00:44.730> doing<00:00:45.120> developed<00:00:45.870> into<00:00:46.050> this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
I was doing developed into this

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.229 
I was doing developed into this
connection<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.829> isolation<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.640> technology

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
connection in isolation that technology

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.410 
connection in isolation that technology
brings<00:00:48.390> us

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
brings us

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.270 
brings us
so<00:00:51.079> down<00:00:51.230> here<00:00:51.410> this<00:00:51.470> is<00:00:51.649> kind<00:00:51.829> of<00:00:51.890> where<00:00:52.070> I

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
so down here this is kind of where I

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.850 
so down here this is kind of where I
show<00:00:52.610> my<00:00:52.790> work<00:00:53.000> when<00:00:53.239> I<00:00:53.270> when<00:00:53.630> I<00:00:53.660> have<00:00:54.500> people

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
show my work when I when I have people

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.530 
show my work when I when I have people
over<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.340> kind<00:00:55.550> of<00:00:55.610> lay<00:00:55.730> it<00:00:55.850> out<00:00:55.940> pull<00:00:56.420> this

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
over so I kind of lay it out pull this

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.360 
over so I kind of lay it out pull this
stuff<00:00:56.750> out<00:00:56.870> from<00:00:57.079> underneath<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.530> bed<00:00:57.680> so

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
stuff out from underneath the bed so

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
slippery and candy colored I felt that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.680 
slippery and candy colored I felt that
the<00:01:40.160> Plex<00:01:40.490> really<00:01:40.789> kind<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.030> related<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.570> that

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
the Plex really kind of related to that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.520 
the Plex really kind of related to that
I<00:01:42.460> never<00:01:43.460> really<00:01:43.670> had<00:01:43.820> this<00:01:44.210> experience<00:01:45.170> when

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530

I never really had this experience when
I<00:01:45.560> was<00:01:45.740> young<00:01:46.100> inside<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.179> technology<00:01:47.840> but<00:01:48.410> I

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
I was young inside this technology but I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.370 
I was young inside this technology but I
think<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.610> not<00:01:49.820> growing<00:01:50.119> up<00:01:50.360> with<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:50.750> in<00:01:50.929> my

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
think that not growing up with it in my

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.070 
think that not growing up with it in my
hand<00:01:51.619> all<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.979> time<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:52.880> think<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.690> gave<00:01:53.840> me<00:01:54.050> a

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
hand all the time I think it gave me a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.450 
hand all the time I think it gave me a
little<00:01:54.229> bit<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.590> perspective<00:01:54.979> from<00:01:55.369> the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
little bit of a perspective from the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.999 
little bit of a perspective from the
outside<00:01:56.049> on<00:01:57.049> these<00:01:57.200> long<00:01:57.439> drives<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:57.950> I

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
outside on these long drives that I

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.740 
outside on these long drives that I
would<00:01:58.189> take<00:01:58.369> down<00:01:58.670> through<00:01:59.479> Southern

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
would take down through Southern

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.649 
would take down through Southern
Minnesota<00:01:59.780> there<00:02:00.380> were<00:02:00.439> lots<00:02:00.619> of<00:02:01.570> farms<00:02:02.570> that

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
Minnesota there were lots of farms that

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:03.940 
Minnesota there were lots of farms that
were<00:02:02.840> just<00:02:03.020> lit<00:02:03.170> up<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.500> usually<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:03.860> was

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
were just lit up and usually I was

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.160 
were just lit up and usually I was
driving<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.369> little<00:02:04.579> late<00:02:04.970> night<00:02:05.180> um<00:02:05.540> there

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
driving a little late night um there

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.420 
driving a little late night um there
were<00:02:06.229> kind<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.470> these<00:02:06.560> little<00:02:06.619> islands<00:02:07.280> these

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
were kind of these little islands these

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.639 
were kind of these little islands these
little<00:02:07.670> pieces<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.299> light<00:02:08.649> scattered

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
little pieces of light scattered

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.170 
little pieces of light scattered
throughout<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.040> countryside<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.700> began<00:02:11.030> to

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
throughout the countryside I began to

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.729 
throughout the countryside I began to
notice<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.720> same<00:02:11.870> type<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.140> effect<00:02:12.350> with

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
notice that the same type of effect with

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.440 
notice that the same type of effect with
people<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.190> same<00:02:13.400> way<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:14.000> light<00:02:14.239> would

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
people the same way this the light would

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.479 
people the same way this the light would
reach<00:02:14.600> out<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:14.930> kind<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:15.350> touch<00:02:15.620> the

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
reach out and kind of just touch the

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.370 
reach out and kind of just touch the
people<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.329> were<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:17.570> close<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.260> but

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
people that were so close to it but

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:29.670 
people that were so close to it but
they'd<00:02:18.530> never<00:02:18.860> really<00:02:19.190> extended<00:02:19.670> beyond<00:02:19.940> that

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.120 

well<00:02:30.340> they<00:02:30.670> say

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.180 

till<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.180> know<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.540> work<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.190> paradoxical

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
till you know the work is paradoxical

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.910 
till you know the work is paradoxical
and<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.850> fact<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:40.260> kind<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.530> has<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
and the fact that it kind of has the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.620 
and the fact that it kind of has the
subject<00:02:41.190> matter<00:02:41.520> that's<00:02:41.730> both<00:02:41.880> connected<00:02:42.390> and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
subject matter that's both connected and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.220 
subject matter that's both connected and
it's<00:02:42.840> both<00:02:43.050> isolated<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.710> same<00:02:43.920> time<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
it's both isolated at the same time the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.410 
it's both isolated at the same time the
light<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.710> they're<00:02:46.950> kind<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.760> bathed<00:02:48.090> then

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
light that they're kind of bathed then

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.960 
light that they're kind of bathed then
it<00:02:49.110> kind<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.410> gives<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.370> viewer<00:02:50.730> this

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
it kind of gives the viewer this

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.580 
it kind of gives the viewer this
impression<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.450> maybe<00:02:51.660> they're<00:02:51.930> gleaning

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
impression that maybe they're gleaning

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.900 
impression that maybe they're gleaning
something<00:02:53.010> or<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.310> they're<00:02:53.520> being

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
something or that they're being

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.000 
something or that they're being
you<00:02:54.180> know<00:02:54.270> aloo<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.600> use<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.990> term<00:02:55.380> illuminated

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
you know aloo I use the term illuminated

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.580 
you know aloo I use the term illuminated
isn't<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.490> know<00:02:56.610> you're<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.540> are<00:02:58.080> receiving

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
isn't you know you're you are receiving

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.900 
isn't you know you're you are receiving
some<00:02:58.770> sort<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.010> information<00:02:59.400> you're<00:02:59.700> making

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
some sort of information you're making

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.970 
some sort of information you're making
some<00:03:00.090> sort<00:03:00.270> of<00:03:00.300> connection<00:03:00.540> that's<00:03:00.810> not<00:03:01.050> very

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
some sort of connection that's not very

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.900 
some sort of connection that's not very
tangible<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:04.770> at<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> same<00:03:05.280> time<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:05.790> such

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
tangible and at the same time it's such

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.520 
tangible and at the same time it's such
an<00:03:06.030> isolating<00:03:06.690> practice<00:03:07.140> because<00:03:07.380> it's

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
an isolating practice because it's

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.810 
an isolating practice because it's
something<00:03:07.710> that<00:03:07.830> really<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.550> do

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
something that really you have to do

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.760 
something that really you have to do
alone<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.900> then<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.230> interact<00:03:10.560> with<00:03:10.590> this

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
alone and then you interact with this

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.320 
alone and then you interact with this
screen<00:03:11.040> alone<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.490> don't<00:03:11.610> interact<00:03:11.880> with<00:03:12.180> it

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
screen alone you don't interact with it

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.530 
screen alone you don't interact with it
with<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.600> group<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.990> people<00:03:14.240> you<00:03:15.240> know<00:03:15.390> the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
with a group of people you know the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.600 
with a group of people you know the
images<00:03:16.020> both<00:03:16.290> they<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.620> this<00:03:16.740> beautiful

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
images both they have this beautiful

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.920 
images both they have this beautiful
light<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:17.880> makes<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.420> think<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.690> there's

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
light that makes you think that there's

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.380 
light that makes you think that there's
this<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:19.410> grace<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.370> these<00:03:20.520> devices<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.270> at

the same time and you have this just

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.560 
the same time and you have this just
they're<00:03:23.220> completely<00:03:23.730> surrounded<00:03:24.420> by<00:03:24.510> this

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
they're completely surrounded by this

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.280 
they're completely surrounded by this
darkness<00:03:25.080> in<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.530> cold<00:03:25.920> isolation<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:27.290> always

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
want for viewer to leave thinking about

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.240 
want for viewer to leave thinking about
something<00:03:30.990> and<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.320> want<00:03:31.770> them<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.920> be<00:03:32.040> thinking

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
something and I want them to be thinking

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.430 
something and I want them to be thinking
that's<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:33.240> really<00:03:33.300> hope<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:33.750> any<00:03:34.230> work

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
that's it's really hope for any work

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.440 
that's it's really hope for any work
that<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.710> make<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.970> view<00:03:36.150> takes

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
that I make is that the view takes

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.540 
that I make is that the view takes
something<00:03:36.660> away<00:03:36.840> from<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.440> if<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.220> would<00:03:38.370> take

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
something away from it if you would take

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.610 
something away from it if you would take
something<00:03:38.820> with<00:03:39.150> them<00:03:39.390> home<00:03:40.200> from<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
something with them home from the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.090 
something with them home from the
experience<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.160> they<00:03:41.280> have<00:03:41.310> with<00:03:41.520> your<00:03:41.880> work
