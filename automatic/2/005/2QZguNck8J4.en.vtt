00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
in it's not much so far until you start

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.130 
in it's not much so far until you start
the<00:01:35.610> booter<00:01:36.590> this<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.740> their<00:01:38.210> router<00:01:39.210> they're

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the booter this is their router they're

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.330 
the booter this is their router they're
a<00:01:40.170> router<00:01:40.500> number<00:01:40.799> whatever<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.159> want<00:01:41.280> to

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
right here this is like since packets

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.030 
right here this is like since packets
the<00:02:26.920> router<00:02:27.129> and<00:02:28.170> basically<00:02:29.170> just<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:29.739> fries

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
the router and basically just like fries

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.750 
the router and basically just like fries
it<00:02:30.599> now<00:02:31.599> you<00:02:32.319> do<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.620> about<00:02:32.829> 20<00:02:33.189> to<00:02:33.310> 30<00:02:33.489> times

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
it now you do it about 20 to 30 times

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.690 
it now you do it about 20 to 30 times
per<00:02:34.689> data<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:36.069> do<00:02:36.250> more<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.609> mean

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
per data but you do more you mean

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.640 
per data but you do more you mean
doesn't<00:02:36.909> hurt<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.900> want<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.139> do<00:02:38.230> twenty<00:02:38.530> to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
doesn't hurt just want to do twenty to

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.459 
doesn't hurt just want to do twenty to
thirty<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.159> should<00:02:39.760> give<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.209> enough

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
thirty and it should give you enough

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
then you put the speed up to ten you

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.099 
then you put the speed up to ten you
start<00:02:44.439> the<00:02:44.620> booter<00:02:44.889> and<00:02:45.450> then<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.719> should

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
start the booter and then it should

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.599 
start the booter and then it should
start<00:02:47.379> putting<00:02:47.500> offline<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.069> may<00:02:48.250> take<00:02:48.579> a

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
start putting offline now may take a

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.209 
start putting offline now may take a
couple<00:02:49.150> minutes<00:02:49.359> but<00:02:49.810> after<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:50.169> after<00:02:50.439> how

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:51.219 
couple minutes but after that after how

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.170 
couple minutes but after that after how
so<00:02:51.430> spike<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:53.669> stock<00:02:54.669> in<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.819> next<00:02:55.030> box

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
so spike the stock in the next box

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.089 
so spike the stock in the next box
that's<00:02:56.109> basically<00:02:56.439> how<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.650> do<00:02:56.829> it<00:02:56.980> it's

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
that's basically how you do it it's

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.679 
that's basically how you do it it's
pretty<00:02:57.189> easy<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.609> don't<00:02:57.819> know<00:02:57.909> whose<00:02:58.120> IP<00:02:58.329> this

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
pretty easy I don't know whose IP this

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.539 
pretty easy I don't know whose IP this
is<00:02:58.840> because<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.079> did<00:02:59.230> not<00:02:59.349> choose<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.650> so

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
is because I did not choose it so

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.709 
is because I did not choose it so
hopefully<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:00.909> is<00:03:01.030> helpful<00:03:01.180> if<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.629> have
