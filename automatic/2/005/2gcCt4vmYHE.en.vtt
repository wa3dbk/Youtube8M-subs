program which I've already done here

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.040 
program which I've already done here
then<00:00:52.980> you're<00:00:53.160> gonna<00:00:53.280> recognize<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.360> lot<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.899> you

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
see the toolbars are very similar to a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.400 
see the toolbars are very similar to a
Windows<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> base<00:00:57.960> program<00:00:58.699> you're<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
Windows a base program you're going to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.219 
Windows a base program you're going to
go<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> create<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
go to create and you can see I have a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.710 
go to create and you can see I have a
design<00:01:04.619> library<00:01:05.309> you've<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.090> some<00:01:06.330> lettering

here I'm going to hit this little

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.230 
here I'm going to hit this little
percentage<00:02:35.810> which<00:02:36.290> brings<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.950> 100%<00:02:37.610> and

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
percentage which brings it to 100% and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.690 
percentage which brings it to 100% and
you<00:02:39.110> have<00:02:39.290> your<00:02:39.500> x<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.130> y<00:02:40.250> which<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:42.490> x<00:02:43.490> and

you have your x and y which is the x and
y<00:02:43.760> axis<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.140> what<00:02:45.290> I'm<00:02:45.380> going<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.620> do<00:02:45.770> let's<00:02:46.010> say

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
y axis so what I'm going to do let's say

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.540 
y axis so what I'm going to do let's say
we're<00:02:46.310> going<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.490> increase<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.480> size<00:02:47.690> by<00:02:48.550> two

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
we're going to increase the size by two

positioned my hoop in the center so this

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.080 
positioned my hoop in the center so this
is<00:04:18.470> actually<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.590> Machine<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.220> have<00:04:20.850> the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
is actually the Machine I have the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.360 
is actually the Machine I have the
embroidery<00:04:21.870> unit<00:04:21.959> attached<00:04:22.530> so<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:22.950> see<00:04:23.130> this

embroidery unit attached so you see this

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.210 
embroidery unit attached so you see this
here<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.270> embroidery<00:04:24.720> unit<00:04:24.889> okay<00:04:25.889> and

because the machine and then of course

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.900 
because the machine and then of course
it<00:05:12.470> won't<00:05:12.560> start<00:05:12.890> again<00:05:13.040> until<00:05:13.400> you<00:05:13.550> come<00:05:13.730> back

so you know if you've got like for

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.390 
so you know if you've got like for
example<00:05:43.010> this<00:05:43.550> designers<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:44.570> colors<00:05:45.400> I'll

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
example this designers and colors I'll

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.670 
example this designers and colors I'll
have<00:05:46.640> to<00:05:46.760> change<00:05:46.970> my<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:48.110> color<00:05:48.350> on<00:05:48.530> my

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
have to change my the color on my

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.470 
have to change my the color on my
machine<00:05:48.920> three<00:05:49.460> times<00:05:49.730> so<00:05:49.940> it's<00:05:50.090> very<00:05:50.210> very

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
machine three times so it's very very

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.980 
machine three times so it's very very
simple<00:05:50.810> as<00:05:51.590> far<00:05:51.890> as<00:05:51.980> that<00:05:52.130> goes<00:05:52.190> and<00:05:52.670> then<00:05:52.990> you

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
simple as far as that goes and then you

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.400 
simple as far as that goes and then you
can<00:05:54.170> also<00:05:54.650> one<00:05:55.190> of<00:05:55.220> the<00:05:55.660> nice<00:05:56.660> features<00:05:56.690> of<00:05:57.200> the
