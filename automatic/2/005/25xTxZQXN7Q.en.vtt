00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.469
 hello to all and welcome street in this 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.230
 new unboxing video on the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.330
 collector version of distrust then 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.460
 distrust is a game that comes out on xbox 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.039
 360 playstation 3 and pc on April 2, 2013 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.369
 it is edited and developed by work at 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.289
 black and it's mmo tps so the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.420
 first thing really super nice in 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.860
 this collector version is the box 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.800
 who for you really have to put a 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.840
 solid quality box seem not 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 fragile and that is not fragile so 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.190
 this collector version of course you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.020
 are entitled to our figurines but that I 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.899
 will come back a little later more in 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.390
 detail to better present it to you under 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.690
 this figure you will find a 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.270
 carl bang paper match founder pdg 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.100
 chief engineer in the game a little 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.120
 pretty friendly greeting 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.370
 so it's not a piece of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.719
 paper is transparent plastic 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.420
 more beautiful effect with a small side 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.880
 silvered frankly it's pretty nice 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.430
 after here is another trick but will 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.200
 kitsch and 1.4 stickers I'm not 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.610
 too much where we will stick that but hey we 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.619
 have 4 small sticker 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.650
 we find in this collector's version 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.540
 also an art book 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.580
 so I'll show you an art 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.380
 raw quality 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.210
 we avoid the riquiqui format we find 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.009
 in some collector we are still 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.540
 far from the A4 format we would like to find 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.640
 in each ars end to enjoy it 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.400
 fully 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.770
 bonus side so important to emphasize 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.490
 the interface has been fully translated 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.909
 in French 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.829
 what is really good the drawings the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.320
 at work are of quality we will find a 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.850
 little bit of all this is landscapes of 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.770
 weapons vehicles 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.630
 a defect of the artois that lack 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.180
 explanations there is no text to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.860
 side of all all the drawings have 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.950
 been nice to find small texts 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.420
 explaining how the developers 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.979
 artistic have come to this rendering 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.850
 the fine evolution of small explanations 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.439
 of which is fond 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.759
 there is nothing but you can still 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.149
 appreciated very pretty drawings in this 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.300
 sector 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.720
 in this art book underneath well 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.400
 heard you will find the game from elsewhere 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.739
 to the passes 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.150
 hachette collector version you 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.310
 will have digital objects 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.799
 extra like heavy armor 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.140
 the hydra a small range and finally full of 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.189
 little extra things for good 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.010
 show everyone that you at 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.750
 spend 90 euros to have the game but 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.970
 which is nice also it will be the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.430
 soundtrack that for once is in 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.629
 physical version since one has fed up 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.340
 to have codes to download 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.540
 mp3 we finally have something solid 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.989
 in the hands to listen to the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.290
 music 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.769
 the figurine as for it is really 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.720
 not bad 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.010
 so unfortunately it's plastic 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.659
 it's not the residence 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.329
 there is even a big made in china under the 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.620
 base to remind us 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.599
 the plastic to the touch and by 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.879
 extraordinary against the finishes 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.720
 painting everything is successful we get 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.129
 even ask why do they 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.260
 have not faith in resin is so 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.889
 better in resin 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.389
 the details are successful the animation of 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.920
 the figurine finally the movement of the 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.269
 figure and the look you really 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.980
 the impression that this creature is there 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.900
 to attack you here I hope that 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.040
 this 2 boxing video you liked and me 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.730
