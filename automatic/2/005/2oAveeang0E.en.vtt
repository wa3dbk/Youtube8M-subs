 as you can see I drive without driving and I do not have a driver 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.550
 welcome to the cybercafÃ© an electric vehicle fully 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.619
 automated 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.669
 it is developed by the media the national research institute one has a 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.869
 title format my self-criticism 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.279
 engineers designed these cybercars for manipulation to be 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.230
 simple as elevator buttons 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.570
 it's a screen you show your destination but then you go 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.490
 leave 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.490
 the smart car 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.120
 it is the vehicle is ideal complementary to mass transport 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.500
 accessible for wheelchairs for tired people August all 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 just for people coming home from a party 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.470
 these cybercars hyper concentrated intelligence 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.580
 four other laser beams that constantly scans to recognize the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.350
 trajectory and hundreds of antennas here we have a wi-fi antenna 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.270
 and then a gps antenna then we have here an onboard camera this 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.350
 camera is able to recognize 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.690
 signage 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.690
 on the road 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.220
 11:00 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.710
 has been analyzed by the world en 5 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.710
 the occupation of my vehicle that will leave once you are 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.800
 once arrived at his destination he had been disembarked 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.870
 for the only vehicle with new customers 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.170
 wauquiez from all alone and recharge on the next he has 40 km 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.640
 comfort autonomy 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 and it's really the vehicle of sharing with this
