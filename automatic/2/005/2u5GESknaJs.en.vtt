00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.779
 foto str and then we are for james 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.790
 I noticed that I drove 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.650
 personally that the rap is better 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.660
 or that something saver to do 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.270
 i find the luxury of one of the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.460
 biggest mce is this gives simply by 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.859
 florea of ​​the type but also of the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.330
 the quality and quantity to kill 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.119
 I found out early how marcel cool 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.119
 he has been making music since the age of 95 since 1991 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.949
 at the time in the airport project 1996 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.170
 you were actually rapper how are you 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.790
 I came to music at the time 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.560
 if I'm completely honest then over 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.970
 teen disco we had after the 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.540
 deep disco and started with 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.580
 break dancing 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.520
 that was more like dancing in circles 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.200
 and like to move it or so ran there 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.730
 no idea and then there were a few 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.980
 Braker because they showed me how 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.900
 That's what you really want to do and over 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.370
 the breakdance over the few moves the 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.560
 I could because I am clean in the scene 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.890
 also with the same buddy 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.740
 together 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.180
 and then we drove for Bob James 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.830
 I noticed that personally 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.019
 that the rap is better or that 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.789
 Something to do a language has the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.259
 braker there was with rudi have also 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.939
 developed very fast and were all 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.259
 a lot better than me a bit 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.679
 graffiti actually tries this one 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.270
 This scene is now considered with distance 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:16.920
 This hip hop scene is really one 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.020
 many have been a creative catch basin 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.569
 people from my environment could thereby 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.509
 do something creative and act 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.799
 is no longer just consumer rené 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.119
 schmidt asks what rapper thinks so 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.229
 good but i think well but difficult 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.370
 extremely difficult there is just so much 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.540
 stuff 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.010
 I can basically say I think 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.410
 sometimes they are cool when they are so 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.640
 are a little bit over it 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.960
 But I find this contest part of 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.010
 just not like that 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.190
 who's up a bit now 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.780
 just comes that I find very clear 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.040
 So texts with content 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.200
 I thought early how to say 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.720
 max herre cool I think so the luxury 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.550
 one of the biggest mce is there 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.620
 simply from the florea type but also 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.080
 from the quality and quantity 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.540
 So that is extremely amazing though 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.740
 there are a lot of new names and yes, yes 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.120
 I do not have such a media landscape 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.170
 I'm not on the road 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.630
 lately but acoustic 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.890
 I can not say but I hear 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.690
 me a mixtape where German people 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.120
 turn up and I think really cool 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.900
 hot 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.480
 in principle, nothing about the topics 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.920
 also interesting there is my question 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.350
 you are flying from me or your bude 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.880
 away me that everyone is gone again 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.910
 a question from me you are there he one 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.470
 man prefers a song 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.720
 Defines what he likes or rather 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.440
 says complete without artists for real 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.570
 everything he does 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.690
 I look at both is there are songs 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.340
 profound materia there is weather 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.990
 wonder or wonder the season but me 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.430
 think this is the whole album extremely fat 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.410
 and also those who think about where to go again 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.640
 it represents extremely cool 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.890
 that would be, for example, one that I as 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.200
 artists but also individual songs and there 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.370
 there are the touches and you hear 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.330
 then stop in a bit and think 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.130
 okay that it does not mean so totally 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.480
 It is also different as it is 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.100
 nowadays you only work that 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.200
 even a song then later the sounds 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.640
 Deep dives in this everything understands 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.190
 he is still around it usually is 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.830
 so when you meet people in the 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.450
 art that you sometimes even if you 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.580
 things are not so cool that even 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.610
 not so bad because that's the case 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.650
 fits the types and you rather 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.900
 understands that it just makes sense 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.080
 but somehow so from distance 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.280
 many things just do not like 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.330
 logged off akdeniz improved so too 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.360
 contract contract I do not know yet 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.250
 not no 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.310
 Okay , grab your grave, tell me 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.890
 sometimes too contract yes I know 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.390
 the rapper is i know he last 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.100
 has year were very much present on the internet 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.750
 because get a lot of resonance 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.650
 I just do not have the album itself yet 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.940
 but I have a nice listen 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.450
 thing is to hear I have excellent 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.460
 like 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.530
 so in any case, a rapper is yes 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.760
 I find my own direction 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.440
 They just remember me in the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.360
 rap scene does not know so much anymore 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.380
 but rather things like broken hear 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.550
 bells or halt raconteurs and rock 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.040
 things or done 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.900
 I'm on another film school 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.060
 Now I've heard the name now 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.030
 Let's take a look at itunes 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.590
 playlists a cake and it was easy 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.850
 at the moment is the is perhaps 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.669
 he also has someone in common 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.070
 the autodidactic approached is 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.470
 The music also says as funny as 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.260
 They too short, I'm not so 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.919
 beautiful singer i am from the 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.150
 Cost reductions here, too, the man that 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.110
 simply was the bock on it has 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.110
 but not really learned that
