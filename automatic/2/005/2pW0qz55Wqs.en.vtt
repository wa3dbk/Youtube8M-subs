00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
similar in size so do I tend to do with

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
similar in size so do I tend to do with
the<00:00:55.890> table<00:00:56.250> spoon<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> take<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.969> great<00:00:57.329> big

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the table spoon is to take a great big

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.779 
the table spoon is to take a great big
tablespoon<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.250> without<00:00:59.460> it

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
tablespoon because I can without it

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.080 
tablespoon because I can without it
falling<00:01:00.239> off<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.750> put<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.350> into<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.100> tin<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
falling off and put it into the tin I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.660 
falling off and put it into the tin I
usually<00:01:03.960> find<00:01:04.229> two<00:01:05.100> large<00:01:06.030> scoops<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.930> that

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
usually find two large scoops like that

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.280 
usually find two large scoops like that
should<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.360> should<00:01:09.930> give<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.260> enough

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
should do it and should give you enough

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440 
should do it and should give you enough
if<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:10.860> bananas<00:01:11.520> were<00:01:11.670> large<00:01:11.909> enough<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
if your bananas were large enough and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.420 
if your bananas were large enough and
you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.200> find<00:01:13.500> you'll<00:01:13.710> find<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.310> do

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you can find you'll find that you can do

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.270 
you can find you'll find that you can do
this<00:01:14.549> quite<00:01:14.970> rapidly<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.590> always<00:01:16.890> start<00:01:17.159> off

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
this quite rapidly so I always start off

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.960 
this quite rapidly so I always start off
with<00:01:17.549> two<00:01:17.909> large<00:01:18.290> tablespoons<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.590> batter<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
with two large tablespoons of batter to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300 
with two large tablespoons of batter to
put<00:01:21.180> into<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> muffin<00:01:21.720> cups<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.189> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
put into the muffin cups and then if you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.490 
put into the muffin cups and then if you
have<00:01:23.430> anything<00:01:23.790> left<00:01:24.150> after<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.869> that's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
have anything left after that that's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.380 
have anything left after that that's
when<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.009> kind<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.369> top<00:01:26.909> some<00:01:27.240> off

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
when you can kind of top some off

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.999 
when you can kind of top some off
because<00:01:27.659> maybe<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:28.140> table<00:01:28.470> spoons<00:01:28.710> were<00:01:28.860> not

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
because maybe your table spoons were not

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.469 
because maybe your table spoons were not
always<00:01:29.540> exactly<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.380> same<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> start<00:01:33.360> off

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
always exactly the same so start off

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149 
always exactly the same so start off
with<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> also<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.920> so

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
with that and then what I also do so

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.530 
with that and then what I also do so
that<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.400> don't<00:01:35.579> waste<00:01:35.670> any<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> batter

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that you don't waste any of the batter

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.530 
that you don't waste any of the batter
get<00:01:37.320> yourself<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.430> scoop<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
get yourself a scoop in here and you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.630 
get yourself a scoop in here and you
want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.049> get<00:01:40.740> everything<00:01:41.340> out<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.490> you
