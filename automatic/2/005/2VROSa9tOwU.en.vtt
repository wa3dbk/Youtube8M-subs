welcome back to his clown's garage in
this<00:00:03.210> video<00:00:03.540> I<00:00:03.600> will<00:00:03.929> discuss<00:00:04.470> how<00:00:04.529> to

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
this video I will discuss how to

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.350 
this video I will discuss how to
troubleshoot<00:00:06.140> your<00:00:07.189> heater<00:00:08.189> blower<00:00:08.730> system

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
troubleshoot your heater blower system

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.320 
troubleshoot your heater blower system
on<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.679> third<00:00:10.679> gen<00:00:10.950> which<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.219> an<00:00:11.309> 82<00:00:11.639> 92<00:00:12.000> Camaro

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
on a third gen which is an 82 92 Camaro

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.020 
on a third gen which is an 82 92 Camaro
/<00:00:12.809> Firebird<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:14.460> could<00:00:14.790> also<00:00:14.820> be

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
/ Firebird and this could also be

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.920 
/ Firebird and this could also be
applied<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.900> any<00:00:16.379> regular<00:00:16.650> car<00:00:17.240> so<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.750> is

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
applied to any regular car so this is

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.370 
applied to any regular car so this is
what<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> wiring<00:00:20.130> diagram

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
what you have here is the wiring diagram

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.290 
what you have here is the wiring diagram
this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.439> hot<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.100> run<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.880> basically<00:00:24.150> when

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
this is hot and run so basically when

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.810 
this is hot and run so basically when
you<00:00:24.330> turn<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.570> ignition<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.680> power<00:00:26.010> gets

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
you turn the ignition on the power gets

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.269 
you turn the ignition on the power gets
sent<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> fuse<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
sent to the fuse here and this is the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.359 
sent to the fuse here and this is the
heater<00:00:29.519> AC<00:00:30.029> fuse<00:00:30.359> 25<00:00:30.990> amp<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.250> on

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
heater AC fuse 25 amp and this is on

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.819 
heater AC fuse 25 amp and this is on
your<00:00:32.489> fuse<00:00:32.730> block<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.719> right<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:33.930> -

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
your fuse block and this is right on -

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.709 
your fuse block and this is right on -
where<00:00:35.370> your<00:00:35.489> feet<00:00:35.730> are<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
where your feet are and this is what it

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.200 
where your feet are and this is what it
looks<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.489> you're<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> see<00:00:38.879> it's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
looks like and you're going to see it's

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.869 
looks like and you're going to see it's
a<00:00:39.239> 25<00:00:39.660> amp<00:00:39.899> fuses<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.100> heater<00:00:41.399> AC

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
a 25 amp fuses this one here heater AC

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.720 
a 25 amp fuses this one here heater AC
some<00:00:42.480> cars<00:00:42.750> say<00:00:42.989> HVAC<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.610> pretty

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
some cars say HVAC on it but it's pretty

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.350 
some cars say HVAC on it but it's pretty
much<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> same<00:00:45.210> principle<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:47.270> as<00:00:48.270> you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
much the same principle here and as you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.220 
much the same principle here and as you
can<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.539> back<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.860> brown<00:00:50.190> wire<00:00:50.579> as

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
can see back here it's a brown wire as

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.180 
can see back here it's a brown wire as
evident<00:00:52.230> over<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.219> also<00:00:53.370> says<00:00:53.670> Brown<00:00:54.030> brn

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
evident over here it also says Brown brn

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.599 
evident over here it also says Brown brn
25<00:00:56.190> amp<00:00:56.370> fuse<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.379> power<00:00:58.620> there<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
25 amp fuse so you get power there and

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
25 amp fuse so you get power there and
this<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> blower<00:01:00.239> switch<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:01.440> controls

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
this is the blower switch this controls

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.560 
this is the blower switch this controls
the<00:01:02.039> speeds<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.879> your<00:01:04.339> heater<00:01:05.339> blower<00:01:05.640> motor

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the speeds on your heater blower motor

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.399 
the speeds on your heater blower motor
and<00:01:07.369> there's<00:01:08.369> an<00:01:08.520> off<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.180> there's<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.049> low

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and there's an off and there's a low

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.090 
and there's an off and there's a low
medium<00:01:10.710> high<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.930> see<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.350> also<00:01:13.860> on

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
medium high so you can see that also on

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070 
medium high so you can see that also on
the<00:01:14.369> resistor<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.330> I'll<00:01:15.479> show<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> how<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the resistor which I'll show you how it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.289 
the resistor which I'll show you how it
looks<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> car<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.729> switch<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
looks on the car now this switch is

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.350 
looks on the car now this switch is
inside<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> car<00:01:19.020> where<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.380> control<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
inside the car where you control it and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.960 
inside the car where you control it and
say<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:22.049> heater<00:01:22.290> blower<00:01:22.650> always<00:01:23.610> works

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
say now your heater blower always works

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.140 
say now your heater blower always works
you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.420> shut<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.689> off<00:01:25.100> it's<00:01:26.100> either<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.700> bad

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you can shut it off it's either a bad

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.899 
you can shut it off it's either a bad
switch<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.470> always<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:29.159> inside

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
switch here which is always on inside

is this a there's a resistance in jets
created<00:03:33.390> by<00:03:33.510> these<00:03:33.660> coils<00:03:33.989> which<00:03:34.350> I'll<00:03:34.500> show

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
created by these coils which I'll show

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.900 
created by these coils which I'll show
you<00:03:34.709> how<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:34.920> looks<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.130> on<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.430> car<00:03:35.640> and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
you how it looks like on the car and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.240 
you how it looks like on the car and
that<00:03:36.840> varies<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.260> voltage<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.010> blower

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
that varies a voltage to the blower

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.090 
that varies a voltage to the blower
motor<00:03:38.519> so<00:03:39.120> depending<00:03:40.080> on<00:03:40.170> which<00:03:40.380> route<00:03:40.739> which

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
motor so depending on which route which

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.220 
motor so depending on which route which
resistor<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.640> takes<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.239> varies<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.750> voltage

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
resistor it takes it varies a voltage

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.680 
resistor it takes it varies a voltage
and<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.709> therefore<00:03:44.310> changes<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.209> speed<00:03:45.540> of

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
and it therefore changes the speed of

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.390 
and it therefore changes the speed of
the<00:03:45.780> blower<00:03:45.989> motor<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.950> let<00:03:47.070> me<00:03:47.130> show<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.340> in

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
the blower motor so let me show you in

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.100 
the blower motor so let me show you in
the<00:03:47.459> car<00:03:47.700> how<00:03:47.820> this<00:03:48.030> resistor<00:03:48.840> looks<00:03:49.019> like

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
the car how this resistor looks like

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.780 
the car how this resistor looks like
alright<00:03:52.110> so<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.500> car<00:03:52.830> it's<00:03:53.430> on<00:03:53.610> the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
alright so in this car it's on the

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.570 
alright so in this car it's on the
passenger<00:03:54.420> side<00:03:54.660> over<00:03:54.959> here<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.519> this<00:03:56.519> is

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
passenger side over here and this is

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.080 
passenger side over here and this is
your<00:03:57.320> resistors<00:03:58.320> for<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:58.950> blower<00:03:59.160> motor<00:03:59.430> so

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
your resistors for the blower motor so

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.330 
your resistors for the blower motor so
if<00:04:00.239> say<00:04:00.510> if<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.959> don't<00:04:01.110> have<00:04:01.340> different

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
if say if you don't have different

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.520 
if say if you don't have different
speeds<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.970> blower<00:04:03.209> motor<00:04:03.480> works<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.140> you

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
speeds a blower motor works and you

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.920 
speeds a blower motor works and you
can't<00:04:04.739> go<00:04:04.890> from<00:04:05.040> high<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.340> low<00:04:05.640> medium<00:04:06.360> speeds

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
can't go from high to low medium speeds

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.150 
can't go from high to low medium speeds
on<00:04:07.200> it

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
on it

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.850 
on it
it's<00:04:08.519> most<00:04:08.880> likely<00:04:09.079> your<00:04:10.079> blower<00:04:10.320> resistors

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
it's most likely your blower resistors

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.400 
it's most likely your blower resistors
in<00:04:11.130> here<00:04:11.370> bad<00:04:11.640> or<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.360> wires<00:04:12.630> going<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.140> them

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
in here bad or the wires going to them

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.120 
in here bad or the wires going to them
it's<00:04:13.560> bad<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.670> let<00:04:14.910> me<00:04:14.970> take<00:04:15.150> them<00:04:15.299> off<00:04:15.600> here

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
it's bad so let me take them off here

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.560 
it's bad so let me take them off here
let<00:04:17.130> me<00:04:17.160> take<00:04:17.370> this<00:04:17.549> off<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.150> show<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:18.390> what

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
let me take this off and show you what

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:29.619 
let me take this off and show you what
it<00:04:18.630> looks<00:04:18.810> like

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:29.629 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:36.249 

data<00:04:30.629> and<00:04:31.159> these<00:04:32.159> are<00:04:34.759> seven<00:04:35.759> millimeter

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
data and these are seven millimeter

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.589 
data and these are seven millimeter
bolts<00:04:37.259> and<00:04:37.610> this<00:04:38.610> could<00:04:38.819> be<00:04:38.849> located<00:04:39.389> anywhere

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
bolts and this could be located anywhere

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.929 
bolts and this could be located anywhere
in<00:04:39.749> a<00:04:39.840> car<00:04:40.080> some<00:04:40.439> cars<00:04:40.469> located<00:04:41.400> with<00:04:41.729> an

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:41.939 
in a car some cars located with an

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.899 
in a car some cars located with an
actual<00:04:42.360> blower<00:04:42.629> motor<00:04:42.900> housing<00:04:43.620> is<00:04:44.099> or<00:04:44.699> it's

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
actual blower motor housing is or it's

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.700 
actual blower motor housing is or it's
inside<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.479> car<00:04:45.689> and<00:04:45.900> any<00:04:46.020> different<00:04:46.319> panels

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
inside the car and any different panels

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.850 
inside the car and any different panels
and<00:04:47.029> this<00:04:48.029> is<00:04:48.180> what<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.419> resistors<00:04:48.930> look<00:04:49.650> like

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
and this is what the resistors look like

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.010 
and this is what the resistors look like
so<00:04:50.789> this<00:04:50.939> varies<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.449> voltage<00:04:51.900> output<00:04:52.879> and

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
so this varies the voltage output and

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.790 
so this varies the voltage output and
you<00:04:55.020> go<00:04:55.199> ahead<00:04:55.289> and<00:04:55.409> replace<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:57.529> so<00:04:58.529> that's

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
you go ahead and replace that so that's

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.450 
you go ahead and replace that so that's
how<00:04:58.919> you<00:04:58.979> check<00:04:59.310> your<00:04:59.689> heater<00:05:01.279> system<00:05:02.279> on

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
how you check your heater system on

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.610 
how you check your heater system on
third<00:05:03.060> gen<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.479> like<00:05:03.870> I<00:05:03.900> said<00:05:04.169> this<00:05:04.259> applies

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
third gen and like I said this applies

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.159 
third gen and like I said this applies
