00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
hear those high socks and then the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
hear those high socks and then the
little<00:01:01.890> brown<00:01:02.129> studs<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:03.149> show<00:01:03.359> part<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.840> his

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
little brown studs to show part of his

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.100 
little brown studs to show part of his

legs and then the shorts are short blue

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.429

legs and they work really nicely for

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.240 
legs and they work really nicely for
shorts<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:15.229> as<00:01:16.229> long<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.860> don't<00:01:17.009> look

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
shorts I think as long as you don't look

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.760 
shorts I think as long as you don't look
too<00:01:17.310> much<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:18.210> behind<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.880> he<00:01:21.360> has<00:01:21.770> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
too much from behind and then he has the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.460 
too much from behind and then he has the
long<00:01:22.979> sleeve<00:01:23.310> shirt<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.210> uniform<00:01:24.810> and

long sleeve shirt for the uniform and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.719 
long sleeve shirt for the uniform and
then<00:01:25.619> he<00:01:25.860> has<00:01:25.979> Chewbacca<00:01:26.759> hands<00:01:27.710> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.920> from

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
then he has Chewbacca hands this is from

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
there are some taller minifigures out

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.190 
there are some taller minifigures out
there<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.700> guys<00:02:09.850> have<00:02:10.270> seen<00:02:10.690> my

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
there and if you guys have seen my

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.360 
there and if you guys have seen my
custom<00:02:11.980> pirate<00:02:12.940> video<00:02:13.770> he's<00:02:14.770> like<00:02:14.950> about<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
custom pirate video he's like about the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.250 
custom pirate video he's like about the
same<00:02:15.580> height<00:02:15.760> technically<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.750> that's<00:02:17.140> just

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
same height technically so that's just

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.870 
same height technically so that's just
interesting<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.070> put<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:19.410> proportion<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:21.490> yeah

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
interesting to put in proportion so yeah

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.780 
interesting to put in proportion so yeah
and<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.380> pose<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.860> legs<00:02:24.070> differently

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and you can pose the legs differently

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.210 
and you can pose the legs differently
which<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.180> really<00:02:25.420> cool<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:26.709> love<00:02:27.010> how

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
which is really cool and I just love how

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.760 
which is really cool and I just love how
I<00:02:27.250> did<00:02:27.550> on<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.240> legs<00:02:28.480> because<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:29.140> was<00:02:29.380> very

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
I did on the legs because that was very

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.440 
I did on the legs because that was very
difficult<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.520> figure<00:02:30.730> out<00:02:30.880> how<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.150> was<00:02:31.270> going

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
difficult to figure out how I was going

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.350 
difficult to figure out how I was going
to<00:02:31.510> do<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.550> yeah<00:02:33.550> I<00:02:33.580> think<00:02:33.790> it's<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.209> great

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
to do that and yeah I think it's a great

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.600 
to do that and yeah I think it's a great
