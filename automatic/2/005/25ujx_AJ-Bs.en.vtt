00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
classes are there and at the beginning

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.730 
classes are there and at the beginning
we<00:01:04.030> had<00:01:04.150> at<00:01:04.269> least<00:01:04.300> a<00:01:04.780> dozen<00:01:05.080> character

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
classes that wouldn't do of course so we

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.950 
classes that wouldn't do of course so we
had<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.740> cut<00:01:08.920> down<00:01:09.159> to<00:01:09.460> five<00:01:09.940> we<00:01:10.600> have<00:01:10.780> the

character class has its own skills for

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.249 
character class has its own skills for
example<00:01:18.369> there<00:01:18.759> are<00:01:18.790> three<00:01:19.060> skill<00:01:19.479> trees<00:01:19.780> for

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
every single character class when

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.209 
every single character class when
designing<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.540> character<00:01:22.990> classes<00:01:23.500> we

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
designing the character classes we

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.520 
designing the character classes we
wanted<00:01:24.909> that<00:01:25.090> every<00:01:25.479> class<00:01:25.719> should<00:01:26.110> have<00:01:26.320> his

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
wanted that every class should have his

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.539 
wanted that every class should have his
own<00:01:26.619> role<00:01:26.950> in<00:01:27.189> combat<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.719> strengths<00:01:29.140> in

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
own role in combat and the strengths in

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.090 
own role in combat and the strengths in
solo<00:01:30.549> mode<00:01:30.719> so<00:01:31.719> basically<00:01:32.079> the<00:01:32.469> Nomad<00:01:32.770> is<00:01:33.040> a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
solo mode so basically the Nomad is a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.399 
solo mode so basically the Nomad is a
very<00:01:33.909> good<00:01:34.060> at<00:01:34.210> solo<00:01:34.450> because<00:01:34.689> he<00:01:35.079> can<00:01:35.229> have

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
very good at solo because he can have

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.190 
very good at solo because he can have
pets<00:01:35.680> but<00:01:36.579> in<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.789> group<00:01:37.000> he<00:01:37.719> is<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.840> very<00:01:38.049> skilled
