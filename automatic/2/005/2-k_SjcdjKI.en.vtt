00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.450
 yes good at the end to all the powers 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.920
 like to play more than more than training 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.360
 Well I think you have to value in your 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.270
 Fair measure is so colorful but not 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.000
 comes well to catch sensations and the 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.529
 habit of making goals and going 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.869
 winning games and all that the player 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.520
 it's good for you not at the end we've been 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.320
 working then aspects especially 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.090
 offensive during the week but one 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.489
 we are still we are very green and 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.469
 Well, I think the second time 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.230
 yes we have been better than the first 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.579
 we have had more dynamism and good I 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.350
 I think we've done things better 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.030
 but good as I told you before there is 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.519
 assess is just measure 'well a little 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.929
 what are these friendly in the account 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.929
 the opponent that we had opposite also 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.780
 well at the end I do not know I think what 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.280
 we take more as a session not and already 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.199
 the matches will come the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.449
 already the importance will come 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.050
 the nerves will come a little bit and 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.699
 all that I do not give is part of 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.559
 preseason it is not clear that it is a 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.810
 important player and that's why he has gone 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.360
 where he has gone and they have paid what what 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.590
 have paid for one 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.080
 I think we have a broad template 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.720
 we have prepared games to give 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.010
 one step forward and well we do not 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.900
 We forget to clean up and think about the future 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.930
 in the end we have to value do not know 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.060
 also that we want other competitions 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.150
 I think we have people there for one 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.590
 we also have people that last year 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.450
 well, he did not have much 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.100
 continuity, not because, above all, 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.710
 injuries then good we will value everything 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.360
 that but it is also true that we trust 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.010
 in the people that we have the midfield and 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.050
 As I said before, I think that 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.300
 are trained to take a step 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.220
 to the front if, as I said before, 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.390
 final has gone to Real Madrid and have 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.130
 paid that because he is a player 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.590
 important we will not deny it and it comes to 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.570
 make a great season but good yo 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.790
 I trust the people that we have, I think 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.210
 that the strength of this team is in the 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.369
 group and I'm sure that the people who act on 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.649
 come in that position for sure that what 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.210
 will do well well well was the first 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.119
 time we do it on the day it touched me 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.679
 also but but good is different I 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.070
 I think they have spent other years with 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.930
 another with another perspective and the truth 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.640
 what exciting exciting we know that 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.970
 it's a friendly match but 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.110
 happy I think that the matches of 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.340
 preseason at the end are 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.620
 since the first game 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.240
 preseason and it's normal that good 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.550
 we had arrived with legs 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.990
 There has also been a heavy burden of 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.720
 I work during the week and with sessions 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.180
 doubles and in the end that's that's the end 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.400
 of the preseason games for that 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.530
 we are going to have time for the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.660
 lighter pieces and I think today 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.180
 we have done very well yes 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.890
 because today you will ask me yes yes it is 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.000
 true that is no longer by society 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.400
 but well I think you have to live it 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.709
 tail with the same naturalness at the end 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.260
 there are every year there are casualties there are high and 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.580
 transfers of transfers and we have to 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.580
 live as such
