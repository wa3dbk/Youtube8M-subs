way you can imagine where the need for

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.000 
way you can imagine where the need for
anesthesia<00:02:15.180> may<00:02:15.480> come<00:02:15.720> into<00:02:15.870> play<00:02:15.959> there<00:02:16.860> may

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
anesthesia may come into play there may

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.130 
anesthesia may come into play there may
be<00:02:17.040> an<00:02:17.340> opportunity<00:02:17.880> for<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.209> CEO<00:02:18.480> or<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:19.050> a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
be an opportunity for a CEO or in a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.220 
be an opportunity for a CEO or in a
position<00:02:19.650> at<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.950> facility<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.780> lot<00:02:22.110> of

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
position at that facility so a lot of

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.820 
position at that facility so a lot of
opportunities<00:02:22.860> there<00:02:24.650> they're<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> little

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
opportunities there they're a little

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.600 
opportunities there they're a little
more<00:02:25.980> cost<00:02:26.310> efficient<00:02:26.910> because<00:02:28.099> they<00:02:29.099> don't

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
more cost efficient because they don't

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.210 
more cost efficient because they don't
cost<00:02:29.880> quite<00:02:30.150> as<00:02:30.300> much<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.660> say<00:02:30.959> an

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
cost quite as much as say an

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.140 
cost quite as much as say an
anesthesiologist<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:32.760> they're<00:02:32.880> kind<00:02:33.090> of

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
anesthesiologist and so they're kind of

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.990 
anesthesiologist and so they're kind of
like<00:02:33.269> an<00:02:33.450> in-between<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.190> again<00:02:35.459> it's<00:02:35.910> a

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
like an in-between and so again it's a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.339 
like an in-between and so again it's a
popular<00:02:36.390> career<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.019> starting<00:02:37.319> to

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
popular career and it's starting to

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.199 
popular career and it's starting to
become<00:02:37.440> more<00:02:37.800> popular<00:02:39.860> also<00:02:40.860> some<00:02:41.400> CRNAs<00:02:41.970> work

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
become more popular also some CRNAs work

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.970 
become more popular also some CRNAs work

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
anesthesia services in some cases they

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.309 
anesthesia services in some cases they
may<00:02:47.130> offer<00:02:47.280> more<00:02:48.000> salaries<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.900> maybe<00:02:49.200> a

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
may offer more salaries and maybe a

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.809 
may offer more salaries and maybe a
little<00:02:49.440> bit<00:02:49.560> more<00:02:49.739> lucrative<00:02:49.980> if<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.580> do<00:02:50.700> it

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
little bit more lucrative if you do it

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.690 
little bit more lucrative if you do it
that<00:02:50.940> way<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.530> if<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.709> work<00:02:53.040> for<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> for-profit
