00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hi everyone, everything good today, the makeup goes 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.620
 be inspired in the winter I bought the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.050
 actor recently from mec este es mails 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.110
 and I wanted to do a makeup with my mouth 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.389
 everything and I look nothing and it's perfect needing 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.020
 winter and I hope you like it let's go 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.420
 start the first study to be published 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.220
 eyelashes and eyelashes are easier 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.260
 apply because they are half of the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.269
 year out only if you do not have this 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.039
 seal you can cut your 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.039
 normal in the middle also works 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.450
 while waiting for the eyelashes and Karen I go 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.100
 base and let's see if I said 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.050
 berenice which is matte base 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.600
 I think it's perfect for winter because 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.629
 She is not so remarkable so she has a 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.520
 a little bit of lighting, so I 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.290
 I think it moisturizes bm skin works 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.129
 well with me besides her has a great 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.500
 roof 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.110
 be careful not to pass on 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.190
 Top of the dossier bush so let's go 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.320
 be careful 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.460
 if Argentina was not to start the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.460
 circuses and just took off 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.840
 The next step is to apply a base one 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.670
 a little darker than my skin 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.500
 This is really a bikini and I'm going 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.740
 make an outline with it I go 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.729
 marking the entire outline of xexéo 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.300
 also from the nose and the chat below and 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.950
 also in the face of the corners because it will 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.030
 darken a little bit instead of using 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.880
 the powder 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.259
 I think in winter the skin gets very 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.270
 resected it is good to do this based 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.440
 now I'll get a corrective one 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.360
 a little clearer corrective 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.840
 illuminator and volume in the parts I 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.490
 I want them to be the finest and most beautiful 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.380
 I will now take a fábio is 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.509
 I 'm small and I 'm only going to do this but everything 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.920
 care and pay attention also to the root 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.990
 hair that tends to stay with 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.640
 a little more base more 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.000
 concentrated and if you do not take 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.000
 ugly 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.490
 now I will look for active is that the studio 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.930
 mac the finish and I'll pass your eyes and 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.750
 I'll also apply some corrective 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.750
 illuminator just to give the finishing touch 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.970
 the next step is to get through the dust I want 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.670
 make the skin well matte so I'm going to take 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.050
 all the illumination of the skin that I want 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.250
 let her be well matted 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.010
 but if you liked your lightened skin 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.930
 You can use your lighted display but I 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.760
 I want to do something else today. 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.800
 one thing I never do then price 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.840
 the steel powder will also go through 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.610
 down from the eyes to the positive 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.620
 knowing to be very pretty 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.170
 the next step now pass a shadow 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.900
 coffee brown with beveled brush only in 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.209
 part of the middle out of the eye just do 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.560
 a very light cat pull 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.660
 if you want to use a 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.790
 black eyeliner you can also hear 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.130
 a black shadow but I chose the shadow 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.959
 brown to stay a softer and 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.760
 you can use it everyday too. 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.760
 because I want an almost nothing eye 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.000
 I 'll also use an umbrella 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.700
 vanilla in the inner corner of the eye 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.019
 this shadow a matte shadow is only for 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.420
 give a bright day in the eye but I 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.250
 I also want everything to be well matted. 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.610
 I'm going to use dabul eyelash mascara now 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.610
 Joa she retracts and she increases then I 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.650
 I'll use the long part will lengthen the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.329
 eyelashes and I will also use 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.290
 twisting to make eyelash volume 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.290
 shortly thereafter 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.510
 I'm going to wear eyebrow pencil now. 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.310
 dunga who says berenice I'll fill in 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.750
 only the little folds of my eyebrow have not 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.770
 I also want to score a lot 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.450
 but if you want to mark your 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.710
 eyebrow you can also 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.720
 do whatever you want 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.490
 and this pencil also has a side that is 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.380
 nude and I'll pass it is low 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.460
 eyebrow to illuminate and 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.890
 raise your eyebrow now to the 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.010
 blush I'm going to use this one from the eudora he se 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.250
 calls pitt jeans and I'm not mistaken and I 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.600
 I will play in all cheekbones 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.520
 to be very soft, I do not want to 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.770
 Nothing much marked, people have to be well. 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.410
 soft because the button is all understood 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.120
 so the eye skin has it all this 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.120
 bird not to become too heavy 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.850
 and last button and if button is called 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.560
 is brown or gray mec and magnify fire 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.140
 I will use it very carefully because 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.720
 that lipstick for being a dark lipstick it 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.700
 you're wrong it's very noticeable then 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.380
 have to be careful if you want 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.240
 use a pencil or a 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.630
 Mouth to do it you can because I 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.230
 I think it goes even better 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.230
 the mistakes 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.669
 the final profit stayed so i loved it 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.949
 I love it, I love it. 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.210
 It is a perfect lipstick for winter and 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.580
