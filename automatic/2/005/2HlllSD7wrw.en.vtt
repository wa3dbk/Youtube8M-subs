 with that authors 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.800
 I am satisfied that some guides Marco Rotaru 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.590
 and as more everything is supposed to be layered among each other or dances 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.410
 Tüpker starters were great emotions, the good god organ game has history 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.590
 Nature decided that and then percent justice or discipline 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.770

 we are running good evening percent 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.170
 Windecker Schande told Reber very contentedly 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.390
 The first appearance of feel Arthur and his team want the less 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.810
 satisfied 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 from the second appearance 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 I do not want to excuse the players because 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.950
 To play Karen Bass you saw that percent 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.150
 if it is not so 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.080
 as we all wish 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.630
 then percent has been tried 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.770
 a strong opponent and celebrities 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.920
 around 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.780
 a strength team in this region 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.680
 for one percent 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.010
 who have made some confusion 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.080
 in the team around 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 de is getting away 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.740
 I'll just say that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.360
 it is scary fresh »will be an ice age the players 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.360
 be lubricated and become it 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.659
 more disabled in use tips in every Merchant of Football League games 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.319
 and on Sunday the biggest game of the season is under 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.470
 Son Heiner Klö's missing Hunte said that 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.899
 4 if that's always that 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:32.099
 do a good job and they make me mate Suser 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.899
 Wesels are incredibly frustrating and become 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:37.919
 I take that so we lasted 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.629
 then percent she must say with bigger be good cross 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.760
 South Denmark's Seagulls defender Pepe himself early enough in this ethical 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.179
 that is very balanced and expensive 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.839
 if you can borrow percent and 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:54.859
 give his teammates since then this is just the way and then 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:55.949
 perhaps 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.589
 there it is my shorts maybe the way we get there too 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:06.169
 so exercise training so choice there was no treatment woman today in the 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.419
 Game whistled again and again under 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.809
 I think this is not the right way among them 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.219
 not saying that we did not hinder the last three wins 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.359
 we treated the same way 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.489
 b the Danish team I do not think so 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:25.229
 that's something to me 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.599
 want to see 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.809
 as I said we have 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:31.039
 are happy about the three points 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.709
 I came 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.189
 the last 30 minutes to it is not our best performance in Vienna anything 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.589
 already mentioned, every point is worth the gold 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:41.309
 The Wegener will take the points with you 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:43.669
 on Sunday 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.189
 that wipes internet 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:47.889
 Thank you for a long time 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.889
 there are inquiries from the present colleagues Dr 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.019
 the question if the video is something and Brigitte Müller 5 minutes 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:06.679
 since I also saw the television editorial 9 percent 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.889
 I thought that percent 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.349
 that's back in it was wanted to have Kettemer both where 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.109
 the referee on the penalty bench why watch 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.689
 under the halt said 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:20.689
 the disk was not in there 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.409
 the referee was flawless and has also recognized this very well place 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.599
 about it 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.389
 also the notorious Kölner 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.430
 Media landscape do not ask me a question 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.450
 With that we stay with the two coaches in Cologne in Kutenhausen way 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.870
 on Sunday in Hannover and then the next home game on 16 in the second 

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:52.679
 the international break against Wolfsburg is a good time and chips
