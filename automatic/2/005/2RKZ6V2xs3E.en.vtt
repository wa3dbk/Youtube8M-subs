00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.060 

I<00:00:22.789> think<00:00:23.510> those<00:00:23.660> are<00:00:23.779> ring<00:00:24.020> and<00:00:24.320> strap<00:00:24.710> surfing

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
I think those are ring and strap surfing

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.830 
I think those are ring and strap surfing
is<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.340> lot<00:00:25.550> different<00:00:25.699> than<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:26.570> normal

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
is a lot different than the normal

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.019 
is a lot different than the normal
paddling<00:00:27.259> trip<00:00:27.500> especially<00:00:27.710> when<00:00:28.369> you<00:00:28.490> get

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
paddling trip especially when you get

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.200 
paddling trip especially when you get
into<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.420> larger<00:00:29.599> wedge<00:00:29.930> but<00:00:30.230> but<00:00:30.590> definitely

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
into the larger wedge but but definitely

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.790 
into the larger wedge but but definitely
definitely<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:32.599> in<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:32.870> small<00:00:33.140> waves<00:00:33.379> also

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
definitely so in the small waves also

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.250 
definitely so in the small waves also
and<00:00:34.129> that<00:00:35.000> you're<00:00:35.120> riding<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.629> wave

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
and that you're riding the wave

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.920 
and that you're riding the wave
you<00:00:36.800> know<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:37.360> potentially<00:00:38.360> got<00:00:38.540> four<00:00:38.809> or

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
you know you potentially got four or

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.880 
you know you potentially got four or
five<00:00:38.960> turns<00:00:39.440> under<00:00:39.769> your<00:00:39.890> belt<00:00:40.129> before

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
five turns under your belt before

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.810 
five turns under your belt before
somebody<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.040> would<00:00:43.129> be<00:00:43.250> paddle<00:00:43.610> surfing

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
somebody that would be paddle surfing

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.900 
somebody that would be paddle surfing
would<00:00:44.330> be<00:00:44.480> taking<00:00:44.839> off<00:00:45.040> you<00:00:46.040> know<00:00:46.220> that's<00:00:46.519> a

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
would be taking off you know that's a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.670 
would be taking off you know that's a
pretty<00:00:47.239> obvious<00:00:47.690> advantage<00:00:48.170> right<00:00:48.350> there

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
pretty obvious advantage right there

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.500 
pretty obvious advantage right there
then<00:00:49.100> you<00:00:49.280> throw<00:00:49.610> in<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:49.820> fact<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:50.329> you're

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
then you throw in the fact that you're

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.930 
then you throw in the fact that you're
connected<00:00:51.079> and<00:00:51.370> anywhere<00:00:52.370> you<00:00:52.430> go<00:00:52.760> the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
connected and anywhere you go the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.610 
connected and anywhere you go the
board's<00:00:53.180> gonna<00:00:53.390> follow<00:00:53.629> so<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.140> can<00:00:54.350> start

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
board's gonna follow so you can start

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.010 
board's gonna follow so you can start
jumping<00:00:54.980> off<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:55.280> lip<00:00:55.489> above<00:00:56.149> it<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:56.930> know

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
jumping off the lip above it you know

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.529 
jumping off the lip above it you know
beyond<00:00:57.410> it

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
beyond it

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.110 
beyond it
somersault<00:01:00.280> basically<00:01:01.280> snowboarding<00:01:02.000> you

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
somersault basically snowboarding you

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.630 
somersault basically snowboarding you
know<00:01:02.210> whatever<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:03.260> kind<00:01:03.949> of<00:01:04.009> create<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:04.520> your

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
know whatever you kind of create in your

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.940 
know whatever you kind of create in your
mind<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:05.720> potentials<00:01:06.289> there<00:01:06.500> because<00:01:06.830> the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
mind the potentials there because the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:18.039 
mind the potentials there because the
board<00:01:07.160> is<00:01:07.250> going<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.430> be<00:01:07.550> there<00:01:07.700> with<00:01:07.880> you

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.990 

filling<00:01:18.680> Kelly<00:01:20.380> it's<00:01:21.380> pretty<00:01:21.619> easy<00:01:21.770> yeah<00:01:22.490> he's

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
filling Kelly it's pretty easy yeah he's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.020 
filling Kelly it's pretty easy yeah he's
he's<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.020> did<00:01:24.259> it<00:01:24.380> wave<00:01:24.560> judgment<00:01:25.159> in<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.909> way

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
he's so did it wave judgment in the way

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.710 
he's so did it wave judgment in the way
he<00:01:26.240> works<00:01:26.479> for<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:26.780> driver<00:01:27.049> it's<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.070> real<00:01:28.720> real

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
he works for the driver it's a real real

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.210 
he works for the driver it's a real real
kind<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.049> team<00:01:30.259> thing<00:01:30.500> if<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.710> got<00:01:30.860> somebody

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
kind of team thing if you got somebody

kind of team thing if you got somebody
at<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.430> end<00:01:31.490> of<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.670> rope<00:01:31.820> that<00:01:32.000> knows<00:01:32.240> how<00:01:32.450> to

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
at the end of the rope that knows how to

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.630 
at the end of the rope that knows how to
work<00:01:32.720> with<00:01:32.899> you<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:33.710> can<00:01:33.920> really<00:01:34.399> take

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
work with you you can really take

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.190 
work with you you can really take
advantage<00:01:34.670> of<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.270> team<00:01:35.600> working<00:01:35.810> and

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
advantage of that team working and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.279 
advantage of that team working and
broaden<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.770> scope<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:38.060> where<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.899> can<00:01:39.080> put

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
broaden the scope of where you can put

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.590 
broaden the scope of where you can put
the<00:01:39.470> surfer<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.039> what<00:01:40.220> he<00:01:40.399> can<00:01:40.610> do<00:01:40.880> once<00:01:41.450> he

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
the surfer and what he can do once he

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.830 
the surfer and what he can do once he
releases<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.289> rope<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.850> so<00:01:43.850> having<00:01:44.570> someone

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
releases the rope and so having someone

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.219 
releases the rope and so having someone
experienced<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:46.000> knows<00:01:47.000> how<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.330> judge<00:01:48.200> the

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
experienced and knows how to judge the

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.609 
experienced and knows how to judge the
waves<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:49.039> ride<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.939> pry<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.690> -<00:01:50.990> prior<00:01:51.319> to<00:01:51.530> it

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
waves and ride it pry it - prior to it

breaking<00:01:52.069> is<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:53.770> sort<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.979> good<00:01:55.640> skill<00:01:55.909> to

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
breaking is a sort of a good skill to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.480 
breaking is a sort of a good skill to
have<00:01:56.500> there<00:01:57.500> was<00:01:57.619> lots<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:57.920> sets<00:01:58.130> coming<00:01:58.399> in

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
have there was lots of sets coming in

there's a blast it was just really hard
to<00:02:22.920> line<00:02:23.099> up<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.909> need<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.060> big<00:02:24.330> board<00:02:24.569> I

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
to line up and you need a big board I

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.360 
to line up and you need a big board I
mean<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> real<00:02:25.260> Hawaii<00:02:25.890> sorta<00:02:26.250> way

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
mean it's like a real Hawaii sorta way

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.850 
mean it's like a real Hawaii sorta way
but<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.700> really<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.239> frames<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.840> got<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.830> a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
but it really a frames and got like a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.080 
but it really a frames and got like a
built-in<00:02:29.989> deep<00:02:30.989> water<00:02:31.230> wave<00:02:31.500> meal<00:02:31.890> too

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090
