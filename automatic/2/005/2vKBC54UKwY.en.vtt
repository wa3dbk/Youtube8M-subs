a contest which we call a hackathon the
hackathon<00:02:05.909> basically<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.780> an<00:02:07.049> application

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
hackathon basically is an application

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.430 
hackathon basically is an application
development<00:02:08.129> process<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
development process and the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.710 
development process and the
students<00:02:11.100> from<00:02:11.280> plano<00:02:11.700> east<00:02:11.880> were<00:02:12.270> victorious

object of this competition was to create
an<00:02:19.410> application<00:02:20.190> for<00:02:21.090> smartphones<00:02:21.210> that

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
an application for smartphones that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.630 
an application for smartphones that
would<00:02:22.020> help<00:02:22.170> high<00:02:22.890> school<00:02:23.160> students<00:02:23.550> to

would help high school students to
graduate<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:24.660> created<00:02:24.870> an<00:02:25.140> app<00:02:25.320> called<00:02:25.800> ocular

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
graduate we created an app called ocular

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.480 
graduate we created an app called ocular
and<00:02:27.080> what<00:02:28.080> ocular<00:02:28.440> enabled<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> do<00:02:29.070> was

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
and what ocular enabled you to do was

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.820 
and what ocular enabled you to do was
take<00:02:29.940> pictures<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.390> equations<00:02:31.350> like<00:02:31.560> a

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
take pictures of equations like a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.650 
take pictures of equations like a
student<00:02:32.340> might<00:02:32.490> encounter<00:02:32.820> in<00:02:33.180> their<00:02:33.330> studies

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
student might encounter in their studies

student might encounter in their studies
but<00:02:34.470> they<00:02:34.590> didn't<00:02:34.830> understand<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:36.360> would

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
but they didn't understand and it would

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.200 
but they didn't understand and it would
tell<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.860> students<00:02:38.280> how<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.490> solve<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.000> kind

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
tell the students how to solve that kind

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.360 
tell the students how to solve that kind
of<00:02:39.270> problem<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.230> today<00:02:40.680> when<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.100> had<00:02:41.250> an

of problem so today when we had an

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.550 
of problem so today when we had an
opportunity<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.880> bring<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.330> no<00:02:42.780> texting<00:02:43.410> and

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
opportunity to bring the no texting and

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.790 
opportunity to bring the no texting and
driving<00:02:43.770> simulator<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.670> can<00:02:44.880> wait<00:02:45.060> program<00:02:45.990> to

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
driving simulator it can wait program to

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.920 
driving simulator it can wait program to
the<00:02:47.040> plano<00:02:47.280> Independent<00:02:47.820> School<00:02:48.030> District<00:02:48.510> it

the plano Independent School District it
was<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.140> natural<00:02:49.620> choice<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:50.160> choose<00:02:50.430> plano

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
was a natural choice to choose plano

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.060 
was a natural choice to choose plano
east<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.540> honor<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.380> students<00:02:52.770> who<00:02:52.890> won

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
the hackathon texting and driving is not

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.120 
the hackathon texting and driving is not
a<00:02:56.250> good<00:02:56.460> idea<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.970> i<00:02:57.870> think<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.620> because<00:02:58.980> we

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
a good idea and i think that because we

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.860 
a good idea and i think that because we
enabled<00:02:59.490> them<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.640> come<00:03:00.150> present<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.660> to

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
enabled them to come present that to

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.170 
enabled them to come present that to
this<00:03:01.350> high<00:03:01.620> school<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:02.100> lot<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.520> people<00:03:02.790> will

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
this high school a lot of people will

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.390 
this high school a lot of people will
have<00:03:03.960> their<00:03:03.990> opinions<00:03:04.530> changed<00:03:04.950> on<00:03:05.070> texting

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
have their opinions changed on texting

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.560 
have their opinions changed on texting
and<00:03:05.550> driving<00:03:05.730> i<00:03:06.000> think<00:03:06.270> it'll<00:03:06.390> make<00:03:06.510> a

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
and driving i think it'll make a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.630 
and driving i think it'll make a
positive<00:03:06.750> impact
