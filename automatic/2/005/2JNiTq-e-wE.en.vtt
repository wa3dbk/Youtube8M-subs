probably much different than what I seem
to<00:00:25.930> be<00:00:27.870> seems<00:00:28.870> like<00:00:29.140> maybe<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:31.000> distinction

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
to be seems like maybe the distinction

between reality and fiction could be

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.590 
between reality and fiction could be
difficult<00:00:34.780> for<00:00:35.289> you<00:00:35.699> at<00:00:36.699> least<00:00:36.910> I<00:00:37.089> was<00:00:37.269> honest

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
difficult for you at least I was honest

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.099 
difficult for you at least I was honest
to<00:00:37.809> how<00:00:37.929> I<00:00:37.960> felt<00:00:38.440> I<00:00:38.859> didn't<00:00:39.280> pretend<00:00:39.969> I<00:00:40.480> was<00:00:40.780> me

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109
