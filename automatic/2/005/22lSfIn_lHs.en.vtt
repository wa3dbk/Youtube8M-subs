phantom which is a very popular multi
rotor<00:00:20.529> and<00:00:20.830> they're<00:00:21.759> both<00:00:21.880> in<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.060> same<00:00:22.119> class

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
rotor and they're both in the same class

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.720 
rotor and they're both in the same class
and<00:00:23.020> now<00:00:23.259> they've<00:00:23.500> cost<00:00:23.830> about<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.040> same<00:00:24.130> but

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
and now they've cost about the same but

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.019 
and now they've cost about the same but
let's<00:00:24.880> have<00:00:24.939> a<00:00:25.029> look<00:00:25.060> this<00:00:25.330> is<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:26.039> DJI<00:00:27.039> unit

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
let's have a look this is the DJI unit

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.940 
let's have a look this is the DJI unit
and<00:00:28.329> look<00:00:28.869> at<00:00:28.989> the<00:00:29.110> neatness<00:00:29.590> of<00:00:29.829> that

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
and look at the neatness of that

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.650 
and look at the neatness of that
soldiering<00:00:30.399> there<00:00:30.550> see<00:00:30.700> how<00:00:30.849> the<00:00:30.910> you<00:00:31.419> know<00:00:31.540> as

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
soldiering there see how the you know as

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.000 
soldiering there see how the you know as
I<00:00:31.779> mentioned<00:00:32.079> before<00:00:32.169> there's<00:00:32.500> no<00:00:32.619> extraneous

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
I mentioned before there's no extraneous

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.340 
I mentioned before there's no extraneous
wire<00:00:33.550> hanging<00:00:33.940> off<00:00:34.059> there<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:34.510> there's<00:00:35.140> nice

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
wire hanging off there and there's nice

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.979 
wire hanging off there and there's nice
bright<00:00:35.710> balls<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.399> solder<00:00:36.850> it's<00:00:37.390> it's<00:00:37.719> really

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
bright balls of solder it's it's really

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.200 
bright balls of solder it's it's really
quite<00:00:38.320> nice<00:00:38.559> and<00:00:38.800> down<00:00:38.920> here<00:00:39.280> we're<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.030> lead

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
quite nice and down here we're the lead

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.270 
quite nice and down here we're the lead
to<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.570> receiver<00:00:41.320> goes<00:00:41.530> off<00:00:41.680> this<00:00:41.800> this<00:00:42.070> is<00:00:42.190> an

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
to the receiver goes off this this is an

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.220 
to the receiver goes off this this is an
ESC<00:00:42.520> this<00:00:42.820> is<00:00:42.940> where<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.120> receiver<00:00:43.930> Lee<00:00:44.050> goes

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
ESC this is where the receiver Lee goes

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.840 
ESC this is where the receiver Lee goes
I<00:00:44.260> thought<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:44.590> put<00:00:44.740> silicon<00:00:45.100> on<00:00:45.220> there<00:00:45.370> to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
I thought that put silicon on there to

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.310 
I thought that put silicon on there to
support<00:00:46.150> the<00:00:46.300> wires<00:00:46.540> so<00:00:46.840> they're<00:00:46.990> not<00:00:47.110> going

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
support the wires so they're not going

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.250 
support the wires so they're not going
to<00:00:47.910> suffer<00:00:48.910> from<00:00:49.060> vibration<00:00:49.630> and<00:00:49.750> fracture

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
to suffer from vibration and fracture

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.470 
to suffer from vibration and fracture
and<00:00:50.410> stress<00:00:50.800> and<00:00:50.980> things<00:00:51.100> I<00:00:51.340> mean<00:00:51.670> that<00:00:52.300> is

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
and stress and things I mean that is

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.060 
and stress and things I mean that is
just<00:00:52.510> brilliant<00:00:52.990> that's<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.560> way<00:00:53.740> it<00:00:54.010> should

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
just brilliant that's the way it should

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.520 
just brilliant that's the way it should
look<00:00:54.310> and<00:00:54.850> again<00:00:55.750> on<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.020> main<00:00:56.260> power

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
look and again on the main power

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.160 
look and again on the main power
distribution<00:00:57.310> board<00:00:57.579> we<00:00:58.090> can<00:00:58.239> see<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.570> no

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
distribution board we can see that no

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.990 
distribution board we can see that no
again<00:00:59.470> the<00:00:59.680> soldering<00:01:00.130> here<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.460> really<00:01:00.670> good

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
again the soldering here is really good

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
again the soldering here is really good
there's<00:01:01.210> nice<00:01:01.360> bright<00:01:01.690> that<00:01:01.900> the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
there's nice bright that the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.330 
there's nice bright that the
installation<00:01:02.320> comes<00:01:02.680> right<00:01:02.950> up<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.220> the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
installation comes right up to the

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.609 
installation comes right up to the
solder<00:01:03.670> ball<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.420> it's<00:01:04.570> nice<00:01:04.720> bright<00:01:05.140> solder

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
solder ball and it's nice bright solder

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.649 
solder ball and it's nice bright solder
and<00:01:05.890> it's<00:01:06.159> it's<00:01:06.579> not<00:01:06.640> there's<00:01:07.000> not<00:01:07.119> miss

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
and it's it's not there's not miss

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:08.969 
and it's it's not there's not miss
everywhere<00:01:08.079> there's<00:01:08.229> no<00:01:08.320> little<00:01:08.500> jagged

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
everywhere there's no little jagged

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.289 
everywhere there's no little jagged
edges<00:01:09.100> poking<00:01:09.549> out<00:01:09.640> because<00:01:09.759> I've<00:01:09.880> overheated

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
edges poking out because I've overheated

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.929 
edges poking out because I've overheated
the<00:01:10.509> solder<00:01:10.990> it's<00:01:11.530> it's<00:01:12.100> really<00:01:12.399> quite<00:01:12.729> good

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
the solder it's it's really quite good

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.599 
the solder it's it's really quite good
and<00:01:13.090> again<00:01:13.360> down<00:01:13.689> here<00:01:13.750> some<00:01:14.409> silicon<00:01:14.920> to

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
and again down here some silicon to

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.160 
and again down here some silicon to
protect<00:01:15.999> the<00:01:16.090> wire<00:01:16.270> from<00:01:16.539> bending<00:01:17.079> and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
protect the wire from bending and

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.660 
protect the wire from bending and
stretching<00:01:17.439> and<00:01:17.740> causing<00:01:18.189> the<00:01:18.280> soldering

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
stretching and causing the soldering

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.209 
stretching and causing the soldering
joints<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:19.090> break<00:01:19.270> off<00:01:19.420> there<00:01:19.600> I<00:01:20.259> mean<00:01:20.950> this<00:01:21.039> is

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
joints to break off there I mean this is

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.679 
joints to break off there I mean this is
this<00:01:21.399> is<00:01:21.460> quality<00:01:21.969> stuff<00:01:22.179> this<00:01:22.299> is<00:01:22.450> what<00:01:22.600> you

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
this is quality stuff this is what you

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.349 
this is quality stuff this is what you
would<00:01:22.780> expect<00:01:23.229> from<00:01:23.829> a<00:01:24.159> unit<00:01:24.909> that's<00:01:25.060> costing

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
would expect from a unit that's costing

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.539 
would expect from a unit that's costing
several<00:01:25.569> hundred<00:01:26.200> dollars<00:01:26.649> other<00:01:27.249> nice

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
several hundred dollars other nice

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.330 
several hundred dollars other nice
touches<00:01:27.759> this<00:01:28.689> capacitor<00:01:29.229> here<00:01:29.469> has<00:01:30.189> got

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
touches this capacitor here has got

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.919 
touches this capacitor here has got
silicon<00:01:30.969> holding<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.359> to<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.479> board's<00:01:31.810> has

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
silicon holding it to the board's has

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.379 
silicon holding it to the board's has
not<00:01:32.079> simply<00:01:32.530> held<00:01:32.859> up<00:01:33.009> by<00:01:33.189> its<00:01:33.340> leads<00:01:33.670> which

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:34.389 
not simply held up by its leads which

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:36.629 
not simply held up by its leads which
would<00:01:34.749> cause<00:01:34.959> it<00:01:35.079> to<00:01:35.109> fray<00:01:35.469> and<00:01:35.709> you<00:01:36.549> know

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:36.639 
would cause it to fray and you know

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:38.099 
would cause it to fray and you know
vibration<00:01:37.389> would<00:01:37.509> cause<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.840> leads<00:01:38.020> just

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
vibration would cause the leads just

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.510 
vibration would cause the leads just
flicks<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:38.889> would<00:01:39.009> stress<00:01:39.310> and

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
flicks and that would stress and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.459 
flicks and that would stress and
eventually<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:40.420> break<00:01:40.659> so<00:01:40.869> they<00:01:41.259> put

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
eventually that break so they put

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.529 
eventually that break so they put
silicon<00:01:41.859> leader<00:01:42.039> hold<00:01:42.279> it<00:01:42.399> on<00:01:42.520> that's<00:01:43.119> very

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
silicon leader hold it on that's very

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.099 
silicon leader hold it on that's very
very<00:01:43.779> good

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
very good

indeed<00:02:05.979> I'm<00:02:06.509> really<00:02:07.509> happy<00:02:07.659> with<00:02:07.779> that<00:02:07.929> I've

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
indeed I'm really happy with that I've

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.870 
indeed I'm really happy with that I've
been<00:02:08.200> much<00:02:08.440> happier<00:02:08.830> with<00:02:08.920> one<00:02:09.099> of<00:02:09.220> these<00:02:09.340> then

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
been much happier with one of these then

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.010 
been much happier with one of these then
they<00:02:10.000> will<00:02:10.149> cure<00:02:10.390> when<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.599> comes<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.899> the

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
they will cure when it comes to the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.400 
they will cure when it comes to the
quality<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.819> construction<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.630> guess<00:02:13.840> you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
quality of construction and I guess you

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.280 
quality of construction and I guess you
know<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:16.090> Q<00:02:16.900> rx350<00:02:17.620> was<00:02:17.980> touted<00:02:18.459> as<00:02:18.580> a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
know the Q rx350 was touted as a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.979 
know the Q rx350 was touted as a
competitor<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.939> DJI<00:02:22.329> system<00:02:22.840> but

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
competitor to the to the DJI system but

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.910 
competitor to the to the DJI system but
really<00:02:23.349> when<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.560> comes<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.890> quality<00:02:24.069> the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
really when it comes to quality the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.070 
really when it comes to quality the
is<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.310> no<00:02:25.580> comparison<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.569> I<00:02:26.630> notice<00:02:26.900> here

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
is just no comparison and I notice here

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.559 
is just no comparison and I notice here
even<00:02:27.349> we've<00:02:28.040> got<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> little<00:02:28.490> silver<00:02:29.150> connector

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
even we've got a little silver connector

even we've got a little silver connector
going<00:02:30.050> on<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.290> wood<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:30.530> put<00:02:30.680> silicone

going on to the wood they put silicone

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.440 
going on to the wood they put silicone

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
just to hold that stop that falling off

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.089 
just to hold that stop that falling off
these<00:02:33.140> are<00:02:33.290> little<00:02:33.440> things<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.739> mean<00:02:33.950> you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
can fly you craft without having to

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.699 
can fly you craft without having to
worry<00:02:35.660> about<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.900> falling<00:02:36.170> out<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.590> sky

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
worry about it falling out of the sky

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.160 
worry about it falling out of the sky
because<00:02:37.459> something's<00:02:37.940> been<00:02:38.120> done<00:02:38.420> wrong<00:02:38.780> I

supposed to be a review of the DJI

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.790 
supposed to be a review of the DJI
product<00:02:43.970> but<00:02:44.450> it's<00:02:44.569> pretty<00:02:44.810> easy<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.319> see<00:02:45.620> from

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
product but it's pretty easy to see from

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.640 
product but it's pretty easy to see from
this<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.640> DJI<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.390> streets<00:02:48.050> ahead<00:02:48.319> of

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
this that the DJI is streets ahead of

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.009 
this that the DJI is streets ahead of
the<00:02:49.310> wall<00:02:49.459> Kira<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.940> terms<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.330> its<00:02:50.450> quality<00:02:50.989> of

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
the wall Kira in terms of its quality of

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.070 
the wall Kira in terms of its quality of
construction<00:02:51.319> so<00:02:52.280> yeah<00:02:52.670> thumbs<00:02:52.940> up<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.300> DJI

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
construction so yeah thumbs up to DJI

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.160 
construction so yeah thumbs up to DJI
and<00:02:54.650> as<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:55.610> said<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.880> other<00:02:55.940> day<00:02:56.090> not<00:02:56.959> good

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
and as I said the other day not good

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.780 
and as I said the other day not good
enough<00:02:57.350> for<00:02:57.410> Kira<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.400> for<00:02:58.550> those<00:02:58.640> who

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
enough for Kira and for those who

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.240 
enough for Kira and for those who
haven't<00:02:59.000> seen<00:02:59.060> inside<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.600> DJI<00:03:00.110> naza<00:03:00.560> DJI

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
haven't seen inside the DJI naza DJI

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
phantom before this is what they look

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.150 
phantom before this is what they look
like<00:03:02.930> this<00:03:03.319> is<00:03:03.470> what's<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.739> them<00:03:03.860> there's<00:03:04.040> the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
like this is what's in them there's the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.699 
like this is what's in them there's the
the<00:03:04.610> Nezzer<00:03:04.850> controller<00:03:05.360> unit<00:03:05.600> you've<00:03:06.560> got

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
the Nezzer controller unit you've got

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.320 
the Nezzer controller unit you've got
your<00:03:06.860> power<00:03:07.010> distribution<00:03:07.370> board<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.030> got<00:03:08.180> an

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
your power distribution board you got an

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.270 
your power distribution board you got an
ESC<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:09.110> each<00:03:09.230> motor<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.739> get<00:03:09.860> your<00:03:09.980> motors

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
ESC for each motor you get your motors

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.070 
ESC for each motor you get your motors
and<00:03:10.549> it's<00:03:10.700> all<00:03:10.850> pretty<00:03:11.120> basic<00:03:11.330> stuff<00:03:11.720> it's

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
and it's all pretty basic stuff it's

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.170 
and it's all pretty basic stuff it's
very<00:03:12.230> similar<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.700> wolf<00:03:13.880> here<00:03:14.150> I

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
very similar to the to the wolf here I

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.670 
very similar to the to the wolf here I
mean<00:03:14.330> you<00:03:14.420> can't<00:03:14.630> really<00:03:14.750> change<00:03:15.019> much<00:03:15.410> and

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
mean you can't really change much and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.830 
mean you can't really change much and
here's<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.160> little<00:03:16.340> thing<00:03:16.700> it's<00:03:16.850> got<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.120> GPS

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
here's the little thing it's got the GPS

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.380 
here's the little thing it's got the GPS
up<00:03:18.319> here<00:03:18.709> on<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.920> roof<00:03:19.069> just<00:03:19.130> like<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.730> qrx

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
up here on the roof just like the qrx

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.390 
up here on the roof just like the qrx
doesn't<00:03:20.690> have<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> copper<00:03:21.080> shield<00:03:21.319> over<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.680> but

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
doesn't have a copper shield over it but

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.490 
doesn't have a copper shield over it but
obviously<00:03:23.060> doesn't<00:03:23.600> seem<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.900> need<00:03:24.080> it<00:03:24.140> that's

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
obviously doesn't seem to need it that's

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.979 
obviously doesn't seem to need it that's
just<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:25.310> lid<00:03:25.549> of<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.790> Phantom<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.069> yeah

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
just the lid of the Phantom so yeah

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.569 
just the lid of the Phantom so yeah
really<00:03:29.989> good<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:30.530> think<00:03:30.739> well<00:03:30.859> Kira<00:03:31.100> they're

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
really good you think well Kira they're

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.789 
really good you think well Kira they're
gonna<00:03:31.700> copy<00:03:32.329> a<00:03:32.450> basic<00:03:32.900> layout<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:33.680> things

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
gonna copy a basic layout and things

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.440 
gonna copy a basic layout and things
they<00:03:34.280> could<00:03:34.400> have<00:03:34.519> improved<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:35.060> instead<00:03:35.359> of

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
they could have improved on instead of

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.569 
they could have improved on instead of
making<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.720> worse<00:03:36.010> here's<00:03:37.010> something<00:03:37.430> rather

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
making it worse here's something rather

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.610 
making it worse here's something rather
interesting<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:39.019> wall<00:03:39.170> Kira<00:03:39.380> has<00:03:39.590> a

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
interesting the the wall Kira has a

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.610 
interesting the the wall Kira has a
dimension<00:03:40.370> 7<00:03:41.329> channel<00:03:41.660> wall<00:03:41.840> now<00:03:42.260> many<00:03:42.380> chance

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
dimension 7 channel wall now many chance

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.960 
dimension 7 channel wall now many chance
but<00:03:42.739> it's<00:03:42.829> got<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:42.950> receiver<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.730> comes<00:03:43.880> in

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
but it's got a receiver and it comes in

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.080 
but it's got a receiver and it comes in
a<00:03:44.030> box<00:03:44.180> with<00:03:44.390> arrows<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:44.720> things<00:03:44.780> this<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
a box with arrows and things this is the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.490 
a box with arrows and things this is the
Phantom<00:03:47.090> receiver<00:03:47.660> it's<00:03:47.989> just<00:03:48.140> this<00:03:48.230> little

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
Phantom receiver it's just this little

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.620 
Phantom receiver it's just this little
board<00:03:48.680> here<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.940> antenna<00:03:50.269> runs<00:03:50.480> off<00:03:50.600> the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
board here and the antenna runs off the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.800 
board here and the antenna runs off the
side<00:03:50.989> over<00:03:51.620> here<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.269> so<00:03:53.269> they'd<00:03:53.540> have<00:03:53.570> any

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
side over here and so they'd have any

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.880 
side over here and so they'd have any
bother<00:03:54.019> putting<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.350> in<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.500> case<00:03:54.650> it's<00:03:54.829> just

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
bother putting it in the case it's just

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.170 
bother putting it in the case it's just
a<00:03:55.070> little<00:03:55.100> board<00:03:55.459> that<00:03:55.579> screws<00:03:55.820> onto<00:03:56.000> the

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
a little board that screws onto the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.420 
a little board that screws onto the
thing<00:03:56.329> oh<00:03:56.799> there's<00:03:57.799> no<00:03:57.920> need<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.130> put<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.370> in

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
thing oh there's no need to put it in

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.800 
thing oh there's no need to put it in
the<00:03:58.489> case<00:03:58.670> on<00:03:58.790> us<00:03:58.910> inside<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.390> hole<00:03:59.540> you<00:03:59.690> know

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
the case on us inside the hole you know

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.470 
the case on us inside the hole you know
and<00:04:00.019> if<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:01.010> get<00:04:01.310> one<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.459> these<00:04:01.670> it's<00:04:02.329> pretty

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
and if you get one of these it's pretty

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.300 
and if you get one of these it's pretty
obvious<00:04:03.200> that<00:04:03.230> it's<00:04:03.890> got<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:05.890> ccpm<00:04:06.890> output<00:04:07.190> here

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
obvious that it's got a ccpm output here

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.979 
obvious that it's got a ccpm output here
CPM<00:04:07.760> up<00:04:07.880> or<00:04:08.000> whatever<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.329> know<00:04:08.420> multiplexed

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
CPM up or whatever you know multiplexed

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.170 
CPM up or whatever you know multiplexed
only<00:04:09.500> one<00:04:09.650> lead<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:10.670> goes<00:04:10.850> from<00:04:11.030> the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
only one lead that goes from the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.660 
only one lead that goes from the
receiver<00:04:11.299> over<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:12.170> controller<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:13.430> if

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
receiver over to the controller so if

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.069 
receiver over to the controller so if
you've<00:04:13.790> got<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:14.030> receive<00:04:14.569> them<00:04:14.780> Freescale

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
you've got to receive them Freescale

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.509 
you've got to receive them Freescale
make<00:04:15.410> them<00:04:15.560> if<00:04:15.859> you<00:04:15.950> could<00:04:16.010> another<00:04:16.220> receiver

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
make them if you could another receiver

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.819 
make them if you could another receiver
that<00:04:16.700> has<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.570> same<00:04:17.810> kind<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.079> output<00:04:18.440> then

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
that has the same kind of output then

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.349 
that has the same kind of output then
yeah<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.459> could<00:04:19.609> probably<00:04:19.760> replace<00:04:20.180> that

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
yeah you could probably replace that

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.420 
yeah you could probably replace that
receiver<00:04:20.660> with<00:04:21.320> your<00:04:21.590> own<00:04:21.739> because<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.039> know<00:04:22.190> a

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
receiver with your own because I know a

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.100 
receiver with your own because I know a
lot<00:04:22.820> of<00:04:22.850> people<00:04:23.120> complain<00:04:23.479> that<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.690> range<00:04:23.900> on

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
lot of people complain that the range on

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.620 
lot of people complain that the range on
most<00:04:24.590> of<00:04:24.650> these<00:04:24.740> little<00:04:24.979> 350<00:04:25.400> size<00:04:25.610> really<00:04:26.479> do

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
most of these little 350 size really do

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.750 
most of these little 350 size really do
fly<00:04:26.810> multirotors<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.800> fairly<00:04:28.100> limited<00:04:28.490> I

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
fly multirotors is fairly limited I

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.640 
fly multirotors is fairly limited I
think<00:04:28.789> they<00:04:29.000> claimed<00:04:29.180> 300<00:04:29.720> meters<00:04:29.990> with<00:04:30.110> us<00:04:30.229> if

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
think they claimed 300 meters with us if

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.469 
think they claimed 300 meters with us if
you<00:04:30.770> go<00:04:30.950> with<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.250> free<00:04:31.430> sky<00:04:31.610> system<00:04:31.970> well<00:04:32.120> you

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
you go with the free sky system well you

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.790 
you go with the free sky system well you
know<00:04:32.600> it's<00:04:32.720> our<00:04:32.840> fly<00:04:33.110> nose<00:04:33.349> to<00:04:33.500> 2<00:04:33.650> kilometers

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
know it's our fly nose to 2 kilometers

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.050 
know it's our fly nose to 2 kilometers
with<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.340> standard<00:04:34.729> RF<00:04:35.000> system<00:04:35.360> and

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
with the standard RF system and

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.270 
with the standard RF system and
you<00:04:36.300> know<00:04:36.419> you<00:04:36.480> could<00:04:36.810> quite<00:04:37.380> greatly<00:04:37.919> extend

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
you know you could quite greatly extend

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.040 
you know you could quite greatly extend
the<00:04:38.370> range<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.850> your<00:04:38.940> little<00:04:39.150> helicopter<00:04:39.690> it

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
the range of your little helicopter it

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.180 
the range of your little helicopter it
looks<00:04:40.169> like<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.410> would<00:04:40.470> be<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.590> fairly<00:04:40.830> easy<00:04:40.950> job

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
looks like it would be a fairly easy job

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.670 
looks like it would be a fairly easy job
maybe<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:42.150> project<00:04:42.990> sometime<00:04:43.410> in<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.560> future

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
maybe a project sometime in the future

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.590 
maybe a project sometime in the future
and<00:04:43.919> I've<00:04:43.980> caught<00:04:44.130> up<00:04:44.280> is<00:04:44.430> to<00:04:44.970> put<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.240> free<00:04:45.389> sky

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
and I've caught up is to put a free sky

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.409 
and I've caught up is to put a free sky
receiver<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.700> Phantom<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:48.030> just<00:04:48.270> see

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
receiver and the Phantom and just see

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.450 
receiver and the Phantom and just see
how<00:04:48.540> much<00:04:48.870> different<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.320> is<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:50.130> for<00:04:50.310> those

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
how much different it is and for those

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.400 
how much different it is and for those
wanting<00:04:50.730> to<00:04:51.030> know<00:04:51.210> where<00:04:51.510> part<00:04:51.870> two<00:04:52.110> of<00:04:52.139> the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
wanting to know where part two of the
