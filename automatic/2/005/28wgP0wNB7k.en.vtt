00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.110

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.520
 sachet of optional coloring seasoning is 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.050
 so good what I'm going to do first is 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.490
 cut and remove all the fat to 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.700
 our meat 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:48.680
 and wash it very well 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:53.510
 well here is where I live I find now 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.290
 in this package for vegetable broth and 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.720
 that's what I buy 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.680
 but you can put the amount 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.129
 of vegetables that you prefer 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.240
 here I am I have pre washed the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.350
 vegetable 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.350
 and prepared 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:19.060
 in a large pot we put water 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.290
 comment and we will add the meat 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.290
 together with an onion 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.080
 after half an hour 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.170
 we are going to add 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.159
 corn, yucca and chopped tomatoes 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.000
 and a little salt 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:50.980
 but first we are going to remove everything 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.600
 what releases the broth as well as 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.120
 that is a myth the fat 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.310
 everything you can 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.950
 good 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.960
 after that we add to it what it is 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.210
 the corn 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.210
 and the yucca and the tomato 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.240
 and a little salt 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.950
 this broth is usually also 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:58.160
 put taro if they find in it but 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.710
 As I did not find here, do not use it 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.010
 well already after it has passed a 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.280
 We are not going to add all the rest 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.860
 of the vegetables minus the zucchini 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.100
 zucchini we're going to leave it like this for the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.100
 latest 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.530
 water is added if they see that they need more 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.530
 Water 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.260
 we put 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.060
 a little bit of cilantro not all the bunch 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.060
 but a little bit more than cilantro 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.280
 already here you have the heat cooking a 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.010
 hour 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.010
 This broth lasts two hours to get to know each other 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.190
 Since it's strong, it's been an hour and 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.790
 mean she is when we are going to put the 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.790
 zucchini 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.949
 the coloring season if you like 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.050
 and salt 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.629
 and there you can check if you 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.629
 lack more salt or not 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:09.620
 well after two hours we check 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:15.280
 our flesh is soft 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.280
 and if it's soft, it's ready 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:29.919
 well I served it I accompanied it with a 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:37.139
 white rice to the broth I put onion 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:37.139
 chopped and chopped cilantro and a lemon quoted 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.120
