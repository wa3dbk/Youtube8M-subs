 they have become part of the landscape 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.049
 from the coast of nigeria dozens of 

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:08.880
 gigantic ships stranded and sunk 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.970
 abandoned to their luck throughout 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.710
 850 kilometers of the coastline the lack of 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.780
 legislation and maritime surveillance 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.330
 make many owners take advantage 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.519
 they find it very economical to abandon their 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.349
 boats in Nigerian waters and save 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.349
 the scrapping costs and taxes 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.719
 many of these boats belonged in 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.519
 your day to organizations dedicated to 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.350
 Banker business and activity 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.820
 habitual clandestine in nigeria that 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.100
 consists of the theft and contraband of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.960
 oil the biggest problem they cause 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.820
 these ships scattered along the coast 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.750
 is the erosion and destruction of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.719
 beaches no longer depend on vast 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.780
 including rudin men online so is 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.780
 how it started shape inland 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 Y 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.990
 the old rusted hulls of ships 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.760
 they have become a refuge for thieves 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.680
 and pirates who arrive for the prized 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.960
 skeleton constituted by thousands of 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.000
 tons of steel the beaches of nigeria 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.000
 they are no longer safe places to bathe 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.700
 the biggest 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.860
 fact 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.869
 some ships carry only about 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.610
 other days are piling up since 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.860
 decades already converted into boats 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.869
 ghosts but still constitute a 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.869
 invisible threat although very real 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.680
 a greenpeace activist has 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.810
 overflown in hang glider with motor the

 google nuclear power plant to 30 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.619
 kilometers of Lyon and has managed to locate 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.140
 above the dome of one of the 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.060
 there reactors of the power station there has launched 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.950
 a can of smoke and landed in one 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.050
 of the courtyards of the complex before being 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.030
 stopped greenpeace says this 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.069
 demonstrates the vulnerability of 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.750
 French nuclear weapons in the face of an attack or 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.880
 plane crash although the company 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.980
 owner has said that what she has done 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.720
 greenpeace has not been dangerous 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.720
 of security for the facilities 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.519
 the rate at which the population grows 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.500
 world together with the rhythm of consumption we 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.660
 leads to an economic catastrophe and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.620
 environmental that conclusion of the report that 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.629
 last night presented at the un 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.360
 a group of 23 scientists led by 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.580
 the Nobel Laureate John Sulston Soft 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.680
 to avoid them measure that the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.690
 world consumption in favor of the most 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.510
 poor and that programs are strengthened 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.250
 of family planning say that 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.140
 courageous politicians are needed 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.150
 dare to demand rich countries that 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.610
 consume less so that the poor 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.650
 can consume more and warn that 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.780
 if we do not achieve that sustainable economy 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.880
 the risk of social catastrophes 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.769
 economic and environmental are 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.549
 will multiply on a scale never before 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.549
 imagined 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.930
 21st century urban landscape overcrowding 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.870
 shanty town and chaos city swarm city

 Without limits' is river but also Jakarta 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.730
 or lakes examples of what life is like the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.099
 megalopolis this further development 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.560
 economic the greatest cultural development 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.180
 the maximum of economic opportunities and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.760
 of work but at the same time 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.370
 In parallel we find ourselves with 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.200
 huge shanty areas of people who 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.989
 they are living an existence 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.640
 really painful asphalt labyrinths 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.040
 futuristic and tangles of jams 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.900
 multitudinous until here do not reach us 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.630
 and noise or pollution but almost 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.370
 we could feel the smell of it total city 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.500
 is the sample that we can see from today 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.840
 in the ivam in valencia and that invites us 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.540
 to reflect on the day to day on 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.640
 the everyday in a mega city where the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.069
 adding individuals and loneliness accent 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.230
 social where black and white are played and 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.140
 where they are trapped and feeling free is 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.720
 possible between cities are a place 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.510
 of freedom for millions of people 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.770
 and massive migrations of rural people 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.510
 to the cities 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.400
 many people will do issues 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.470
 economic is true well there are many 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.470
 people who do it for studies by 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.240
 Aspects for the desire for freedom cities 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.220
 that mold us and transform us 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.530
 they force to adapt the way of being of 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.810
 exist to relate to space 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.590
 to look for ourselves 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.590
 to find us 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.599
 an advance with tons of remains of what 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.520
 that devastated the tsunami approaches the 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:44.860
