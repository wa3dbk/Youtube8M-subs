on<00:01:54.399> their<00:01:54.610> school<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.920> these<00:01:56.920> ones<00:01:57.189> tend<00:01:57.430> to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
on their school and these ones tend to

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.300 
on their school and these ones tend to
use<00:01:57.610> more<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.180> heart<00:01:59.049> attachments<00:01:59.710> but

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
use more of the heart attachments but

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.889 
use more of the heart attachments but
like<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.640> said<00:02:00.759> they're<00:02:00.939> both<00:02:01.149> pretty<00:02:01.450> good<00:02:01.539> and

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
like I said they're both pretty good and

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.740 
like I said they're both pretty good and
the<00:02:02.649> video<00:02:02.860> quality<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.430> GoPro<00:02:04.090> Hero<00:02:04.119> 2<00:02:04.450> has

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
the video quality the GoPro Hero 2 has

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.859 
the video quality the GoPro Hero 2 has
somewhat<00:02:05.740> better<00:02:05.890> Valente<00:02:06.520> well<00:02:07.270> actually<00:02:07.570> is

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
somewhat better Valente well actually is

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.600 
somewhat better Valente well actually is
a<00:02:08.080> lot<00:02:08.200> better<00:02:08.380> video<00:02:08.649> quality<00:02:08.800> but<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.369> Saabs

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
a lot better video quality but the Saabs

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.290 
a lot better video quality but the Saabs
18<00:02:09.940> low<00:02:10.390> camera<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:10.959> this<00:02:11.950> one<00:02:12.130> was<00:02:12.280> like<00:02:12.400> 720p

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
18 low camera so this one was like 720p

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.729 
18 low camera so this one was like 720p
footage<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.780> noticed<00:02:14.110> there's<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.349> little<00:02:14.560> at

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
footage I noticed there's a little at

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.770 
footage I noticed there's a little at
least<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.160> first<00:02:15.610> gen<00:02:15.910> because<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.420> second

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
least the first gen because the second

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.600 
least the first gen because the second
gen<00:02:16.930> ones<00:02:17.170> don't<00:02:17.860> seem<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.160> have<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.370> problem

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
gen ones don't seem to have this problem

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.949 
gen ones don't seem to have this problem
but<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.819> first<00:02:19.090> gen<00:02:19.300> seems<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.720> have<00:02:19.810> some

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
but the first gen seems to have some

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.520 
but the first gen seems to have some
issues<00:02:20.140> with<00:02:20.500> lighting<00:02:21.400> especially<00:02:21.610> indoors

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
issues with lighting especially indoors

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.680 
issues with lighting especially indoors
but<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:24.190> way<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.370> use<00:02:24.760> these<00:02:25.000> two<00:02:25.239> is<00:02:25.510> I'll

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
but the way I use these two is I'll

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.600 
but the way I use these two is I'll
usually<00:02:25.810> put<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:26.230> on<00:02:26.410> my<00:02:26.530> head<00:02:26.739> or<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.459> my

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
usually put this on my head or on my

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.430 
usually put this on my head or on my
helmet<00:02:27.819> because<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:29.080> night<00:02:29.260> vision

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
about not gonna just click in there

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.100 
about not gonna just click in there
which<00:02:30.819> is<00:02:30.940> great<00:02:31.150> for<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.480> cuz<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.780> same<00:02:31.959> one

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
which is great for this cuz the same one

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.780 
which is great for this cuz the same one
I<00:02:32.140> used<00:02:32.440> for<00:02:32.709> when<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.040> was<00:02:33.160> qualifying<00:02:33.610> at<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.910 
I used for when I was qualifying at the
range<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.630> this<00:02:34.870> one<00:02:35.110> I'll<00:02:35.319> actually<00:02:35.680> attach

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
range and this one I'll actually attach

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.280 
range and this one I'll actually attach
the<00:02:36.130> weapon<00:02:36.459> now<00:02:36.760> some<00:02:37.510> guys<00:02:37.690> they'll<00:02:38.049> do<00:02:38.200> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
the weapon now some guys they'll do the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.960 
the weapon now some guys they'll do the
gum<00:02:38.500> gun<00:02:38.920> cam<00:02:39.160> footage<00:02:39.370> where<00:02:39.640> they<00:02:39.700> put<00:02:39.910> it

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
gum gun cam footage where they put it

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.300 
gum gun cam footage where they put it
along<00:02:40.390> with<00:02:40.599> barrel<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.930> gun<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.380> would

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
along with barrel to gun I would

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.930 
along with barrel to gun I would
recommend<00:02:43.410> either<00:02:44.410> doing<00:02:44.860> one<00:02:45.370> was<00:02:45.640> looking

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
recommend either doing one was looking

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.069 
recommend either doing one was looking
down<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.180> scope<00:02:46.420> because<00:02:46.630> some<00:02:46.840> people

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
down the scope because some people

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.720 
down the scope because some people
configure<00:02:47.530> well<00:02:47.769> some<00:02:48.010> people<00:02:48.130> figured<00:02:48.489> I<00:02:48.579> had

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
configure well some people figured I had

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.009 
configure well some people figured I had
to<00:02:48.819> do<00:02:48.880> they<00:02:48.970> have<00:02:49.090> cameras<00:02:49.569> like<00:02:49.780> there's

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
to do they have cameras like there's

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.120 
to do they have cameras like there's
something<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.290> guess<00:02:50.470> there's<00:02:50.650> some<00:02:50.769> versions

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
something I guess there's some versions

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.940 
something I guess there's some versions
the<00:02:51.190> GoPros<00:02:51.579> it's<00:02:51.760> right<00:02:52.030> behind<00:02:52.209> optic<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
the GoPros it's right behind optic and

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.860 
the GoPros it's right behind optic and
but<00:02:54.610> what<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:54.970> would<00:02:55.090> kind<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.450> recommend

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
but what I would kind of recommend

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.420 
but what I would kind of recommend
though<00:02:55.989> is<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.200> have<00:02:56.349> it<00:02:56.470> facing<00:02:56.860> because

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
though is you have it facing because

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.949 
though is you have it facing because
what<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.700> notice<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.180> if<00:02:58.299> you<00:02:58.420> haven't<00:02:58.780> saw<00:02:58.900> the

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
what I notice is if you haven't saw the

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.470 
what I notice is if you haven't saw the
barrel<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.380> gun<00:02:59.459> it's<00:03:00.459> not<00:03:00.549> as<00:03:00.790> dynamic<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
barrel of a gun it's not as dynamic the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.360 
barrel of a gun it's not as dynamic the
most<00:03:01.690> dynamic<00:03:01.900> shots<00:03:02.350> really<00:03:02.680> get<00:03:02.920> over<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
most dynamic shots really get over the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.190 
most dynamic shots really get over the
shoulder<00:03:03.760> or<00:03:03.790> on<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.329> head<00:03:04.510> well<00:03:05.019> when<00:03:05.140> you

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
shoulder or on the head well when you

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.990 
shoulder or on the head well when you
have<00:03:05.350> this<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.799> gun<00:03:06.040> it's<00:03:06.430> like<00:03:06.579> on<00:03:06.790> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
have this on the gun it's like on the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.759 
have this on the gun it's like on the
barrel<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.450> get<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.840> lot<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.350> looking

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
barrel you get a lot of that looking

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.009 
barrel you get a lot of that looking
into<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:09.100> dirt<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.639> just<00:03:09.880> kind<00:03:10.389> of<00:03:10.480> kind<00:03:10.900> of

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
into the dirt it just kind of kind of

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.949 
into the dirt it just kind of kind of
boring<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.530> if<00:03:12.430> you<00:03:12.880> do<00:03:13.000> have<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.150> camera<00:03:13.660> that

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
boring so if you do have a camera that

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.449 
boring so if you do have a camera that
you<00:03:14.170> want<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.440> put<00:03:14.530> on<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.709> gun<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:14.950> recommend

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
you want to put on the gun I recommend

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.879 
you want to put on the gun I recommend
it<00:03:15.609> have<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.239> facing<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:17.079> so<00:03:17.319> you<00:03:17.500> can<00:03:17.620> catch<00:03:17.829> a

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
it have it facing you so you can catch a

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.410 
it have it facing you so you can catch a
reaction<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.670> do<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.970> can<00:03:19.150> do<00:03:19.239> what<00:03:19.389> I

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
sometimes but like I said I really love

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.050 
sometimes but like I said I really love
both<00:03:44.500> cameras<00:03:45.040> they're<00:03:45.310> both<00:03:45.459> one<00:03:45.760> button

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
both cameras they're both one button

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.440 
both cameras they're both one button
press<00:03:46.239> both<00:03:46.750> charge<00:03:47.109> via<00:03:47.380> USB<00:03:47.889> it's<00:03:48.760> really

press both charge via USB it's really

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.059 
press both charge via USB it's really
simple<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.930> mean<00:03:50.079> there's<00:03:50.230> extended<00:03:50.739> battery

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
simple I mean there's extended battery

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.009 
simple I mean there's extended battery
packs<00:03:51.310> for<00:03:51.549> this<00:03:51.670> one<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.120> there's<00:03:52.359> like

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
packs for this one and there's like

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.479 
packs for this one and there's like
there's<00:03:53.260> tons<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.769> different<00:03:53.889> accessories

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
there's tons of different accessories

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.370 
there's tons of different accessories
and<00:03:54.639> they're<00:03:54.940> both<00:03:55.150> good<00:03:55.420> cameras<00:03:55.810> obviously

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
and they're both good cameras obviously

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.500 
and they're both good cameras obviously
when<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.340> comes<00:03:57.489> to<00:03:57.579> capturing<00:03:57.790> sound<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.450> think

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
when it comes to capturing sound I think

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.360 
when it comes to capturing sound I think
the<00:03:58.690> GoPro<00:03:59.079> captures<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.560> little<00:03:59.799> better<00:04:00.040> sound

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
the GoPro captures a little better sound

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.160 
the GoPro captures a little better sound
you<00:04:00.760> can

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
you can

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.110 
you can
change<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.650> back<00:04:02.340> housing<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:02.910> main

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
change that back housing of the main

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.700 
change that back housing of the main
little<00:04:03.450> protective<00:04:03.900> thing<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.170> got<00:04:04.319> here<00:04:04.350> so

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
little protective thing you got here so

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.680 
little protective thing you got here so
it<00:04:04.830> captures<00:04:05.100> better<00:04:05.490> sound<00:04:05.819> that<00:04:06.569> it

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
it captures better sound that it

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.690 
it captures better sound that it
normally<00:04:07.020> does<00:04:07.200> but<00:04:07.470> like<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.069> said<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.430> one

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
normally does but like I said this one

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.960 
normally does but like I said this one
is<00:04:08.910> more<00:04:09.750> or<00:04:09.840> less<00:04:09.990> for<00:04:10.350> discreet<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.580> know<00:04:11.640> or

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
is more or less for discreet you know or

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.910 
is more or less for discreet you know or
like<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.480> said<00:04:12.660> if<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.930> want<00:04:13.200> attach<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.650> gun

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
like I said if you want attach to a gun

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.260 
like I said if you want attach to a gun
that's<00:04:14.130> perfect<00:04:14.459> cause<00:04:14.550> it's<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:14.819> damn<00:04:14.850> small

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
that's perfect cause it's so damn small

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.150 
that's perfect cause it's so damn small
look<00:04:15.510> at<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:15.660> size<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.170> tack<00:04:16.380> light<00:04:16.620> this

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
look at the size of the tack light this

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.860 
look at the size of the tack light this
is<00:04:17.310> obviously<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.790> mean<00:04:18.030> it's<00:04:18.390> still<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.630> pretty

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
is obviously I mean it's still a pretty

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.449 
is obviously I mean it's still a pretty
small<00:04:18.989> camera<00:04:19.560> especially<00:04:19.829> when<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.220> take<00:04:20.340> it

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
small camera especially when you take it

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.860 
small camera especially when you take it
out<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:20.549> housing<00:04:20.910> but<00:04:20.940> typically<00:04:21.750> you're

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
out of housing but typically you're

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.720 
out of housing but typically you're
gonna<00:04:21.959> be<00:04:22.079> using<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.440> with<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.830> housing<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:23.460> I

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
gonna be using it with the housing so I

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.250 
gonna be using it with the housing so I
mean<00:04:24.030> if<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.210> want<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.510> talk<00:04:24.810> about<00:04:24.840> size

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
mean if you want to talk about size

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.800 
mean if you want to talk about size
really<00:04:25.770> I'm<00:04:25.950> talking<00:04:26.190> about<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.360> know<00:04:27.630> a

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
really I'm talking about so you know a

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.480 
really I'm talking about so you know a
little<00:04:28.050> bit<00:04:28.140> more<00:04:28.200> comparable<00:04:28.770> in<00:04:28.950> size<00:04:28.980> here

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
little bit more comparable in size here

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.490 
little bit more comparable in size here
the<00:04:29.790> GoPro<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.210> still<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.480> little<00:04:30.690> bigger<00:04:30.870> and

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
the GoPro is still a little bigger and

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.409 
the GoPro is still a little bigger and
its<00:04:31.680> profile<00:04:32.160> is<00:04:32.430> more<00:04:32.940> or<00:04:33.060> less<00:04:33.120> like<00:04:33.390> a

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
its profile is more or less like a

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.260 
its profile is more or less like a
traditional<00:04:34.220> camera<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.610> know<00:04:35.669> it's<00:04:36.060> not

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
traditional camera you know it's not

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.770 
traditional camera you know it's not
designed<00:04:37.220> quite<00:04:38.220> as<00:04:38.490> low<00:04:38.760> profile<00:04:39.240> as<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.450> so

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
designed quite as low profile as it so

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.510 
designed quite as low profile as it so
it<00:04:39.840> was<00:04:39.990> good<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:40.320> bad<00:04:40.410> about<00:04:40.860> both<00:04:41.100> they're

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
it was good and bad about both they're

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.280 
it was good and bad about both they're
both<00:04:41.550> very<00:04:42.150> good<00:04:42.270> cameras<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.169> would

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
both very good cameras and I would

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.640 
both very good cameras and I would
recommend<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.830> know<00:04:43.919> try<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.610> all<00:04:45.320> all<00:04:46.320> out

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
recommend you know try that all all out

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.880 
recommend you know try that all all out
and<00:04:47.360> if<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.540> get<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.780> contour<00:04:49.350> let<00:04:49.620> me<00:04:49.710> know

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
and if you get a contour let me know

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.470 
and if you get a contour let me know
it's<00:04:50.250> one<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.640> cameras<00:04:51.000> I've<00:04:51.120> been<00:04:51.270> trying

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
it's one of the cameras I've been trying

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.330 
it's one of the cameras I've been trying
to<00:04:51.540> look<00:04:51.660> at<00:04:51.840> getting<00:04:52.050> but<00:04:52.380> eventually<00:04:53.010> I'll

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
to look at getting but eventually I'll

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.430 
to look at getting but eventually I'll
probably<00:04:53.550> have<00:04:53.760> one<00:04:54.060> of<00:04:54.090> each<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.900> I'll<00:04:55.260> just

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
probably have one of each and I'll just

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.730 
probably have one of each and I'll just
be<00:04:55.590> making<00:04:56.070> all<00:04:56.340> my<00:04:56.370> videos<00:04:56.850> doing<00:04:57.740> different

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
be making all my videos doing different
