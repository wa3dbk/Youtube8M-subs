shading like when your skin is already

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980 
shading like when your skin is already
really<00:01:04.799> sensitive<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> keep<00:01:06.090> doing

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
really sensitive and then you keep doing

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.560 
really sensitive and then you keep doing
more<00:01:07.229> stuff<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.010> gets<00:01:08.360> even<00:01:09.360> more

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
more stuff to it it gets even more

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.090 
more stuff to it it gets even more
sensitive<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.619> felt<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.830> someone

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
sensitive like it just felt like someone

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.010 
sensitive like it just felt like someone
was<00:01:11.189> taking<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.520> knife<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.030> carving<00:01:12.840> into

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
was taking a knife and like carving into

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.190 
was taking a knife and like carving into
me<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.549> mean<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.240> think<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.840> worth<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
me but I mean I think that it's worth it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.429 
me but I mean I think that it's worth it
wasn't<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.799> too<00:01:17.040> unbearable<00:01:18.080> I'm<00:01:19.080> glad<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
wasn't like too unbearable I'm glad it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.230 
wasn't like too unbearable I'm glad it
only<00:01:19.560> took<00:01:19.740> two<00:01:19.890> hours<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.119> would<00:01:21.210> have

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
only took two hours if it would have

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.670 
only took two hours if it would have
taken<00:01:21.420> three<00:01:21.750> hours<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.110> probably<00:01:22.380> would<00:01:22.590> have

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
taken three hours I probably would have

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.850
