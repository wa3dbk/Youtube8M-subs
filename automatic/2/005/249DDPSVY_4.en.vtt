00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.640
 Know the chariot 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.060
 Launched in collaboration with Challenger Richard Cutland 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.180
 Mokbo Museum Collection 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.420
 Welcome everyone to come to a 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.400
 Very special place for people who love to watch a chariot 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.820
 The unique Mokbo Museum is located in Norfolk on the east coast of England. 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.240
 Show more than 150 vehicles, artillery and vehicles plus many other military displays 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.600
 The Mokbo Museum is Europe's largest private collection of arms collections 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.660
 In addition, this is the best place I have ever seen. 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.160
 This is a great place to watch a chariot. 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.360
 Because there are thousands of acres of unspoiled land all the way to the ocean. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.580
 Mokbo has a long history of armaments 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.760
 Once defended the East Coast of England against external attacks 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.020
 This area became a defensive front during World War I. 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.880
 Hundreds of troops are stationed here 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.960
 There are also many bunker turrets and trenches built here. 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.420
 In 1936 and during World War II 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.420
 It became an air defense artillery base. 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.900
 The purpose is to shoot down the German bomber 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.280
 The base did not stop function until 1958 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.780
 The most primitive World War II artillery bunker is still here 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.960
 The bunker has recently been restored and re-erected with 3.7 吋 anti-aircraft guns. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.200
 The effective range is up to 25,000 feet. There is also a Bofos 40 mm anti-aircraft gun. 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.360
 Before 1941, British Prime Minister Churchill visited the camp. 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.620
 I also love this because there is a lot of equipment. 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.940
 There are fighters and missiles 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.960
 And showcases a series of amazing military and stereo models 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.120
 There is also a huge collection of ammunition 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.400
 There are also many artillery here. 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.220
 The Mokbo Museum has the best in the world 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.600
 Most of the armored vehicles are still operational 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.540
 That is an excellent T34/85 chariot. 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.320
 This is the Grizzly chariot of the Sherman family. 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.900
 This is the M5 Stuart Chariot 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.320
 There is also M24 Chasing Chariot 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.240
 And this recently rehabilitated comet chariot (Comet) 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.440
 The restoration of the Churchill 7 is scheduled to take place next year. 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.720
 Next, in the three episodes of "Knowing the Chariot" 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.720
 We will learn more about the M5 Stuart Chariot. 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.620
 M24 Chariot Chariot 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.880
 And M47 and T-55 chariots 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.580
 Stay tuned
