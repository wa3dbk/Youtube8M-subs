00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
very taut molded here we have our bleach

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.230 
very taut molded here we have our bleach
dispenser<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.439> put<00:01:13.619> detergent

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
dispenser and when we put detergent

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.090 
dispenser and when we put detergent
right<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.049> water<00:01:16.259> passes<00:01:16.770> through<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
right in here so water passes through it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.700 
right in here so water passes through it
and<00:01:17.700> mixes<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.900> dispenses<00:01:19.470> straight

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and mixes it so it dispenses straight

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
and mixes it so it dispenses straight
into<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> bore<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:20.939> breaks<00:01:21.119> the
