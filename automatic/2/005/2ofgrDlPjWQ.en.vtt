rebooting<00:00:19.260> itself<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.890> didn't<00:00:20.039> think

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
rebooting itself and we didn't think

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.230 
rebooting itself and we didn't think
they'd<00:00:20.310> give<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.580> because<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.880> happened<00:00:21.180> like

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
they'd give it because it happened like

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.330 
they'd give it because it happened like
every<00:00:21.449> two<00:00:21.600> hours<00:00:21.900> then<00:00:22.619> today<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> guess<00:00:23.130> it's

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
look at over the weekend and on top of

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.860 
look at over the weekend and on top of
that<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.610> tried<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.969> down<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.270> Sony<00:00:42.510> Vegas<00:00:42.540> on

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
that we tried to down with Sony Vegas on

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.569 
that we tried to down with Sony Vegas on
our<00:00:42.989> laptop<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:43.950> not<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.460> an

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
our laptop but that's not really an

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
our laptop but that's not really an
option<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.390> usually<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> 55

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
option because we usually have a 55

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.080 
option because we usually have a 55
download<00:00:46.980> speed<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.430> yesterday<00:00:47.879> our

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
download speed but yesterday our

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090 
download speed but yesterday our
download<00:00:48.600> speed<00:00:48.840> went<00:00:48.989> down<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> 1<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
download speed went down to a 1 so it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.799 
download speed went down to a 1 so it
take<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.489> 5<00:00:50.879> hours<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.210> download<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.660> there'd

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
take like 5 hours to download so there'd

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.660 
take like 5 hours to download so there'd
be<00:00:51.870> no<00:00:52.020> way<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.289> could<00:00:52.410> edit<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.250> video<00:00:53.489> together

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
be no way we could edit a video together

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
be no way we could edit a video together
until<00:00:54.120> tomorrow<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.690> tomorrow<00:00:54.989> we'll<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.199> a
