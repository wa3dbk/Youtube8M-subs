00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.050 

and<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.259> honest<00:01:10.619> i<00:01:10.860> don't<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:11.909> i've

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and to be honest i don't think i've

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060 
and to be honest i don't think i've
actually<00:01:12.270> played<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.960> soccer<00:01:13.350> video<00:01:13.770> game

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
actually played a soccer video game

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.899 
actually played a soccer video game
since<00:01:14.549> FIFA<00:01:15.119> 96<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:16.440> so<00:01:16.860> loading<00:01:17.759> this

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
since FIFA 96 I think so loading this

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.300 
since FIFA 96 I think so loading this
one<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.330> definitely<00:01:19.080> took<00:01:19.259> me<00:01:19.470> back<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.220> was

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
one up definitely took me back and I was

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.100 
one up definitely took me back and I was
quickly<00:01:20.580> able<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.149> settle<00:01:21.420> into<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> gameplay

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
quickly able to settle into the gameplay

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.830 
quickly able to settle into the gameplay
with<00:01:22.740> more<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.430> focus<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:24.090> reaction<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
with more of a focus on reaction and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.680 
with more of a focus on reaction and
reflexes<00:01:25.590> than<00:01:25.880> simulation<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> strategy<00:01:29.690> so

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
reflexes than simulation and strategy so

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.539 
reflexes than simulation and strategy so
judging<00:01:31.200> from<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> menu<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.430> appear

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
judging from the menu there would appear

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.359 
judging from the menu there would appear
to<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.940> a<00:01:33.090> wide<00:01:33.450> variety<00:01:33.690> of<00:01:33.990> game<00:01:34.320> modes<00:01:34.649> but<00:01:35.310> I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
to be a wide variety of game modes but I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.029 
to be a wide variety of game modes but I
was<00:01:35.670> having<00:01:35.940> a<00:01:36.030> hard<00:01:36.210> time<00:01:36.240> reading<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.229> it

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
was having a hard time reading it so it

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.800 
was having a hard time reading it so it
couldn't<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.520> discern<00:01:38.909> between<00:01:39.119> them<00:01:39.570> I

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
couldn't really discern between them I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
couldn't really discern between them I
could<00:01:40.530> blame<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.190> small<00:01:41.460> screen<00:01:41.789> but

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
could blame it on the small screen but

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.200 
could blame it on the small screen but
maybe<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.110> my<00:01:43.409> lack<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> Japanese<00:01:44.819> reading

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
maybe it's my lack of Japanese reading

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.719 
maybe it's my lack of Japanese reading
comprehension<00:01:45.740> but<00:01:46.740> anyways<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.429> willing<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
comprehension but anyways I'm willing to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.910 
comprehension but anyways I'm willing to
bet<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.330> usual<00:01:48.479> choice<00:01:48.929> of<00:01:49.259> season<00:01:49.710> or

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
bet it's the usual choice of season or

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
bet it's the usual choice of season or
exhibition<00:01:50.280> play<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.509> would<00:01:51.630> seem<00:01:51.840> that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
exhibition play and it would seem that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.020 
exhibition play and it would seem that
there<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> save<00:01:52.920> your<00:01:53.100> game<00:01:53.280> there

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
there is a way to save your game there

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.850 
there is a way to save your game there

switching between the controllable team

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.120 
switching between the controllable team
members<00:02:17.930> seemed<00:02:18.260> pretty<00:02:18.470> random<00:02:18.950> at<00:02:19.100> times

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130

my sleeping goalie for some of that I
still<00:02:57.100> had<00:02:57.490> a<00:02:57.520> great<00:02:57.850> time<00:02:58.090> with<00:02:58.330> this<00:02:58.450> one<00:02:58.510> and
