00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.320
 Hello everyone at the microphone shock and if 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.830
 do you hear that mean on angry 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.190
 games 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.830
 mobile game reviews 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.869
 the subject of our release robots because 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.449
 that robots are a beak and I have two 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.640
 quite good games they are the first game it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.590
 continuation of one of the best kirov on 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.960
 mobile devices and pack 2 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.179
 unlike the same can for which was 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.669
 dull little more than fully here 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.489
 present and dynamics it Optic 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 elements and even suddenly the plot so 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.260
 let's get started in order let's start with 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.000
 Grafona as its predecessor ipad 2 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.250
 made on the engine unreal engine 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.320
 and on this engine everything is usually fine and with 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.230
 graphics and with physics and with optimization 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.820
 here also objects are drawn 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.160
 sufficiently detailed effects of explosions and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.710
 traces of flying shells looks bright 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.289
 colorful and the game is generally pleasing to the eye 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.340
 everything is done in such 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.710
 post-apocalyptic skyhigh style and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.840
 ruins and other misery here 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 side by side with shiny and new 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.909
 robots who by the way and staged 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.650
 the ruins which leads us to the plot we 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.439
 we play earnings whose name is 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.689
 actually and around is going wild 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.820
 ruin people whether already extinct whether 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.729
 very close to it and amidst all this 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.220
 fighting two armies of robots but we have 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.920
 pretty fabulous task to find and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.530
 save the princess who by the way man 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.290
 but the hell knows where she is and here for now 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.930
 looking for and both warring armies shoot 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.090
 and there are many more in it too 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.640
 what is happening but I will not spoil 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 now about the gameplay here, in principle, everything 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.290
 understandable high quality shooting gallery protagonist 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.630
 moves from cover to cover these 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.939
 displacement is controlled with wipe what 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.159
 quite simple and intuitive 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.380
 when we are behind cover in us not 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.659
 fall so you need to pick a moment 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.090
 to lean out and not get in the face 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.490
 attacks the robot of those enemies who were 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.509
 allocated in advance with the types of attacks 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.060
 also a few 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.820
 and there are the usual shots they are cool stacks 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.979
 pieces like a jetpack and grenades naturally 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.560
 the more cool thing you use 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.190
 the greater its cooldown way like 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.200
 quite diverse 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.240
 a lot they behave differently and 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.700
 Accordingly, you need to adjust to 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.950
 this is your tactic what else is cool 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.490
 quite a few mini bosses and at times 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.980
 climbs out 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.520
 and bosses are bigger that also diversifies 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.040
 gameplay 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.500
 In short, the game is quite interesting and 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.050
 playable she paid but donata 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.830
 pretty dynamic and there about robots and 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.710
 doomsday so advise 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.810
 the second game is called treasure and it is no longer 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.750
 about the robot warrior and about the robot assistant 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.970
 his name is oddly clarke and he 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.450
 helps other robots not to die 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.620
 from hunger without recharging the genre of this game 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.930
 a puzzle that is to be done 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.850
 a certain set is not always obvious 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.710
 Action to pass the level for 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.570
 example you need to put a cube on 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.730
 a button to open the door and so 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.140
 further here you and lasers and other 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.640
 charms without which it can not do 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.890
 similar puzzles 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.080
 the task is complicated by the fact that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.300
 clarke goes not one but further along 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.980
 some weakened robot then 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.959
 have to crank the same simplest 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.090
 operation with a cube and a button you need 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.620
 put the robot take the cube put the cube 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.020
 take the robot well do you understand 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.390
 movement for simplicity carried out 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.459
 how do you on the grid we choose which one 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.770
 side will turn the front of the clarke and 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.600
 this position is fixed regardless of 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.180
 driving directions self movement 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.850
 performed by joystick it's strictly 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.040
 on straight lines which is very convenient by the way 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.209
 but the main highlight of the game in my opinion 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.370
 is the graphics 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.230
 I generally rarely pay attention to 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.600
 graphics but here she is really very 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.550
 cool all done in such a bit 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.370
 cartoon style but at the same time 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.410
 gloomy gray and everywhere there are all pipes and 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.840
 iron is not surprising because around 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.820
 some robots and the whole picture pleases 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.390
 eye and complements the pleasure of 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.850
 gameplay 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.430
 sometimes by the way there are places that 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.290
 pass quite difficult and have to 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.989
 somewhere to think somewhere to show patience 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.600
 somewhere the reaction rate and somewhere and 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.120
 the other and the third will have to die immediately 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.730
 something which will have died from well, it often 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.070
 okay, so say the challenge to the player 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.810
 the most difficult that we have seen but still 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.269
 here are two games 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.169
 both beautiful opi in their own interesting and 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.210
 quality 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.850
 so choose what's more to your taste and 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.340
 play and we have everything with you today 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.850
 Fedor were shock and Nikolay Podgursky 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.850
 Yes soon
