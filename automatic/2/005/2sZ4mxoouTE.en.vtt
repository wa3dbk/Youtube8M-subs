you

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.770 

in<00:00:32.890> this<00:00:33.890> situation<00:00:34.700> we<00:00:35.149> are<00:00:35.180> assuming<00:00:35.600> that<00:00:35.660> a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
in this situation we are assuming that a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.310 
in this situation we are assuming that a
firefighter<00:00:36.050> has<00:00:36.680> fallen<00:00:36.949> to<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:37.640> floor

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
firefighter has fallen to the floor

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.660 
firefighter has fallen to the floor
obviously<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.500> floor<00:00:39.770> is<00:00:39.920> compromised<00:00:40.489> so

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
obviously the floor is compromised so

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.389 
obviously the floor is compromised so
sounding<00:00:41.120> would<00:00:41.269> be<00:00:41.420> necessary<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:43.100> next

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
sounding would be necessary the next

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.939 
sounding would be necessary the next
step<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:43.879> going<00:00:44.719> to<00:00:44.840> be<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.050> preparation<00:00:45.739> of

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
step is going to be the preparation of

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.819 
step is going to be the preparation of
the<00:00:46.370> rope<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.910> lower<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.660> rescuer<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:48.680> the

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
the rope to lower the rescuer to the
