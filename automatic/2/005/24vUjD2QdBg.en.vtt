older<00:01:14.880> again<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.250> reason<00:01:17.280> why<00:01:17.700> we're

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
older again so and the reason why we're

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.090 
older again so and the reason why we're
not<00:01:18.090> using<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.680> has<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
not using this one is because it has a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.969 
not using this one is because it has a
lot<00:01:20.400> more<00:01:20.430> complications<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.530> some<00:01:22.530> papers

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
lot more complications like some papers

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.770 
lot more complications like some papers
graphics<00:01:23.340> cards<00:01:23.700> doesn't<00:01:24.030> work<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
graphics cards doesn't work with it and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.350 
graphics cards doesn't work with it and
you<00:01:25.680> need<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.040> certain<00:01:26.400> texture<00:01:26.880> pack<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.270> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you need a certain texture pack so it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.580 
you need a certain texture pack so it
doesn't<00:01:27.600> work<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> texture<00:01:28.380> packs

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
doesn't work with of the texture packs

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.310 
doesn't work with of the texture packs
and<00:01:28.850> it's<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.060> lot<00:01:30.299> more<00:01:30.329> confusing<00:01:30.810> or<00:01:30.960> install

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and it's a lot more confusing or install

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.859 
and it's a lot more confusing or install
and<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.210> show<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.540> in

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and if you want I can show that in

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.450 
and if you want I can show that in
another<00:01:33.960> video<00:01:34.259> hood<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
another video hood but this is just the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
another video hood but this is just the
one<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.030> people<00:01:36.509> who<00:01:36.540> want<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> simple

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
once you've got all these folders you go

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.810 
once you've got all these folders you go
to<00:01:43.200> your<00:01:43.680> Minecraft<00:01:44.159> folder<00:01:44.310> I've<00:01:44.640> got<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
to your Minecraft folder I've got a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.020 
to your Minecraft folder I've got a
shortcut<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.360> I'll<00:01:45.780> look<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
shortcut here I'll look like this but to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.670 
shortcut here I'll look like this but to
get<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.360> unique<00:01:48.630> type<00:01:48.840> percent<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.560> then

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
get to that unique type percent and then

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.670 
get to that unique type percent and then
up<00:01:50.180> data<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:51.750> under<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> percent<00:01:52.500> sign

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
up data and then under the percent sign
