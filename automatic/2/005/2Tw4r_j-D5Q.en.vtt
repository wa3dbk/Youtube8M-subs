I mean that Joe Montana is on point the
throw<00:05:59.470> power<00:05:59.740> on<00:06:00.070> that<00:06:00.100> thing<00:06:00.490> it's<00:06:01.300> not

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
throw power on that thing it's not

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.790 
throw power on that thing it's not
really<00:06:01.780> that<00:06:01.900> well<00:06:02.139> it's<00:06:02.320> not<00:06:02.470> really<00:06:02.620> that

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
really that well it's not really that

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.000 
really that well it's not really that
good<00:06:03.120> but<00:06:04.120> at<00:06:04.419> the<00:06:04.540> same<00:06:04.720> time<00:06:04.960> he<00:06:05.590> gets<00:06:05.860> it

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
good but at the same time he gets it

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.710 
good but at the same time he gets it
then<00:06:06.190> you'll<00:06:06.340> put<00:06:06.550> it<00:06:06.669> on<00:06:06.880> the<00:06:07.090> spot<00:06:07.419> so<00:06:07.690> they

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
then you'll put it on the spot so they

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.719 
then you'll put it on the spot so they
were<00:06:07.870> super<00:06:08.169> to<00:06:08.260> get<00:06:08.410> it<00:06:08.530> so<00:06:09.070> these<00:06:09.310> that

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
were super to get it so these that

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.680 
were super to get it so these that
accuracy<00:06:10.240> makes<00:06:10.600> up<00:06:10.810> for<00:06:11.050> a<00:06:11.080> lot<00:06:11.140> of<00:06:11.350> it<00:06:11.620> but

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
accuracy makes up for a lot of it but

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.810
