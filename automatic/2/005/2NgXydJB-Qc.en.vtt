greater place of importance when it came

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.880 
greater place of importance when it came
to<00:02:23.380> his<00:02:24.380> miss

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to his miss

fortune and clamato Oh misfortune

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.260 
fortune and clamato Oh misfortune
despite<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.710> fact<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:27.950> despite<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:29.060> fact

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
despite the fact that despite the fact

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.740 
despite the fact that despite the fact
that<00:02:29.360> collapsed<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.230> Camacho<00:02:30.590> still<00:02:30.860> alive

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
that collapsed that Camacho still alive

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.520 
that collapsed that Camacho still alive
so<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:33.620> throws<00:02:33.830> me<00:02:34.010> off<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.430> really<00:02:34.580> does<00:02:35.530> but

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
so that throws me off it really does but

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.760 
so that throws me off it really does but
regardless<00:02:37.490> he<00:02:37.940> does<00:02:38.120> feel<00:02:38.360> something<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.709> I

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
regardless he does feel something but I

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.800 
regardless he does feel something but I
was<00:02:40.040> hoping<00:02:40.340> for<00:02:40.400> more<00:02:40.550> emotion<00:02:41.120> now<00:02:41.750> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
was hoping for more emotion now the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.470 
was hoping for more emotion now the
second<00:02:42.260> thing<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:43.520> apparently<00:02:43.970> he<00:02:44.330> was

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
second thing is that apparently he was

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.090 
second thing is that apparently he was
standing<00:02:44.780> there<00:02:45.020> for<00:02:45.410> days<00:02:47.950> apparently<00:02:48.950> he

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
standing there for days apparently he

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.420 
standing there for days apparently he
was<00:02:49.250> standing<00:02:49.580> there<00:02:49.820> for<00:02:50.150> days<00:02:50.300> and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
was standing there for days and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.010 
was standing there for days and
according<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.489> giro<00:02:52.850> his<00:02:53.480> energy<00:02:53.959> is

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
according to giro his energy is

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.820 
according to giro his energy is
overflowing<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:56.140> pales<00:02:57.140> in<00:02:57.260> comparison<00:02:57.290> to

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
overflowing it pales in comparison to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.949 
overflowing it pales in comparison to
what<00:02:57.980> he<00:02:58.070> had<00:02:58.220> before<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.760> I'm<00:02:59.540> pretty<00:02:59.840> sure

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
what he had before and I'm pretty sure

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.350 
what he had before and I'm pretty sure
that's<00:03:00.290> because<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.489> inner<00:03:01.880> monster

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
that's because of the inner monster

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.880 
that's because of the inner monster
inside<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.050> him<00:03:03.140> just<00:03:03.290> coming<00:03:03.739> out<00:03:03.830> and

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
inside of him just coming out and

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.000 
inside of him just coming out and
awakening<00:03:04.550> temporarily<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.890> know

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
awakening temporarily and you know

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.340 
awakening temporarily and you know
blasted<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:08.000> hole<00:03:08.030> right<00:03:08.239> through<00:03:08.420> storage<00:03:08.989> in

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
blasted a hole right through storage in

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.280 
blasted a hole right through storage in
it<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.370> that's<00:03:10.790> what<00:03:11.060> I'm<00:03:11.180> that's<00:03:11.390> what<00:03:11.959> I'm<00:03:12.080> uh

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
it so that's what I'm that's what I'm uh

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.310 
it so that's what I'm that's what I'm uh
that's<00:03:12.860> what<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.040> predict<00:03:13.700> as<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.360> why<00:03:14.570> he's<00:03:14.959> his

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
that's what I predict as to why he's his

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.910 
that's what I predict as to why he's his
energy<00:03:15.739> is<00:03:16.190> overflowing<00:03:17.470> because<00:03:18.470> he<00:03:18.769> hasn't

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
energy is overflowing because he hasn't

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.790 
energy is overflowing because he hasn't
eaten<00:03:19.130> anything<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:20.170> it's<00:03:21.170> kind<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.560> weird

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
eaten anything and it's kind of weird

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.540 
eaten anything and it's kind of weird
because<00:03:22.450> mr.<00:03:23.450> toriko<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.920> foundation<00:03:25.459> on

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
because mr. toriko and the foundation on

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.640 
because mr. toriko and the foundation on
target<00:03:25.850> for<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.030> longest<00:03:26.300> time<00:03:26.420> has<00:03:26.810> been<00:03:27.019> you

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
target for the longest time has been you

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.199 
target for the longest time has been you
eat<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.519> level<00:03:28.970> up<00:03:29.150> duh<00:03:29.420> duh<00:03:29.780> duh<00:03:30.620> duh<00:03:31.310> and

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
eat you level up duh duh duh duh and

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.850 
eat you level up duh duh duh duh and
then<00:03:32.329> you<00:03:32.450> just<00:03:32.600> get<00:03:32.810> rippling<00:03:33.200> muscles<00:03:33.739> in

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
then you just get rippling muscles in

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.699 
then you just get rippling muscles in
your<00:03:33.950> shining<00:03:34.549> rubberfruit<00:03:35.480> 20<00:03:36.260> go<00:03:36.410> along

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
your shining rubberfruit 20 go along

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.640 
your shining rubberfruit 20 go along
here<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:37.310> don't<00:03:37.730> know<00:03:38.030> how<00:03:38.840> many<00:03:38.870> ran<00:03:39.380> that

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
here I don't know how many ran that

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.030 
here I don't know how many ran that
place<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.730> obviously<00:03:41.540> were<00:03:41.780> used<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.860> them

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
place and so obviously were used to them

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.240 
place and so obviously were used to them
eating<00:03:43.459> food<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:44.030> powering<00:03:44.989> up<00:03:45.140> but<00:03:46.100> in<00:03:46.160> this

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
eating food and powering up but in this

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.759 
eating food and powering up but in this
case<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:46.549> see<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:47.090> damn<00:03:47.269> thing<00:03:47.540> and<00:03:47.900> the

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
case you see the damn thing and the

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.410 
case you see the damn thing and the
energy<00:03:49.130> he<00:03:49.280> has<00:03:49.489> is<00:03:50.079> overflowing<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.940> is

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
energy he has is overflowing and it is

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.009 
energy he has is overflowing and it is
so<00:03:53.810> much<00:03:54.049> more<00:03:54.320> so<00:03:55.280> in<00:03:55.579> quantity<00:03:56.299> then

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
so much more so in quantity then

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.160 
so much more so in quantity then
compared<00:03:57.560> all<00:03:57.590> he<00:03:57.709> had<00:03:57.890> before<00:03:58.280> he<00:03:58.989> engaged<00:03:59.989> in

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
compared all he had before he engaged in

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.050 
compared all he had before he engaged in
combat<00:04:00.470> against<00:04:00.890> ours<00:04:01.070> on<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:01.610> before<00:04:01.820> the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
combat against ours on this before the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.920 
combat against ours on this before the
time<00:04:02.299> geo<00:04:02.720> saw<00:04:03.049> toriko<00:04:04.239> so<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.420> thing<00:04:05.570> here<00:04:05.840> is

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
time geo saw toriko so the thing here is

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.569 
time geo saw toriko so the thing here is
that<00:04:05.959> I'm<00:04:06.290> assuming<00:04:06.709> again<00:04:06.920> it's<00:04:07.310> because<00:04:07.549> of

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
that I'm assuming again it's because of

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.729 
that I'm assuming again it's because of
the<00:04:07.730> inner<00:04:07.880> monster<00:04:08.150> site<00:04:08.600> or<00:04:08.780> co<00:04:08.989> awakening

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
the inner monster site or co awakening

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.990 
the inner monster site or co awakening
temporarily<00:04:10.390> now<00:04:12.220> when<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.310> comes<00:04:13.549> to<00:04:13.760> Tori

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
temporarily now when it comes to Tori

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.029 
temporarily now when it comes to Tori

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:28.189 
knew this before we're in which toriko

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.700 
knew this before we're in which toriko
would<00:05:28.310> be<00:05:28.430> like<00:05:28.639> very<00:05:28.789> powerful<00:05:29.240> feature<00:05:29.710> and

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
would be like very powerful feature and

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.920 
would be like very powerful feature and
he<00:05:31.279> had<00:05:31.430> all<00:05:31.460> these<00:05:31.729> tasks<00:05:32.210> laid<00:05:32.330> out<00:05:32.449> for<00:05:32.719> him

he had all these tasks laid out for him

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.649 
he had all these tasks laid out for him
so<00:05:33.499> he<00:05:33.529> would<00:05:33.800> get<00:05:34.039> close<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.580> that<00:05:34.610> power<00:05:34.879> or

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
so he would get close to that power or

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.450 
so he would get close to that power or
you<00:05:36.409> know<00:05:36.529> or<00:05:36.680> at<00:05:36.889> least<00:05:37.099> if<00:05:37.249> something

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:39.589 
happened to him like for example if he

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.829 
happened to him like for example if he
died<00:05:39.830> like<00:05:40.039> yeah<00:05:40.249> she<00:05:40.309> did<00:05:40.580> then<00:05:41.360> he<00:05:41.719> would

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:41.839 
died like yeah she did then he would

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:43.749 
died like yeah she did then he would
then<00:05:42.050> tortola<00:05:42.499> would<00:05:42.649> have<00:05:42.770> a<00:05:42.800> set<00:05:43.310> future
