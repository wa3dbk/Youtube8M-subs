uruguay and france well what a tough

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.280 
uruguay and france well what a tough
draw<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.150> for<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.360> host<00:00:12.570> South<00:00:12.809> Africa

draw that is for the host South Africa
you<00:00:13.769> can't<00:00:14.070> really<00:00:14.190> see<00:00:14.280> them<00:00:14.490> progressing

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
you can't really see them progressing

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.330 
you can't really see them progressing
out<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.389> group<00:00:15.599> with<00:00:16.410> mexico<00:00:16.859> uruguay

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
out of that group with mexico uruguay

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.800 
out of that group with mexico uruguay
and<00:00:17.369> france<00:00:17.490> you'd<00:00:17.970> think<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.390> would<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.600> two

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and france you'd think it would be two

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.210 
and france you'd think it would be two
from<00:00:19.080> three<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.470> those<00:00:19.680> who<00:00:19.949> would<00:00:20.039> go<00:00:20.189> through

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
from three of those who would go through

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.310 
from three of those who would go through
the<00:00:21.119> French<00:00:21.330> will<00:00:21.570> probably<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.930> favourites

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
the French will probably be favourites

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.230 
the French will probably be favourites
for<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> group<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.789> their<00:00:23.910> recent

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
for the group but with their recent

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.759 
for the group but with their recent
record<00:00:24.539> they've<00:00:24.720> struggled<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.560> is

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
record they've struggled really is

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.040 
record they've struggled really is
trouble<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.189> qualifying<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.910> who<00:00:27.630> would<00:00:27.900> bet

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
trouble in qualifying and who would bet

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.480 
trouble in qualifying and who would bet
on<00:00:28.080> them<00:00:28.289> winning<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> group<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.099> Uruguay

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
on them winning the group and Uruguay

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.030 
on them winning the group and Uruguay
Mexico<00:00:30.000> both<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.480> them<00:00:30.599> tough<00:00:30.810> games<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.890> it's

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
Mexico both get them tough games so it's

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.380 
Mexico both get them tough games so it's
possibly<00:00:32.460> say<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.090> two<00:00:33.270> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
possibly say it's going to be two of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
possibly say it's going to be two of
those<00:00:33.510> three<00:00:33.570> who<00:00:33.960> go<00:00:34.110> through<00:00:34.700> Group<00:00:35.700> B

argentina nigeria south korea and greece
this<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> tough<00:00:40.079> group<00:00:40.320> close<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.800> being<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
this is a tough group close to being the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.729 
this is a tough group close to being the
group<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.340> death<00:00:41.399> possibly<00:00:42.469> argentina<00:00:43.469> will

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
group of death possibly argentina will

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.350 
group of death possibly argentina will
be<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> favourites<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.610> should<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.059> through

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
be the favourites and should go through

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.029 
be the favourites and should go through
really<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> players<00:00:46.110> they<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.530> but

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
really with the players they have but

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.010 
really with the players they have but
they<00:00:47.129> did<00:00:47.280> struggle<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.730> qualifying<00:00:48.210> you

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
they did struggle in qualifying you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.520 
they did struggle in qualifying you
never<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:50.090> nigeria<00:00:51.090> possibly<00:00:52.079> not<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.379> good

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
never know nigeria possibly not as good

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.069 
never know nigeria possibly not as good
as<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.770> were<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.550> previous<00:00:54.000> years<00:00:54.079> South

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
as they were in previous years South

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.639 
as they were in previous years South
Korea<00:00:55.760> 2002<00:00:56.760> semi-finalists<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.379> they're<00:00:58.559> not

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
Korea 2002 semi-finalists so they're not

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.130 
Korea 2002 semi-finalists so they're not
to<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.890> written<00:00:59.070> off<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.520> greasy<00:01:00.000> hero<00:01:00.329> 2004

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.290 
to be written off and greasy hero 2004
champion<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.890> they're<00:01:02.699> probably<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.239> as

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

champion so they're probably in it as
well<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.260> possibly<00:01:04.619> take<00:01:04.769> argentina<00:01:05.280> to

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369

well so you possibly take argentina to
win<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> group<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.510> goes<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.720> plan<00:01:06.900> and

any one of the other three could

they<00:01:25.080> can't<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.560> taken<00:01:25.830> too<00:01:26.040> lightly<00:01:26.189> but

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
they can't be taken too lightly but

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.880

for<00:03:25.730> second<00:03:26.060> place<00:03:26.260> could<00:03:27.260> be<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.410> close<00:03:27.650> one

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
for second place could be a close one

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.030 
for second place could be a close one
that<00:03:28.600> possibly<00:03:29.600> taking<00:03:29.989> swiss<00:03:30.350> there<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.890> go

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
that possibly taking swiss there to go

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.910 
that possibly taking swiss there to go
through<00:03:31.310> honduras<00:03:31.910> not<00:03:32.780> not<00:03:33.320> too<00:03:33.470> bad<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> team

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
through honduras not not too bad a team

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.140 
through honduras not not too bad a team
but<00:03:34.070> you'd<00:03:34.400> think<00:03:34.610> they<00:03:34.730> would<00:03:34.850> struggle

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
but you'd think they would struggle

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.560 
but you'd think they would struggle
maybe<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.840> qualify<00:03:36.230> from<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.680> group<00:03:37.570> anyway

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
maybe to qualify from that group anyway

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.060 
maybe to qualify from that group anyway
there<00:03:38.959> should<00:03:39.170> be<00:03:39.200> some<00:03:39.410> great<00:03:39.650> games<00:03:39.860> there

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
there should be some great games there

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.250 
there should be some great games there
we<00:03:40.489> look<00:03:40.640> forward<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.299> England<00:03:42.140> should

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
we look forward to and England should

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.479 
we look forward to and England should
have<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.410> great<00:03:42.590> chance<00:03:42.799> of<00:03:42.950> at<00:03:43.070> least<00:03:43.220> making

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
have a great chance of at least making

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.150 
have a great chance of at least making
the<00:03:43.700> knockout<00:03:44.000> stage<00:03:44.299> now<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:45.739> we'll<00:03:45.890> all<00:03:46.010> look

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
the knockout stage now so we'll all look

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.699 
the knockout stage now so we'll all look
forward<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.609> that<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:48.109> can't<00:03:48.320> come<00:03:48.500> quick

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
forward to that and it can't come quick

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.739 
forward to that and it can't come quick
enough
