00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
on the midsole it definitely could have

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.850

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.130 
matters to me so and then there's the
sport<00:01:41.549> blue<00:01:41.729> colorway<00:01:42.150> which<00:01:42.360> i<00:01:42.570> think<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
sport blue colorway which i think is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.350 
sport blue colorway which i think is
great<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.610> kind<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.880> represents<00:01:45.299> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
great because it kind of represents a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.749 
great because it kind of represents a
giant<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.710> Jordan's<00:01:47.399> history

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
giant what if in like Jordan's history

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.499 
giant what if in like Jordan's history
because<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:49.799> black<00:01:50.009> cement<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.490> arguably<00:01:51.180> one

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
because the black cement is arguably one

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.819 
because the black cement is arguably one
of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> greatest<00:01:51.720> Jordan<00:01:52.439> shooters<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.710> all

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
of the greatest Jordan shooters of all

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.590 
of the greatest Jordan shooters of all
time<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.220> might<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.880> black<00:01:54.119> cement<00:01:54.420> 3<00:01:54.570> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
time it might be the black cement 3 I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.030 
time it might be the black cement 3 I
mean<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> greatest

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
mean is like the greatest

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.890 
mean is like the greatest
when<00:01:57.640> many<00:01:57.850> people's<00:01:58.210> opinions<00:01:58.570> agree<00:01:58.780> is

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
when many people's opinions agree is

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.110 
when many people's opinions agree is
jordyn<00:01:59.200> shoe<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.440> all<00:01:59.560> time<00:01:59.800> but<00:02:00.070> what<00:02:00.880> if

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
jordyn shoe of all time but what if

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.810 
jordyn shoe of all time but what if
Jordan<00:02:01.690> had<00:02:01.810> played<00:02:02.140> for<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.440> team<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:03.250> was

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
Jordan had played for a team that was

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.890 
Jordan had played for a team that was
using<00:02:04.360> blue<00:02:04.510> as<00:02:04.630> like<00:02:04.810> their<00:02:04.990> primary<00:02:05.530> colors

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
using blue as like their primary colors

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.690 
using blue as like their primary colors
this<00:02:07.900> is<00:02:08.110> kind<00:02:08.470> of<00:02:08.530> like<00:02:08.680> that<00:02:08.860> what<00:02:09.100> if<00:02:09.280> you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
this is kind of like that what if you

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.220 
this is kind of like that what if you
know<00:02:09.820> if<00:02:09.940> Jordan<00:02:10.390> had<00:02:10.510> played<00:02:10.720> for<00:02:10.750> like<00:02:11.110> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
know if Jordan had played for like the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.400 
know if Jordan had played for like the
Cavs<00:02:11.850> or<00:02:12.850> like<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.540> Knicks<00:02:13.840> or<00:02:14.050> something

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
Cavs or like the Knicks or something

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.700 
Cavs or like the Knicks or something
like<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.040> could<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.400> past<00:02:15.640> as<00:02:15.940> the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
like that this could have past as the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.190 
like that this could have past as the
original<00:02:17.710> black<00:02:17.950> cements<00:02:18.460> obviously<00:02:19.200> this

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
original black cements obviously this

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.990 
original black cements obviously this
wouldn't<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:20.710> blue<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.130> will<00:02:21.340> be<00:02:21.430> black<00:02:21.700> and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
wouldn't be blue this will be black and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.100 
wouldn't be blue this will be black and
you<00:02:22.210> would<00:02:22.330> see<00:02:22.510> like<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.750> know<00:02:22.780> subtle

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
you would see like you know subtle

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.110 
you would see like you know subtle
changes<00:02:23.440> here<00:02:23.740> on<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.980> upper<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.580> on<00:02:24.970> the

tongue and the eyelids as well but just

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.410 
tongue and the eyelids as well but just
pretty<00:02:29.830> close<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.520> being<00:02:30.550> what<00:02:31.030> could<00:02:31.300> have

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
pretty close to being what could have

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.390 
pretty close to being what could have
been<00:02:31.570> like<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.020> original<00:02:32.380> black<00:02:32.560> cement<00:02:32.950> you
