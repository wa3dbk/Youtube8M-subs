Anderson music instruction when it comes

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.409 
Anderson music instruction when it comes
to<00:00:12.259> the<00:00:12.349> world<00:00:12.559> of<00:00:12.799> symbols<00:00:13.099> there's<00:00:13.909> so<00:00:14.269> many

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:14.419 
to the world of symbols there's so many

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.150 
to the world of symbols there's so many
options<00:00:14.929> out<00:00:15.079> there<00:00:15.139> can<00:00:15.559> almost<00:00:15.679> be<00:00:15.949> a<00:00:15.980> little

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
options out there can almost be a little

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.400 
options out there can almost be a little
bit<00:00:16.280> overwhelming<00:00:16.910> so<00:00:17.689> today<00:00:17.960> I<00:00:17.990> wanted<00:00:18.320> to

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
bit overwhelming so today I wanted to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.200 
bit overwhelming so today I wanted to
just<00:00:18.560> talk<00:00:18.679> with<00:00:19.039> you<00:00:19.160> real<00:00:19.519> briefly<00:00:19.670> about

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
just talk with you real briefly about

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.150 
just talk with you real briefly about
some<00:00:20.509> of<00:00:21.019> the<00:00:21.080> different<00:00:21.170> characteristics<00:00:22.039> of

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
some of the different characteristics of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.740 
some of the different characteristics of
a<00:00:22.250> symbol<00:00:22.580> and<00:00:22.640> how<00:00:22.759> they<00:00:22.939> change<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.480> sound

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
a symbol and how they change the sound

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.300 
a symbol and how they change the sound
today<00:00:24.169> we're<00:00:24.320> going<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.470> focus<00:00:24.560> on<00:00:24.919> the<00:00:25.099> weight

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
today we're going to focus on the weight

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.390 
today we're going to focus on the weight
of<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.519> symbol<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.029> its<00:00:26.210> diameter<00:00:26.630> in<00:00:27.400> the

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
of a symbol and its diameter in the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.710 
of a symbol and its diameter in the
world<00:00:28.609> of<00:00:28.789> symbols<00:00:28.999> there's<00:00:29.390> just<00:00:29.599> an

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
world of symbols there's just an

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.929 
world of symbols there's just an
astonishing<00:00:30.470> array<00:00:30.679> of<00:00:30.980> different<00:00:31.490> things

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
astonishing array of different things

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.060 
astonishing array of different things
that<00:00:32.630> you<00:00:32.840> can<00:00:33.050> do<00:00:33.200> different<00:00:33.410> tonal<00:00:33.800> colors

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
that you can do different tonal colors

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.820 
that you can do different tonal colors
different<00:00:34.700> sizes<00:00:34.840> all<00:00:35.840> of<00:00:35.930> that<00:00:36.260> each<00:00:36.440> one<00:00:36.620> has

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
different sizes all of that each one has

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.710 
different sizes all of that each one has
its<00:00:36.860> own<00:00:37.280> voice<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.000> to<00:00:38.060> speak<00:00:38.330> or<00:00:38.450> its<00:00:38.570> own

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
its own voice so to speak or its own

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.930 
its own voice so to speak or its own
individual<00:00:39.290> characteristic<00:00:40.100> but<00:00:40.760> just

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
individual characteristic but just

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.400 
individual characteristic but just
briefly<00:00:41.150> I<00:00:41.420> wanted<00:00:41.720> to<00:00:41.810> explain<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:42.170> couple

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
briefly I wanted to explain a couple

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.100 
briefly I wanted to explain a couple
things<00:00:42.940> general<00:00:43.940> rule<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:44.420> be<00:00:44.570> aware<00:00:44.810> of<00:00:44.870> is

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
things general rule to be aware of is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.560 
things general rule to be aware of is
that<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.890> smaller<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.580> diameter<00:00:46.760> meaning

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
that the smaller the diameter meaning

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.390 
that the smaller the diameter meaning
how<00:00:47.810> big<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.170> symbol<00:00:48.500> is<00:00:48.650> around<00:00:48.950> or<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
how big the symbol is around or the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.870 
how big the symbol is around or the
circular<00:00:50.030> sort<00:00:50.480> of<00:00:50.600> appeal<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:52.190> higher<00:00:52.640> the

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
circular sort of appeal the higher the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.790 
circular sort of appeal the higher the
pitch<00:00:53.060> will<00:00:53.360> be<00:00:53.540> let<00:00:54.080> me<00:00:54.140> demonstrate<00:00:54.320> that

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
pitch will be let me demonstrate that

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.390 
pitch will be let me demonstrate that
the<00:00:55.100> hi-hats<00:00:55.460> 14-inch<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:57.710> crash<00:00:58.010> cymbal

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
the hi-hats 14-inch this crash cymbal

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.450 
the hi-hats 14-inch this crash cymbal
over<00:00:58.520> here<00:00:58.670> is<00:00:58.730> 18<00:00:59.240> inches<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:01.040> this<00:01:01.250> ride

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
over here is 18 inches and this ride

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.630 
over here is 18 inches and this ride
cymbals<00:01:01.880> 22<00:01:02.830> can<00:01:03.830> hear<00:01:04.009> each<00:01:04.040> one<00:01:04.400> goes<00:01:04.580> a

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
cymbals 22 can hear each one goes a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.400 
cymbals 22 can hear each one goes a
little<00:01:04.879> bit<00:01:05.059> lower<00:01:05.300> in<00:01:05.449> terms<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:05.930> its<00:01:06.110> pitch

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
little bit lower in terms of its pitch

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.770 
little bit lower in terms of its pitch
so<00:01:07.310> that's<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.610> general<00:01:08.000> rule<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.360> be<00:01:08.510> aware<00:01:08.720> of

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
so that's a general rule to be aware of

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.020 
so that's a general rule to be aware of
the<00:01:09.020> smaller<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.650> diameter<00:01:09.830> higher<00:01:10.790> the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
the smaller the diameter higher the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.000 
the smaller the diameter higher the
pitch<00:01:11.210> now<00:01:11.960> when<00:01:12.110> we<00:01:12.200> talk<00:01:12.380> about<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.740> weight

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
pitch now when we talk about the weight

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.920 
pitch now when we talk about the weight
of<00:01:13.160> a<00:01:13.250> symbol<00:01:13.610> you'll<00:01:13.790> often<00:01:13.970> see<00:01:14.150> this<00:01:14.540> as<00:01:14.750> you

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
of a symbol you'll often see this as you

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.560 
of a symbol you'll often see this as you
look<00:01:15.320> around<00:01:15.440> there's<00:01:15.740> thin<00:01:16.220> crashes<00:01:16.880> medium

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
look around there's thin crashes medium

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.190 
look around there's thin crashes medium
thin<00:01:17.990> medium<00:01:18.970> dark<00:01:19.970> heavy<00:01:20.450> there's<00:01:20.780> all<00:01:20.900> kinds

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
thin medium dark heavy there's all kinds

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.990 
thin medium dark heavy there's all kinds
of<00:01:21.260> you<00:01:21.470> language<00:01:22.070> that's<00:01:22.250> used<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.520> describe

of you language that's used to describe

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.610 
of you language that's used to describe
how<00:01:23.540> cymbal<00:01:23.990> sound<00:01:24.230> but<00:01:24.440> here's<00:01:24.560> another

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
how cymbal sound but here's another

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.290 
how cymbal sound but here's another
general<00:01:25.190> characteristic<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:25.909> be<00:01:26.030> aware<00:01:26.240> of

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
general characteristic to be aware of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.360 
general characteristic to be aware of
the<00:01:26.810> thinner<00:01:27.140> assemble<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.040> more<00:01:28.250> it's

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
the thinner assemble is the more it's

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.520 
the thinner assemble is the more it's
going<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.580> tend<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.940> make<00:01:29.120> a<00:01:29.150> crash<00:01:29.630> type<00:01:30.350> of

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
going to tend to make a crash type of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.890 
going to tend to make a crash type of
sound<00:01:30.740> kind<00:01:31.640> of<00:01:31.700> like<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:35.570> heavier

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
sound kind of like this the heavier

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.690 
sound kind of like this the heavier
assembler<00:01:36.470> is<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.860> more<00:01:37.100> it's<00:01:37.190> going<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.430> tend

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
assembler is the more it's going to tend

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.850 
assembler is the more it's going to tend
to<00:01:37.820> have<00:01:38.000> sort<00:01:38.690> of<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:38.870> clinky<00:01:39.320> sound<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.830> it

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
to have sort of a clinky sound to it

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.890 
to have sort of a clinky sound to it
kind<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.280> like<00:01:40.400> this<00:01:40.490> ride<00:01:40.700> cymbal

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.010 

so<00:01:44.680> if<00:01:44.800> i<00:01:44.890> had<00:01:45.040> a<00:01:45.070> thin<00:01:45.520> ride<00:01:45.820> cymbal<00:01:46.330> when<00:01:46.900> i'm

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
so if i had a thin ride cymbal when i'm

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.510 
so if i had a thin ride cymbal when i'm
playing<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.470> lot<00:01:47.620> on<00:01:47.770> it<00:01:47.890> it<00:01:48.040> would<00:01:48.160> tend<00:01:48.430> to

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
playing a lot on it it would tend to

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.850 
playing a lot on it it would tend to
kind<00:01:48.760> of<00:01:48.940> bleed<00:01:49.450> into<00:01:49.750> that<00:01:49.900> crash<00:01:50.260> sort<00:01:50.710> of

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
kind of bleed into that crash sort of

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.310
