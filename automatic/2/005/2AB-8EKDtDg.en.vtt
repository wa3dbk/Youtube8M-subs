 times his rookie ryad boudebouz 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.400
 but this first half is not 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.890
 very rich in occasions a situation 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.680
 with this free-kick bastiais and dia a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.180
 inviolate

 mandanne the old dijonnais had distorted 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.730

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.760
 not find the way to the nets 0 to 0 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.350
 that's the half time score 45 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.649
 first minutes very poor in 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.560
 opportunities with technical waste and

 very few offensive attempts 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.520
 conclusive frederic hantz hopes a 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.729
 little more madness and taking 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.049
 initiatives to force fate and to 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.260

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.320
 the Corsican coach will be able to exult 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.020
 after this magnificent strike from wahbi

 on the side of lyon it is well and truly 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.210
 present with the sporting and it allows 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.210
 Corsican to lead 1 to 0 here to the guru 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.590
 the Tunisian international 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.930
 allows Corsicans to lead 1 to 0 but 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.290
 guingamp will react at the end of the game 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.510
 mandanne seeps into the surface of 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.580

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.369
 the question of whether ben

 years in the repair area 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.070
 in any case mustapha yatabare does not 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.830
 do not deprive to equalize 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.970

 tony chapron means the penalty spot 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.630
 but it seems that the hand of 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.420
 defender Bastians are outside the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.390

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.970
 landreau that confirms once again 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.260
 that he's really one of all 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.560
 best specialists on penalty 1 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.570
