00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello everyone, wake up this and in this 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.899
 video will show you how to rename 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.649
 the name of minecraft items is yours 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.080
 resource packs 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.360
 People have asked me how long ago 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.440
 do and I somehow wrote in the comments 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.289
 under the video 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.720
 but many do not understand and they have something not 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.230
 It turned out and so I decided to record a video 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.340
 since i have free time 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.800
 I want to immediately say something that is difficult 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.349
 nothing but you only need 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.810
 repeat after me and you like you all 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.279
 should get 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.890
 let's get started for a start 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.920
 go to start and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.600
 search bar we write a command like 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.969
 percentage a dad 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.430
 date percentage and go to daddy roaming 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.570
 then go to the folder. maykravt in 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.050
 asus pax folder 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.590
 and open the machine Spock I will show it on 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.680
 example of my resource pack so in vain i 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.410
 opened the tower full screen so here in 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.610
 In principle, it is possible to close this 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.729
 move go to the assets folder 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.770
 maykravt 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.170
 and you should have files like 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.130
 texture with text pinching features land 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.000
 I’ll remove the market for now and tell you 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.280
 why did i delete 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.860
 basically like and that is the folder where we are 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.960
 we will grind things and if anyone 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.900
 there is no such daddy and such files 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.610
 or are there other files then link to this 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.970
 I'll leave daddy in the description below the video 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.240
 can go and download 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.710
 but before you immediately download and 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.229
 throw through here as you already understood 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.229
 that you do not need to throw because here 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.299
 there was already a wing folder I wanted to be that 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.750
 say start you need to go your 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.060
 minecraft and minecraft choose language on 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.090
 Russian that is, change it whenever 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.500
 change language to Russian Minkov 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.560
 close it go to the young folder 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.259
 eat file by hand and by 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.930
 open with notepad or 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.740
 programs not paid plus plus by the way 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.770
 good program advise you to download and 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.160
 leaf him here it is looking for what subject 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.800
 which ones you want 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.800
 translate, or rename the same I 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.310
 stage will show an example 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.310
 diamond sword yes are there any staples and 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.370
 all the things that are minecraft here 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.160
 he has a diamond sword and there the words diamond . 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.640
 name diamond sword well and drank a lot 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.190
 for example diamond sword valor how would 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.130
 You can have it transferred to everyone. 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.940
 save and so on show more 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.300
 for example, here is the bread and translate 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.610
 perhaps his bread and so on in 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.860
 Basically there is nothing difficult but I wanted 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.840
 to say that if everything is on 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.560
 Russian words in Russian seeds 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.830
 pumpkin wheat seeds and so on then you 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.750
 should write here in Russian too 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.660
 because if manka what is the language 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.370
 Russian the file you use too 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.180
 Russians multiply everything in Russian 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.690
 I hope you understand how this is 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.740
 saved saved 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.470
 can also try it all 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.470
 translate here in this file already on 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.090
 English which is open by mouth 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.540
 under because so somehow we don’t 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.700
 opens and we also look for a fitting here 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.560
 This want to translate but here already on 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.840
 Russian and write down here since 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.230

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.390

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.470
