00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
we came from what the history of what we

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.050 
we came from what the history of what we
do<00:04:38.300> is<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:39.919> definitely<00:04:40.130> influenced<00:04:40.880> us

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
do is and it definitely influenced us

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.360 
do is and it definitely influenced us
and<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.710> know<00:04:42.740> we<00:04:42.919> want<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.220> make<00:04:43.340> a

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
and and you know we want to make a

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.540 
and and you know we want to make a
powerful<00:04:43.880> rock<00:04:44.030> record<00:04:44.450> out<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:44.840> do<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.200> and

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
so I think it was definitely an

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.039
