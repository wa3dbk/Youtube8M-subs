move it back and forth and take a look

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.500 
move it back and forth and take a look
at<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> what's<00:00:47.820> happening<00:00:48.239> by<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
at the what's happening by the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.459 
at the what's happening by the
carburetor<00:00:50.629> you'll<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.079> piece<00:00:52.289> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
carburetor you'll see that that piece of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.520 
carburetor you'll see that that piece of
linkage<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:54.300> connected<00:00:54.899> right<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:57.530> then

carburetor

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.330 

the<00:01:08.750> throttle<00:01:09.409> cable<00:01:09.530> for<00:01:09.829> this<00:01:09.920> particular

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
the throttle cable for this particular

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.580 
the throttle cable for this particular
unit<00:01:10.640> has<00:01:10.670> been<00:01:10.909> disconnected<00:01:11.299> but<00:01:12.229> in<00:01:12.350> theory

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
unit has been disconnected but in theory

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.830 
unit has been disconnected but in theory
it<00:01:12.890> would<00:01:13.850> push<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:14.710> lever<00:01:15.710> up<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:19.840> this

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
it would push this lever up and this

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.359 
it would push this lever up and this
piece<00:01:21.110> would<00:01:21.670> slide<00:01:22.670> back<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.060> forth<00:01:24.369> so

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
piece would slide back and forth so

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.429 
piece would slide back and forth so
that's<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.729> five<00:01:25.880> horsepower<00:01:26.210> let's<00:01:27.110> move<00:01:27.289> on

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
that's the five horsepower let's move on

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.649 
that's the five horsepower let's move on
to<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.679> seven<00:01:27.950> horsepower<00:01:28.450> alright<00:01:29.450> right

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
to the seven horsepower alright right

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.419 
to the seven horsepower alright right
here<00:01:29.840> we're<00:01:30.020> looking<00:01:30.140> at<00:01:30.439> an<00:01:30.619> Ariens<00:01:31.009> snow

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
here we're looking at an Ariens snow

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.309 
here we're looking at an Ariens snow
blower<00:01:31.460> with<00:01:31.909> a<00:01:31.939> seven<00:01:32.390> horsepower<00:01:32.689> engine<00:01:33.200> on

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
it again that's it to come see I've

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.510 
it again that's it to come see I've
taken<00:01:35.450> heater<00:01:35.780> box<00:01:36.020> off<00:01:36.319> and<00:01:36.619> once<00:01:37.429> again

we'll<00:01:37.819> look<00:01:37.939> down<00:01:38.149> here<00:01:38.479> put<00:01:39.140> shadows<00:01:40.039> in<00:01:40.189> the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
we'll look down here put shadows in the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.050 
we'll look down here put shadows in the
way<00:01:40.599> but<00:01:41.599> the<00:01:45.009> two<00:01:46.009> are<00:01:46.039> deceit<00:01:46.490> on<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:46.819> let's

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
way but the two are deceit on that let's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.539 
way but the two are deceit on that let's
go<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.299> different<00:01:47.569> direction<00:01:48.039> this<00:01:49.039> again<00:01:49.369> is

comes the engine this one is an eight
horsepower<00:02:44.670> engine<00:02:45.800> we're<00:02:46.800> looking<00:02:47.160> at<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
horsepower engine we're looking at the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.720 
horsepower engine we're looking at the
carburetor<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.440> governor<00:02:49.770> arm<00:02:49.950> back

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
carburetor and the governor arm back

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.580 
carburetor and the governor arm back
here<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.090> governor<00:02:51.450> arm<00:02:51.630> again<00:02:52.230> with<00:02:52.410> two

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
here is the governor arm again with two

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.220 
here is the governor arm again with two
pieces<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.130> linkage<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.640> back<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.959> fatter

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
pieces of linkage on the back the fatter

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.660 
pieces of linkage on the back the fatter
one<00:02:55.530> which<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> second<00:02:56.610> hole<00:02:56.760> from<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:56.970> end

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
one which is a second hole from the end

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:08.260 
one which is a second hole from the end
connects<00:02:59.670> up<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:01.310> control<00:03:02.310> up<00:03:02.520> here<00:03:06.830> and

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
connects up to the control up here and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.780 
connects up to the control up here and
then<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.750> other<00:03:10.010> piece<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.190> linkage<00:03:11.640> the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
then the other piece of linkage the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.510 
then the other piece of linkage the
thinner<00:03:12.030> one<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:13.530> she<00:03:13.590> connects<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.280> top

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
thinner one now she connects to the top

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.690 
thinner one now she connects to the top
of<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.760> carburetor<00:03:15.090> right<00:03:15.330> here

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
of the carburetor right here

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.680 
of the carburetor right here
so<00:03:17.700> as<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:20.930> throttles<00:03:21.930> up<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.970> then<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
so as the throttles up and then the the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.130 
so as the throttles up and then the the
governor<00:03:25.080> needs<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:26.670> reduce<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.150> RPMs<00:03:27.630> it

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
governor needs to to reduce the RPMs it

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
governor needs to to reduce the RPMs it
will<00:03:28.290> move<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.620> way<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:30.140> turn<00:03:34.040> reducing<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
will move this way and turn reducing the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.449 
will move this way and turn reducing the
speed<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.580> carburetor<00:03:35.880> so<00:03:37.100> again<00:03:38.100> we<00:03:38.310> got

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
speed of the carburetor so again we got

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.130 
speed of the carburetor so again we got
this<00:03:38.610> one<00:03:38.730> up<00:03:38.850> here<00:03:38.880> whereas<00:03:39.780> this<00:03:39.870> one's<00:03:40.080> a

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
this one up here whereas this one's a

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.210 
this one up here whereas this one's a
little<00:03:40.290> different<00:03:40.410> than<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.890> other<00:03:41.010> ones

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
little different than the other ones

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.240 
little different than the other ones
that<00:03:41.310> I've<00:03:41.459> shown<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.920> this<00:03:43.920> piece<00:03:44.100> of

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
that I've shown you this piece of

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.690 
that I've shown you this piece of
linkage<00:03:44.519> is<00:03:44.670> up<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.000> upper<00:03:45.060> hole<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:46.700> some

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
linkage is up in the upper hole and some

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.340 
linkage is up in the upper hole and some
of<00:03:47.820> them<00:03:47.970> are<00:03:48.030> in<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.239> bottom<00:03:48.510> hole<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.900> don't

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
of them are in the bottom hole I don't

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.110 
of them are in the bottom hole I don't
know<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.799> makes<00:03:49.950> much<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.400> difference<00:03:50.430> but

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
know that makes much of a difference but

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.479 
know that makes much of a difference but
this<00:03:51.299> is<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:52.320> is<00:03:52.500> way<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.890> stock<00:03:53.220> right

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
this is a this is way this stock right

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.979 
this is a this is way this stock right
now<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:53.670> haven't<00:03:53.910> adjusted<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.630> one<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:54.930> all

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
now I haven't adjusted this one and all

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.590 
now I haven't adjusted this one and all
myself<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.739> there<00:03:56.730> we<00:03:56.850> go<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.030> come<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.480> eight

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
myself so there we go to come to eight

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.890 
myself so there we go to come to eight

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.020 
a John Deere snow blower snow thrower
with<00:04:07.590> an<00:04:07.739> eight<00:04:07.920> horsepower<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.670> comes<00:04:08.880> the

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
with an eight horsepower to comes the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.660 
with an eight horsepower to comes the
engine<00:04:09.329> on<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.799> excuse<00:04:10.799> me<00:04:10.950> I'm<00:04:11.100> wrong<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.549> is

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
engine on it excuse me I'm wrong this is

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.840 
engine on it excuse me I'm wrong this is
a<00:04:11.700> ten<00:04:12.060> horsepower<00:04:12.570> so<00:04:13.380> let's<00:04:14.310> again<00:04:14.790> look

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
a ten horsepower so let's again look

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.349 
a ten horsepower so let's again look
over<00:04:15.239> here<00:04:15.420> at<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:16.220> governor<00:04:17.220> arm<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.850> you'll

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
over here at the governor arm and you'll

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.909 
over here at the governor arm and you'll
see<00:04:18.540> this<00:04:18.690> one<00:04:18.840> has<00:04:18.959> two<00:04:19.140> pieces<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.530> linkage

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
see this one has two pieces of linkage

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.200 
see this one has two pieces of linkage
coming<00:04:20.250> off<00:04:20.370> of<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:22.190> fatter<00:04:23.190> piece<00:04:24.030> of

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
coming off of it the fatter piece of

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.920 
coming off of it the fatter piece of
linkage<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.220> second<00:04:26.220> hole<00:04:26.340> from<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.550> end

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
linkage and the second hole from the end

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.890 
linkage and the second hole from the end
goes<00:04:27.930> over<00:04:28.320> here<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.180> throttle<00:04:30.390> control

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
goes over here to the throttle control

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.140 
goes over here to the throttle control
and<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.860> throttle<00:04:32.160> control<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.640> pointed<00:04:33.030> up

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
and the throttle control is pointed up

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.320 
and the throttle control is pointed up
right<00:04:33.600> like<00:04:33.780> this<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.610> then<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.789> other<00:04:36.060> piece

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
right like this and then the other piece

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.690 
right like this and then the other piece
of<00:04:36.360> linkage<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:37.050> smaller<00:04:37.260> one<00:04:37.560> is<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.520> very

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
of linkage is smaller one is on the very

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.529 
of linkage is smaller one is on the very
end<00:04:38.940> hole<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:40.260> governor<00:04:41.070> arm<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.550> that

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
end hole of the governor arm and that

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.710 
end hole of the governor arm and that
one<00:04:42.690> connects<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:44.640> top<00:04:44.820> of<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.150> the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
one connects to the top of the the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.150 
one connects to the top of the the
carburetor<00:04:46.140> here<00:04:46.520> so<00:04:48.260> if<00:04:49.260> we<00:04:49.440> throttle<00:04:49.860> up<00:04:49.979> and

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
carburetor here so if we throttle up and

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.040 
carburetor here so if we throttle up and
down

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
down

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.249 
down
let's<00:04:53.050> see<00:04:53.199> what's<00:04:53.349> going<00:04:53.649> on<00:04:53.770> here<00:04:55.080> if<00:04:56.080> you're

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
let's see what's going on here if you're

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.019 
let's see what's going on here if you're
throttled<00:04:56.439> up<00:04:56.709> and<00:04:56.979> then<00:04:57.459> the<00:04:57.550> governor<00:04:57.879> needs

00:04:58.019 --> 00:04:58.029 
throttled up and then the governor needs

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:01.339 
throttled up and then the governor needs
to<00:04:58.270> throttle<00:04:59.169> back<00:04:59.379> it'll<00:05:00.309> push<00:05:00.580> back<00:05:00.849> and

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
to throttle back it'll push back and

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.339 
to throttle back it'll push back and
allow<00:05:02.349> the<00:05:02.849> RPMs<00:05:03.849> to<00:05:04.149> to<00:05:04.749> back<00:05:04.959> off<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.199> little

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
allow the RPMs to to back off a little

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.179 
allow the RPMs to to back off a little
bit<00:05:05.649> so<00:05:06.779> again<00:05:07.779> we're<00:05:08.559> down<00:05:08.709> here<00:05:08.739> in<00:05:09.009> the

stop and off or store and off and what
will<00:05:46.389> happen<00:05:46.689> is<00:05:46.839> when<00:05:47.110> you<00:05:47.199> pull<00:05:47.409> this<00:05:47.559> down

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:47.939 
will happen is when you pull this down

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:53.129 
will happen is when you pull this down
into<00:05:48.939> the<00:05:49.089> stop<00:05:49.300> position<00:05:51.689> what's<00:05:52.689> going<00:05:52.959> on

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
into the stop position what's going on

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.389 
into the stop position what's going on
down<00:05:53.589> here<00:05:53.619> is<00:05:54.389> this<00:05:55.389> little<00:05:55.569> metal<00:05:55.929> tab<00:05:56.399> will

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:57.399 
down here is this little metal tab will

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.149 
down here is this little metal tab will
connect<00:05:57.969> with<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.509> control<00:05:58.899> so<00:05:59.529> again<00:05:59.949> if<00:06:00.129> we

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
connect with the control so again if we

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.959 
connect with the control so again if we
push<00:06:00.429> it<00:06:00.579> up<00:06:00.699> and<00:06:01.689> give<00:06:01.839> it<00:06:01.959> some<00:06:02.079> speed<00:06:02.969> the

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
push it up and give it some speed the

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:07.139 
push it up and give it some speed the
connection<00:06:04.449> is<00:06:04.569> broken<00:06:04.779> right<00:06:04.990> there<00:06:05.139> and<00:06:06.149> now

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:07.149 
connection is broken right there and now

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:09.179 
connection is broken right there and now
that<00:06:07.179> we're<00:06:07.509> going<00:06:07.599> to<00:06:07.659> be<00:06:07.779> in<00:06:07.929> the<00:06:08.139> in<00:06:08.349> Fast

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
that we're going to be in the in Fast

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.619 
that we're going to be in the in Fast
and<00:06:10.139> I<00:06:11.139> will<00:06:11.349> turn<00:06:11.769> it<00:06:11.889> down<00:06:12.039> and<00:06:12.339> in<00:06:13.209> back<00:06:13.449> in

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:13.629 
and I will turn it down and in back in

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:15.029 
and I will turn it down and in back in
the<00:06:13.689> stop<00:06:13.899> position<00:06:14.110> what<00:06:14.499> what<00:06:14.740> basically

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
the stop position what what basically

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.219 
the stop position what what basically
going<00:06:15.369> on<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:15.789> we<00:06:15.849> can<00:06:15.879> only<00:06:16.119> see<00:06:16.419> this<00:06:16.569> this

going on and we can only see this this

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:18.629 
going on and we can only see this this
well<00:06:17.469> because<00:06:17.619> I<00:06:17.829> took<00:06:18.009> the<00:06:18.129> carburetor<00:06:18.519> off

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639

that<00:06:38.229> you<00:06:38.319> kill<00:06:38.529> an<00:06:38.649> engine<00:06:38.979> is<00:06:39.789> or<00:06:40.240> stop<00:06:40.599> an

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:40.749 
that you kill an engine is or stop an

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:45.629 
that you kill an engine is or stop an
engine<00:06:41.050> is<00:06:41.169> you<00:06:41.409> short<00:06:41.769> it<00:06:41.889> out<00:06:42.099> and<00:06:43.019> by<00:06:44.639> by

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
engine is you short it out and by by

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.480 
engine is you short it out and by by
allowing<00:06:45.909> this<00:06:46.749> to<00:06:47.019> slide<00:06:47.229> down<00:06:47.499> and<00:06:47.740> touch

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
allowing this to slide down and touch

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.119 
allowing this to slide down and touch
this<00:06:48.669> little<00:06:48.849> wire<00:06:49.169> that<00:06:50.169> basically<00:06:50.709> shorts

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:51.129 
this little wire that basically shorts

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.219 
this little wire that basically shorts
out<00:06:51.219> the<00:06:51.399> engine<00:06:51.759> and<00:06:51.909> the<00:06:52.539> engine<00:06:52.569> shuts<00:06:53.050> off

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:53.229 
out the engine and the engine shuts off

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:54.899 
out the engine and the engine shuts off
so<00:06:53.769> that's<00:06:53.979> what<00:06:54.099> that's<00:06:54.279> all<00:06:54.399> about
