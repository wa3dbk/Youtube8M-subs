you think you play spring game before
almost<00:06:22.160> 70,000<00:06:22.850> people<00:06:22.880> I<00:06:24.280> honestly<00:06:25.280> didn't<00:06:25.670> I

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
almost 70,000 people I honestly didn't I

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.520 
almost 70,000 people I honestly didn't I
always<00:06:26.150> thought<00:06:26.330> the<00:06:26.690> spring<00:06:26.990> game<00:06:27.020> is<00:06:27.350> just

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
always thought the spring game is just

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.830 
always thought the spring game is just
something<00:06:27.770> you<00:06:28.070> know<00:06:28.190> the<00:06:28.550> fans<00:06:29.360> can<00:06:29.570> kill<00:06:29.750> him

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
something you know the fans can kill him

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.360 
something you know the fans can kill him
watch<00:06:29.960> that<00:06:30.140> they<00:06:30.260> wanted<00:06:30.560> to<00:06:30.740> you<00:06:30.890> know<00:06:30.920> and

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
watch that they wanted to you know and

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.550 
watch that they wanted to you know and
uh<00:06:31.400> it<00:06:32.270> wasn't<00:06:32.480> going<00:06:32.690> to<00:06:32.780> be<00:06:32.840> like<00:06:33.020> a<00:06:33.080> big<00:06:33.380> deal

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
uh it wasn't going to be like a big deal

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.070 
uh it wasn't going to be like a big deal
but<00:06:33.620> because<00:06:34.340> Jones<00:06:35.030> has<00:06:35.180> made<00:06:35.360> it<00:06:35.540> made<00:06:35.810> it<00:06:35.840> a

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
but because Jones has made it made it a

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.340 
but because Jones has made it made it a
big<00:06:36.590> deal<00:06:36.770> and<00:06:37.040> I<00:06:37.100> think<00:06:37.660> the<00:06:38.660> main<00:06:38.900> reason<00:06:38.930> for

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
big deal and I think the main reason for

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.860 
big deal and I think the main reason for
that<00:06:39.590> is<00:06:39.800> so<00:06:39.980> we<00:06:40.160> can<00:06:40.370> get<00:06:40.580> in<00:06:40.730> front<00:06:40.940> of<00:06:41.090> 70,000

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
that is so we can get in front of 70,000

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.560 
that is so we can get in front of 70,000
people<00:06:42.310> before<00:06:43.310> the<00:06:43.550> season<00:06:44.120> starts<00:06:44.420> before

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
Thomas Dante vs blader I mean that's the

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.710 
Thomas Dante vs blader I mean that's the
first<00:06:52.730> time<00:06:52.820> they've<00:06:53.060> really<00:06:53.360> played<00:06:53.600> in
