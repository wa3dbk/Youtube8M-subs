to my TA classes but this time around

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.030 
to my TA classes but this time around
it's<00:00:06.930> turned<00:00:07.170> his<00:00:07.290> attentions<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.950> the

it's turned his attentions to the

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.589 
it's turned his attentions to the
campervan<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.820> has<00:00:09.240> come<00:00:09.389> up<00:00:09.420> with<00:00:09.570> a

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
campervan and has come up with a

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.830 
campervan and has come up with a
cracking<00:00:10.110> new<00:00:10.260> idea<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.010> twin<00:00:11.280> 500s<00:00:12.150> now

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
cracking new idea in the twin 500s now

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.480 
cracking new idea in the twin 500s now
what's<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.290> good<00:00:13.410> about<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.219> it's

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
what's so good about this is that it's

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.330 
what's so good about this is that it's
on<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> five<00:00:15.059> meter<00:00:15.450> long<00:00:15.839> wheelbase<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.220> has

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
on a five meter long wheelbase so it has

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.130 
on a five meter long wheelbase so it has
to<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:17.490> some<00:00:17.760> fairly<00:00:18.090> clever<00:00:18.359> design<00:00:18.779> ideas

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
to have some fairly clever design ideas

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.140 
to have some fairly clever design ideas
to<00:00:19.260> actually<00:00:19.410> work<00:00:19.770> one<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.550> which<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.939> best

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
to actually work one of which the best

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.120 
to actually work one of which the best
thing<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.960> has<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.080> sliding<00:00:22.680> door<00:00:22.710> on

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
thing is that it has a sliding door on

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.810 
thing is that it has a sliding door on
both<00:00:23.550> sides<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.390> vehicle

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.009 

Continental<00:00:29.820> manufacturers<00:00:30.420> bringing<00:00:30.810> fans

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
Continental manufacturers bringing fans

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.740 
Continental manufacturers bringing fans
into<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> UK<00:00:31.740> generally<00:00:32.730> don't<00:00:33.030> re<00:00:33.300> hand<00:00:33.570> them

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
into the UK generally don't re hand them

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.630 
into the UK generally don't re hand them
so<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> sliding<00:00:34.590> door<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> habitation

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
so the sliding door or the habitation

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.400 
so the sliding door or the habitation
door<00:00:35.820> will<00:00:36.030> not<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> UK<00:00:36.930> near<00:00:37.140> site

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
door will not be on the UK near site

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.959 
door will not be on the UK near site
this<00:00:37.980> means<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.550> distort<00:00:38.850> your

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
this means you have to distort your

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.850 
this means you have to distort your
passengers<00:00:39.510> into<00:00:39.840> traffic<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.379> driving<00:00:40.680> in

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
passengers into traffic if driving in

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.950 
passengers into traffic if driving in
the<00:00:40.920> UK<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.460> don't<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.629> reason

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the UK I don't think this is the reason

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
the UK I don't think this is the reason
why<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.860> fan<00:00:44.100> there<00:00:44.280> are<00:00:44.370> twin<00:00:44.550> sliding

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
why on this fan there are twin sliding

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.430 
why on this fan there are twin sliding
doors<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.420> more<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> fact<00:00:46.260> that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
doors it's more to do with the fact that

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.619 
doors it's more to do with the fact that
it's<00:00:46.770> only<00:00:46.890> 5<00:00:47.250> meters<00:00:47.460> long<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.090> having<00:00:48.480> this

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it's only 5 meters long so having this

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.720 
it's only 5 meters long so having this
kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.930> open<00:00:49.289> access<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.829> extremely

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
kind of open access is extremely

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.900 
kind of open access is extremely
valuable<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> having

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
valuable so you can see that having

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.639 
valuable so you can see that having
these<00:00:54.030> double<00:00:54.480> sliding<00:00:54.960> doors<00:00:55.170> means<00:00:55.469> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
these double sliding doors means that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.959 
these double sliding doors means that
you<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> seating<00:00:56.399> group<00:00:56.730> around

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you can have the seating group around

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.270 
you can have the seating group around
