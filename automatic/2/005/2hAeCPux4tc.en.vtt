00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.049 

yeah

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.530 

all<00:00:15.059> right<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.690> another<00:00:16.170> run<00:00:16.470> from<00:00:16.920> my

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
all right so this is another run from my

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.760 
all right so this is another run from my
improvisational<00:00:18.540> godfather<00:00:19.050> solo<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.710> I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
improvisational godfather solo that I

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.380 
improvisational godfather solo that I
did<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> while<00:00:20.099> back<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.029> very

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
did a while back and it's very

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.140 
did a while back and it's very
reminiscent<00:00:22.220> at<00:00:23.220> least<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> way<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.820> starts

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
reminiscent at least the way that starts

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.450 
reminiscent at least the way that starts
out<00:00:24.270> is<00:00:24.390> very<00:00:24.630> reminiscent<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.350> how<00:00:25.529> slash

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
out is very reminiscent of how slash

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.080 
out is very reminiscent of how slash
uses<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.830> build<00:00:28.830> up<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> sweet<00:00:29.609> child<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.029> mine

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
uses to build up the sweet child of mine

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.210 
uses to build up the sweet child of mine
so<00:00:30.510> before<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> kind<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:31.800> kicks<00:00:32.040> in

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
so before it kind of really kicks in

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.549 
so before it kind of really kicks in
like<00:00:32.400> in<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> center<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.150> so<00:00:33.410> let's<00:00:34.410> go

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
like in the center there so let's go

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.040 
like in the center there so let's go
ahead<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.010> get<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.519> this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.970> the<00:00:36.150> key

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
ahead and get to it this is in the key

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.700 
ahead and get to it this is in the key
of<00:00:37.080> D<00:00:37.199> minor<00:00:37.940> okay

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
of D minor okay

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.469 
of D minor okay
and<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.830> we're<00:00:40.979> down<00:00:41.159> in<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.430> position

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:44.479 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.350 

alright<00:00:45.479> so<00:00:46.229> it<00:00:46.350> starts<00:00:46.769> out<00:00:46.949> very<00:00:47.729> similarly

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
alright so it starts out very similarly

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.820 
alright so it starts out very similarly
to<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.930> sweet<00:00:49.350> child<00:00:49.620> o<00:00:49.739> mine<00:00:49.769> lead<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:54.830> okay

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
to that sweet child o mine lead up okay

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.110 
to that sweet child o mine lead up okay
so

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.510

did<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> tenth<00:01:09.240> fret<00:01:09.450> there<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.290> B<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.860> one

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
did the tenth fret there on the B so one

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.080 
did the tenth fret there on the B so one
more<00:01:11.159> time

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.399 

now<00:01:18.090> here's<00:01:18.360> where<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.690> gets<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:19.049> tricky

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
now here's where it gets all tricky

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
now here's where it gets all tricky
there's<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> bit<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.010> stretch<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
there's a bit of a stretch because you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450 
there's a bit of a stretch because you
got<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.390> pinkie<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.320> on<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.979> tenth<00:01:23.280> fret

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
got your pinkie here on the tenth fret

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
got your pinkie here on the tenth fret
of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.760> B<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> sixth<00:01:25.200> fret<00:01:25.530> with

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
of the B and then on the sixth fret with

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
of the B and then on the sixth fret with
your<00:01:25.890> index<00:01:26.250> finger<00:01:26.760> down<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.229> E<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
your index finger down here on the E and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.230 
your index finger down here on the E and
this<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.300> way<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> play

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
this is the way that that I like to play

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:44.039 
this is the way that that I like to play
it<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.630> start<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.350> context

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.359 

and<00:01:44.140> I<00:01:44.619> kind<00:01:44.829> of<00:01:44.890> let<00:01:45.070> them<00:01:45.219> ring<00:01:47.369> then

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
and I kind of let them ring then

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:55.420 
and I kind of let them ring then
hammer-on<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.030> pull-off

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:13.140 

okay<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.390> one<00:01:56.840> more<00:01:57.020> time

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.800 

up-to-speed<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.510> have

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.270 

once<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.990> get<00:02:21.140> done<00:02:21.320> with<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.650> stretch<00:02:21.980> lick

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
once you get done with this stretch lick

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.030 
once you get done with this stretch lick
this<00:02:22.940> one

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.070 

and<00:02:28.549> we<00:02:28.790> end<00:02:28.970> up<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.299> that<00:02:29.450> D<00:02:29.720> we're

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
and we end up on that D we're

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.030 
and we end up on that D we're
essentially<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.900> go<00:02:32.900> up<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.349> scale<00:02:33.530> on

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
essentially going to go up the scale on

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.309 
essentially going to go up the scale on
the<00:02:34.280> high<00:02:34.489> E<00:02:34.519> string<00:02:34.760> using<00:02:35.480> these<00:02:35.659> notes

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.520 

okay<00:02:41.069> but<00:02:41.549> we're<00:02:41.730> going<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:41.909> use<00:02:41.969> a<00:02:42.540> very

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
okay but we're going to use a very

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.979 
okay but we're going to use a very
similar<00:02:44.250> rhythm<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.359> almost<00:02:45.659> similar

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
similar rhythm and almost similar

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.740 
similar rhythm and almost similar
fingering<00:02:46.950> moving<00:02:47.609> moving<00:02:48.209> up

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
fingering moving moving up

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.740 
fingering moving moving up
so<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.439> first<00:02:49.769> fingering<00:02:50.430> when<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.120> slide<00:02:51.510> in

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
so the first fingering when you slide in

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.789 
so the first fingering when you slide in
after<00:02:55.010> okay<00:02:56.010> you're<00:02:56.250> going<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.400> slide<00:02:56.879> up<00:02:57.799> the

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
after okay you're going to slide up the

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:06.190 
after okay you're going to slide up the
twelfth<00:02:59.159> fret<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.579> high<00:02:59.670> E<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.359> do<00:03:01.019> this

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.539 

okay<00:03:07.230> then<00:03:07.799> we're<00:03:07.950> going<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.129> move<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
okay then we're going to move to the

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.179 
okay then we're going to move to the
next<00:03:08.730> note<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:09.180> scale<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.659> do<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:13.129> okay<00:03:14.129> so

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
next note the scale and do this okay so

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:22.240 
next note the scale and do this okay so
so<00:03:14.909> far<00:03:14.939> we<00:03:15.359> have<00:03:18.200> okay<00:03:19.200> next<00:03:20.189> note<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.579> scale

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
so far we have okay next note the scale

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.690 
so far we have okay next note the scale
will<00:03:23.250> slide<00:03:23.519> into<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.790> actually<00:03:25.310> okay<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.370> so

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
will slide into it actually okay so so

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.570 
will slide into it actually okay so so
far<00:03:26.909> we<00:03:27.060> have

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.790 

my<00:03:32.420> favorite<00:03:32.930> part<00:03:33.140> of<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.320> lick<00:03:33.470> is<00:03:33.500> when<00:03:33.770> I

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
my favorite part of the lick is when I

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.420 
my favorite part of the lick is when I
finally<00:03:35.020> get<00:03:36.020> up<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.380> this<00:03:36.500> point<00:03:36.830> right<00:03:37.250> up

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
finally get up to this point right up

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.320 
finally get up to this point right up
here<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.090> use<00:03:38.780> uh<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:39.770> think<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.370> was<00:03:40.490> lick<00:03:40.760> seven

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
here I use uh I think it was lick seven

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:50.809 
here I use uh I think it was lick seven
