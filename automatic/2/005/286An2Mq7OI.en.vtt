00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
moving along so we're not just so

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.280 
moving along so we're not just so
reliant<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.969> engines<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.600> mean<00:00:36.870> our<00:00:36.989> engines

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
turning a Rotech yeah that's why we

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.139 
turning a Rotech yeah that's why we
introduced<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> throttle<00:00:56.850> body<00:00:56.940> fuel

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
introduced the throttle body fuel

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.849 
introduced the throttle body fuel
injection<00:00:57.600> system<00:00:57.989> initially<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.590> our<00:00:58.680> line

carburetor the throttle body obviously
has<00:01:02.760> some<00:01:02.910> advantages<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.539> mixture<00:01:03.870> control

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
has some advantages with mixture control

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.750 
has some advantages with mixture control
and<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.650> fully<00:01:04.830> aerobatic<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.580> very

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and it's fully aerobatic it's a very

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
popular on our engines and we've since

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
popular on our engines and we've since
expanded<00:01:09.960> our<00:01:10.530> range<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.400> supply

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
expanded our range so that we can supply

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.460 
expanded our range so that we can supply

Australian company and what actually

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.670 
Australian company and what actually
happened<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> throttle<00:01:37.049> throttle<00:01:37.409> body

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
happened was the throttle throttle body

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
well the first thing that we stepped

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.310 
well the first thing that we stepped
into<00:02:06.280> was<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:07.300> big<00:02:07.480> thing<00:02:07.720> that<00:02:07.750> people

into was the big thing that people
complain<00:02:08.619> about<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.950> gyro<00:02:09.250> engine<00:02:09.520> even

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
complain about the gyro engine even

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.130

to me as a ready-made product and we

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.070 
to me as a ready-made product and we
made<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.289> more<00:04:31.440> professional<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.810> cnc<00:04:33.810> and

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
made it more professional and cnc and

basically<00:04:37.710> what<00:04:37.830> we're<00:04:37.979> doing<00:04:38.010> is<00:04:38.310> we're

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
basically what we're doing is we're

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.730 
basically what we're doing is we're
we're<00:04:38.639> supplying<00:04:39.479> a<00:04:39.750> plane<00:04:40.020> adapter<00:04:40.500> plate

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
we're supplying a plane adapter plate

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.550 
we're supplying a plane adapter plate
some<00:04:41.340> pulleys<00:04:41.700> belts<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.300> some<00:04:43.050> instructions

along with the 45m Nippon Denso

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.200 
along with the 45m Nippon Denso
alternator<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.979> it<00:04:47.400> makes<00:04:47.580> for<00:04:47.669> a<00:04:47.789> very<00:04:47.820> nice

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
alternator and it makes for a very nice

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.670 
alternator and it makes for a very nice
conversion<00:04:48.870> of<00:04:48.990> course<00:04:49.229> then<00:04:49.380> you've<00:04:49.500> got<00:04:49.650> a

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
conversion of course then you've got a

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.790 
conversion of course then you've got a
45<00:04:50.160> amp<00:04:50.460> system<00:04:51.419> as<00:04:51.539> opposed<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:52.169> a

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
45 amp system as opposed to a a

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.520 
45 amp system as opposed to a a
lightweight<00:04:53.700> 16<00:04:54.240> ampere<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.600> tame<00:04:54.900> system<00:04:55.350> this

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
lightweight 16 ampere a tame system this

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.500 
lightweight 16 ampere a tame system this
directly<00:04:56.070> replaces<00:04:56.610> their<00:04:56.760> system<00:04:57.150> so<00:04:57.180> the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
directly replaces their system so the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.640 
directly replaces their system so the
weight<00:04:57.660> penalty<00:04:57.810> here<00:04:58.139> would<00:04:58.289> probably<00:04:58.350> be<00:04:58.620> a

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
weight penalty here would probably be a

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.879 
weight penalty here would probably be a
couple<00:04:58.710> of<00:04:58.979> pounds

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.379 

right<00:05:03.889> the<00:05:04.099> other<00:05:04.129> problem<00:05:04.849> with<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.300> other

third problem that is quite common with
the<00:05:08.780> Java<00:05:09.020> engine<00:05:09.469> is<00:05:09.590> because<00:05:10.250> they<00:05:10.400> run<00:05:10.580> non

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:10.879 
the Java engine is because they run non

everything's just rock aligned perfectly
you<00:05:20.150> sometimes<00:05:20.810> can<00:05:21.020> experience<00:05:21.469> difficulty

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
you sometimes can experience difficulty

you sometimes can experience difficulty
getting<00:05:22.069> them<00:05:22.219> to<00:05:22.310> start<00:05:22.580> we've<00:05:23.449> had<00:05:23.599> great

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
getting them to start we've had great

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.570

success<00:05:24.289> with<00:05:24.409> the<00:05:24.650> electronic<00:05:25.099> ignition<00:05:25.340> on

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
success with the electronic ignition on

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.700 
success with the electronic ignition on
Aerotech<00:05:26.120> radials<00:05:26.569> and<00:05:26.719> so<00:05:26.840> we<00:05:26.960> decided<00:05:27.469> we

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
Aerotech radials and so we decided we

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.559 
Aerotech radials and so we decided we
could<00:05:27.889> easily<00:05:28.009> adapt<00:05:28.550> our<00:05:29.120> electronic

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
could easily adapt our electronic

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.899 
could easily adapt our electronic
ignition<00:05:29.780> system<00:05:30.289> to<00:05:30.469> the<00:05:30.620> jabiru<00:05:30.949> and<00:05:31.729> so

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
ignition system to the jabiru and so

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:33.399 
ignition system to the jabiru and so
what<00:05:32.090> we've<00:05:32.240> proposed<00:05:32.659> that<00:05:32.930> have<00:05:33.050> been<00:05:33.259> doing

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
what we've proposed that have been doing

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.709 
what we've proposed that have been doing
for<00:05:33.710> some<00:05:33.889> time<00:05:34.129> now<00:05:34.340> is<00:05:34.849> replacing<00:05:35.479> one<00:05:35.599> of

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
for some time now is replacing one of

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.749 
for some time now is replacing one of
the<00:05:35.779> the<00:05:36.050> coils<00:05:36.379> on<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.529> jabiru<00:05:37.039> with<00:05:37.580> this

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
the the coils on the jabiru with this

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.269 
the the coils on the jabiru with this
sensor<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.270> sensor<00:05:38.629> plate<00:05:38.949> with<00:05:39.949> it<00:05:40.069> which<00:05:40.159> is

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
sensor and sensor plate with it which is

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.309 
sensor and sensor plate with it which is
a<00:05:40.310> whole<00:05:40.490> sensor<00:05:40.939> and<00:05:41.120> then<00:05:41.629> that<00:05:41.810> trips<00:05:42.110> the

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 
a whole sensor and then that trips the

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.369 
a whole sensor and then that trips the
Rotech<00:05:43.039> ignition<00:05:43.969> module<00:05:44.360> and<00:05:44.539> the<00:05:44.990> rotate
