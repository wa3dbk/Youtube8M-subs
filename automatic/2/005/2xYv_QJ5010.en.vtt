00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
in the very first level it's just

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.370 
in the very first level it's just
rewinding<00:02:05.420> time<00:02:05.600> it's<00:02:06.170> pretty

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
rewinding time it's pretty

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.320 
rewinding time it's pretty
straightforward<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.100> it's<00:02:07.789> mostly<00:02:08.119> used

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
straightforward and it's mostly used

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.180

just to kind of correct any sort of bad
platforming<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.120> do<00:02:11.300> but<00:02:11.900> after<00:02:12.230> that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
platforming that you do but after that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.050 
platforming that you do but after that
you'll<00:02:12.650> start<00:02:12.890> finding<00:02:13.160> objects<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.790> aren't

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
you'll start finding objects that aren't

you'll start finding objects that aren't
affected<00:02:14.720> by<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:14.989> reversal<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.860> time<00:02:16.069> so

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
affected by the reversal of time so

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.280 
affected by the reversal of time so
they'll<00:02:16.519> stay<00:02:16.790> as<00:02:17.060> Tim<00:02:17.750> moves<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.200> the

they'll stay as Tim moves to the
environment<00:02:18.800> there's<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.430> ghost<00:02:19.880> version<00:02:20.300> of

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
Tim that will then move forward through

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.740 
Tim that will then move forward through
the<00:02:22.400> game<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.940> path<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.390> were<00:02:23.510> just

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
the game and the path that you were just

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.410 
the game and the path that you were just
on<00:02:24.049> and<00:02:24.350> then<00:02:25.040> after<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.730> gets<00:02:25.880> kind<00:02:26.360> of

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
on and then after that it gets kind of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.320 
on and then after that it gets kind of
weird<00:02:29.709> now<00:02:30.709> on<00:02:30.860> their<00:02:31.010> own<00:02:31.160> these<00:02:31.910> could<00:02:32.150> just

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
weird now on their own these could just

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.640 
weird now on their own these could just
be<00:02:32.450> gimmicks<00:02:32.840> you've<00:02:33.019> seen<00:02:33.170> plenty<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.470> games

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
be gimmicks you've seen plenty of games

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.979 
be gimmicks you've seen plenty of games
before<00:02:33.799> that<00:02:34.040> do<00:02:34.340> time<00:02:34.610> manipulation<00:02:35.120> but

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
before that do time manipulation but

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.620 
before that do time manipulation but
what<00:02:36.170> really<00:02:36.350> sets<00:02:36.650> braid<00:02:36.890> apart<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.630> how

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
what really sets braid apart is how

what really sets braid apart is how

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
clever it is about its implementation of

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.699 
clever it is about its implementation of
these<00:02:40.760> different<00:02:41.120> mechanics<00:02:41.600> each<00:02:42.080> world<00:02:42.470> has

these different mechanics each world has
such<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.040> specific<00:02:43.400> use<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.630> time<00:02:44.900> that<00:02:45.470> you

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
such a specific use of time that you

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.650 
such a specific use of time that you

time<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:48.019> this<00:02:48.110> way<00:02:48.319> but<00:02:49.100> by<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.250> time<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.610> get

time in this way but by the time you get

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
parts of braid but the way this game

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.620
