spindle where the bearing bolts on to
the<00:00:26.609> left<00:00:26.849> side<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.210> drop<00:00:27.930> spindle<00:00:28.470> and

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the left side is the drop spindle and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.470 
the left side is the drop spindle and
you<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.920> see<00:00:29.160> where<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.699> hole<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> center

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
you can see where the hole in the center

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.459 
you can see where the hole in the center
is<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.250> higher<00:00:32.250> obviously<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.110> drops<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
is it's higher obviously so it drops the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.670 
is it's higher obviously so it drops the
vehicle<00:00:34.829> down<00:00:34.920> 2<00:00:35.100> inches<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.260> here
