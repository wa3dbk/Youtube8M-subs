hi<00:00:00.840> guys<00:00:01.140> today<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:02.040> going<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.460> show<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.700> the

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hi guys today I'm going to show you the

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.820 
hi guys today I'm going to show you the
1.5<00:00:04.080> update<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.400> item<00:00:05.970> elevator<00:00:06.509> so<00:00:07.500> let's

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
1.5 update of the item elevator so let's

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.640 
1.5 update of the item elevator so let's
get<00:00:08.099> started

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
get started

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.430 
get started
this<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> version<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.610> made<00:00:11.780> torch<00:00:12.780> then<00:00:13.410> a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
this is a version I made torch then a

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.730 
this is a version I made torch then a
block<00:00:13.860> all<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.670> way<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.690> uses<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> clock

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
block all the way up that uses a clock

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.370 
block all the way up that uses a clock
that<00:00:17.039> controls<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.000> phone<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:18.869> turn<00:00:19.140> it

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
that controls the phone you can turn it

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.170 
that controls the phone you can turn it
on<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.619> off<00:00:20.689> repeater<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.289> Roetzel<00:00:26.180> it

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
on and off repeater on to Roetzel it

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.359 
on and off repeater on to Roetzel it
works<00:00:28.019> perfectly<00:00:29.750> if<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.199> wanted<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.859> make<00:00:32.070> it

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
works perfectly if you wanted to make it

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.020 
works perfectly if you wanted to make it
automatic<00:00:33.110> I've<00:00:34.110> turned<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.890> clock<00:00:35.190> sideways

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
automatic I've turned the clock sideways

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.190 
automatic I've turned the clock sideways
but<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.809> exactly<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.100> same<00:00:38.660> now<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> put<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
but it's exactly the same now I put a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.600 
but it's exactly the same now I put a
comparator<00:00:41.129> redstone<00:00:42.290> torch<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.710> repeater<00:00:44.340> on

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
comparator redstone torch a repeater on

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.049 
comparator redstone torch a repeater on
for<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.320> there's<00:00:46.739> nothing<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> dropper

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
for now if there's nothing in a dropper

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.590 
for now if there's nothing in a dropper
it<00:00:48.570> will<00:00:48.719> turn<00:00:49.050> off<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.530> clock<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:54.180> repeater

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
it will turn off the clock the repeater

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.420 
it will turn off the clock the repeater
makes<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.170> delay<00:00:55.590> when<00:00:56.190> turning<00:00:56.760> off<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.360> clock

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
makes a delay when turning off the clock

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.510 
makes a delay when turning off the clock
so<00:00:59.430> let's<00:00:59.850> look<00:01:00.270> at<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.809> taller<00:01:01.350> version<00:01:01.710> this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
so let's look at a taller version this

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.390 
so let's look at a taller version this
is<00:01:02.730> exactly<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.809> same<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.650> need<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.159> put

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
is exactly the same but you need to put

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.390 
is exactly the same but you need to put
more<00:01:05.729> features<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.170> when<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.680> turns<00:01:07.950> off<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
more features so when it turns off the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:23.610 
more features so when it turns off the
clock<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.540> delay<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.229> longer

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.000 

you<00:01:24.220> can<00:01:24.430> put<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.700> switch<00:01:25.120> here<00:01:25.570> which<00:01:26.010> keeps

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
you can put a switch here which keeps

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.520 
you can put a switch here which keeps
the<00:01:27.400> clock<00:01:27.700> on<00:01:27.970> this<00:01:28.600> way<00:01:28.870> you<00:01:28.930> can<00:01:29.290> use

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
the clock on this way you can use

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.790 
the clock on this way you can use
multiple<00:01:30.240> hoppers<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.840> most<00:01:32.110> important

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
multiple hoppers the most important

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.790 
multiple hoppers the most important
thing<00:01:33.100> about<00:01:33.280> this<00:01:33.700> design<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:34.690> is<00:01:35.470> quite

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
thing about this design and is quite

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.050 
thing about this design and is quite
resource<00:01:36.340> friendly

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
resource friendly

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.770 
resource friendly
the<00:01:37.840> chests<00:01:38.260> can<00:01:38.590> be<00:01:38.770> flush<00:01:39.160> at<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.640> top<00:01:39.910> you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
the chests can be flush at the top you

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.150 
the chests can be flush at the top you
can<00:01:41.020> have<00:01:41.230> multiple<00:01:41.590> inputs<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:44.350> guys<00:01:44.620> I<00:01:44.920> hope

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
can have multiple inputs so guys I hope

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.040 
can have multiple inputs so guys I hope
that<00:01:45.190> helped<00:01:46.140> by<00:01:47.140> from<00:01:47.740> silver<00:01:48.220> creepers<00:01:49.050> and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
that helped by from silver creepers and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.330 
that helped by from silver creepers and
remember<00:01:50.860> please<00:01:51.430> like<00:01:51.820> and<00:01:52.120> subscribe
